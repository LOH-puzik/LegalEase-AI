He was represented before ORG , a non - governmental organisation based in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant joined ORG ( \u201c LOC ) in DATE . He quickly became involved in the treatment of sex offenders and was well regarded by his employers and the courts in respect of this work .", "In DATE , probation officers were sent a form in which they were asked to declare whether or not they were freemasons . The applicant stated that he was not a freemason but listed a number of other organisations of which he was a member , including \u201c The ORG of Roissy \u201d . This organisation subsequently became \u201c ORG \u201d ( hereafter , \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , of which the applicant was a director .", "On DATE ORG received an anonymous fax , in which it was claimed inter alia that PERSON advertised its services on the internet as the builder and supplier of products connected with bondage , domination and sadomasochism ( \u201c BDSM \u201d ) and the organiser of BDSM events and performances . The fax included a photograph of the applicant , wearing a mask , with CARDINAL semi - naked women .", "On DATE the fax was sent by a police officer to CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s colleagues , who brought it to the attention of ORG senior management . ORG undertook an investigation , and found that PERSON was registered at the applicant \u2019s address and that its website included links to a number of BDSM websites , including \u201c ORG \u201d ( \u201c BB \u201d ) , which advertised various events and included photographs of the applicant and others , semi - naked , performing acts which the accompanying text indicated had taken place at a local private CARDINAL club and involved male domination over submissive women .", "The applicant was immediately suspended on full pay , on the ground that ORG had reason to believe that the above activities might be incompatible with his role as a probation officer and bring ORG into disrepute . The applicant admitted that he was involved in the performance aspect of PERSON \u2019s activities but claimed that he had never authorised photographs of himself of the type included in the fax to be published on the internet and that the owners of the ORG website had now removed the photographs at his request . Although the ORG official carrying out the investigation considered that the photographs were in the nature of soft pornography and depicted acts which were degrading to women , the applicant disagreed . The investigating official concluded that the applicant was unwilling to accept that his involvement in activities of this nature was inappropriate . She made a report to the ORG Assistant Chief Probation Officer .", "The Assistant Chief Probation Officer reviewed the report and concluded that while the PERSON website itself did not contain photographs of sexual activity it was linked to other websites which did . She considered that the activities shown on the ORG website were indecent and exploitative . Although she took into account the rights contained in ORG CARDINAL of the LAW , and the applicant \u2019s DATE of service , she formed the view that the applicant had acted in a way which was incompatible with his job working with sex offenders and vulnerable people . She considered that the information shown on the website could be \u201c badly misinterpreted \u201d .", "On DATE ORG commenced disciplinary proceedings against him . Following a hearing before the Panel of ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) on DATE , the applicant was formally dismissed on DATE . The ORG , which accepted that the applicant \u2019s activities were not contrary to criminal law , considered , however , that , given the nature of the acts shown in the internet photographs and referred to in the PERSON advertisements , the fact that this material was in the public domain was incompatible with his position as a probation officer , particularly an officer working with sex offenders . They held that ORG had a responsibility to the public to maintain confidence in the integrity of its officers and that public knowledge of the applicant \u2019s activities would damage the reputation of the Service .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal to a differently constituted Panel was dismissed on DATE . The ORG considered whether the applicant should be given alternative employment within ORG , but took the view that such a proposal would be inappropriate given the conclusion that his activities had been found to be incompatible with the role of any probation officer .", "On DATE the applicant commenced proceedings in ORG ( \u201c ET \u201d ) to challenge his dismissal . In its judgment of DATE , following a hearing which concluded in DATE , the ORG made the following findings of fact :", "\u201c It was clear having listened to extensive evidence from the respondent \u2019s witnesses , and which was probed in great depth on behalf of the applicant , that the investigating officers and the disciplinary and appeal panel had very grave concerns that the activities of the applicant were incompatible with his role as a probation officer . Throughout his interviews the applicant sought to justify his activities and did not accept that these activities could be incompatible with his role as a probation officer . On each interview he sought to justify himself and was not prepared to accept that the view of his employers was a reasonably held view . It was only at a very late stage that he even suggested that he would be willing to take steps to have references to ORG website removed . \u201d", "The ORG continued :", "\u201c Great play was made on behalf of the applicant that the approach of the respondents , both with its investigating officers and the disciplinary panels , were prudish and narrow - minded . ... The [ ET ] heard from various witnesses of their concern as to the consequences if the applicant \u2019s activities came more fully into the knowledge of the general public . There was a concern for the general reputation of ORG but there was equally a concern as to the effect of these activities upon victims of crime and in particular victims of sex crime as well as on offenders who were receiving the help of the Probation Service \u201d .", "The ORG concluded that the dismissal fell within the range of responses of a reasonable employer . It further concluded that LAW was not engaged because the activities in question were in the public domain and did not therefore form part of Mr Pay \u2019s private life . Article CARDINAL was engaged , but not infringed . The ET recognised that an employee owed duties to his employer and that the conduct of the employee should not bring the work of the employer into disrepute . The work of ORG was sensitive and it was important that employees did not bring into the public domain views or activities which could have an adverse impact . It was not therefore incompatible with Article CARDINAL to place some limitation on a probation officer \u2019s freedom of expression and it was reasonable of the ORG to have taken the view that the activities of the applicant , taken in the round , could be damaging to it and needed to be curbed .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( \u201c EAT \u201d ) which dismissed the appeal in a judgment dated DATE . The ORG found that LAW was not applicable and saw no error in the ORG \u2019s judgment to that effect . In considering the proportionality of the dismissal under LAW , the ORG observed that the ORG had found as a fact that throughout the disciplinary proceedings the applicant had not been prepared to accept that his ORG view of his activities had been reasonable and had only offered at a very late stage to take steps to have references to the ORG website removed . The ORG continued :", "\u201c That finding reflects a dispute which arose at the [ ET ] . It was contended before us that the Respondent had not demonstrated that it was a proportionate response for it to dismiss the Applicant when it could have considered his severing his connections to PERSON , and opportunities for alternative work . Taking those in turn , the finding of the [ ET ] is amply borne out by the evidence ...", "It is plain that there had been discussion between the Respondent and the Applicant about his willingness to sever his connection with PERSON entirely ; but that his case was that only certain electronic links between PERSON and the ORG websites had been severed . He was at no time willing to alter his connection with PERSON . That is consistent with the finding that he sought to justify his activities .", "As to the possibility of alternative deployment , the respondent considered that his activities were inconsistent with any Probation Officer \u2019s duties . ... Given the finding that the PERSON was unwilling to give up his connection with PERSON , and the Respondent \u2019s attitude to PERSON \u2019s activities , the possibility of alternative work would not logically arise . \u201d", "The ORG concluded that ORG had committed no error of law when it decided that the dismissal had been proportionate under LAW . On the issue of delay the ORG commented :", "\u201c Something must be said about the delays in this case . The applicant \u2019s cause of action arose when he was dismissed on DATE . He presented an ORG on DATE and so a period of DATE elapsed before the ORG gave its decision . LAW in its original form was lodged on DATE and we are giving judgment over DATE . Without a convincing explanation , these delays would be unacceptable . However , neither party makes any criticism of the other , nor is there any criticism by them of ORG or of the ORG . In those circumstances it is inappropriate for us to add anything . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant filed notice of an application to seek leave to appeal to ORG . This application was filed outside the DATE time - limit and was rejected on DATE . He made a renewed application , claiming that the delay had been caused by the fact that legal aid had not been granted until DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG provisionally granted the applications for leave to appeal and an extension of time , but allowed the respondent ORG days to oppose this order . Lord PERSON observed :", "\u201c It seems to me that there is CARDINAL issue which is capable of engaging the attention of this court . Accepting , as the ORG did , that , in order to be fair , a dismissal has to be Convention compliant ... , it seems to me arguable that , properly appraised , the factors before ORG did not make it proportionate to dismiss Mr Pay , given that the dismissal was held to have been not for incapacity but for some other substantial reason . The substantive reason was , in effect , the damage that would be done to the good name and standing of ORG were it to become public that Mr Pay , working as he did with sex offenders and their victims , was involved in an activity involving bondage and sadomasochism .", "The question is not unproblematical . Under LAW , it is debateable whether this is a matter of private life since the activities were publicised on the internet , but it does seem to me arguable that , to the extent that Mr GPE \u2019s own sexual proclivities were in issue , they related to his private life as much as to matters he had publicised .", "What perhaps is more important is the proportionality of dismissal in a situation in which the dismissal was prompted not by considerations of personal unsuitability for the job , but by legitimate considerations of adverse publicity which would rebound on ORG . \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON had greater misgivings about the appeal \u2019s prospects of success but was prepared to grant leave on the above terms .", "The respondent ORG opposed the applications . On DATE an identically constituted ORG issued a supplementary judgment , without the benefit of oral argument , in which it held that in the light of the full ORG judgment in PERSON Y ( see below ) , it now appeared that the applicant \u2019s appeal had no prospect of success and there could therefore be no useful purpose in granting the extension of time .", "The applicant made a renewed oral application to ORG , which was rejected on DATE . ORG again refused to grant an extension , since the question of principle had been decided in GPE v. Y. In parallel with NORP v. Y , there had been a waiver or forfeiture of privacy , on different grounds but with the same legal effect . Article CARDINAL was not , therefore , engaged . Although Article CARDINAL was applicable , the ORG had been entitled to react as it did to the consequences for it of the applicant \u2019s exercise of his right to free speech .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , an employee has the right not to be unfairly dismissed by his employer . By section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , an employer must show a reason for a dismissal falling within a category set out in section PERSON ) , which includes \u201c conduct \u201d or \u201c some other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify the dismissal of an employee holding the position which the employee held \u201d .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) deals with fairness :", "\u201c Where the employer has fulfilled the requirements of subsection ( CARDINAL ) , the determination of the question whether the dismissal is fair or unfair ( having regard to the reason shown by the employer ) \u2013", "( a ) depends on whether in the circumstances ( including the size and administrative resources of the employer \u2019s undertaking ) the employer acted reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee , and", "( b ) shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case . \u201d", "The applicant in the above case worked as a part time development officer for a charity which aimed to promote , through voluntary work , the personal development of young offenders and those at risk of offending in the CARDINAL age group . When the applicant had been working for the respondent charity for DATE , his employers discovered that DATE previously he had been arrested and cautioned by the police for having committed a consensual sexual act with another man in a public toilet . The caution came to light as a result of normal police checks made by ORG before providing further funding to the respondent . Disciplinary proceedings were taken against the applicant . He was dismissed and subsequently complained to the ET .", "The ORG found that it had been fair and reasonable for the respondent to treat the applicant \u2019s conduct as grounds for dismissal . He had committed a criminal offence and shown an inappropriate lack of self control and serious lack of judgment . Given the sector in which he was employed , his failure to tell his employer about the caution was a serious matter which had undermined the respondent \u2019s trust and confidence in him .", "The applicant appealed to the ORG , contending that his dismissal had breached his rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW . The ORG held that LAW did not apply , as the conduct , a \u201c transitory sexual encounter \u201d between CARDINAL strangers in a public toilet , was not covered by the right to respect for private life . Article CARDINAL did not , therefore , apply , but even if it did , the applicant had not been dismissed on grounds of sexual orientation but instead because he had committed a criminal offence and failed to disclose it .", "The applicant then appealed to ORG . ORG proposed a framework of questions to assist employment tribunals in dealing with Convention issues in unfair dismissal cases between private litigants , but held , on the facts of the case before it , that Article CARDINAL was not engaged , since X was dismissed for conduct which was a criminal offence and which occurred in a place to which the public had access .", "Until its repeal on DATE , the duties and functions of probation officers were regulated by ORG . Section CARDINAL provided that :", "\u201c It is the duty of probation officers \u2013", "( a ) to supervise the probationers and other persons placed under their supervision and to advise , assist and befriend them ;", "( b ) with a view to assisting the court in determining the most suitable method of dealing with a person \u2019s case , to enquire ( in accordance with any direction of the ORG ) into , and make reports on , his circumstances or home surrounding ;", "( c ) to advise , assist and befriend , in such cases and in such manner as may be prescribed , persons who have been released from custody ; and", "( d ) to perform such other duties as may be prescribed . \u201d", "In its judgment in the present case , the ORG observed :", "\u201c The modern probation service is a law enforcement agency at the heart of the criminal justice system . It aims to see that offenders receive proper punishment for their offending by the way they are supervised in the community . It works for the effective rehabilitation so they are less likely to offend in the future . Its objectives include ORG priorities which were to challenge offenders in their behaviour , to enforce community sentences rigorously and to reduce the risk of harm from dangerous offenders . Its responsibilities include the delivery of effective programmes for supervising offenders safely in the community and upholding the interests of the victims of crime . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
