{"ITEMID": "001-22209", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "AUT", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "SCH\u00dcSSEL v. AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON Suppan , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "At the material time the applicant was Deputy Prime Minister of GPE in a coalition Government formed by the NORP ORG ( ORG ) and the applicant \u2019s party , namely ORG ( \u00d6sterreichische Volkspartei ) . In the DATE election campaign the applicant had been nominated by his party as candidate for the office of Prime Minister .", "In DATE the NORP ORG and ORG distributed stickers showing a picture of the applicant \u2019s face CARDINAL overlapped by the face of Mr PERSON , the leader of ORG ( ORG ) , headed by the following text : \u201c The social security slashers and the education snatchers share a common face \u201d ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) .", "On DATE the applicant brought proceedings under section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) granted the applicant \u2019s request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants from publishing and disseminating the applicant \u2019s picture , in the event that his legitimate interests were thereby injured , firstly , in that the accompanying text alleged that he was a \u201c social security slasher \u201d and an \u201c education snatcher \u201d or , secondly , in that his face was distorted by being overlapped with the face of a politician of an opposing party , that of PERSON .", "In its reasoning , ORG noted that section CARDINAL of LAW protected anyone against abuse of his or her picture in public . A person in the public eye , in particular one who had entered the public arena of his or her own motion , was not protected in this public capacity . The applicant had put himself at the centre of his party \u2019s election campaign . As his party \u2019s top candidate , he could be regarded as endorsing its positive statements and had to accept being the target of its GPE criticism . Thus , the use of his picture by political opponents was not in itself contrary to section CARDINAL of LAW . However , while the applicant had to accept admissible criticism directed against the party represented by him , an infringement of his legitimate interests was conceivable regarding attacks on his privacy or personal disparagement which went beyond the limits of acceptable criticism . This consideration applied in particular where his picture was used in a distorted manner . In the present case , the applicant did not have to accept the distorted use of his picture \u201c melted \u201d with the picture of a political opponent .", "Further , ORG examined whether the publication of the applicant \u2019s picture in the context of the impugned statement \u201c The social security slashers and the education snatchers share a common face \u201d was unlawful . It found that the combination of the applicant \u2019s picture with disparaging expressions suggesting that he was insensitive to social needs and was stealing educational opportunities violated his legitimate interests .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the objection ( Widerspruch ) of the defendants .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , upon the GPE appeal , confirmed the preliminary injunction order as to the prohibition to publish a distorted picture of the applicant , but lifted it as regards the prohibition to publish it accompanied by the incriminated text .", "ORG confirmed that the applicant did not have to accept the publication of his distorted picture overlapped with the picture of a political opponent . However , as to the accompanying text , it found that the expressions \u201c social security slashers \u201d and \u201c education snatchers \u201d , though being blunt , were no more than the usual graphic wording applied in an election campaign . The average citizen would conclude that the applicant advocated reducing social assistance and making budgetary cuts in the education system . The statement could not be understood as to contain an allegation of theft within the meaning of LAW , nor did it suggest that the applicant was generally insensitive to social needs .", "On DATE ORG , upon the GPE appeal on points of law , quashed ORG decision and dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a preliminary injunction .", "ORG observed that , when examining whether the publication of a picture violated legitimate interests within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW , it had to be taken into account whether the person concerned was well - known . However , even where a well - known politician was concerned , there were limits to the admissible publication of his picture . Such limits applied where the publication intruded on a politician \u2019s privacy , where his picture was distorted or where it was accompanied by a text which connected him with events with which he had nothing to do or attributed political convictions to him which he did not hold .", "ORG confirmed the appellate court \u2019s view that section CARDINAL of LAW did not prohibit the publication of the applicant \u2019s picture in the context of the allegation that he was a social security slasher and an education snatcher . The impugned statement was - contrary to the applicant \u2019s view - not a statement of fact but a value judgment . The dividing line between statements of fact and value judgments depended on the context in which the statement was made and the impression it conveyed . In general , the public would understand attributions of negative intentions to CARDINAL politician by his political opponents as value judgments . Whether measures proposed in the interest of consolidating the budget were perceived as slashing social security or , on the contrary , as preserving a sound economic basis for the social security system , was indeed a value judgment .", "ORG went on to say that political debate and the shaping of public opinion was sometimes impossible without having recourse to graphic wording . It recalled that political debate was protected by the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by LAW . Referring to the case - law of ORG , ORG recalled that the limits of acceptable criticism were wider for a politician than for a private individual . A politician inevitably and knowingly laid himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by journalists , the public at large and his political opponents . Thus , as his party \u2019s top candidate , the applicant had to accept that his political opponents used disparaging words to describe his political aims .", "As to the question of whether the publication of the applicant \u2019s picture overlapping with Mr PERSON \u2019s was contrary to section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG contested the appellate court \u2019s view . It was clear to every onlooker that the faces of CARDINAL leading politicians had been combined by way of photomontage . The picture showed the applicant as he had presented himself in the election campaign without making his features ugly or repulsive . The sticker simply conveyed the political message that the applicant advocated the same policy as Mr PERSON on social security and education issues . This was the \u201c common face \u201d of the defendant \u2019s CARDINAL most important opponents . On the whole , this was an admissible political statement rather then a personal disparagement of the applicant .", "In the subsequent main proceedings , ORG held a hearing on DATE . The applicant \u2019s counsel submitted that the sticker at issue suggested to the general public not only that the applicant \u2019s future political intention was to reduce social security or educational opportunities but that he had already taken such measures . He requested that a member of the applicant \u2019s party be heard as a witness . The court dismissed the request , finding that the matter was ready for decision .", "ORG , referring to ORG reasoning , dismissed the applicant \u2019s request that the defendants be prohibited from publishing his picture in the event that his legitimate interests were thereby injured , firstly , in that the accompanying text alleged that he was a \u201c social security slasher \u201d and an \u201c education snatcher \u201d or , secondly , in that his face was distorted by being overlapped by the face of a politician of an opponent party , in particular PERSON .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the witness requested by him had not been heard , the court found that the question of what impression was conveyed by the sticker at issue was a matter of legal assessment to be carried out by the court .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It found that the applicant \u2019s submissions in the main proceedings did not raise any relevant new facts as compared to the preliminary injunction proceedings .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW , insofar as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Images of persons shall neither be exhibited publicly , nor disseminated in any other way in which they are made accessible to the public , where the legitimate interests of the person in question , or in the event they have died without having authorised or ordered publication , of a close relative would be injured . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
