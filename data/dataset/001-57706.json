Mr PERSON lives at LOC , in the commune of GPE ) .", "Since DATE he has been involved in cattle farming on a farm of QUANTITY which his father had operated before him . The farmland comprises a parcel registered as \" Commune Woensdrecht , section G , no . DATE \" ( circa QUANTITY ) , of which Mr NORP is a co - owner together with the PERSON , a foundation set up for the purpose of nature preservation . He has a one sixth interest in the land . The above parcel was situated outside the dyke along the eastern end of the PERSON , an arm of LOC .", "CARDINAL . The eastern part of the PERSON has been shut off from the sea by a series of dykes whose purpose was to strengthen the defences against the sea rather than to reclaim land .", "Before the completion of these dykes the area comprising the parcel G , no . DATE consisted partly of a complex of open water , strips of mudland and siltland submerged either by each high tide or by spring tides ( slikken en schorren ) , intersected by inlets , and partly of low dunes backed by cliffs ) . The open - water area was a mixture of salt and fresh water . Due to these conditions , only limited use could be made of the parcel .", "The dyke enclosing the land comprising the parcel - called \" PERSON \" after the local delta region known as the \" Markiezaatsmeer \" - was completed in DATE . Thereafter , with the disappearance of the tides and the predominance of fresh water , the land gradually became drier with changes in the flora and fauna of the area and an explosive growth of thistles .", "At the present time the PERSON , an area composed of QUANTITY land and QUANTITY water , is partly a \" protected natural site \" in the sense of section CARDINAL of LAW ( \" LAW \" - ( PERSON ) and partly a \" national nature preserve \" in the sense of LAW of that LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The PERSON acts as a supervisor for the area .", "CARDINAL . Before the PERSON was completed the Minister of Culture , Recreation and Public Works designated the area which includes the parcel as a \" protected natural site \" by an order of CARDINAL DATE made pursuant to section DATE CARDINAL Act .", "An explanatory note was appended to the order . Points CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the note contained a comprehensive description of the particular scientific and environmental importance of the area as it then was . Point CARDINAL described the developments to be expected from the completion of the dykes , including the gradual cessation of tidal effects , the transformation into a freshwater zone , the drying out of the land and important changes in the existing biotope .", "Point CARDINAL of the note specified that \" current long - established use of land could continue as usual \" but that \" certain actions should , however , be subject to authorisation \" ; among these were \" the use of methods intended or likely to alter or intensify the existing use of land \" , \" removing , destroying or degrading the soil ( ... ) , filling in , levelling , clearing or ploughing the land \" and \" the use of herbicides or substances to promote or inhibit growth \" .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the designation order to the ORG under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "He pointed out that he used parts of the designated area including parcel G , no . DATE for pasturing cattle and alleged that the order would turn those parts into wasteland . He submitted that this would not be in the interests of nature conservation and would , moreover , entail considerable economic losses . Further , the area \u2019s protection as a natural site was already sufficiently secured by the GPE regional development plan and the Woensdrecht municipal land - use plan , both of which respected the rights of farmers . He concluded that the reasons given for the order were both insufficient and superfluous and that it should be annulled .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was heard before ORG ( PERSON ) of ORG ( PERSON ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) on DATE .", "In accordance with the advisory opinion of that ORG the applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed by LAW of DATE , no . CARDINAL ( ORG ( PERSON ) DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "The Crown first held that the area met the requirements of section CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW . It then examined and rejected the objection that the requirement of section CARDINAL of that Act was not fulfilled in that the protection of the area was already secured in another way . As to the applicant \u2019s fear that his user of parcel G , no . DATE for pasturing cattle would be unduly restricted , the Crown held that at the hearing it had been established that the manner in which he had exploited the parcel did not impair the essential characteristics of the area so that the existing use could be continued without an authorisation being required . The applicant \u2019s fear that the site would turn into wasteland was considered unfounded because it was possible to use the land so as to prevent that . Finally the ORG held that the interests of protecting the area as a \" protected natural site \" under LAW outweighed the interests of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant had QUANTITY of parcel G , no . DATE levelled and some inlets filled in . When this was discovered , the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries on DATE issued an order under LAW of LAW to cease work . The applicant appealed against this order to ORG ( Afdeling Rechtspraak ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and requested an interim injunction from the President of that ORG . Following the dismissal of that request on CARDINAL DATE , the Minister , by order of CARDINAL DATE , specified the steps to be taken by the applicant to restore the land to its original state . The Minister stated that , if these measures were not carried out by the applicant before DATE , they would be done at his expense . The applicant appealed against this order to ORG alleging that he had taken the impugned measures in order to destroy the thistles proliferating on parcel G , no . DATE , as he had been ordered to do by the municipal authorities of the commune of ORG joined the appeals and dismissed them on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG refused to grant the applicant authorisation to use mechanical means for destroying thistles on part of the land .", "The applicant appealed to the ORG against this decision . In accordance with section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW on ORG ( PERSON wet PERSON ) , the appeal was referred for decision to ORG of ORG . The appeal was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant claimed compensation under section CARDINAL of LAW . He claimed that he had suffered damage because of the manner in which the natural site was managed . As a result thistles had become so abundant that all other growth had ceased and the use of parcel G , no . DATE for pasture had become impossible . He based his claim for Hfl . CARDINAL on the allegation that as from DATE he had had the intention to use that parcel for intensive pasture , increasing the number of cattle to CARDINAL .", "The Minister dismissed the claim on CARDINAL DATE , pointing out , inter alia , that the applicant could not reasonably have expected that after the closure of the PERSON he would have been able to use the parcel more intensively than before since he must have known long before that the area would be designated as a protected natural site .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision to the ORG . At the date of the hearing before the ORG the appeal was still pending before ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( b ) of LAW defines a natural site as composed of grounds and waters which are of general interest as regards their scenic beauty or scientific value .", "Under section CARDINAL of the LAW the Minister of Culture , Recreation and Public Works may , in agreement with the Minister for Planning and Development ( ruimtelijke ordening ) , designate as a protected natural site ( beschermd natuurmonument ) a natural site which is not protected in any other way . Designation takes place by means of a reasoned decision which must specify the land registry parcels affected by the designation .", "CARDINAL . LAW ) of the LAW states that it is forbidden to carry out actions detrimental to the scenic beauty or scientific interest of a protected natural site or which might disfigure the site , without authorisation by the Minister or in breach of the terms of such an authorisation . LAW ) specifies that the actions envisaged by LAW ( CARDINAL ) are those which affect the essential characteristics of the protected natural site as set out in the designation order .", "CARDINAL . LAW allows for the possibility of obtaining compensation for damage suffered as a result of a designation order , refusal of authorisation or the terms attached to an authorisation .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act limits appeal to the ORG by interested parties to : a designation order under LAW , a repeal of such an order under LAW , decisions as to authorisations made under LAW and decisions as to compensation for damage under section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL the Minister of Culture , Recreation and Public Works may designate as a \" national nature preserve \" ( staatsnatuurmonument ) a natural site which belongs to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the LAW provide for various penalties or coercive measures in respect of actions contrary to the provisions of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . Under GPE law the civil courts have traditionally had competence to grant relief against the administration if and in so far as no other relief is available .", "This competence is based on the LAW and on LAW ( FAC RO ) ) .", "Under subsection CARDINAL of CARDINAL of the LAW it is for the judiciary to adjudicate on \" disputes on civil rights and claims \" . The \" judiciary \" responsible for the administration of justice in civil cases is composed of ORG , the courts of appeal , the district and cantonal courts .", "ORG provides ( as far as relevant ) :", "\" The judiciary is exclusively charged to take cognizance of and to decide upon all disputes on property or rights derived from property , on claims or civil rights ... \"", "CARDINAL . The leading precedents as to the interpretation of LAW are ORG judgments of DATE and of CARDINAL DATE .", "In its judgment of DATE ( PERSON ( GPE ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ) ORG held that :", "\" under section CARDINAL RO , the exclusive competence of the judiciary depends on the object of the dispute , that is the right for which the plaintiff claims protection , and not on the nature of the right on which the defendant \u2019s argument is based \" .", "The case which was decided by ORG in its judgment of DATE ( GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL ) concerned an action brought by a commune against a province based on the latter \u2019s refusal to deliver electricity to the commune . The commune alleged in the first place that it was entitled to delivery under a quasi - contractual obligation incumbent on the province and in the second place that the refusal constituted a tort since it was contrary to a public law obligation . The commune sought both a declaratory judgment that the refusal was unlawful and a judicial order to deliver .", "As to the first ground ORG , reiterating its decision of DATE , held inter alia that :", "\" for the question whether there is a claim within the meaning of that section [ section CARDINAL RO ] it is immaterial whether the obligation is governed by public or by civil law ... \"", "On the second ground ORG noted that these claims were based on section CARDINAL of LAW and held :", "\" that the protection afforded by this section is not confined only to the claim for damages to which it explicitly refers , but also applies to preventive measures where there exists a serious threat that injustice is on the point of being done . \"", "It concluded that as far as the latter ground was concerned the \" object of the dispute \" was an obligation under section CARDINAL of LAW and that , accordingly , the case concerned a civil right within the meaning of section CARDINAL RO , it being irrelevant for the competence of the civil courts whether or not the obligation to deliver the electricity was of a public law nature .", "CARDINAL . The above case - law is understood to imply that where a citizen bases his claims against the administration on the allegation that the latter has committed a tort against him , the civil courts are , in principle , competent to take cognizance of the case .", "CARDINAL . Finally it should be noted that where the civil courts are competent the President of ORG has competence in interlocutory proceedings ( kort geding - see , for the role of these proceedings in the GPE , the PERSON judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of the LAW , as construed in the constant case - law of ORG , the judiciary is not permitted to examine the lawfulness of Acts of ORG . The courts can , however , review the lawfulness of subordinate legislation and of all other acts of the administration including the lawfulness of decisions which have a general character ( such as regulations , plans or , directives ) .", "A decision of the administration is unlawful ( onrechtmatig ) and constitutes a tort within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW when it violates a right of the plaintiff or is contrary to a rule of international or domestic law which seeks to protect the plaintiff \u2019s interests , or to general principles of proper administration which , inter alia , forbid abuse of power and encompass the principles of proportionality and reasoned decisions as well as requiring that all relevant considerations be taken into account in reaching a decision .", "CARDINAL . Although section CARDINAL of the Civil Code states that a victim of a tort is entitled to damages , his rights under this section are wider . He may ask for a declaratory judgment and for an injunction by which the defendant is either forbidden or ordered to do something ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) . That means that a citizen who claims that a decision of the administration constitutes a tort may demand , if need be in interlocutory proceedings , that the court or its President restrains the administration , for example , from executing or having executed its impugned decision ( see ORG judgment of DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) . In this sense the courts , although they lack competence to annul the decisions of administrative authorities , may , as ORG explained in its judgment of DATE , make such a decision \" inoperative \" .", "Although claims for damages against the administration are subject to a limitation period of DATE under a special LAW DATE , the period of limitation for other forms of relief against the administration based on section CARDINAL of LAW is the normal DATE period provided for in section DATE of that code .", "CARDINAL . Under GPE law there are CARDINAL other forms of relief against the administration .", "CARDINAL . In the first place , it may be possible to appeal to an administrative tribunal with competence to make a decision in the matter . This is , as a general rule , possible in areas such as fiscal law , social security law , and the law concerning civil servants : in these fields cases are dealt with by either special administrative tribunals or special sections of the civil courts .", "Since DATE , when the LAW concerning administrative jurisdiction as to decisions of the administration ( FAC administratieve rechtspraak overheidsbeschikkingen ( LAW ) ) entered into force , there is , moreover , a more general administrative tribunal , ORG ( Afdeling Rechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , which is competent only as regards administrative decisions . It is since LAW that it has become possible to appeal to ORG from those orders made under LAW against which under LAW there is no appeal to the Crown ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . In the second place , under GPE law as it stood before the enactment of LAW on ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) there was a special form of relief against the administration , referred to as an \" administrative appeal \" . Under this procedure the aggrieved citizen was given the right to appeal from the decision of an administrative authority to a higher administrative authority which , if the appeal was allowed , had competence to take the proper decision itself . The appeal to the Crown under LAW from the designation order of the Minister ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) is an example of this type of relief . A further example was the administrative appeal which was at stake in ORG judgments of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , no CARDINAL ) : the appeal from a decision by the municipal executive to the municipal council ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine below ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( NJ DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , ORG examined whether the lower court was correct in holding that it should not examine the lawfulness of a municipal development plan . ORG recalled that an appeal lies to the ORG after such a plan has been approved first by the municipal council and then by the provincial council . It added that in such an appeal ORG gives an advisory opinion and thus \" an examination of the case in adversary proceedings is secured \" .", "The ORG concluded :", "\" that the law , by making available the above - described administrative procedure , offers such guarantees to all those interested in the substance of the municipal development plan , that it is to be assumed that a plan which has been formally drawn up in accordance with the law is final for everybody ... , so that an action before the civil courts , based on the allegation that the plan is null and void because the substance is contrary to the law , is excluded . \"", "In its above - mentioned judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) ORG took the opposite view with regard to the administrative appeal then under examination :", "\" ... because the appeal to the municipal council which is possible under the law does not offer sufficient guarantees for it to be regarded as a special procedure which excludes the possibility of seeking relief before the civil courts ... \"", "ORG reiterated this opinion in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) . There the court held that :", "\" if the applicant for a building licence is of the opinion that the authorities by refusing his application have violated section CARDINAL of LAW , he may under section CARDINAL of LAW claim damages for the harm he has suffered . The court in assessing that claim must examine the lawfulness of the decision refusing the application because the procedure to seek relief from such a decision does not offer sufficient guarantees for it to be considered a special procedure which excludes examination on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW . \"", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned judgments form part of an extensive case - law to the effect that where an administrative appeal offers sufficient guarantees as to a fair procedure , the civil courts , although remaining in principle competent , should refrain from examining the lawfulness of the administrative decision against which the appeal lies . Examination of the latter question is not , however , excluded if the administrative appeal does not offer such guarantees .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in a much noted article by PERSON ( Non sine causa , Opstellen aangeboden aan Prof . PERSON , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) it was submitted that the ORG did not meet the requirements of LAW para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . The author warned that there might be many cases of appeal to the ORG where that provision applied and argued that the appeal to the ORG procedure should be revised . The ORG \u2019s judgment in the PERSON case ( the judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) confirmed the correctness of these views .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the ORG judgment several authorities - among whom a member of ORG - had already stated that , if the above proposition was right , the consequence would be that ( CARDINAL ) the appeal to the ORG could no longer be said to be an administrative appeal which \" offers sufficient guarantees \" as to a fair procedure and ( CARDINAL ) that , accordingly , under the doctrine described in paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above , the civil courts would be free to examine the lawfulness of any decision of the administration coming within the province of DATE ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW against which appeal to the ORG lies ( see , inter alia : ORG , ORG , DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ; PERSON , GPE , DATE , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , PERSON voor de Nederlandse Juristenvereniging , ORG DATE , ORG . , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON Does & ORG , PERSON ( DATE ) , p. CARDINAL ) .", "After the ORG judgment this view was generally accepted among the many learned writers who examined the consequences of that judgment for the GPE system of remedies against the administration ( see , inter alia , PERSON , PERSON DATE , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , ibid . , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , Nederlands Juristenblad DATE , p. CARDINAL ; \" Kroonberoep en Art . CARDINAL ECRM \" ( DATE ) , pp . CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL ; PERSON , in his note on the ORG judgment , ORG Beslissingen DATE , no . CARDINAL ; PERSON and PERSON , ORG in de sociale rechtsstaat , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) . The only question which divided the legal profession was whether or not it would be necessary to appeal to the ORG before taking the case to a civil court .", "The above view concerning the competence of the civil courts was also accepted by ORG in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE in interlocutory proceedings ( PERSON DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG decided this issue for the first time in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) . The case concerned a decision taken by the municipal authorities under LAW DATE ( PERSON ) to close down the plaintiff \u2019s business . Under that Act the plaintiff could have appealed to the Crown ( \" administrative appeal \" ) and in that context he could have requested interim mesures from the President of ORG of ORG . Instead , however , he instituted interlocutory proceedings ( kort geding ) before the President of a civil court . Both the President and ORG held that the plaintiff should have availed himself of the appeal procedure to the ORG and refused to entertain the action . In conformity with the advisory opinion of the acting PERSON ORG dismissed the appeal .", "The ORG first recalled that :", "\" the fact that , under section CARDINAL RO civil courts are competent to take cognizance of an action based on section CARDINAL of LAW , does not prevent a refusal to entertain the action based on , to put it briefly , the existence of another remedy which offers sufficient guarantees . \"", "The ORG then held that there actually was such a procedure because the plaintiff could have addressed himself to the President of ORG of ORG ; accordingly , the President of the civil court was not the appropriate judge in the matter .", "As appears from the opinion of PERSON , a ORG judge acting as PERSON , this was in conformity with the doctrine referred to in DATE above . He had , however , also discussed the question whether that doctrine could still be upheld after the ORG judgment which he considered ought to be taken into account . He concluded that \" also after the ORG judgment in principle the citizen will have to appeal to the ORG first ; thereafter he can address himself to the civil courts \" ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) .", "ORG considered that the ORG judgment was immaterial because the case concerned interlocutory proceedings which did not involve a \" determination \" of the plaintiff \u2019s civil rights . It added :", "\" It is true , however , that it would be difficult to accept the aforementioned exclusion of the President as kort geding judge if it were open to an interested party in cases concerning a determination of civil rights within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW to take the case as to the merits directly to the civil courts . The system in force at the moment should , in order to avoid procedural complications , however , be understood as enabling the interested party to bring his case to the civil courts only after a decision on his appeal to the ORG . \"", "In his annotation to the judgment Professor PERSON pointed out that the conclusions drawn by ORG were to be expected in the light of its case - law :", "\" the appeal to the ORG is no longer to be considered as offering sufficient guarantees ; consequently , until LAW on ORG has made ORG a tribunal in most cases , there is a role for the civil courts . \"", "CARDINAL . The above interpretation was endorsed by a judgment of ORG of DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) . In that case the plaintiff ( PERSON ) had asked for a new licence under LAW DATE in view of plans to extend and modify a filling station . In anticipation of the granting of this licence the company had in DATE - with the full knowledge and approval of the head of the municipal \" Nuisance - Act- department \" - reconstructed its installations in the station . However , in DATE the muncipal authorities refused to grant the licence requested and at the same time closed down all of the company \u2019s installations . Upon appeal the ORG annulled the decisions of the municipal authorities and issued the requested licence . PERSON thereupon instituted a claim for damages in a civil court . ORG held that the commune had committed a tort and ordered it to pay damages . ORG dismissed the commune \u2019s appeal .", "In its appeal the commune complained that ORG had considered itself bound by the decision of the ORG . ORG recalled the doctrine referred to above ( in DATE ) . It held that the appeal to the ORG was , as far as the domestic law of the GPE was concerned , to be considered as an administrative procedure which offered sufficient guarantees . Consequently , in principle , the civil courts were bound by the ORG \u2019s decision . However , ORG added :", "\" In view of the judgment of ORG DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ( the PERSON case ) an exception to that principle must , however , be made if \u2018 the licencee or the person who exploits the ORG pleads that the ORG can not be deemed to be a \u2018 tribunal\u2019 which meets the requirements of LAW para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of LAW : in that case the aforementioned principle is not to be applied and it is the duty of the civil courts also to deal fully and independently with the issue already decided by the ORG . It has , however , not been established that PERSON has made such a plea based on the above - mentioned treaty provision and the commune can not make such a plea . \"", "This ruling was further confirmed by ORG judgment of DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW the King or Queen is inviolable . The Sovereign takes decisions on the responsibility of a Minister , who must countersign them .", "In ordinary language , the expression \" the ORG \" means the Sovereign and Minister or Ministers exercising their decision - making powers .", "CARDINAL .
