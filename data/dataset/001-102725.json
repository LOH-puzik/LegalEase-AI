On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision on the ground of procedural deficiencies and remitted the case to them for reconsideration .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG against the administrative authorities ' failure to decide ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE ORG ordered ORG to issue a decision within DATE . Subsequently , ORG appointed an expert on agriculture and forestry issues , who , after inspecting the applicant 's land on DATE , delivered his opinion on DATE .", "On DATE ORG requested ORG to order another expert , PERSON , to submit an additional expert opinion on nature conservation issues , which ORG delivered on DATE .", "Subsequently , on DATE , ORG invited the applicant to submit comments on the experts ' opinions on nature conservation and agricultural and forestry issues . On DATE the applicant submitted comments on these opinions and requested a public hearing .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE concerning the request for permission under LAW . It found that competence to decide on the merits had passed over to it since ORG had failed to make a decision within the DATE time - limit set .", "ORG held that it could dispense with an oral hearing and an inspection of the applicant 's land since the proceedings had been carried out correctly and the facts , in so far as relevant in view of the applicable law , were undisputed . This decision was served on the applicant 's counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint before the ORG , arguing , inter alia , that the proceedings had been unreasonably long and that they had been unfair as no oral hearing had taken place before ORG . The application was registered under number CARDINAL . The ORG issued a partial decision on admissibility on DATE , in which it declared the complaint about the duration of the proceedings inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded . In a final decision on admissibility issued on DATE the ORG declared the complaint about the lack of an oral hearing before ORG admissible .", "By a judgment of DATE the ORG found a violation of LAW , since ORG had not held an oral hearing . In particular , the ORG held in the judgment :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the applicant 's case was considered , in a first round , by ORG , and ORG , i.e. purely administrative authorities , and then by ORG , which quashed the latter authority 's decision . In a second round , ORG failed to decide within the statutory time - limit and jurisdiction passed on to ORG . The applicant did not contest that ORG qualifies as a tribunal , and there is no indication in the file that the Administrative Court'Fischer v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL with further references ) . Thus , ORG was the first and only tribunal which examined the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . As the NORP reservation in respect of LAW concerning the requirement that hearings be public , has been found to be invalid ( see , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-X ) , the applicant was in principle entitled to a public oral hearing before the first and only tribunal examining his case , unless there were exceptional circumstances which justified dispensing with such a hearing . The ORG has accepted such exceptional circumstances in cases where proceedings concerned exclusively legal or highly technical questions ( see ORG v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ; PERSON v. GPE DATE . ) no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . In particular , the ORG had regard to the rather technical nature of disputes over benefits under social - security schemes and has repeatedly held that in this sphere the national authorities , having regard to the demands of efficiency and economy , could abstain from holding a hearing if the case could be adequately resolved on the basis of the case - file and the parties ' written observations ( see , amongst others , PERSON v. GPE , cited above ) .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the circumstances of the present case , the ORG notes that the applicant commented on the expert opinions submitted in the previous proceedings and requested , in particular , that the experts be summoned to an oral hearing and that the concerned land be inspected by the court . He stressed that the project would improve the productivity of the agricultural land and that therefore public interest existed in the realisation of his project as required under the applicable law . He also challenged the expert A. for bias as he had already delivered an opinion upon a request by ORG and that his independence was doubtful as he was a civil servant bound by instructions .", "CARDINAL . The ORG can not find that in the present case the subject matter of the proceedings before ORG was of such a nature , namely a highly technical issue or of mere legal nature , as to dispense its obligation to hold a hearing .", "CARDINAL . There has accordingly been a violation of LAW . \u201d", "In view of this finding of a violation the ORG did not consider it necessary to examine the complaints about the alleged unfairness of the proceedings . ORG did not award the applicant compensation for pecuniary damage , holding that it could not speculate as to the outcome of the proceedings . ORG also dismissed the claims for non - pecuniary damage , holding that the finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction . The judgment became final on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG to reopen proceedings . He relied on the ORG 's judgment of DATE and , since the ORG had not awarded him damages , argued that the ORG had assumed that restitution was possible at the national level . The applicant further contended that the opinion of the expert on nature conservation on which the decision had been based was in contradiction to other findings in the file . As this would constitute a violation of the principle of equality of arms , the applicant asked for another expert to be summoned to a hearing .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to reopen proceedings . Relying on LAW ( PERSON ) , it held that reopening was only provided for by law if the provisions on the right to be heard had not been complied with in the previous proceedings , and if it could be assumed that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different if the right to be heard had been observed . ORG considered that the applicant had failed to argue which submissions he could have made at a hearing which would have led to a different outcome of the proceedings . It therefore refused to grant a reopening of the proceedings . It also held that the law did not provide that a judgment of the ORG finding a violation of LAW should automatically lead to the reopening of proceedings .", "The decision was served on the applicant 's counsel on DATE .", "ORG , which supervises the execution of judgments of the ORG in accordance with LAW , has not yet adopted a Final Resolution .", "Section CARDINAL of the Administrative Court Act reads as follows :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL .
