It noted that , unlike LAW , LAW did not explicitly lay down as a basic right the right of those charged with criminal offences to have the charges against them examined and to have the criminal proceedings against them finalised within a reasonable time . However , it analysed in detail the terms of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and held that that provision was to be construed as containing a procedural obligation to comply with the statutory timelimits for conducting and finalising the pre - trial phase of criminal proceedings , with a view to bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial . It thus served the same purpose as LAW , albeit only in relation to the first phase of criminal proceedings . The court continued :", "\u201c As noted above , the [ abolished remedy ] was intended to serve as an effective remedy within the meaning of LAW in order to ensure the right to have a criminal case examined within a \u2018 reasonable time\u2019 during the pretrial phase of the proceedings . ORG finds that the repeal of that remedy is not unconstitutional , because it does not remove the disciplining procedural timelimits envisaged under LAW . Statutory limitations on the duration of the CARDINAL parts of the pretrial phase of criminal proceedings \u2013 \u2018 investigation\u2019 and \u2018 steps to be taken by the prosecutor after the investigation has been completed\u2019 \u2013 still exist and continue to be applied . ...", "The repealed ... Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code contained the implicit assessment of the legislature that , in view of the need to complete criminal proceedings within a reasonable time , it was unacceptable for a person to remain charged in pretrial proceedings for DATE in cases of serious offences and for DATE in cases of lesser offences . In most cases those timelimits would be longer than the sum of the timelimits under LAW CARDINAL and LAW . An exception could occur only if the duration of the investigation was extended , exceptionally , to DATE by the head of a regional or higher prosecutor \u2019s office or a person designated by him or her ( LAW ) . Only then would the repeal lead to a restriction of a procedural right and raise the question whether , in the light of LAW , that restriction did not exceed what was required for the administration of justice .", "ORG does not accept the argument that the legislative change destroys the right of the accused to have their cases examined within a \u2018 reasonable time\u2019 , as required under LAW . The [ DATE ] Code of Criminal Procedure laid down the basic principle that cases are to be examined and decided within a reasonable time , requiring the authorities in charge of pretrial investigations to comply with procedural timelimits ( LAW ) . The constitutional amendments in DATE and the new [ LAW ] , adopted in DATE , put in place additional safeguards for the faster examination of cases and for avoiding their undue protraction . The repeal of [ Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code ] does not affect that system of rules . Its aim was to improve the law in order to ensure good justice , which is [ a legitimate aim ] .", "The main weakness of the repealed procedure was that it used a formal , purely quantitative criterion to measure \u2018 reasonable time\u2019 during the pretrial phase of the proceedings . It is true that in most cases such an approach would lead to a correct assessment \u2013 something fully logical in view of the fact that under the rules of procedure a person can be charged only if there already exists \u2018 enough evidence\u2019 that he or she is guilty . However , in some complex cases that criterion might , contrary to the public interest that all offenders be brought to justice , give the accused an undue advantage \u2013 for instance in cases in which it proves to be genuinely difficult to trace and charge accomplices , cases in which the need arises to gather additional evidence , including through letters rogatory , cases in which the accused has slowed down the proceedings , etc . It is no wonder that the caselaw of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW is quite flexible . That ORG uses CARDINAL criteria to assess the relevant period : the factual and legal complexity of the case , the conduct of any authorities involved and the conduct of the person concerned [ ( see Eckle v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; and ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) ] . It is equally possible to exceed a reasonable time while formally complying with the applicable timelimits and to comply with the \u2018 reasonable time\u2019 requirement while exceeding the applicable timelimits . ORG finds breaches of the \u2018 reasonable time\u2019 requirement only on the basis of delays attributable to the authorities . In view of that , ORG considers that by repealing [ Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ] of the [ DATE ] Code of Criminal Procedure the legislature sought to achieve a constitutionally legitimate aim \u2013 to ensure the interests of justice while taking into account the right to \u2018 a hearing within a reasonable time\u2019 , as construed by ORG . In so far as in exceptional cases the new legal framework could restrict the rights of the accused , one should take into account that there exists a balancing mechanism , namely the requirement under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ] for all preventive measures [ such as pretrial detention or house arrest ] to be set aside after the expiry of timelimits that are identical to those under the repealed provisions .", "It is also important to examine whether the repeal of the possibility for accused persons to request that their case be brought for trial does not create a lacuna in the law , in breach of the requirement of LAW for effective remedies in respect of the rights and freedoms enshrined in the LAW and in particular the right of those charged with criminal offences to have their cases examined within a reasonable time . In its caselaw ORG has held that remedies are effective if they can prevent the alleged violation or its continuation , or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred [ ( see GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXI ) ] . In a number of judgments , that ORG has noted that before the introduction of Article CARDINALa of the [ CARDINAL ] Code of Criminal Procedure our State did not make available a remedy complying with the requirements of LAW , read in conjunction with LAW and capable of ensuring that the pretrial phase of criminal proceedings does not exceed a reasonable time [ ( see NORP and NORP v. GPE , nos . FAC and DATE , DATE ; PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; and GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) ] . In those circumstances , the answer to the above question depends on whether , from the creation of that remedy in DATE until its abolition in DATE , the ORG has created alternative mechanisms ensuring the availability of effective remedies in respect of the right to have charges examined within a reasonable time during the pretrial phase of criminal proceedings . In [ our ] view , that has been done , as far as rules are concerned . An amendment to LAW [ which came into force in DATE ] created a new independent body , the ORG attached to ORG , which may act pursuant to requests by the persons concerned , a category which includes those charged with a criminal offence . That ORG checks the work of the judicial authorities and has the power to report and make proposals to all ORG authorities , including the competent judicial authorities ( LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW ) . The ORG \u2019s powers have been laid down in more detail in the new [ LAW ] . It may now check \u2018 the way in which judicial , prosecutorial and investigation case files are being opened and processed , as well as their completion within the prescribed timelimits\u2019 ( section CARDINAL ) of the LAW ) . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , the results of such checks have to be made available not only to the judge , prosecutor or investigator concerned , but also to the head of the relevant department of the judiciary . That head must then inform the chief inspector whether any recommendations given have been complied with within the timelimit set in the ORG \u2019s report ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act ) . If it is necessary to prevent or overcome an undue delay during the pretrial phase of criminal proceedings , the authority in charge of ensuring compliance with the ORG \u2019s directions is the head of the relevant department of the prosecuting authorities . He or she has the power to take various measures : organisational ( under section PERSON ) of the Act ) , disciplinary ( to impose certain light sanctions under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW or to initiate disciplinary proceedings before ORG ) and procedural ( to set aside or vary the decisions of the lower prosecutors , to give mandatory directions or personally to take the necessary procedural steps , as possible under LAW of the [ DATE ] Code of Criminal Procedure , [ or ] to exercise control over the activities of the investigating authorities in line with ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the [ same Code ] ) . It can therefore be accepted that the repeal of [ Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code ] does not lead to a legal vacuum incompatible with LAW . Naturally , the mere existence of rules does not preclude the risk of future judgments in which ORG will find violations in respect of GPE . All State authorities must take into account the general statement made in GPE , cited above , namely that the remedy required by LAW must be effective in practice as well as in law . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
