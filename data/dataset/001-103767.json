The applicant is an association from PERSON ( GPE ) whose registration as a professional association was refused in a final decision delivered by ORG on DATE . Its name in NORP is ORG ( ORG ) .

CARDINAL on the establishment of associations and foundations , in its version in force at the time .", "On DATE ORG issued a favourable opinion on the statute of the applicant , referring specifically to the purposes of the association described in Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL stipulated that the goal of the association was the unitary organisation and functioning of the profession of legal adviser in GPE and the promotion of the principle that this profession had a complementary place within the national judicial system . Article CARDINAL of the statute provided further that the aim of the association was \u201c the protection and promotion of the rights of its members , ( ... ) concerning a consistent practice of the profession for the protection and promotion of the rights and freedoms of legal entities , authorities and public institutions , as well as of private persons in their relations with judicial institutions ( ... ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG seeking registration in ORG kept by that court . By an interlocutory judgment delivered in private on DATE the court granted the request and ordered the registration of the applicant in that register . The decision also provided that ORG could lodge an appeal on points of law within DATE from communication .", "CARDINAL . The Public Prosecutor and ORG lodged an appeal on points of law against that decision . ORG NORP Bar joined the proceedings in ORG interest .", "CARDINAL . In the appeal , the prosecutor argued that the interlocutory judgment of DATE , in approving the purposes stipulated in the association 's statute , had infringed ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL in so far as it had allowed the applicant to protect and promote the rights of private individuals , whereas only lawyers had the right to represent or assist private individuals in their relations with judicial institutions . The prosecutor also criticised LAW ( j ) of the statute , which allowed the council of the association to give its opinion ( \u201c aviz \u201d ) on the creation , within its geographical area , of companies providing freelance consultancy , assistance and legal representation , as well as to resolve complaints against the fees charged by freelance legal advisers . Further , the prosecutor contested LAW ( l ) , which entitled the council of the association to organise competitive examinations for vacant legal adviser positions , draw up job descriptions and inform the disciplinary board of any malpractice on the part of legal advisers .", "CARDINAL . NORP The bar associations supported the prosecutor 's arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant held an extraordinary general assembly and adopted an additional protocol to the statute , in which it amended Article CARDINAL by removing the reference to representation of private persons . It also removed LAW ( j ) entirely and amended LAW ( l ) by limiting the task of the council of the association to providing information on malpractice on the part of legal advisers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG seeking registration of the modifications . By an interlocutory decision of DATE , delivered in private , the court ordered the registration of those modifications . From the information submitted by the ORG , it appears that an appeal was lodged against this judgment and a final decision was delivered on DATE . No copy of the appeal decision was submitted to the case file .", "CARDINAL . During the trial regarding the appeal lodged by the prosecutor and by the bar associations against the interlocutory judgment of DATE , the applicant alleged that it had become groundless after the adoption of the additional protocol to its statute . It argued that the only ground for the appeal could be an amendment to the interlocutory decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the prosecutor 's appeal on points of law in a final decision , modified the interlocutory judgment of DATE and dismissed the applicant 's request for registration The court considered that , according to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL , the professional activity of a legal adviser could only be carried out within the framework of the legal entity for which he worked , thus excluding the possibility to represent the interests of private individuals . It further considered that LAW that law provided that the profession of legal adviser was incompatible with that of lawyer . It then held that legal advisers could be appointed or hired under the provisions of that law ; therefore they could not carry out functions which were specific to those of a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that the provisions of LAW ( j ) of the applicant 's statute were at odds with LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the organisation and functioning of the lawyer profession , which provided that only lawyers may offer freelance consulting , assistance and legal representation . The appellate court considered that those aspects of illegality had also been recognised by the applicant , which had allegedly removed them by adopting an additional protocol to its statute . However , the fact that an additional protocol had been adopted could not have validated the interlocutory judgment of DATE , since that decision had taken account of the existing situation at the time it had been delivered .", "CARDINAL . DATE Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL on associations and foundations provides that the judge in charge of reviewing the legality of a request for registration and the supporting documents is to scrutinise the request within DATE of the date it was lodged .

When the deadline is reached and the judge concludes that the irregularities have been remediated , it shall take note of this in an interlocutory judgment and shall order the registering of the association in ORG .", "Article CARDINAL provides that an association is registered in ORG only when the interlocutory judgment allowing the request for registration becomes final . Article CARDINAL of the same act provides that any changes to the statute of an association which has acquired legal personality and has been registered legally have to be recorded in ORG according to a procedure that is similar to the CARDINAL for registering as an association .", "CARDINAL . The same LAW provides that an association may be dissolved by a judicial decision if its goals prove to be contrary to law or public order .", "CARDINAL .
