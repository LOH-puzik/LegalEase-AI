SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection rejected (victim);Not necessary to examine preliminary objection (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies)", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;John Freeland;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants live in the villages of ORG , PERSON and PERSON , situated in containment zone no . CARDINAL ( Alarmzone CARDINAL ) within a", "radius of QUANTITY from the nuclear power station at GPE ( GPE of GPE ) . They either own or rent their homes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the company which had operated the power station since DATE , ORG ( \u201c the operating company \u201d ) , applied to ORG ( the government ) for an extension of its operating licence for an indefinite period and for permission to increase production by PERCENT . The application was published in ORG of DATE together with a notice inviting persons satisfying the requirements laid down by section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to file an objection .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL objections in all were sent to ORG , CARDINAL of which came from GPE and GPE .", "In their objection of CARDINAL DATE , to which several expert opinions were attached , the applicants requested ORG to refuse an extension of the operating licence and to order the immediate and permanent closure of the nuclear power station . Relying in particular on LAW ( the former ) section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , they maintained that the power station did not meet current safety standards on account of serious and irremediable construction defects and that , owing to its condition , the risk of an accident occurring was greater than usual . In addition , they asked the authorities to obtain further data and in the meantime take certain provisional measures . With regard to the fact that under the applicable law ORG would consider the application for an operating licence as an authority of both first and last instance , they pointed out that its decision could give rise to an application based on LAW since it affected their civil rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG and ORG rejected the requests for interim measures and for gathering the additional data .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed all the objections as being unfounded and , subject to compliance with various specified safeguards , granted an operating licence until DATE and authorised a PERCENT increase in production . In its decision it relied on an expert report by ORG , an independent report prepared at the request of ORG on the effects of the power station on the nearby river and opinions of ORG , ORG for ORG and the cantonal authorities .", "ORG found firstly that the objectors living in containment zone no . CARDINAL were entitled to take part in the proceedings , unlike the objectors who lived further away from the power station , mainly in GPE and GPE .", "It then recapitulated the factors which , under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , justified refusing an operating licence or granting it subject to conditions and stated that applicants who satisfied all the statutory requirements were entitled to an operating licence .", "It went on to note that although power stations built DATE certainly no longer met current technical standards , they could nonetheless be maintained and modernised so that they could continue to operate quite safely . In order to satisfy itself that this was so in the instance under review , ORG considered each of the objections in turn . It found them to be unfounded .", "With regard to the complaint based on the right to life protected by LAW , ORG drew attention to the position under ORG case - law , whereby only deliberate infringements could constitute a breach of that right . That did not apply to the operation of a nuclear power station , at least so long as appropriate technical and operating procedures were adopted to prevent such an infringement and so long as these could reasonably be considered to provide a level of protection comparable to that existing in other generally accepted technical installations .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW of DATE on the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) , a licence from the ORG is required for the construction and operation of nuclear installations and for any changes in the purpose , nature or scale of such installations . LAW ) provides that a licence must be refused or granted subject to appropriate conditions or obligations if that is necessary in order , in particular , to protect people , the property of others or important", "rights . Section CARDINAL provides that ORG or a body designated by it decides licence applications . No appeal lies against its decisions .", "CARDINAL . Under ORG case - law , the safety of nuclear power stations can only be considered by the ORG as part of its licensing procedures ( Judgments of ORG ( ORG ) , vol . CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE provides that ORG hears , as a final court of appeal , administrative - law appeals against decisions of the federal authorities . However , by section CARDINAL ( e ) , as worded at the material time , no appeal lay against the grant of a licence for technical installations to be brought into service .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE lays down the principle that administrative decisions are appealable . By DATE , however , an appeal is inadmissible if it is made against a decision against which an administrative - law appeal lies to ORG . Under section CARDINAL ( a ) a person has locus standi to appeal if he is affected by the decision and has an interest worthy of protection in having the decision set aside or varied .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c Any person who sustains or is exposed to damage because an owner abuses his right may bring an action against that owner requiring him to restore the previous position or to take preventive measures , without prejudice to any damages . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . When exercising their right , especially when carrying on industrial processes , owners are required to refrain from acting in a manner detrimental to neighbouring properties .", "CARDINAL . NORP The following , in particular , are prohibited : emissions of smoke or soot , offensive smells , noises , and vibrations which are harmful and exceed the limits of the tolerance which neighbours must show to each other having regard to local custom and the situation and type of the buildings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By virtue of section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , expropriations may be carried out \u201c for the purposes of works that are in the interest of the ORG or of a substantial area of the country and for any other public - interest aim recognised by federal law \u201d .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides : \u201c The following may be expropriated : rights in rem over land , rights arising from land ownership that concern relations between owners and occupiers of adjacent LOC and the rights in personam of tenants or farmers of the property to be expropriated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the latter provision , ORG has held :", "\u201c Actions brought under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL to CARDINAL [ of LAW ] ... are included among the rights which may be expropriated under LAW ... If the emissions or other allegedly adverse effects result from the construction , in accordance with the applicable law , of a building in the public interest for which land has been expropriated , or are the consequence of using the building for its intended purpose , no private - law action lies for the purpose of obtaining an injunction or compensation . A claim for compensation for expropriation replaces the cause of action under private law and must be made to the expropriations judge , who has jurisdiction not only to assess compensation but also to rule on whether the right ... exists . An expropriating authority 's refusal to commence proceedings may be challenged , at last instance , by means of an administrative - law appeal to ORG . \u201d ( ORG , vol . CARDINAL Ib , p. CARDINAL )", "In another judgment ORG held :", "\u201c By virtue of section CARDINAL ... , rights arising from land ownership that concern relations between owners and occupiers of adjacent premises may be expropriated and be forfeited or restricted , temporarily or permanently , provided that the proportionality principle is complied with ... \u201d ( ORG , vol .

Section CARDINAL of the LAW has applied in the case of people living near very busy main roads who were concerned about pollution from exhaust fumes ( ORG , vol . CARDINAL Ib , p. CARDINAL ) . Under ORG case - law , compensation is awarded if the nuisance was not foreseeable and resulted in substantial damage and if the owner suffered special loss ( loc . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) .
