GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON . ORG , is a religious association based in GPE . It was represented before the ORG by Mr H. NORP and Mr PERSON , both of FAC .", "The applicant association was formed in GPE ( GDR ) in DATE by citizens of the NORP faith .", "On DATE it obtained ORG approval as a religious association with legal personality ( rechtsf\u00e4hig ) .", "On DATE the Presidium of ORG ( ORG ) of ORG PERSON PDS ) decided to make a donation ( GPE ) of CARDINAL GDR marks to the applicant association , following a request to that effect from the association .", "On DATE the president of the applicant association received a cheque for that amount .", "On DATE he handed the cheque to the applicant association \u2019s bank , which credited the sum to its account on DATE .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG for ORG in the GPE ( ORG zur Pr\u00fcfung des Verm\u00f6gens der Parteien und Massenorganisationen in der DDR ) stated that the donation in question constituted an asset covered by section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON of DATE on parties and other political associations , also known as LAW ( Gesetz \u00fcber Parteien und andere politische ORG ) ) , as amended by ORG of DATE ( Gesetz zur GPE des GPE ) ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . The asset was therefore subject to the administration of ORG ( Treuhandanstalt ) .", "The commission also considered that this unlawful disposal by the PDS of its assets without ORG consent , in breach of section DATE ) of LAW , had in fact amounted to a fictitious transaction ( Scheingesch\u00e4ft ) designed to enable the applicant association \u2019s president , who had close links with the PDS , to retain possession of the sum in question .", "In a decision of DATE ORG relating to ORG ( Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr vereinigungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben DATE \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ruled that the sum of money DATE converted into MONEY ( DEM ) , together with the accrued interest \u2013 in the applicant association \u2019s bank account constituted an asset subject to the administration of ORG and could not be disposed of without the ORG \u2019s consent , by virtue of section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "ORG considered that the sum in question had been part of the ORG \u2019s assets , which had been placed under the administration of ORG from DATE , pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of LAW . As the applicant association \u2019s bank account had not been credited with the sum until after DATE , authorisation for that change in assets should have been sought from ORG , in accordance with section DATE ) of LAW , but that had not been the case .", "On DATE the applicant association lodged an objection against that decision , arguing , in particular , that , in accordance with LAW of LAW ( Zivilgesetzbuch DDR ) , payment of the donation had taken effect when the cheque had been handed over on DATE and that the value of its assets had therefore increased on that date .", "In a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the objection .", "The applicant association subsequently applied to ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) to have ORG decisions set aside on the ground , inter alia , that it was not an organisation related to the ORG but a religious association entitled to protection under LAW ) .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the application in its entirety .", "ORG held that the conditions for applying section CARDINAL of LAW were not satisfied . The applicant association was neither a juristic person nor an organisation related to the PDS , and ORG was not responsible for the administration of assets which had been transferred in accordance with the power of third parties to dispose of property ( PERSON ) , even if the relevant contractual agreements had been invalid ( unwirksam ) . In addition , it had not been established that the applicant association had been formed to pursue any aims other than those set out in its articles of association .", "ORG appealed against that judgment to ORG ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld ORG judgment .", "ORG held that ORG decision had had no basis in law as the applicant association was neither a juristic person nor an organisation related to the ORG . Even though the circumstances surrounding its formation and the payment of the donation in issue remained questionable in certain respects , there was insufficient evidence of any link between the applicant association and the FAC .", "ORG added that , in accordance with LAW of LAW , the power to dispose of the sum in question had not become effective until the money had been credited to the applicant association \u2019s bank account . Admittedly , when LAW had come into force on DATE , the money had still been part of the ORG \u2019s assets . However , that did not justify ORG actions , since it was required to institute civil proceedings if it wished to seek damages from third parties . It was unable to take any administrative measures by virtue of its powers as a public authority save in respect of the types of juristic person listed in section CARDINALb of LAW .", "ORG subsequently appealed on points of law to ORG ) .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed ORG appeal and set aside the judgment of ORG on the ground that it had contravened federal law ( ORG ) .", "ORG held that ORG had been entitled to consider that , pursuant to section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) of LAW , the donation paid into the applicant association \u2019s bank account was placed under the administration of ORG .", "It considered , firstly , that the sum of money in question had indeed been part of the ORG \u2019s assets on the key date of DATE and that , secondly , administration by ORG under section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) of LAW could extend to third parties other than those specifically referred to in that provision .", "With regard to the first point , ORG referred to its own decision of DATE and reiterated that a change in assets did not take effect on the date on which the cheque was handed over but only on the date on which the sum appearing on the cheque was credited to the relevant bank account . In the instant case , that had not occurred until DATE in other words , after DATE , the date on which ORG had come into force , placing the sum in issue under the administration of ORG .", "ORG subsequently held that the fact that , as a result of the transfer , the ORG \u2019s right to payment from its bank had been transformed into a right enjoyed by the applicant association to payment from its own bank did not mean that that the money in question was no longer part of the ORG \u2019s assets ; furthermore , the money had been paid into an account that already contained assets belonging to the applicant association . In that connection , it pointed out that the purpose of section CARDINAL ) of LAW was , as it had previously held , to secure political - party assets acquired in breach of the rule of law ( rechtsstaatswidrig ) , with a view to returning them to their former owners or using them in the public interest . Section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) of LAW should therefore be construed according to economic criteria ( wirtschaftliche GPE ) and , accordingly , ORG administration of cash assets or money held in a bank account did not cease to be effective as a result of ordinary private - law transactions but continued as long as the sum in question was still sufficiently identifiable as the property of the party concerned , as had been the case in this instance .", "With regard to the second point , ORG considered that ORG power of administration did not entail administration as a trustee in the ordinary sense but entitled it to exercise its sovereign powers to administer and dispose of assets ( hoheitliche Verwaltungs- und ORG ) vis - \u00e0 - vis third parties by means of a declaratory administrative measure ( feststellender PERSON ) . Under section CARDINAL ) of LAW , ORG activities were not designed to protect the best interests of the political party or related organisation . On the contrary , its task was to ensure , once the assets in question had been secured , that they were returned to their former owners by way of reparation ( Wiedergutmachung ) or , if that proved impossible , that they were used in the public interest . Only where the assets had been acquired in accordance with the rule of law were they to be returned to the party or related organisation . The sovereign powers conferred on ORG accordingly included the right to use those powers against third parties by means of an administrative measure .", "The applicant association subsequently lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) .", "In a decision of DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to entertain the appeal .", "The Political Parties LAW of DATE ( Gesetz zur GPE des GPE ) , which amended the GPE \u2019s PERSON of DATE on parties and other political associations , also known as LAW ( Gesetz \u00fcber Parteien und andere politische ORG ) ) , came into force on DATE .", "Section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that the Prime Minister ( Ministerpr\u00e4sident ) is to appoint an independent commission to draw up a report on the assets ( PERSON ) of all the GPE \u2019s political parties and related organisations , juristic persons and mass organisations , both within and outside the territory of the GPE .", "By section CARDINAL ) , all political parties and related organisations , juristic persons and mass organisations must , inter alia , provide the commission with a statement of all their assets as at DATE and of any subsequent changes .", "Section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) provides that as soon as the LAW comes into force , no changes in the assets of such entities may be effected without the consent of the chairman of the independent commission .", "Section CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c In order to secure the assets of political parties or related organisations , juristic persons and mass organisations , all assets which belonged to political parties and related organisations , juristic persons and mass organisations on DATE , or which have subsequently replaced those assets , shall be placed under the administration of a trustee . \u201d", "( \u201c PERSON oder ihnen verbundenen PERSON , juristischen CARDINAL und Massenorganisationen wird das ORG der Parteien und der ihnen verbundenen PERSON , juristischen ORG , das am CARDINAL .
