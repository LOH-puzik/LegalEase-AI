NORP The applicant in the first case , Mr PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant in the second case , Mr PERSON ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . Both applicants were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were high - ranking prosecutors . The first applicant had served , inter alia , as the Deputy Prosecutor General and the Deputy Minister of ORG . Both applicants acquired the status of a \u201c prosecutor in inactive service \u201d ( prokurator w stanie spoczynku ) in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants stood for election to the PERSON ( the first ORG ) from the list of the PERSON and ORG party as nonpartisan candidates .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during the electoral campaign before parliamentary elections , ORG ) , a body composed of senior prosecutors , Members of ORG , the Minister of ORG , ORG and the representative of the President of the Republic , passed a resolution expressing a view on the participation of prosecutors standing for election in political activities . ORG opined that prosecutors , including prosecutors in inactive service had the right to stand for election to ORG . It noted that the prosecutors in inactive service enjoyed a privileged position in comparison to the prosecutors in service in that when elected members of parliament the former were not required to renounce their status of prosecutors in inactive service . ORG recommended that this situation had to be addressed by the legislature . At the same time , it reminded all prosecutors of the statutory ban on engaging in political activity .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were elected members of the PERSON on DATE . The results of the elections were published on DATE . On an unspecified date the applicants were requested by the Speaker of the PERSON ( PERSON ) to renounce their status of prosecutors in inactive service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG passed a new resolution in which it opined that both prosecutors in service and prosecutors in inactive service could not hold their position and sit as Member of ORG at the same time . The ORG stated that its previous opinion of CARDINAL DATE had only concerned the period of electoral campaign .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Speaker of the PERSON issued CARDINAL respective orders declaring that the applicants had forfeited their parliamentary seats under LAW in conjunction with LAW . He observed that the prohibition of holding jointly a parliamentary seat and other public office ( \u201c incompatibilitas \u201d ) was the consequence of the principle of the separation of powers and of the political neutrality of the public service . LAW prescribed in LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL the absolute and directly applicable ban on joint holding of the office of a deputy with other positions listed in this provision . The scope of this ban could not be restricted by statutory regulations .", "CARDINAL . The Speaker noted that the ban on holding jointly a parliamentary seat and the office of a prosecutor was prescribed in LAW . This rule was also reflected in the statutory norms , namely section CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY on the Exercise of the Mandate of the Member of the PERSON and of the ORG ( hereinafter \u201c The LAW on the Exercise \u201d ) and section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW on ORG . The scope of those various provisions was not identical , in particular with regard to the consequences of the breach of the impugned ban . LAW on the Exercise stated that deputies could not concurrently work in the position of a prosecutor and permitted in such a case for a prosecutor to benefit from an unpaid leave of absence . On the other hand , LAW required that a prosecutor who had been elected to hold a position in a ORG organ forfeit his office of the prosecutor , unless he acquired the status of a prosecutor in inactive service . The Speaker acknowledged the above divergences in respect of the impugned ban between the statutory regulation on the one hand and the constitutional regulation on the other . Nonetheless , the Speaker considered that he was obliged to apply the constitutional rule prescribed in LAW and disregard the statutory provisions incompatible with that rule .", "CARDINAL . The next issue to determine was the interpretation of the term \u201c prosecutor \u201d employed in LAW and whether this term encompassed prosecutors in inactive service . The Speaker noted that this was an autonomous constitutional term which could not be limited to its statutory definitions . Having analysed the relevant provisions of LAW as well as the case - law of ORG and of ORG , the Speaker found that the term \u201c prosecutor \u201d employed in LAW encompassed equally prosecutors in inactive service .", "CARDINAL . The Speaker noted that within DATE of the final result of the elections the applicants could have declared that they had renounced their status of prosecutors in inactive service . In the absence of such a declaration , the Speaker held that the applicants had forfeited their parliamentary seats .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . He argued , inter alia , that the Speaker had erred in finding that the term \u201c prosecutor \u201d used in LAW comprised prosecutors in inactive service . He further maintained that the Speaker had suddenly adopted a new interpretation of the term which was inconsistent with its statutory understanding ( section CARDINALa LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW on the Exercise ) as well as contrary to existing practice . He further invoked the first resolution of ORG which stated that a prosecutor in inactive service could hold the office of a deputy jointly with his status of a prosecutor in inactive service . In addition , the Speaker \u2019s finding that the first applicant had to irrevocably forfeit his status of the prosecutor in inactive service in order to keep his parliamentary seat breached the constitutional provisions on proportionality and equality . Lastly , invoking , inter alia , LAW , the applicant submitted that the Speaker had not informed him about the procedure initiated in his case and had not offered him a possibility to make representations .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed too . He alleged , inter alia , that the Speaker had wrongly applied LAW and other provisions of the LAW regulating the right of access to the public service and the right to stand for election as well as the relevant provisions of LAW . He also invoked LAW . His main contention was that the ban prescribed in LAW did not apply to prosecutors in inactive service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , sitting in camera , dismissed the applicants\u2019 respective appeals .", "CARDINAL . ORG first inquired about the existing practice with regard to judges and prosecutors in inactive service sitting as MPs . It established that there had been CARDINAL case of a judge in inactive service who sat as a Senator ( Member of the ORG , the second ORG of the NORP ORG ) DATE . In that case no action was taken by the Speaker of the ORG . There had been no such cases concerning prosecutors in inactive service . In CARDINAL case concerning a judge in inactive service , the First President of ORG objected to the participation of this judge in the capacity of an expert in the works of the parliamentary commission of inquiry , considering it being incompatible with the duty of political neutrality of judges . In ORG view , the existing practice was inconsistent and did not support the ORG contention that prosecutors in inactive service could sit as MPs .", "CARDINAL . ORG carried out a detailed analysis of the term \u201c prosecutor \u201d within the meaning of LAW . It noted first that this provision used the term \u201c prosecutor \u201d without any qualification which signified that it was applicable to all prosecutors , i.e. persons appointed to a post of a prosecutor . At the date of the entry into force of the LAW , that is on DATE , the appointment to a post of a prosecutor ended with retirement . Subsequently , on DATE LAW introduced the status of a \u201c prosecutor in inactive service \u201d ( in parallel to the status of a \u201c judge in inactive service \u201d ) . Following this amendment , the public - law employment relationship of a prosecutor began with his appointment and continued until his or her death ( save for cases when a prosecutor renounced it or was divested of it as a result of a judgment ) . The said amendment altered the meaning of the term \u201c prosecutor \u201d and from its entry into force the term covered not only prosecutors in active service , but also \u201c prosecutors in inactive service \u201d .", "CARDINAL . This finding was confirmed by the case - law of ORG ( judgment of DATE , case no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and of ORG ( inter alia , judgment of DATE , case no . SDI CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Both courts underlined that a prosecutor in inactive service ( or judge in inactive service ) did not cease to be a prosecutor ( judge ) and the holder of a public office . Prosecutors in inactive service continued their publiclaw employment relationship with the exception of the obligation to carry out their duties . The legislator wished to preserve the authority of the office of a prosecutor ( judge ) and thus bestowed particular privileges on those who had held those offices in exchange for the resignation from certain rights . The LAW on the Prosecution Service linked the status of a prosecutor in inactive service with a number of obligations such as disciplinary responsibility , the limitation on taking any other employment or gainful activity , the requirement to uphold the dignity of the office and the ban on engaging in political activity . At the same time prosecutors in inactive service received a special pension ( uposa\u017cenie ) which was more favourable than an ordinary old - age pension . It was further clear that a prosecutor in inactive service could voluntarily renounce his status and all the corresponding rights and obligations .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , ORG held that there was no doubt that the term \u201c prosecutor \u201d employed in LAW covered both prosecutors in service and prosecutors in inactive service . It noted that the interpretation of the provisions of LAW , like in the present case , could not be determined by the content of statutory norms , in particular by section CARDINALa of the LAW on ORG . The ban on holding jointly a parliamentary seat and the position of a prosecutor , comprising prosecutor in inactive service , was directly prescribed in LAW . Accordingly , the fact of a prosecutor going into inactive service could not revoke the ban set out in LAW ; it was necessary that a prosecutor in inactive service renounce his status the prosecutor in inactive service .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG noted that according to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Act on ORG , prosecutors were prohibited from joining any political party and from engaging in any political activity . In accordance with ORG case - law , this provision was also applicable to prosecutors in inactive service , while there was no doubt that sitting as a deputy was a political activity . In ORG view , the rules on disqualification were aimed at ensuring political neutrality of the public service and the transparent operation of the parliament free from undue influence and the conflict of interest . They were further proportional to those aims . ORG held that the constitutional provisions on the equality ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , the right of access to the public service ( Article CARDINAL ) and the right to be elected ( Article CARDINAL ) had not been infringed . The ban which affected the applicant had its origin in the LAW itself and the drafters of LAW had carried out a balancing exercise of the various competing interests . Furthermore , the applicants had had time to consider their options and the possibility to renounce their status of prosecutors in inactive service .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that no provision of the Convention , in particular LAW No . CARDINAL or LAW , had been breached in the applicants\u2019 case . In its view , LAW No . CARDINAL did not concern the rules on disqualification . The applicants had exercised their right to be elected a deputy , but in order to keep their parliamentary seat they had to renounce their status of a prosecutor in inactive service . ORG relied on the decision Bri\u0137e v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) in which ORG had dismissed the complaint of a judge who complained that in order to stand for election to ORG she had had to resign from her judicial office . ORG found that the same approach was applicable , mutatis mutandis , to the situation of the applicants in the present case .", "CARDINAL . ORG further held that LAW was not applicable to the proceedings at issue because they concerned political rights . It noted , in passing , that the applicants had been summoned to renounce their status of the prosecutor in inactive service .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant filed a constitutional complaint . He alleged that the relevant provisions of LAW breached the constitutional right of access to the public service ( LAW ) , the right to stand for election ( LAW ) as well as LAW in that prosecutors in inactive service could not sit as Deputies . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings , having found , inter alia , that the ban on holding jointly the offices of a prosecutor in inactive service and of an MP was prescribed directly in the LAW and therefore ORG had no jurisdiction to decide the case ( case no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It noted , obiter dicta , that the inconsistent interpretation of LAW should be unified .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW provides :", "\u201c Every citizen having the right to vote , who , no later than on DATE of the elections , has attained DATE , shall be eligible to be elected to the PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c No judge , public prosecutor , officer of the civil service , soldier on active military service or officer of the police or of the services of State protection shall exercise the mandate of a Deputy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , in its relevant part , provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The expiration of the mandate of a Deputy shall occur in the following cases :", "...", "CARDINAL ) holding on DATE of an office or position , which according to the provisions of LAW or statutes could not be held jointly with the office of a Deputy , subject to the provision of \u00a7 CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL states that an expiration of the mandate of a Deputy in the situation described above will take place if a Deputy did not submit to the Speaker of the PERSON a declaration resigning from his other office or position within DATE of the official result of the election being published .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that a Member of ORG can not hold jointly his or her mandate with those offices or positions which according to the LAW or statutes can not be held jointly with the mandate of a Deputy .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Act on ORG provides that a prosecutor can not join a political party or be involved in any political activity .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of the same LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c A prosecutor who was nominated , appointed or elected to hold office in the ORG organs , local self - government , diplomatic service , consular service or in the organs of the international or supranational organisations acting on the basis of an international agreement ratified by GPE shall resign from his position unless he goes into inactive service . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
