On DATE ORG held a hearing at which the prosecutor sought to read out statements made by a certain ORG as well as by PERSON , GPE , and PERSON The applicant \u2019s lawyer objected to this , submitting that the statements in question had been made before the NORP courts in another set of criminal proceedings in which those individuals had been the accused , and thus they had not received a warning about criminal liability for making untruthful statements . He also submitted that the NORP authorities had made no attempt to hear those individuals in GPE at the preparatory stage of the proceedings . Moreover , he challenged the legal basis that could allow statements made before foreign courts to be read out .", "Nevertheless , the trial court decided to read out the statements made by ORG and others . The court based its decision on LAW and others , which allowed statements made by both witnesses and accused in another set of proceedings to be read out . It agreed that it had not been obvious whether this provision could be applicable to a situation where the actions of foreign authorities had not been taken at the request of the NORP authorities ; however this doubt had been dismissed by ORG in its decision of DATE . ORG examined the rules of NORP Criminal Procedure and concluded that they did not conflict with the principles and guarantees provided by the NORP legal order .", "CARDINAL .

In reconstructing the facts of the case the trial court firstly examined the type and quantity of chemical substances seized during the search of CARDINAL rooms of the laboratory in B. and the possible time frame of the activity of the laboratory . The written reasons of the judgment in this respect are detailed and extensive . The court examined at length the results of the searches of the laboratory , which had been conducted by several experts , who had collected CARDINAL samples of chemical substances as well as video and photographic evidence . The trial court examined the scientific methodology employed by experts , and the procedures followed , in the light of the allegations made by the accused that some of the evidence against them had been fabricated .", "CARDINAL . The court further examined the involvement of each of the coaccused in the activities with which they had been charged . As regards the applicant , the trial court referred to comparisons made by NORP and NORP experts of chemical substances found in the laboratory to ecstasy pills confiscated in several NORP countries , notably in GPE . The experts considered that it was most probable that the drugs found abroad had been produced in the laboratory in GPE link between the applicant , the other coaccused , and the activity of the laboratory was established on the basis of various pieces of evidence examined at length by the trial court as well as circumstantial evidence .", "CARDINAL . NORP The trial court assessed the credibility of statements obtained from ORG and others by the NORP courts and investigating authorities , which had been read out at the hearing , and determined that they were worthy evidence ( pe\u0142nowarto\u015bciowy materia\u0142 dowodowy ) . They enabled the existence of personal connections between the applicant and drug dealers arrested in GPE , in particular FAC , to be established The court considered this evidence to corroborate what had been established by experts , namely that the drugs found abroad had in fact been produced in the laboratory in B. The trial court considered that FAC in his statements had been incriminating himself to a far greater extent than the applicant . ORG considered himself the main organiser of drugrelated dealings and depicted the applicant as an ineffective executor of his instructions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment . He complained in particular that ORG \u2019s statements , as well as those of CARDINAL other witnesses , had been read out before the trial court although they had not been requested by the NORP authorities as provided by LAW . The applicant also contested the trial court \u2019s refusal of his request for ORG to be heard in person . Moreover , the appeal challenged the trial court \u2019s finding that the applicant had been producing drugs up to DATE . He submitted that the condition of the laboratory when it was searched on CARDINAL DATE showed that it had not been used recently . Thus the trial court was wrong to conclude that the applicant had been committing an offence continuously up to DATE and to apply the more severe legal regulation that entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor also lodged an appeal , alleging that it had been sufficiently proved that the applicant had acted as a leader of an organised criminal gang .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) held a hearing and upheld the impugned judgment . The court considered that the firstinstance court had been right to read out the statements of ORG and others made before the NORP court and that it had correctly applied the legal provisions in the light of ORG interpretation set out in its decision of DATE . The appellate court also dismissed the arguments that the applicant had not been producing any illegal substances immediately before and after DATE . The court considered that the police had secured in his laboratory large quantities of substances for the production of narcotics , with appliances which had not been dismantled and showed signs of recent use . According to the court , a laboratory of that kind did not work steadily and produce constantly , but had periods of stagnation , waiting for the following stages of the production , but nevertheless with the intention of continuing such activity .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the above - mentioned circumstantial evidence , ORG analysed at length the statements made by ORG and other witnesses heard in GPE and assessed their usefulness and veracity . It underlined that the applicant had never contested that he knew ORG and had met him on several occasions , allegedly in the capacity of an expert consultant in chemistry . The court noted that ORG had disclosed many elements of his dealings , which only in part concerned the applicant , without attempting to minimise his own role . His statements were considered logical and trustworthy and corroborated by those made by other witnesses .", "CARDINAL .
