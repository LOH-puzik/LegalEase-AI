CYPRUS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who lives in GPE , GPE . He had been granted legal aid covering part of his costs for the proceedings before this ORG and was represented by Professor PERSON , a barrister practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , Attorney - General of GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was arrested on DATE and was remanded in custody until DATE . On DATE he was committed for trial before ORG of GPE sitting on DATE . On the latter date , he was formally charged with a series of offences dating from DATE to CARDINAL January DATE . He pleaded not guilty .", "A lengthy series of adjournments of the proceedings followed . On DATE the court adjourned the case to QUANTITY , and then to CARDINAL November CARDINAL as another case which was pending before it had been assigned priority . On the same ground the hearing was adjourned twice more . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s request for an adjournment was granted and the case fixed for DATE . On DATE , the case was further adjourned on the basis of a request submitted by the prosecution and was fixed for hearing on DATE . On DATE , the applicant requested an adjournment . This was granted by the court which noted that it was , in any event , unable to proceed because it was engaged in the trial of another case . It fixed the case for DATE when it adjourned it to DATE due to lack of time as it had CARDINAL ongoing trials . On DATE , the hearing was again adjourned to CARDINAL DATE and it was further adjourned at the applicant \u2019s request because in fact the court had CARDINAL other hearings . On DATE , the applicant requested a further adjournment due to the deterioration of his health following a road accident . The case was accordingly adjourned to DATE .", "On that date the applicant applied for a stay of the proceedings on the ground that the excessive delay violated LAW guaranteeing the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time and LAW . ORG granted the application . Reference was made to a period of DATE when \u201c there was complete inactivity in the case \u201d and for which \u201c the excessive workload of the ORG \u201d was responsible . It observed that the trial had been adjourned CARDINAL times without the applicant being responsible , and that even on the QUANTITY occasions when he had himself requested an adjournment , this was granted because of the court \u2019s inability to pursue the case . It therefore concluded that CARDINAL half GPE delay , from the filing of the case until DATE , constituted a breach of the reasonable time requirement . It noted that while ORG had never found that a violation of LAW required the quashing of a conviction , this was one of the remedies offered by the common law in appropriate circumstances . For instance , where the delay took place after the lodging of an appeal against conviction , the appropriate remedy would be a reduction of a sentence , whereas if the delay had arisen before the trial began , as in the present case , one of the available remedies would be to uphold an accused \u2019s plea in bar of the trial . Reference was made to ORG judgment in Attorney General \u2019s Reference no.CARDINAL of DATE ( J ) ( DATE ) PERSON . DATE where it had been stated with regard to stay of proceedings that although it was a remedy which the court could grant , it should be confined to situations which in general terms amounted to an abuse of process . It was noted , however , that GPE case - law on this point was clear : where the shortcomings in the fairness of the proceedings could be remedied by a retrial , a retrial should be ordered where possible ; but if the constitutional rights of an accused had been infringed by a failure to put him on trial within a reasonable time , he should not be obliged to prepare for a trial which would necessarily take place after an unreasonable length of time . In the view of ORG , the only appropriate remedy for the unreasonable length of the proceedings under examination was to stay the proceedings and order the applicant \u2019s discharge .", "ORG in its judgment of DATE criticised ORG assessment of the delay since it had only relied on the length of the period and had not considered other relevant factors , such as the complexity of the case and the applicant \u2019s own conduct . Moreover , it found that ORG account of the relevant adjournments had been inaccurate : while the court itself had been responsible for a number of them , the applicant had not objected and he had himself requested the adjournment of the case on a number of occasions . It observed that according to its case - law unreasonable delay could be remedied by taking it into account in the reduction of sentence . For all the above reasons it considered the decision of ORG erroneous and held that it should be set aside and the case sent for retrial by ORG .", "On DATE judgement was delivered by ORG which found the applicant guilty of the offences of falsification of accounts and stealing by an employee . The applicant was acquitted of CARDINAL other charges of steeling by an employee and more serious charges of falsification of documents .", "On DATE the same court proceeded to sentence the applicant . It considered that given the seriousness of the offences of which he had been convicted , involving breach of confidence and elements of fraud , the only appropriate sentence would be that of imprisonment . The maximum sentence provided for by the relevant provisions of LAW at the time of commission of the relevant offences was DATE imprisonment . ORG referred to the previous decision of ORG in the case , noting that a finding that a trial had not been concluded within reasonable time could be remedied by taking the delay into account as a mitigating factor . It stated that :", "\u201c It is a fact that the lapse of DATE from the date of the applicant \u2019s arrest and DATE ( CARDINAL ) from the commission of the offences for which he has been found guilty , constitutes in itself a period of time that should be taken into account in the determination of an appropriate sentence . The uncertainty of the pending proceedings leading to understandable anxiety about one \u2019s guilt or innocence is in itself harrowing , but this is aggravated by the circumstances of this case , which we will attempt to summarise in the context of our duty to impose a sentence :", "( a ) the accused has been acquitted after a lengthy hearing of most of the charges brought against him ;", "( b ) Despite the fact that certain requests for an adjournment were made on behalf of the defence , responsibility for the length of the proceedings could not be attributed to them given the conduct of the proceedings as a whole ...", "( c ) During this period of time ... the accused \u2019s [ personal ] circumstances had deteriorated . In addition to the anguish he went through due to the pending proceedings , he had lost his employment in the bank and was unable to find a new job .... Moreover , [ it was asserted on behalf of the accused that ] because of the proceedings he could not get married .", "....", "We have carefully examined the circumstances of the present case knowing that they lasted for such a long period that their duration must have a substantial impact on the sentence as a primary mitigating factor .", "Having examined the seriousness of the offences and balanced every other relevant factor , we find that the appropriate sentence can not be other than that of imprisonment . The length of the proceedings in combination with the accused \u2019s lack of criminal record , the devastating effects that the proceedings had on his life ( and , in particular , his loss of employment and career prospects ) must have a significant impact on the prison sentence that is to be passed . \u201d", "Accordingly , the applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment on each of the CARDINAL counts of falsification of accounts and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment on each of the counts of stealing in respect of which he had been convicted . All the sentences were to run concurrently . The applicant \u2019s request for suspension of the sentence of imprisonment was rejected .", "LAW ) of LAW provides as follows , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... , every person is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by an independent , impartial and competent court ... \u201d .", "In the case of PERSON the Police ( DATE ) CARDINAL S.C.J. CARDINAL it was stated :", "\u201c This case had been repeatedly adjourned without a valid reason and without the accused \u2019s culpability . Hence , the accused \u2019s criminal liability had not been determined within reasonable time in breach of his right guaranteed by LAW . This finding leads to the quashing of the conviction as well as the proceedings in their entirety including the arrest order and confiscation of the applicant \u2019s surety . \u201d", "In the case of ORG v. the Police ( DATE ) CARDINAL C.L.R. the Supreme Court stated that :", "\u201c A violation of the rights guaranteed by LAW ... renders the proceedings void in their entirety . \u201d", "However , in the recent case of GPE and CARDINAL of DATE , ORG observed that the case - law of ORG concerning the consequences of a violation of the fair trial guarantee due to the excessive length of the proceedings was not as strict as the position adopted by ORG in its judgment in GPE v. the Police ( cited above ) and subsequent cases . It concluded that the consequences ought to be determined in accordance with the extent of the violation at issue and the possible prejudice to an accused \u2019s defence . Where a violation is demonstrated it should be taken seriously into account as a mitigating factor in sentence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
