In PERSON v. PERSON , cited above , ORG considered the case of a woman arrested for shoplifting in the vicinity of a car that appeared to be hers . She was breathalysed and tested positive for alcohol consumption . With a view to ascertaining whether she had been guilty of driving her car while under the influence of alcohol ( contrary to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) , the police served her with a section QUANTITY notice . The Procurator Fiscal sought to use her answer that she had been driving as the basis for a prosecution for driving with excess alcohol . ORG of Justiciary allowed the defendant \u2019s appeal , finding that the prosecution could not rely on evidence of the admission which she had been compelled to make .", "CARDINAL . On appeal by ORG , ORG found that the use of the admission did not infringe the requirements of LAW . Lord PERSON of GPE , giving the leading judgment , held , inter alia :", "\u201c The high incidence of death and injury on the roads caused by the misuse of motor vehicles is a very serious problem common to almost all developed societies . The need to address it in an effective way , for the benefit of the public , can not be doubted . Among other ways in which democratic societies have sought to address it is by subjecting the use of motor vehicles to a regime of regulation and making provision for enforcement by identifying , prosecuting and punishing offending drivers . Materials ... incomplete though they are , reveal different responses to the problem of enforcement . Under some legal systems ( GPE , GPE and GPE are examples ) the registered owner is presumed to be the driver guilty of minor traffic infractions unless he shows that some other person was driving at the relevant time or establishes some other ground of exoneration . There being a clear public interest in enforcement of road traffic legislation the crucial question in this case is whether section CARDINAL represents a disproportionate response , or CARDINAL that undermines a defendant \u2019s right to a fair trial , if an admission of being the driver is relied on at trial .", "I do not for my part consider that section CARDINAL , properly applied , does represent a disproportionate response to this serious social problem , nor do I think that reliance on the respondent \u2019s admission in the present case , would undermine her right to a fair trial . I reach that conclusion for a number of reasons .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides for the putting of a single , simple question . The answer can not of itself incriminate the suspect , since it is not without more an offence to drive a car . An admission of driving may , of course , as here , provide proof of a fact necessary to convict , but the section does not sanction prolonged questioning about facts alleged to give rise to criminal offences such as understandably was held to be objectionable in PERSON , and the penalty for declining to answer under the section is moderate and non - custodial . There is in the present case no suggestion of improper coercion or oppression such as might give rise to unreliable admissions and so contribute to a miscarriage of justice , and if there were evidence of such conduct the trial judge would have ample power to exclude evidence of the admission .", "CARDINAL . While ORG was entitled to distinguish ... between the giving of an answer under section CARDINAL and the provision of physical samples , and had the authority of ORG in PERSON ... for doing so , this distinction should not in my opinion be pushed too far . It is true that the respondent \u2019s answer whether given orally or in writing would create new evidence which did not exist until she spoke or wrote . In contrast , it may be acknowledged , the percentage of alcohol in her blood was a fact , existing before she blew into the breathalyser machine . But the whole purpose of requiring her to blow into the machine ( on pain of a criminal penalty if she refused ) was to obtain evidence not available until she did so and the reading so obtained could , in all save exceptional circumstances , be enough to convict a driver of an offence ... [ I]t is not easy to see why a requirement to answer a question is objectionable and a requirement to undergo a breath test is not . Yet no criticism is made of the requirement that the respondent undergo a breath test .", "CARDINAL . All who own or drive motor cars know that by doing so they subject themselves to a regulatory regime . This regime is imposed not because owning or driving cars is a privilege or indulgence granted by the ORG but because the possession and use of cars ( like , for example , shotguns ... ) are recognised to have the potential to cause grave injury . It is true that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) permits a question to be asked of \u2018 any other person\u2019 who , if not the owner or driver , might not be said to have impliedly accepted the regulatory regime , but someone who was not the owner or driver would not incriminate himself whatever answer he gave . If , viewing this situation in the round , one asks whether section CARDINAL represents a disproportionate legislative response to the problem of maintaining road safety , whether the balance between the interests of the community at large and the interests of the individual is struck in a manner unduly prejudicial to the individual , whether ( in short ) the leading of this evidence would infringe a basic human right of the respondent , I would feel bound to give negative answers . If the present argument is a good one it has been available to NORP citizens since DATE , but no one in this country has to my knowledge , criticised the legislation as unfair at any time up to now . \u201d", "The decision was adopted by the English High Court in Director of Public Prosecutions v.
