THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national born in DATE . He is represented before the ORG by Ms A.E.M. GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant is a retired senior diplomat . At the time of the events complained of he had no diplomatic status . On DATE , while in transit from GPE to GPE and travelling on CARDINAL passports ( CARDINAL ordinary , the other a diplomatic CARDINAL containing a LOC visa ) , he was arrested at GPE ( GPE ) airport after customs found a quantity of cocaine in excess of QUANTITY in his luggage . The applicant was also found to be carrying a large sum of money in cash . The cocaine had been packed in parcels secured with adhesive tape . It appears from police reports that adhesive tape with which the applicant \u2019s luggage had been secured was identical to that used for packing the cocaine . The applicant relinquished title to the cocaine and the packaging materials ( including the tape ) , and these were destroyed .", "The applicant was tried by ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE , which on DATE found him guilty of having intentionally imported cocaine and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant appealed .", "The appeal was heard by ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE on DATE . The appeal was by way of a complete rehearing , as is prescribed by GPE law .", "The applicant admitted before ORG that before leaving GPE he had packed his luggage himself and secured it with adhesive tape . He had handed it to a luggage porter who had checked it in for him . The cocaine had been put into his luggage by persons unknown to him after the luggage had been checked in . The large sum of money was intended to set up a business in GPE .", "The defence asked for the adhesive tape with which the cocaine had been packed to be examined for fingerprints , arguing that the absence of the applicant \u2019s fingerprints would prove that the applicant had not handled the cocaine . This request could not be acceded to as the tape had been destroyed after the applicant had relinquished title to it . The defence then suggested that the prosecution be declared inadmissible on this ground . The defence further stated that persons unknown to the applicant had placed the cocaine in his luggage . It was suggested that this might conceivably have been the work of the NORP secret service , and a ORG liaison officer should be detailed to make examinations in LOC .", "In its judgment , which was delivered on DATE , ORG held that it had normally to be assumed that a person who packed his own luggage was aware of its contents ; although admittedly in certain circumstances this might not be so there was nothing to suggest in the present case that such circumstances were present . As to the adhesive tape , even if the absence of the applicant \u2019s fingerprints could be established that would not affect ORG finding that the applicant must have known that his luggage contained cocaine . As to the possibility that the applicant had been framed by the NORP secret service , ORG found that the applicant \u2019s statements were \u201c merely of a general nature \u201d , had not been \u201c specified ( geconcretiseerd ) in any way \u201d and had \u201c in no way been related to his person \u201d , so that it was unnecessary to order an investigation by a ORG liaison officer . Further being of the opinion that the applicant had misused a diplomatic passport in the hope of avoiding luggage checks and that his explanation for the size of the sum of money was not substantiated , ORG went on to find him guilty of having intentionally imported cocaine and sentenced him to inter alia DATE imprisonment .", "The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) . His counsel submitted CARDINAL points of appeal .", "On DATE ORG gave judgment dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
