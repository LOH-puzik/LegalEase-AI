On an unspecified date the applicant requested the ORG management to provide a description of his state of health and the treatment received . He received no answer . On DATE the court ordered the ORG to answer immediately and the court received its answer on DATE . In it , the ORG set out its diagnosis of the applicant 's condition and found that his health was unstable and that he needed further treatment . On DATE ORG extended the applicant 's treatment until DATE on the basis of the letter from the ORG .", "CARDINAL .

The letter also noted that the applicant 's continued detention would \u201c contribute to a permanent state of psycho - emotional tension which , in turn , [ would ] cause fluctuations in arterial pressure and blood - sugar levels \u201d . The same diagnosis was noted in the medical form for the applicant 's discharge from the ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since the ORG letter did not include ORG therapy among its recommendations for treatment , the court found the schedule of ORG treatment extending until DATE to be irrelevant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied to ORG questions regarding the need to treat the applicant .

The commission established that the applicant had been given all the treatment prescribed by the ORG while in detention in the prison hospital . It further found that ORG treatment had not been required in the applicant 's case but was simply an additional treatment for diabetes and its complications . The interruption of the applicant 's ORG treatment had not affected his state of health , as proved by his stable blood - sugar levels before and after interruption .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court rejected a habeas corpus request made by the applicant , on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... the reasons for prolonging the accused 's detention pending trial remain valid because the charges against him are based on circumstances not yet examined by the court , and altering the preventive measure may hinder the establishment of the truth in the criminal trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE an appeal by the applicant against the refusal of his habeas corpus request was not examined , the court finding that no further appeal was possible . The court also rejected his request for a medical examination to establish his current state of health and the manner in which he had been treated during his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made another habeas corpus request challenging , inter alia , the persistence of any reasonable suspicion justifying his continued detention . He referred to the finding of a violation of LAW in the case of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) as a new circumstance warranting reexamination of the need to detain him . The court rejected the request , finding that it could not be submitted until DATE at least after the last such request had been examined . It also found that the judgment referred to was not a new circumstance , as it related only to Mr ORG and not to the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant 's detention pending trial was replaced with an obligation not to leave his city of residence .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the ORG indicated by facsimile to ORG an interim measure under Rule CARDINAL of ORG , stating that \u201c the applicant should not be transferred from the [ ORG ] . This interim measure will be valid until ORG will have the opportunity to examine the case , i.e. until DATE at the latest \u201d . The same message was sent several times by facsimile during the morning of DATE . On DATE , the Deputy Registrar of the Fourth Section made several calls to the telephone numbers indicated by ORG , but received no response .", "CARDINAL . On TIME DATE the applicant 's lawyer requested the trial court to stay execution of its decision of DATE and to prevent the applicant 's transfer from the ORG . He submitted a copy of the facsimile from ORG the interim measure . ORG did not hold a hearing and did not reply to his request . The applicant was finally transferred to the prison hospital on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer informed the President of ORG ( PERSON ) of the failure of Judge PERSON , President of ORG , to examine his request of DATE , and asked for urgent action in order to ensure compliance with the ORG 's directions for interim measures . On DATE the lawyer submitted a similar request to the Agent of ORG before the ORG and to ORG , noting that the prosecutor in charge of the case had supported the applicant 's request to continue being treated at the ORG .

On DATE and following ORG request , ORG ordered the applicant 's readmission to the ORG until CARDINAL DATE . The subsequent events are disputed by the parties . According to the applicant , he was brought to the ORG at TIME , but for TIME the management refused to admit him . When the applicant began to feel ill , the management admitted him after TIME . According to the Government , the applicant was admitted on DATE ORG ordered his admission and the delay resulted from the doctors ' view that the applicant did not require further treatment at the ORG . ORG personally oversaw execution of the order .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a copy of a news report broadcast on the PRO - TV television channel , which showed the events at the ORG . The reporter stated that the applicant had been kept waiting for TIME for a decision and that he had finally been admitted after TIME . The doctors informed the reporter that they had refused initially to admit the applicant because they did not have his personal medical file , and had admitted him only when the medical file was brought to them . In an interview given to the same reporter , ORG stated that the reason for the delay in admitting the applicant had been \u201c certain technical , organisational issues \u201d . This was confirmed by a statement from the deputy head of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant 's lawyer , in response to his letter of DATE , that ORG had been officially informed of ORG directions for interim measures via a facsimile from ORG on DATE at TIME Following an urgent court hearing , the trial court had ordered the applicant 's readmission to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Preventive measures may be applied by the prosecuting authority or by the court only in those cases where there are serious grounds for believing that an accused ... will abscond , obstruct the establishment of the truth during the criminal proceedings or reoffend ; alternatively , they can be applied by the court in order to ensure the enforcement of a sentence .", "CARDINAL . Detention pending trial and alternative preventive measures may be imposed only in cases concerning offences in respect of which the law provides for a custodial sentence exceeding DATE . In cases concerning offences in respect of which the law provides for a custodial sentence of DATE , they may be applied if ... the accused has already committed the acts mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In deciding on the necessity of applying preventive measures , the prosecuting authority and the court shall take into consideration the following additional criteria :", "( CARDINAL ) the nature and degree of harm caused by the offence ;", "( CARDINAL ) the character of the ... accused ;", "( CARDINAL ) his / her age and state of health ;", "( CARDINAL ) his / her occupation ;", "( CARDINAL ) his / her family status and the existence of any dependants ;", "( CARDINAL ) his / her economic status ;", "( CARDINAL ) the existence of a permanent place of abode ;", "( CARDINAL) other essential circumstances ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Requests ... shall be examined and decided upon immediately after being lodged . If the authority to which the request is addressed can not decide upon it immediately , it shall give its decision within DATE from the date of receipt . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the entry into force of the new Code of Criminal Procedure on DATE , the first - instance courts were obliged to ensure that a judge was on duty at DATE and on DATE to deal with any urgent matters . According to a certificate issued by the President of ORG , that court had put in place a duty roster of this kind .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment in PERSON ( judgment of DATE , ICJ Reports DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) ) , ORG decided that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . As regards the question whether GPE has complied with the obligation incumbent upon it as a result of LAW , the ORG observes that the Order indicated CARDINAL provisional measures , the first of which states that", "' [ GPE should take alCARDINAL measures at its disposal to ensure that PERSON is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings , and should inform ORG the measures which it has taken in implementation of this Order ' .", "The second measure required the Government of GPE to ' transmit this Order to the Governor of GPE . ... ORG had transmitted to the Governor of GPE a copy of ORG . ...", "GPE authorities have thus limited themselves to the mere transmission of the text of the Order to the Governor of GPE . This certainly met the requirement of the second of the CARDINAL measures indicated . As to the first measure , the ORG notes that it did not create an obligation of result , but that GPE was asked to ' take alCARDINAL measures at its disposal to ensure that PERSON is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings ' . The ORG agrees that due to the extremely late presentation of the request for provisional measures , there was certainly very little time for GPE authorities to act .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes , nevertheless , that the mere transmission of its Order to the Governor of GPE without any comment , particularly without even so much as a plea for a temporary stay and an explanation that there is no general agreement on the position of GPE that orders of ORG on provisional measures are non - binding , was certainly less than could have been done even in the short time available . ...", "CARDINAL . It is also noteworthy that the Governor of GPE , to whom ORG had been transmitted , decided not to give effect to it , even though ORG had recommended a stay of execution for PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG rejected a separate application by GPE for a stay of execution , ' [ g]iven the tardiness of the pleas and the jurisdictional barriers they implicate ' . Yet it would have been open to ORG , as one of its members urged , to grant a preliminary stay , which would have given it ' time to consider , after briefing from alCARDINAL interested parties , the jurisdictional and international legal issues involved . . . ' ( GPE et al . v. GPE et al . , ORG , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The review of the above steps taken by the authorities of GPE with regard to LAW DATE indicates that the various competent GPE authorities failed to take DATE the steps they could have taken to give effect to ORG . The Order did not require GPE to exercise powers it did not have : but it did impose the obligation to ' take alCARDINAL measures at its disposal to ensure that PERSON is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings ... ' . The ORG finds that GPE did not discharge this obligation .", "Under these circumstances the ORG concludes that GPE has not complied with LAW . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "34", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
