In the present case it simply constituted information capable of giving fresh impetus or a new slant to the investigation and leading to the independent gathering of lawful evidence .", "When examined at the hearing as witnesses , [ the CARDINAL non - commissioned gendarmerie officers ] stated that their informer was not CARDINAL of the defendants and that he himself had not witnessed any of the acts he described ; he had merely relayed information he said he had received in confidence from a person whose identity he refused to disclose .", "...", "In the investigators ' view , the process of drawing up an official record of information given to them by an anonymous informer did not in itself constitute any infringement of the defence rights of the persons named by the informer . All that was involved at that stage was the disclosure , with a view to its analysis and verification , of information that might be of interest to the investigation and might assist in clarifying the facts . Viewed in isolation from any objective data that might subsequently confirm it , this information did not constitute evidence of the acts allegedly carried out by the persons whose identity was mentioned by the informer .", "...", "Lastly ... it is not possible to speak of rehearing when it does not appear from the case file or the oral proceedings that [ the person described as an anonymous witness ] gave evidence under oath to an investigating judge .", "With regard to the request for cross - examination of that person , firstly , the court is unaware of his identity and , secondly , regardless of the grounds relied on by the investigating judicial authorities in that respect , it does not appear useful for establishing the truth and would delay the proceedings needlessly without giving the hope of more certain results . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

As to the argument that the appellants ' conviction had been decisively or incidentally based on the statements of an anonymous informer , ORG stated :", "\u201c In so far as they challenge the observation that ORG was unaware of the identity of the person whose examination was being requested and could therefore not order it , these grounds of appeal , being directed against an obiter dictum , are immaterial .", "On that account , they are inadmissible .", "As to the other submissions , the presence in a criminal case file of a record containing information from an unidentified source does not require the trial court to ensure that the informer is identified and examined in accordance with the procedure set forth in Articles CARDINAL bis and CARDINAL bis of LAW in order for the prosecution to be valid or admissible ; those provisions leave it open to the trial court to appoint an investigating judge to that end if such a step appears useful for establishing the truth .", "The judgments consider , on the basis of a factual assessment which this court is not empowered to overrule , that the examination requested would delay the proceedings needlessly without giving cause to hope for more certain results .", "The judgments also observe that the information obtained anonymously did not correspond to the evidence obtained lawfully and independently against the defendants .", "It does not appear from ORG reply to the appellants ' submissions that the trial courts contested their right to rebut the evidence produced at the trial .", "On that account , these grounds of appeal can not be allowed .", "As to the remaining grounds , a breach of LAW ( d ) of the LAW ... does not result from the mere fact that the trial court considered it unnecessary , or impossible , to order the cross - examination of the anonymous informer whose disclosures provided helpful guidance for the investigation .", "On that account , these grounds of appeal have no basis in law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Addressing a further ground of appeal , ORG noted :", "\u201c The appellant [ another co - defendant ] submitted that before the start of the trial , the President of ORG , acting by virtue of the powers conferred on him by LAW , had ' called a series of witnesses who , according to the criminal file , had been connected with with the matter of the anonymous witness ' ; the appellant observed that the session had , however , opened without those persons being examined and concluded that his trial had therefore not been fair within the meaning of LAW ...", "However , the investigative measures described by the appellant could also have been ordered after the start of the trial , even under a different procedure , by the President of ORG acting by virtue of his discretionary power .", "It does not appear from the evidence in the file that the appellant requested the President of ORG to order the examinations that , according to the ground of appeal , were not carried out .", "Since this ground of appeal can not be raised for the first time before this court , it is inadmissible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG includes a President and CARDINAL other judges ( assesseurs ) ; it sits with a jury . For the investigation and trial of civil actions , the court sits without a jury ( Article CARDINAL ) . Persons appearing on the list of jurors must be registered on the electoral roll , enjoy full civic and political rights , be aged at least thirty and CARDINAL and be able to read and write ( Article CARDINAL ) . Members of the jury are chosen by lot from the list of persons on the electoral roll ( Article CARDINAL ) . The procedure for compiling the list of jurors consists of several stages .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that the mayor ( bourgmestre ) is required to carry out a survey of all the voters on the preliminary list in order to determine whether they can read and write , whether they are capable of following the proceedings in ORG in the language of the region concerned , whether they are in active employment and , if so , in what capacity , whether they occupy a public office , whether they are a minister of a religion , whether they are a member of the armed forces in active service , what academic qualifications they have obtained , whether they have previously held elected office at national , provincial or municipal level , whether they are a member of CARDINAL of the committees listed in point ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , and whether there are any impediments preventing them from carrying out the duties of a juror .

NORP The prosecution is responsible for ensuring that , CARDINAL before the opening of the oral proceedings , the list of jurors is served on each accused person , and the documents relating to the survey provided for in LAW in respect of the actual jurors and the additional jurors called for service are attached to the criminal file , where they remain until the trial jury is formed ( LAW .", "CARDINAL . Before the opening of the oral proceedings in each case , on DATE appointed for that purpose , the jurors are called before ORG in the presence of ORG and the defendant , who is assisted by counsel ( Article CARDINAL ) . The president of ORG draws the names of the jurors CARDINAL by CARDINAL . First the defendant , then ORG , may challenge an equal number of jurors . Neither the defendant nor ORG may disclose their grounds for challenging a juror ( LAW . The jury is formed as soon as the names of CARDINAL jurors have been drawn by lot without being challenged . The president of the court then draws the substitute jurors by lot ( Article CARDINAL ) . The examination of the case begins immediately after the formation of the jury ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The president addresses the members of the jury , who stand , and asks them to take the following oath : \u201c You will swear and promise to examine with the most scrupulous attention the charges which will be made against ... ; not to betray either the interests of the accused or those of society which accuses him ; to communicate with no one until after your verdict ; to allow no hatred , spitefulness , fear or affection to influence your judgment ; to reach your decision in the light of the charges and the submissions in defence , according to your conscience and your innermost conviction , with the impartiality and resolution which befit a free and upright person \u201d ( Article CARDINAL ) . Each member of the jury , called on individually by the president , raises his hand and replies \u201c I so swear \u201d , on pain of nullity .", "CARDINAL . The president may order the clerk to read out the judgment by which the defendant was committed for trial . He orders the distribution to each juror of a copy of the bill of indictment and the statement of defence , if one has been filed . ORG reads out the indictment and the defendant or his counsel the statement of defence ( LAW .", "CARDINAL . A witness whose identity has been kept secret in accordance with Articles DATE bis and CARDINAL ter can not be summoned to appear in court as a witness without his consent . The president reads out the witness statement at the hearing and mentions that details of the witness 's identity have been kept secret in accordance with Articles CARDINAL bis and QUANTITY . If the witness agrees to give evidence at the trial , he retains full anonymity . In that eventuality , the president takes the necessary steps to guarantee the witness 's anonymity . The president may direct the investigating judge , either of his own motion or on an application by the prosecution or by the defendant , the civil party or their counsel , to rehear evidence from the witness or to interview a new witness in accordance with Articles CARDINAL bis and CARDINAL ter with a view to establishing the truth .

After asking the questions , the president hands them to the jury , represented by the foreman ; at the same time , he hands over the bill of indictment , the reports establishing the offence and the documents in the file other than the written witness statements .

Once the questions have been put to and handed to the members of the jury , they retire to deliberate in private . The foreman is either the first member of the jury drawn by lot or is appointed by the jury with his consent . Before the deliberations begin , the foreman reads out the following instruction , which is also displayed in large type in the most visible place in the deliberation room : \u201c The law does not ask jurors to account for how they reached their personal conviction ; it does not lay down rules on which they are to place particular reliance as to the completeness and sufficiency of evidence ; it requires them to ask themselves questions , in silence and contemplation , and to discern , in the sincerity of their conscience , what impression has been made on their rational faculties by the evidence against the defendant and the submissions of the defence . The law does not tell them : ' You will hold every fact attested by this number of witnesses to be true ' ; nor does it tell them : ' You will not regard as sufficiently established any evidence that does not derive from this report , these exhibits , this number of witnesses or this many clues ' ; it simply asks them this CARDINAL question , which encompasses the full scope of their duties : ' are you inwardly convinced ?
