During the final hearing on CARDINAL DATE the respondent reiterated her refusal to divorce .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant the divorce to the applicant . The court held that he was the only person responsible for the breakdown of his marriage because he had failed to respect the obligation of fidelity .

There was no indication that when refusing to give her consent NORP had acted out of hatred , was motivated by vengeance , or simply wanted to vex the applicant .

The court stressed that the duration of the applicant \u2019s new relationship could not by itself be considered to be a sufficient reason for granting the divorce .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment . He argued , inter alia , that the court had erred in holding that a spouse \u2019s refusal to consent to a divorce could be disregarded only when it was of an abusive nature or was dictated by hostility towards the spouse seeking the divorce . The court should have examined the negative social consequences caused by continuing the formal existence of failed marriages . In his case , it had failed to do so .", "CARDINAL .
