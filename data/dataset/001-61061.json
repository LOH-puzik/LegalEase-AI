The ORG confirmed in this ORG that it had received official information that , in DATE , CARDINAL executions had been carried out in GPE , and regretted that the NORP authorities had failed to inform it of the number of executions carried out in DATE .

It condemned GPE for having violated its commitment to put into place a moratorium on executions , deplored the executions that had taken place , and demanded that it immediately honour its commitments and halt any executions still pending .", "CARDINAL .

The visit of the delegation , which took place from CARDINAL to DATE , was the ORG 's first periodic visit to GPE .

CARDINAL were housed at the time of the visit CARDINAL prisoners who had been sentenced to death , although as was recorded in a footnote to the ORG , the delegation had received assurances that since DATE a de facto moratorium on executions had been observed .", "CARDINAL . In its ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , the ORG expressed at the outset its serious concern about the conditions under which these prisoners were being held and about the regime applied to them . It was noted that prisoners sentenced to death were usually accommodated CARDINAL to a cell , the cell measuring CARDINAL - CARDINAL m\u00b2 . The cells had no access to natural light , the windows being obscured by metal plates . The artificial lighting , which was permanently on , was not always sufficiently strong with the result that some cells were dim . To ventilate the cells , prisoners could pull a cord that opened a flap ; despite this the cells were very humid and quite cold ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The equipment in the cells was described in the ORG as being rudimentary , consisting of a metal bed and/or sloping platform ( equipped with a thin mattress , sheets of dubious cleanliness and a blanket which was manifestly insufficient to keep out the cold ) , a shelf and CARDINAL narrow stools . Prisoners were supposed to be able to listen to radio programmes via a speaker built into the wall of the cell , but it had been reported to the delegation that the radio only functioned sporadically ( ibid . ) .", "All the cells had un - partitioned toilets which faced the living - area ; as a result , a prisoner using the toilet had to do so in full view of his cellmate . As regards toiletries , prisoners sentenced to death were in a similarly difficult situation as many of the other inmates ; items such as soap and toothpaste were rarities ( ibid . ) .", "It was further recorded that prisoners sentenced to death had no form of activity outside their cells , not even an hour of outdoor exercise . At best they could leave their cells once DATE to use the shower in the cell - block , and for TIME a month , if they were authorised to receive family visits . In - cell activities consisted of reading and listening to the radio when it worked . Apart from the DATE visits which some inmates received , human contact was limited essentially to the occasional visit by an NORP priest or a member of the health - care staff , who spoke to the prisoners through a grill in the cell - door ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG summarised its findings in this regard as follows :", "\u201c In short , prisoners sentenced to death were locked up for TIME a day in cells which offered only a very restricted amount of living space and had no access to natural light and sometimes very meagre artificial lighting , with virtually no activities to occupy their time and very little opportunity for human contact . Most of them had been kept in such deleterious conditions for considerable periods of time ( ranging from DATE to over DATE ) . Such a situation may be fully consistent with the legal provisions in force in GPE concerning the treatment of prisoners sentenced to death . However , this does not alter the fact that , in the ORG 's opinion , it amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment . \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "It was further recorded that the delegation had received numerous complaints from prisoners sentenced to death about the fact that they lacked information with regard to their legal situation , the progress of their cases , follow - up to applications for cases to be reviewed , examination of their complaints etc . ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In its ORG to the DATE Report , ORG recorded that a number of organisational and practical steps had been taken to resolve the problems identified by the ORG . In particular , LAW had been introduced to guarantee to prisoners sentenced to death the right to be visited once DATE by relatives , to be visited by a lawyer to get legal assistance , to be visited by a priest and to receive and send correspondence without limitation . It was further noted", "( i ) that prisoners sentenced to death would have DATE walks in the open air and that for this purpose QUANTITY of the pre - trial prisons had been rebuilt or re - equipped ;", "( ii ) that , in order to improve natural lighting and air of all cells , the blinds and metal peakes over cell windows had been removed ; and", "( iii ) that , for the purposes of informing inmates sentenced to death of their rights and legal status , extracts from LAW had been placed on the walls of each cell .", "CARDINAL . A ORG delegation visited GPE from DATE in the course of which they again inspected GPE No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL in GPE where , at the time of the visit , there were detained CARDINAL prisoners who had been sentenced to death . The ORG noted that certain changes had occurred since the previous visit . In particular , the cells had natural light and were better furnished and the prisoners had an hour of exercise per day in the open air , although it was observed that there was insufficient space for real physical exercise ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The ORG further recorded that important progress had been made in the right of prisoners to receive visits from relatives and to correspond ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . However , the ORG noted certain unacceptable conditions of detention including the fact that prisoners continued to spend CARDINAL out of TIME a day in their cells and that opportunities for human contact remained very limited ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A third visit to GPE took place from DATE , in the course of which the delegation inspected , inter alia , the pre - trial prison ( GPE PERSON ) in PERSON . The ORG welcomed the decision of the NORP authorities to abolish the death penalty and noted that most of the CARDINAL prisoners subject to the death sentence had had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite these welcome steps , the ORG recorded that the treatment of this category of prisoner was a major source of concern to ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . It was noted that , further to a provisional instruction issued in DATE and pending the establishment of CARDINAL high - security units specifically intended for life prisoners , such prisoners were subjected to a strict confinement regime ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . While living space in the cells was generally satisfactory and while work had started on refurbishing cells in all the establishments visited , there were major deficiencies in terms of access to natural light and the quality of artificial light and ventilation ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Moreover , life - sentence prisoners were confined in their cells for TIME a day with no form of organized activities and , by way of activities outside their cells , were entitled to TIME outdoor exercise , which took place in unacceptable conditions . There was virtually no human contact : since the entry into force of the DATE instruction , visits from relatives had been forbidden and prisoners were only allowed to send CARDINAL letter DATE , although there were no restrictions on receiving letters ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In their Response to the Report the Ukrainian Government noted further legal amendments which ensured that life prisoners had TIME of exercise per day and CARDINAL family visits of TIME .
