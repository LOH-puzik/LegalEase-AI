The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . According to the prosecution , PERSON was invited to a bar on DATE by several persons , including PERSON and PERSON , her former neighbours , and the applicant , in whose apartment PERSON and PERSON rented a room .", "CARDINAL . In the bar they all consumed alcohol and then added a soporific to PERSON 's glass , after which she fell asleep . PERSON took PERSON , U. and the applicant in his car to a remote area . PERSON and the applicant took PERSON out of the car and tried to strangle her with a cord . When this failed they tied her limbs and threw her into a well , where she drowned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a police officer , reported that he was trying to locate T. , who could have information regarding PERSON 's whereabouts . Officer PERSON proposed indentifying the person(s ) offering PERSON 's apartment for sale in order to find T.", "CARDINAL . On DATE T. , CARDINAL of PERSON 's neighbours , made a written statement , giving details about PERSON 's murder as allegedly told to her by U. She named PERSON , NORP and S. as perpetrators of the crime . She also mentioned her intention to move to GPE , GPE , where her grandmother lived . On DATE officer PERSON filed a report on a conversation with T. in which he reported that ORG had stated that the applicant had also been involved in the crime . On DATE T. was interviewed by investigator PERSON and confirmed the events as described in the officer 's report . She declared that PERSON had told her about the details of the crime on DATE . She did not mention the applicant 's name or that he had participated in any manner in the crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police found the applicant at his friends ' address and told him that he owed them money . He was requested to follow them to the police station , where he was arrested . He was then informed that he , PERSON and U. were suspected of having murdered PERSON", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , immediately after his arrest he told the investigator all the details about the murder of PERSON which he had found out from PERSON , including the place where the body had been left . He had not reported the crime earlier for fear of PERSON retaliation . However , he was then ill - treated for TIME by the investigators to make him own up to the crime : he was allegedly nearly asphyxiated several times with a gas mask . He was also verbally abused and threatened with more serious forms of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of CARDINAL DATE the applicant made a self - incriminating statement in the presence of a ORG - appointed lawyer and CARDINAL witnesses . That lawyer allegedly never participated in the proceedings after the confession had been made . In his statement the applicant described the manner of PERSON 's murder and the place where her body had been left . He stated that he and PERSON had attempted to strangle PERSON with a cord , and then tied her up and threw her into a well . No mention was made of hitting PERSON or causing other injuries to her . The confession was filmed . Before the filming of the confessions , a medical expert was requested to verify the presence of any signs of ill - treatment on the applicant 's body . He found no such signs . The applicant expressly stated that he had not been ill - treated . He later declared in court that the filming of his confession had been rehearsed with the investigator , that it was a farce and that he had been warned about further ill - treatment if he were to deny his previous confessions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was offered the opportunity to sign the minutes of the interview , first before making any statements in order to confirm that he had been read his rights and then at the end of the interview to confirm what he had stated . However , he refused to sign in both places . He later explained this refusal as a last attempt to resist unlawful pressure .", "CARDINAL . The second part of the confession made on DATE involved going to the well where the victim 's body had been deposited and filming his confession there . He refused to sign this confession .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made another statement , which was essentially the same as that made DATE . He was allegedly threatened with further ill - treatment if he were to deny his earlier confessions .", "CARDINAL . A forensic report was also drawn up on DATE , concluding that PERSON had died from drowning and that her body had a number of bruises on it , caused by repeated hitting , as well as marks on her hands and legs from the cord with which she had been tied . No sign of strangulation was found on her neck . The expert established that PERSON had died \u201c DATE before the report was filed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In TIME CARDINAL DATE the applicant was allowed to call his mother and on DATE he declared , in her presence and in the presence of the investigator , that he was innocent . He also mentioned a person with whom he had been held in the same cell at the police station who could confirm that he had been returned to the cell in a poor general state after ill - treatment by the police . However , he was told by both the investigator and his lawyer that the courts would not believe such statements . He allegedly mentioned his ill - treatment and the possible testimony of his cellmate in his complaints to the courts and the prosecutors but these were not followed up . His former cellmate was apparently not questioned . In all his subsequent interviews the applicant maintained his innocence and explained that he had found out about some of the details of the murder , including the place where the body had been deposited , from PERSON , who had taken him to the well after the murder .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's new lawyer allegedly noted , on DATE , that there were no signatures on the TIME of the interview , contrary to the law . On DATE signatures appeared on the minutes and the applicant was allegedly forced to sign . He refused and the TIME intervention of his mother prevented the investigators from ill - treating him further . As a result of her intervention the investigators had to write in TIME that the applicant had refused to sign . He was allegedly prevented from writing in TIME the date of DATE as the date when he had refused to sign , contrary to LAW see below ) . On DATE the applicant complained about this fact to the prosecution , but to no avail . TIME of the interview with the applicant of DATE were signed by the investigator in charge of the case , PERSON The statement concerning the applicant 's refusal to sign the minutes was countersigned by investigator NORP , who took charge of the case at DATE .", "CARDINAL . For DATE he was allegedly detained in inhuman conditions in the cellar of the police inspectorate .", "CARDINAL . In a statement to the police , ORG 's sister mentioned GPE as a place where their relatives lived .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant of the charge of murder and convicted PERSON The court found , inter alia , that it had not been established that the applicant had participated in the crime . It had been established , however , that he had failed to report it when he was told about it by PERSON , which was a criminal offence . The court also found that the confessions made by the applicant in DATE of his detention could not be used as a basis for convicting him because they contradicted other evidence in the case ( his refusal to sign the confessions , which raised doubts about their truthfulness ; the fact that as from DATE and throughout the proceedings he had denied having killed PERSON ; and his alibi , QUANTITY persons , including PERSON , who also lived in the applicant 's apartment at the time of the events , having confirmed that he had returned home at TIME of the murder ) . The court convicted the applicant of failing to report the crime committed by PERSON , but ordered his release on the basis of an amnesty applicable to lesser crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court 's judgment . The court noted that another person , PERSON , was also suspected of having helped PERSON to murder PERSON and that his case had been disjoined because he was in hiding . The court also noted that , apart from the self - incriminating statement made by the applicant on CARDINAL and DATE , there was nothing in the file proving his involvement in the crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed those CARDINAL judgments , finding that the courts had exceeded their competence and had accepted , without giving valid reasons , the applicant 's claim that he had not participated in the crime . A re - hearing of the case was ordered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of participation in the murder of PERSON and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The court referred to the evidence in the case : witnesses testified to having seen PERSON , NORP , PERSON and the applicant with PERSON in a bar on TIME of her disappearance . Witness T. testified about the intentions of PERSON , who had spoken to her about their plan , to kill PERSON and sell her apartment . Witness ORG testified about PERSON and U. 's actions to obtain the documents necessary for the sale of PERSON 's apartment . Witness PERSON stated that she had witnessed PERSON invite PERSON to a bar on the day of her disappearance .", "CARDINAL . During a search of the applicant 's apartment some of the documents relating to the sale of LOC 's apartment had been found . The record of the search did not specify whether the documents were found in the room rented by PERSON and NORP or in another place . CARDINAL relevant document was found during a personal search of PERSON", "CARDINAL . The court referred to the applicant 's confession and the version of the prosecution , according to which the applicant and PERSON had attempted to strangle PERSON , and , having failed to do so , had thrown her into a well . The court found that the evidence , in addition to his confessions , proved his guilt . It was established that PERSON and PERSON had fraudulently obtained various documents from PERSON with the intention of selling her apartment . Moreover , PERSON had never confessed and the applicant 's confessions had been made before the authorities had known the details such as the place where the body was found and the manner of the killing . These circumstances were later confirmed when the applicant showed them that place and when the experts recovered the body in his presence . The forensic report confirmed the types of injuries inflicted as coinciding with the description of the murder given by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Besides , there had been no evidence that the applicant had been ill - treated , as proved by the medical examination carried out before his first interview . Moreover , the applicant had declared , in the presence of a lawyer , that he had not been ill - treated . The court considered that his refusal to sign the confession was a means of avoiding criminal responsibility .", "All of the above proved the applicant 's guilt .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal , the applicant declared that he had found out the details about the murder from PERSON , who had taken him to the crime scene on DATE after the murder . He claimed that he had been ill - treated by the police in order to own up to the crime . The judgment did not specify the date of the murder and there was evidence confirming that PERSON had died later than the prosecution maintained . The applicant also submitted that , before being questioned as an accused , he had told the police all the details about the murder which he had found out from PERSON This contradicted the court 's finding that the police had not had any details about the murder before the applicant 's interview as a suspect . He refused to sign both confessions but could not offer further resistance due to fear of ill - treatment . He referred to evidence in his criminal file that on TIME CARDINAL DATE his relatives had concluded a contract with a lawyer for his representation but that the investigator had refused to allow that lawyer to represent him . He was then provided with another lawyer whom he did not trust and who did not protect his rights , but was in agreement with the investigator . In addition , the presence of a medical expert and witnesses at the first interview was not a common practice and the expert had not been warned , according to the law , of his criminal responsibility for making false statements . The unusual presence of so many persons at the very first interview only confirmed that the investigator had known that the applicant 's will had been broken as a result of ill - treatment and he had agreed to \u201c confess \u201d . The investigator needed to create a very strong appearance of lack of ill - treatment which would be difficult to rebut . The court had failed to even mention the statement of PERSON , which constituted an alibi for the applicant because it confirmed that he had returned home much earlier than PERSON and U.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance court 's judgment . The court found that the guilt of PERSON and of the applicant had been fully proved by the witness statements of ORG , the police officer who reported on ORG 's statements and the results of the forensic report . The court referred to the applicant 's confession and the version of the prosecution , according to which the applicant and PERSON had attempted to strangle PERSON and after they failed to do so had thrown her into a well .", "The applicant 's withdrawal of his earlier statements was considered a means of avoiding criminal responsibility .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal in cassation the applicant reiterated his arguments made earlier and added that ORG had testified that he had been back home at TIME , as confirmed by PERSON , thus providing him with an unchallenged alibi . Witness T. did not mention his name in her statement . The illtreatment applied to him ( making him wear a gas mask and blocking the access of air until he lost consciousness from suffocation ) could not have left marks on his body . He referred to the findings of the forensic report , which contradicted his statements and the version of the prosecution , according to which he and PERSON had attempted to strangle PERSON That report did not find any marks of strangulation but found multiple injuries , which confirmed that PERSON had been hit repeatedly . The date of the murder had not been established : the residual quantity of the soporific in PERSON 's blood was small , confirming that she had taken it a long time before her death . In addition , the expert declared that she had died DATE before the report was drawn up ( on DATE ) , which excluded the date of CARDINAL DATE as the date of the murder . Another expert submitted in DATE that PERSON had died DATE before the report of DATE , which also challenged the prosecution 's version that PERSON had been murdered on DATE . The applicant drew the court 's attention to his refusal to sign the confessions , which cast doubt on their genuine character . He invoked Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE . The court found that the guilt of the accused had been fully proved . It referred to the prosecution 's version of events , according to which the applicant and PERSON had attempted to strangle PERSON It also referred to the confession made by the applicant on DATE in the presence of a lawyer , according to which he and PERSON had taken PERSON to a well and hit her repeatedly but because she had not died , they had thrown her into the well , where she drowned . The forensic report confirmed the manner of PERSON 's killing and the injuries on her body corresponded to the applicant 's statements . In addition , witnesses confirmed the accused 's intentions to sell PERSON 's apartment and the relevant documents were found in the apartment in which all the accused lived .", "CARDINAL . The court found that there was no evidence of ill - treatment , the applicant having made his confessions in the presence of his lawyer and a number of other persons .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW ( in force at the time of the events ) read as follows :", "\u201c Article CARDINAL", "... Evidence obtained in violation of the present Code or not properly examined during the court hearing can not constitute the basis of a court conviction or of other procedural documents .", "Article CARDINAL", "...
