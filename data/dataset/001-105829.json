The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in LOC .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant \u2019s husband and the second applicant \u2019s father , Mr PERSON , born in DATE , was granted a retirement pension under a regular retirement pension scheme and on the strength of premiums which he had been paying into the centralised social insurance fund . In DATE he requested ORG ( ORG ) to grant him a disability pension , together with so - called \u201c veteran status \u201d ( \u201c uprawnienia kombatanckie \u201d - see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) since from DATE he had been imprisoned , together with his parents , in a labour camp in LOC in GPE . Subsequently , Mr GPE underwent a medical examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG conferred veteran status on the applicant which entitled him to a veteran \u2019s disability pension . It found , on the basis of the results of his medical examination , that his ill - health had been caused by his deportation and imprisonment by the NORP authorities in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Apparently in DATE and DATE doubts arose as to the accuracy of certain medical examinations , on the basis of which social insurance benefits had been granted by ORG . By a letter of DATE ORG requested that ORG to review , under LAW of the LAW DATE on retirement and disability pensions ( ustawa o emeryturach i rentach z systemu ubezpiecze\u0144 spo\u0142ecznych - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the final decisions issued in CARDINAL disability pension cases . The request referred to a pending investigation in the case of a certain PERSON and other doctors who had been assessing claimants\u2019 health for the purposes of social insurance proceedings . The prosecutor submitted that it was highly likely that in those cases serious irregularities concerning the assessment of the claimants\u2019 eligibility for social insurance benefits had occurred . The list of cases attached to that request included Mr GPE \u2019s case . No allegation was ever made that the DATE decision had been obtained by Mr GPE in a fraudulent manner .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE Mr GPE was invited to undergo a fresh medical examination . After that examination ORG , by a decision of DATE , withdrew his veteran \u2019s disability pension , referring to the ORG conclusions . They found that there had been no causal link between his deportation by the NORP authorities and the health problems from which he suffered . From that date onwards his status was again covered by the regular social insurance scheme and he was entitled to an ordinary disability pension .", "He appealed against that decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . During the ensuing judicial proceedings , Mr GPE was examined on DATE by a cardiologist and on DATE by a psychiatrist . According to their opinions , he suffered from numerous serious ailments and he was completely unable to work . However , they concurred that his ailments had been caused by his age and not by his earlier deportation and imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE died . The applicants joined the proceedings as his legal successors under the provisions of domestic law which expressly allowed them to seek payment of his pension covering the period from the date of the contested decision until the plaintiff \u2019s death , and which gave them locus standi in the proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicants sought payment of Mr GPE \u2019s veteran \u2019s disability pension from DATE until his death on DATE and challenged the decision divesting him of his veteran \u2019s status and of his veteran \u2019s disability pension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed their appeal against the decision of DATE . The court had regard to the medical experts\u2019 opinions and findings . It held that in the absence of a causal link between Mr GPE \u2019s deportation in DATE and his medical condition in DATE , he did not meet the requirements for veteran \u2019s status laid down in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the PERSON of DATE on NORP and Victims of War and Post - War Persecutions ( PERSON o kombatantach oraz niekt\u00f3rych osobach b\u0119d\u0105cych ofiarami represji wojennych i okresu powojennego - the ( \u201c the DATE Law , \u201d see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . They submitted that the first - instance judgment was in breach of the applicable laws , in that the court had wrongly and illogically accepted that a medical assessment finding a causal link between the claimant \u2019s health and his or her suffering in the past , on the strength of which veteran \u2019s status and a veteran \u2019s disability pension had been granted , could later be reversed . The existence of a causal link was not something that could reasonably change over time .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , Mr GPE had considerably aged DATE and his health had seriously deteriorated throughout that time . The medical examination carried out in DATE could not therefore assess the link between the deportation and his health at the time when he applied for veteran \u2019s status , the existence of such a link being decisive for entitlement to that status to arise . The applicants argued that there was no legal basis on which to challenge the medical assessment made during the examination of PERSON GPE \u2019s original request for a veteran \u2019s pension in DATE , as this pension had been granted by way of a final decision of ORG . The contested decision of DATE had also violated the principle that acquired rights should not be taken away .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal , sharing the conclusions of the lower court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to entertain the ORG cassation appeal . On DATE the applicants requested the court to serve on them the written grounds for that refusal , to no avail .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW of Poland , which entered into force on DATE , reads :", "\u201c GPE shall be a democratic ORG ruled by law and implementing the principles of social justice . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

This status includes , for example , a lower age of retirement and various financial benefits paid in addition to the normal pension calculated in accordance with the rules of the general social insurance system . In particular , an especially favourable method for calculating periods of employment is used in respect of veterans .", "CARDINAL . At the time when the applicant was divested of his \u201c veteran status \u201d , a retired veteran was , inter alia , entitled to a \u201c veteran \u2019s benefit \u201d equal to PERCENT of the average DATE salary in the public sector ; a fare discount of PERCENT on travel by municipal transport , rail and public long - distance buses ; a special allowance covering PERCENT of such household expenses as electricity , gas and heating ; and a discount of PERCENT on motor - vehicle insurance .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of the DATE PERSON provides that its provisions also apply to persons who have been subjected to forced deportation to GPE during the Second World War and afterwards .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Law , veterans who have acquired the status of war or military invalids ( that is to say , who have been declared unfit for work and whose ailments have been caused by , inter alia , deportation in conditions provided for by LAW b ) of the DATE PERSON ) are entitled to receive benefits defined in LAW ( ustawa o zaopatrzeniu inwalid\u00f3w wojennych lub wojskowych \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) including , in particular , veteran \u2019s disability pension ( renta inwalidy wojennego ) .

In particular , the DATE PERSON provides that they are entitled to family benefit ( renta rodzinna ) . At the material time , if there were CARDINAL family members eligible for that benefit , it was to be paid to them in the amount of PERCENT of a basic amount of CARDINAL NORP z\u0142otys ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of the DATE PERSON , a person divested of veteran \u2019s status retains an entitlement to his or her pension calculated under the rules applicable to the general social insurance scheme .", "CARDINAL .

ORG , in a judgment of DATE ( II AUa CARDINAL ) , held that the provisions of the social insurance legislation , in particular section CARDINAL of the DATE Law , allowed for the reopening of proceedings terminated by a final decision awarding a benefit only where new evidence or circumstances pre - existing prior to that decision came to light after that decision had become final .", "CARDINAL . The same court , in a judgment of DATE ( III AUa CARDINAL ) , held that the legal impossibility of applying section CARDINAL in situations where benefits had been awarded , despite the eligibility conditions not having been satisfied , would have been tantamount to endorsing decisions issued in manifest breach of substantive law .", "CARDINAL . ORG held on DATE ( I GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) that in the context of social insurance proceedings the principle of res judicata operated differently than in the context of judicial decisions in civil cases , in a manner which limited its practical significance . Judicial decisions given in such proceedings established legal relationships between the insured person and the insurance system on the basis of the situation existing when such decisions were given . New developments , relevant to the question of compliance with the eligibility requirements , could justify changes in these legal relationships .", "CARDINAL .
