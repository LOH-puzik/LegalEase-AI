He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment but he was released on DATE because of his good conduct in prison .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG served on the applicant a notice of decision to make a deportation order pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE . The Secretary of ORG regarded as particularly serious those offences involving violence , sex , arson and drugs . Therefore , in view of the nature and severity of the applicant \u2019s offence , the Secretary of ORG concluded that his removal from GPE would be necessary in a NORP society for the prevention of disorder and crime and for the protection of health and morals .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to an Immigration Judge . He indicated that he had been in GPE since he was DATE and was not familiar with the culture in GPE . All of his immediate family were in GPE .

On DATE an Immigration Judge dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the deportation order . He agreed that the applicant \u2019s deportation would be conducive to the public good and that the crime he had committed was sufficiently serious to warrant deportation .

In particular , he noted that the family had managed to cope without the applicant while he was in prison . He also found that the applicant would be able to adapt to life in GPE . He relied on the fact that he was an unemployed , single man of DATE of age who , apart from having ulcerative colitis , was in good health . It was accepted that he could speak NORP . Moreover , the Immigration Judge observed that the medical evidence suggested that the applicant \u2019s attendance at hospital for treatment of his ulcerative colitis had been inconsistent and he could therefore continue to attend hospital sporadically in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made no order on his application for reconsideration . A Senior Immigration Judge noted that the applicant had been sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for his involvement in the importation of heroin and the ORG was entitled to find that this was a very serious matter and sufficiently serious of itself to warrant deportation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his application for reconsideration of the Immigration Judge \u2019s decision as it did not disclose any arguable error of law and an appeal would have no real prospect of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative wrote to ORG , indicating that the applicant had been receiving death threats from CARDINAL of his co - defendants in the drugs offence . The co - defendant was believed to be living in GPE . The applicant therefore submitted that if returned there was a real risk that his life would be in danger . He further submitted that in view of his mother \u2019s ill health , if he were deported then in all likelihood he would not see her again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG advised the applicant that he would not consider the new representations as a fresh claim for asylum .

Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW DATE ( as amended by ORG ) provides that a person who is not a NORP citizen shall be liable to deportation from GPE if the Secretary of ORG for ORG deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE provide for a right of appeal against this decision on the grounds , inter alia , that the decision is incompatible with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that , in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right , courts and tribunals must take into account any case - law from this ORG so far as , in the opinion of the court or tribunal , it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen .", "CARDINAL . The Rules relating to the revocation of a deportation order are contained in CARDINAL of ORG CARDINAL ( as amended ) , supplemented by LAW ( \u201c IDIs \u201d ) . There is no specific period after which revocation will be appropriate although ORG to LAW of the IDIs gives broad guidelines on the length of time deportation orders should remain in force after removal . Cases which will normally be appropriate for revocation DATE after deportation include those of overstayers and persons who failed to observe a condition attached to their leave , persons who obtained leave by deception , and family members deported under LAW ) of LAW DATE . With regard to criminal conviction cases , the normal course of action will be to grant an application for revocation where the decision to deport was founded on a criminal conviction which is now \u201c spent \u201d under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act DATE . Paragraph CARDINAL of the Rules , however , indicates that in the case of an applicant with a serious criminal record continued exclusion for a long term of years will normally be the proper course .
