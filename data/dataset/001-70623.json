SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP insurance company . It was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in Eksj\u00f6 . The respondent Government were represented by Ms A. ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "ORG missionsf\u00f6rsamling , a religious congregation , had taken out a fire insurance policy with the applicant company for a piece of property it owned . On DATE PERSON commenced work development training ( ALU - utbildning ) at the congregation . On DATE he set fire to the house on the property which burnt down completely . PERSON was later convicted of arson .", "The applicant company paid an indemnity to the congregation of CARDINAL million Swedish kronor ( SEK ) and later claimed compensation from ORG ; hereinafter \u201c the LOC \u201d ) , relying on the Ordinance on Compensation from Public Funds for Damage Caused by Participants in FAC or ORG ( F\u00f6rordningen om ers\u00e4ttning av allm\u00e4nna medel f\u00f6r skada orsakad av deltagare i viss arbetsmarknads - utbildning eller yrkesinriktad rehabilitering m.m . , CARDINAL ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "By a decision of DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . It found that no right of recourse for the indemnity paid could be derived from the provisions of the DATE Ordinance .", "The applicant company appealed to the Government , maintaining that LAW ( Lagen om f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsavtal ; CARDINAL ) and the terms of the insurance policy in question entitled it to succeed to any right of compensation of the policy - holder in relation to the perpetrator or anyone else liable to damages .", "In an opinion to the Government , the Chancellor of Justice ( Justitie - kanslern ) stated that predominant reasons spoke in favour of there not being any right of the applicant to compensation from the ORG under LAW of LAW or the DATE Ordinance .", "On DATE the Government upheld the decision of the ORG . It stated that the DATE Ordinance regulated the ORG \u2019s undertaking to assume responsibility , under certain conditions , for damage caused to the provider of vocational training by participants in such training . The Ordinance did not , however , regulate the general legal liability to pay compensation for damage that occurred . LAW was not therefore applicable in relation to the ORG \u2019s undertaking under the Ordinance . Moreover , there was no other basis for granting the applicant company \u2019s compensation claim .", "The applicant company then instituted proceedings for damages against the ORG before ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . It claimed that the ORG was liable for any damage caused by a participant in vocational training , either CARDINAL ) pursuant to the provisions on compensation of the DATE Ordinance , CARDINAL ) according to a contractual responsibility deriving from the LAW and the placement of participants in vocational training , or CARDINAL ) on the basis of a responsibility as employer ( principalansvar ) allegedly assumed by the ORG . The congregation had transferred its right to compensation to the applicant , according to the terms of the insurance policy .", "The ORG maintained , inter alia , that the DATE Ordinance was of a public - law character and that , in the absence of express rules on the transfer of claims , a right of compensation could thus not be transferred until the compensation was available for disbursement . Further , the applicant company could not , on the basis of the insurance policy , claim any right of recourse from the ORG for the indemnity paid but only from the perpetrator of the act causing the damage . Moreover , a participant in vocational training not being comparable to an employee , there was no employer \u2019s responsibility .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s claims . The court considered that the right of compensation under the DATE Ordinance rested with the injured party \u2013 in this case the congregation DATE and that it could not be transferred until the compensation amount had been fixed and was available for disbursement . In so finding , the court had regard to the procedure for claiming compensation under the GPE , which prescribed that a public authority , upon application by the employer , determined in an administrative decision whether the conditions laid down in the GPE were fulfilled .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) . On DATE the appellate court quashed ORG judgment in so far as it had determined the applicant company \u2019s first CARDINAL grounds and rejected the applicant \u2019s claim based on the third ground .", "The appellate court considered that the ORG , under the DATE Ordinance , had assumed a certain economic responsibility for damage caused by participants in vocational training for which they would normally be liable themselves under general tort liability principles . This responsibility was , however , normally limited to FAC for damage to property under section CARDINAL of the Ordinance . Noting further that the GPE prescribed that compensation claims were to be examined by the LAW and , upon appeal , by the Government , the court concluded that that examination involved a comprehensive and final determination of the claims . Consequently , ORG had had no jurisdiction to examine the applicant company \u2019s claims in so far as they were based on the Ordinance . It made no difference that the applicant had added a contractual element to its second ground . The first CARDINAL grounds for the applicant \u2019s claim were therefore dismissed without an examination on the merits .", "As regards the applicant company \u2019s third alternative ground , ORG found that there was no basis for finding that the ORG had assumed an employer \u2019s responsibility under LAW ( PERSON , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) or any other similar responsibility . In so far as the claim was based on this ground , it was accordingly rejected .", "On DATE ORG ( H\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the applicant company leave to appeal .", "The DATE Ordinance sets out the ORG \u2019s liability for damages caused by persons in vocational training who receive benefits whilst undergoing training with a private employer . The relevant provisions , as they stood at the material time , read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL :", "\u201c Compensation is given out of public funds in accordance with the provisions of this GPE to employers and other providers of rehabilitation or vocational training outside the regular school system for damage caused by a person who", "CARDINAL . NORP participates in vocational training and receives an education allowance ,", "... \u201d", "Section CARDINAL :", "\u201c Compensation is awarded for personal injury or damage to property inflicted on the employer , whether or not the person causing the damage is liable for it . The same rule applies in relation to pure economic loss inflicted on the employer by way of a criminal offence . ... \u201d", "Section CARDINAL :", "\u201c Unless otherwise prescribed in subsection CARDINAL , compensation of MONEY for personal injury , MONEY for damage to property and QUANTITY for pure economic loss caused by crime is awarded for CARDINAL and the same incident to every injured party .", "Upon the Government \u2019s approval , an agreement allowing for the award of compensation for personal injury , damage to property and pure economic loss with higher amounts than those laid down in subsection CARDINAL may be concluded . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL :", "\u201c If the compensation does not exceed SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . ORG decides on compensation for damage caused by a person referred to in LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ...", "...", "If the authority finds that compensation should be awarded in a higher amount than that mentioned in subsection CARDINAL or if the matter involves questions of principle , it shall refer the matter , together with its opinion and the necessary investigation , to the Government for decision . \u201d", "According to LAW ORG ( F\u00f6rordningen om arbetslivsutveckling , CARDINAL ) , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Ordinance was applicable to a person undergoing work development training .", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW regulates an insurer \u2019s right of recourse . Subsection CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c If an insurer , as compensation for damage pursuant to a liability insurance policy , has paid an amount of money which the policy - holder had the right to claim as damages from another person , the insurer succeeds to the right against that other person , if the latter has caused the damage with intent or gross negligence or is under a statutory obligation to pay damages whether or not he has caused the damage . However , such a right of recourse does not apply against someone who , CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL or CARDINAL of LAW , is responsible for the damage solely on account of another person \u2019s actions .", "LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW provide that private employers as well as ORG and local authorities are liable for personal injuries , damage to property and pure economic loss caused in the course of their activities .", "According to the preparatory works of LAW Government PERSON , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , the right of recourse in LAW should be restricted and only apply in relation to someone who is liable to pay damages on account of culpable fault or strict liability . Any extension of the right of recourse should be prevented .", "The Government have decided on a few applications from insurance companies which have claimed compensation under the DATE Ordinance on the plea of the right of recourse . In decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the ORG rejected CARDINAL such applications where the companies had paid indemnities due to damage to property , the first one on the ground that the insurance company had no right to compensation under the Ordinance and the second one on the ground that the application was unfounded . However , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the Government granted compensation of MONEY to an insurance company which had paid an indemnity of that amount for personal injury sustained by a person in vocational rehabilitation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
