On DATE GPE and GPE agreed that pending the outcome of an expert report custody be provisionally transferred to PERSON ( vorl\u00e4ufige Obsorge ) and that for the time being NORP should live with PERSON , his father .", "CARDINAL . It appears that subsequently PERSON hindered contact between NORP and GPE and , in DATE , moved to GPE . Thereupon , by an interlocutory decision ( einstweilige GPE ) of DATE , custody of NORP was transferred back to GPE", "CARDINAL . PERSON was ordered to hand NORP over to GPE immediately or to take him back to GPE before DATE . That order was confirmed on appeal on DATE and became final .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon GPE travelled to GPE to have that decision enforced . PERSON proposed to GPE that they enter into an agreement on custody of NORP , and GPE also agreed to staying in GPE . However , no such agreement was finally reached . After GPE had settled in GPE and found employment there , PERSON , together with NORP , left GPE for GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pending the outcome of the custody proceedings , custody was temporarily transferred to ORG . On DATE the court dismissed PERSON \u2019s request for custody to be withdrawn from GPE and transferred to him . The decision was declared immediately enforceable .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , various attempts to enforce that decision were undertaken . The NORP newspapers reported on these events because PERSON kept them regularly informed and sought publicity .", "CARDINAL . The first attempt at enforcement , on DATE , failed because GPE and NORP went into hiding . PERSON had informed the media of this step in advance . Some time later they returned . In order to enforce the custody decision the competent court scheduled a hearing for DATE in the course of which NORP was to be handed over to GPE PERSON failed to appear at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon the judge ordered that NORP be brought before the court by force ( zwangsweise GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . When that decision had to be enforced by court officers NORP barricaded himself in his elementary school and , since the police officers who intervened decided not to use physical force on the LOC of the school , this attempt also failed . These events were also widely covered by the media because PERSON had informed them in advance .", "CARDINAL . After further unsuccessful attempts the rural police ( ORG ) were informed on DATE that NORP was at his father \u2019s house . Court officers sent to the house noted , however , that NORP was not in the house but , together with a babysitter , in a car in front of it . The officers tried to take hold of NORP but he cried and resisted . These scenes were again the subject of widespread media coverage because they were observed and photographed by several journalists , who had been informed and had hurried to the spot .", "CARDINAL . In order to establish whether NORP had suffered injuries during the attempt to enforce the court order , PERSON took him to the GPE hospital . On DATE , by means of a diversion manoeuvre , GPE and NORP were separated and on DATE NORP was handed over to his mother , GPE , on the premises of the hospital . GPE and NORP have been living in GPE since that time . This final phase of the events was also widely reported on in the media .", "CARDINAL .

He argued that the reporting on him had interfered with his strictly private life in a manner likely to expose and compromise him in public . Moreover , the articles constituted a breach of section ORG of LAW , which prohibited reporting on the victim of a crime in a manner which made him or her recognisable in public ; that was only allowed if the importance of the offence or the persons implicated meant that there was a preponderant public interest in the information . Both applications were lodged with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a detailed judgment in the case , which referred to the following articles published in the applicant company \u2019s newspaper and summed up by ORG as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) DATE", "The heading \u2018 Missing father returns home with his CARDINAL boys\u2019 , with a picture of NORP .

ORG allowed the action and ordered the applicant company to pay damages in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , to publish the judgment in its newspaper , and to bear the costs of the proceedings . ORG found that by publishing the above articles containing details of the custody dispute over DATE PERSON , and , moreover , disclosing his full name and accompanied by a photograph of him partly showing a highly distressed facial expression , the applicant company had exposed his strictly private life in a manner likely to compromise him in public , in breach of section CARDINAL of LAW . Moreover , the articles published on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE had , without justification , disclosed the identity of a person who had been the victim of a criminal offence to a large and not directly informed circle of people , in breach of section ORG of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG accepted that there existed a direct link between the events reported on and the public interest because of the sharp criticism voiced of the conduct of the court officials who had attempted to enforce the custody order . However , the person with custody of NORP had not agreed to publication and the public interest in the events could have been satisfied without giving the child \u2019s full name and publishing pictures of him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed . Relying on LAW , it argued , inter alia , that ORG had failed to take into account the fact that there had already been an ongoing debate and that NORP \u2019s father , acting as his son \u2019s spokesman and in his interests , had informed the media of the events . Furthermore , it claimed that it had only acted as a public watchdog , informing the public about the proceedings and criticising the domestic authorities in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly allowed the appeal . It found that there had been no breach of section ORG of LAW , because under that provision a compensation claim existed only if a media outlet had described acts by which someone had become the victim of a crime and if the description violated the victim \u2019s protected interests . In the present case , however , it was not the description of a criminal act that had breached NORP \u2019s protected interests , since the proceedings against the court officials had ended without a conviction . ORG therefore remitted the case to ORG on this point .", "CARDINAL . It further emphasised that by giving details of the plaintiff \u2019s intimate family life and his full name , and by adding pictures of him , the newspaper had intruded into his strictly private life , as these details had merely been given in order to create a sensation and satisfy the curiosity of its readers . Even if there was a link to public life , a media outlet could report on a person \u2019s strictly private life only to the extent necessary to satisfy the need for information related to those elements which were of relevance to the public interest . Reporting on events relating to a person \u2019s strictly private life therefore had to be appropriate to the circumstances and proportionate . In the present case it had not been necessary for the purpose of informing the public of alleged shortcomings within the judiciary , nor had it been necessary to expose in such an intense and striking manner the severe strain being suffered by the juvenile plaintiff by inserting photographs showing his distress and despair , mentioning his full name and setting out the details of his seizure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled again on the case and found no breach of section ORG of LAW . It accordingly reduced the amount of compensation to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that decision .", "CARDINAL .
