ORG The applicant company is a private - law radio and television broadcasting corporation based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it applied for authorisation to enter ORG ( GPE of GPE ) in order to film a sort of portrait ( \u201c eine PERSON \u201d ) of GPE , a female prisoner serving a sentence for murder . The idea was to broadcast the film of the interview in the \u201c LOC programme , in a feature about the trial of another person accused in the same murder case . It argued that the interview with A. , who had consented to it , was a subject of public interest given that , even after her conviction , her case continued to attract a great deal of media attention . \u201c QUANTITY is a DATE NORP television programme covering political and economic questions . Created in DATE , it is one of the longest - running programmes on NORP television , and is currently aired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the prison refused to authorise the filming , for reasons of peace , order and security in the prison , and equal treatment of prisoners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged an appeal against that decision , explaining that the intention was \u201c to film general shots of A. inside the prison and an interview with her \u201d ( \u201c allgemeine Aufnahmen der Insassin i m Gef\u00e4ngnis sowie FAC ihr \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company challenged that decision . It argued that there was no danger of disturbing peace and order or threatening security in the prison as it had no intention of filming the technical installations on the site or inside the different buildings . Nor was the presence of a single cameraman and a female journalist likely to disturb the smooth functioning of the establishment or represent a security risk , especially as the filming should not last CARDINAL or three hours and could take place at a time when the other prisoners were working . In any event the precise practical arrangements for the filming had yet to be finalised .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG of the Canton of Bern rejected the appeal . Like the lower court , without denying the considerable media interest generated by A. \u2019s case in GPE , it rejected the appeal on the basis of section CARDINAL of the order relating to LAW and section DATE of the law of the GPE of GPE on the execution of penalties and measures ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It indicated that LAW of LAW ( paragraph CARDINAL below ) authorised access only to generally accessible sources . It considered that while representatives of the media were ordinarily allowed to visit prisons , the organisational and supervisory effort required for a television film crew was well beyond what might reasonably be expected of the prison authorities . It also considered that there was nothing to stop the applicant company from broadcasting a programme about A. \u2019s case using just an audio recording or a simple interview . It reasoned that for the purposes of a news programme on this particular theme ( \u201c Sachinformation \u201d ) , pictures of the prisoner were not necessary .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company lodged a public - law appeal and an administrative - law appeal with ORG , for violation of its freedom of expression and information . It submitted that there was considerable public interest in the murder trial in GPE . Considering that the use of modern , light equipment would have limited any disruption of the smooth functioning of the prison , it argued that the court below had given insufficient reasons for the technical and security grounds on which its request to film in the prison had been refused . The filming could have taken place in the room set aside for prison visits , which could have been closed to the other prisoners . It also alleged that the principle of equal treatment had been breached , in so far as it had been placed at a disadvantage compared with other media .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the administrative - law appeal . It accepted that prison visits were important because contact with their families helped detainees to prepare and facilitate their social rehabilitation , but that did not give rise to any entitlement to film inside a prison .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , served on the applicant company on DATE , ORG also rejected the public - law appeal . It upheld the decision of the lower court according to which LAW of LAW guaranteed access only to information that was generally accessible . It considered that the same must apply to LAW . It added that giving the applicant company access to the prison might infringe the other ORG personality rights . As to the applicant company \u2019s argument that giving some media access to the prison but not television crews amounted to discriminatory treatment , it held that the principle of equal treatment did not apply to the present case , as television productions bore no comparison with audio recordings or simple interviews .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the ORG \u2019s observations that when PERSON , who has always protested her innocence , was convicted it caused quite a public stir . The \u201c ORG \u201d organisation , for example , which takes various kinds of action in connection with alleged miscarriages of justice , allegedly made threats against the federal judges in charge of the case , which exceptionally led to their replacement for the revision proceedings initiated by NORP The leader of the movement even staged a DATE hunger strike for A. He apparently spent whole DATE outside ORG and allegedly took sympathisers along with him to the home of a federal judge , outside which he camped all night in a deckchair .", "CARDINAL .
