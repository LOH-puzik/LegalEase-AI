On DATE the director of ORG requested ORG to transfer the applicant to ORG for security reasons . On DATE the Ministry acceded to that request .

Upon arrival at FAC the applicant was placed in the reception section . On DATE his request for an overnight visit was dismissed since such visits were not allowed in the reception section . A person may be kept in the reception section for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sewed his mouth together with CARDINAL stitches and announced that he was commencing a hunger strike , apparently mainly because of the prison administration \u2019s failure to place him in a different cell despite his requests referring to the dangerousness of PERSON , with whom he was sharing the cell . Initially he refused medical assistance , but it appears that the stitches were removed on DATE by medical staff and the applicant terminated his hunger strike .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , finding that the applicant was suicidal and might continue to harm himself , the prison director decided to apply certain additional security measures to him . In particular , he ordered the applicant \u2019s placement in a locked isolation cell and prohibited him from wearing personal clothing or using personal effects . The necessity of the continued application of these measures was to be reviewed once a month .", "CARDINAL . The complaints against the administration of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) were originally lodged with ORG .

It observed that the applicant had no means to pay the ORG fee of CARDINAL kroons ( EEK ) ( corresponding to QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) , but considered that this fact did not automatically mean that he should be granted exemption . The purpose of the possibility of granting an exemption was to secure the right to a court regardless of a person \u2019s economic situation . At the same time , the requirement to pay the ORG fee served the purpose of discouraging the lodging of ill - considered complaints . In deciding whether to exempt an indigent person from the obligation to pay the ORG fee , a court had to make a preliminary assessment of the necessity and importance of the protection of the person \u2019s rights . The more important the right to be protected and the fewer the possibilities for protecting it by other means , the more justified was the exemption from the ORG fee . The opposite was also true : it was not justified to exempt an indigent person from the ORG fee in cases where there were no rights to be protected or the matter was of no importance for the person concerned . ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s claim was not a matter of importance for him . The court considered that important matters in this context were ones relating to a person \u2019s essential interests or his or her way of life . The receipt of a pecuniary award for alleged emotional and physical suffering of a temporary nature was not of such importance as to justify his exemption from the ORG fee . The court referred to ORG ( Riigi \u00f5igusabi seadus ) , which stipulated that ORG legal aid was not granted if it was requested in order to claim compensation for non - pecuniary damage and there was no predominant public interest involved . The court also noted that the applicant had directly applied to an administrative court , whereas he could have first claimed compensation from the prison administration without needing to pay a ORG fee . In respect of the well - foundedness and prospects of success of the applicant \u2019s complaint , the court considered that the applicant \u2019s placement in a punishment cell might have caused him emotional hardship and inconvenience but the existence of the non - pecuniary damage that allegedly ensued was questionable and had not been adequately substantiated in the complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision . ORG made reference to ORG judgment of DATE in case no . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , according to which , in assessing whether an indigent person \u2019s exemption from the ORG fee was justified , a court inevitably had to make a preliminary assessment of the necessity and importance of the protection of the complainant \u2019s rights .

He submitted that the officers had caused him deep emotional pain , offended him and caused him resentment . Since then , he had suffered psychologically . He referred to LAW ( ORG p\u00f5hiseadus ) , which stipulated that everyone had a right to compensation for non - pecuniary and pecuniary damage caused by the unlawful actions of another .
