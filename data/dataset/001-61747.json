At the time of the introduction of his application , the applicant was serving a prison sentence in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On or around DATE suspicions arose that the applicant , who at that time was serving a prison sentence in the LOC penitentiary in GPE , had been involved in giving a false tip - off by telephone to the GPE police to the effect that CARDINAL named detainees were planning to escape from prison by taking hostages . Thereafter , and in order to secure order , peace and safety in the penitentiary , the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations were tapped and recorded on tape . These taped conversations were kept so as to allow the authorities to establish \u2013 if such a situation were to arise again \u2013 whether the applicant had been involved in giving any further false telephone tip - offs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as a result of the detonation of an explosive device placed in her car , PERSON \u2013 the applicant \u2019s former partner \u2013 suffered slight injuries . Her son , Mr Y , suffered serious injuries necessitating the amputation of the lower part of his left leg .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the explosion , the applicant was still in prison . As it was suspected that he was involved in the bomb attack , the national public prosecutor ( landelijk officier van justitie ) ordered that the applicant \u2019s recorded telephone conversations be made available to the criminal investigation into the bomb attack .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was summoned to appear before ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) to stand trial on charges of , inter alia , ( attempted ) premeditated grievous bodily harm , causing an explosion endangering property and life , making a threat to kill and various counts of fraud .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of making a threat to kill and CARDINAL count of fraud , acquitted him on the remaining charges and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . Both the applicant and the public prosecutor filed an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , following hearings held on CARDINAL May and DATE , ORG quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , convicted the applicant of complicity in ( attempted ) premeditated grievous bodily harm , causing an explosion endangering property and life , and making a threat to kill or , in any event , to inflict grievous bodily harm . He was also convicted of several counts of fraud . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . As regards the determination of the applicant \u2019s sentence , ORG held , inter alia , that the applicant , over a period of DATE , had continuously threatened PERSON by telephone and had eventually carried out his threats by organising DATE from his place of detention DATE the placing of a bomb under her car . The detonation of this bomb had caused injuries to Ms X and Mr Y , necessitating the amputation of the lower part of the latter \u2019s leg . The court noted that it was only as a result of the administration of rapid and adequate first aid that Mr Y had not bled to death . In addition , the explosion had caused collateral damage to another car as well as to windows of nearby houses and there had been a real danger that the explosion could also have ( fatally ) injured bystanders . The court further noted that the applicant had already been convicted in the past of having deliberately shot PERSON in the leg .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal based the applicant \u2019s conviction on , inter alia , statements given by the applicant , a co - detainee , Mr Y , PERSON and her neighbours , several telephone conversations between the applicant and Ms X that had been tape - recorded by the latter , and one of the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations that had been tapped and recorded prior to QUANTITY October DATE by the authorities of the penitentiary where the applicant was detained , namely a conversation between the applicant and his sister in which he warned his sister never to approach or get into PERSON car .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the defence \u2019s argument that the telephone conversations which had been tapped and recorded by the prison authorities before DATE should be disregarded as unlawfully obtained evidence . Noting the reasons for which the prison authorities had decided to tap and record the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations , the court held that the impugned measures served a lawful purpose , namely the preservation of order , peace and security within the penitentiary . Furthermore , the measures also complied with the requirements of proportionality . It further held that , although the internal penitentiary regulations prescribed the immediate erasure of recorded telephone conversations , a reasonable interpretation of the applicable rules in relation to the aims pursued implied that the recorded conversations could be kept , since there were concrete indications of an ongoing escape plan . When fresh suspicion arose that the applicant was involved in another criminal offence , the information lawfully obtained on the basis of internal prison rules could be made available to the police for the purposes of the criminal investigation into that offence . ORG referred in this connection to the general obligation contained in LAW ) to report , inter alia , criminal offences involving a danger to life , and to the very serious nature of the offence at issue .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal in cassation was rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint that his telephone conversations had been unlawfully tapped , recorded and kept by the penitentiary authorities , ORG held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The complaint has to be considered in the following framework of legal rules . LAW ( PERSON ) ... Article CARDINAL [ of the Convention ] ... Article PERSON of the ... applicable [ DATE ] Prison Rules ( PERSON ) ... Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the [ DATE ] Prison Rules ... [ the ] circular no . CARDINAL of the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) of DATE ... [ and ] an internal regulation issued by the Governor of the LOC penitentiary under LAW [ DATE ] Prison Act ( Beginselenwet Gevangeniswezen ) ...", "CARDINAL . Under the heading \u2018 The lawfulness of the evidence obtained\u2019 ... ORG found that the recording of the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations conducted in the LOC penitentiary served a lawful purpose , namely maintaining order , peace and security in the penitentiary , and further complied with the requirements of proportionality . This finding does not reveal any incorrect interpretation of the law . In the first place , this finding recognises that the recording can be justified in view of the aims set out in LAW of [ LAW ] , in particular the prevention of disorder . In the second place , it recognises that ORG has also examined whether in a democratic society the interference at issue with the right set out in LAW of [ the LAW ] was necessary for attaining the stated aim . In so far as that finding further established that the tape recording pursued this aim and that the interference was also necessary , these matters are factual and are readily understandable .", "CARDINAL . NORP This recording is further provided for by law as required by LAW of [ LAW ] . Indeed , the system of legal rules set out under CARDINAL complies with the requirements of accessibility and foreseeability . The system comprises regulations of which the most important features have been published in generally accessible sources or have been deposited in places accessible to detainees . They provide a sufficiently clear indication to detainees about the fact that telephone conversations can be tapped and recorded and the reasons for this .", "CARDINAL . NORP The above considerations lead to the conclusion that the finding of ORG as to the lawfulness of the tape recording can be upheld . Questions still remain about the finding of ORG as regards the keeping of the recordings and the failure to erase them immediately , the ... making available to the criminal investigation authorities of these tape recordings , ... their being listened to by the latter for the purposes of the investigation into ... [ the car bomb attack ] and the subsequent use in evidence of a document containing a transcript of CARDINAL of the recorded telephone conversations ( evidence item CARDINAL ) . It must first be noted that the cassation complaint apparently only seeks to challenge the finding of ORG as to the use in evidence of the formal record ( proces - verbaal ) containing the transcript of a telephone conversation between the [ applicant ] and his sister ( evidence item CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The internal regulation set out under CARDINAL provides that tape recordings are not to be kept and will be immediately erased . Against the background of a reasonable interpretation , it is difficult to explain that provision otherwise than to mean that the tape recordings must no longer be kept and the tapes must be erased as soon as the danger giving rise to the recording has ceased to exist . Under the heading \u2018 The lawfulness of the evidence PERSON ... ORG found that the telephone conversation used in evidence had been recorded , inter alia , after suspicions had arisen that the [ applicant ] was involved in giving a false telephone tip - off about an intended hostage - taking and that this tape recording had been kept in order to be able to establish \u2013 if such a situation were to arise \u2013 whether the [ applicant ] was again involved in giving false telephone tip - offs affecting the order , peace and security of the penitentiary . It follows from this that , according to ORG and quite apart from the existence of any concrete indication about an escape plan ... \u2013 the keeping of and failure to erase the recordings occurred against the background of the danger which gave rise to the decision to tap the conversations . ORG thus found that there was no violation of the relevant internal regulation . Without stating further reasons , this finding can be readily understood .", "CARDINAL . Taking into account the above considerations , the handing over of the tapes to the national public prosecutor for the purpose of the criminal investigation was not unlawful . Suspicions against the [ applicant ] had arisen that from his place of detention he was involved in a bomb attack . When this official had become aware of the existence of those tapes , it was not unlawful to hand them over , bearing in mind the provisions of LAW and the fact that , failing a voluntary surrender [ of the tapes ] , the judicial authorities could have had recourse to seizure ( inbeslagname ) .", "CARDINAL .
