THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG , is a citizen of GPE who was born in DATE and lives in the GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Ms J.A. Younge , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE , the applicant married her cousin PERSON The couple remained childless . In DATE , the applicant and her husband fled from GPE to the GPE where they applied for asylum on the basis of the husband \u2019s alleged problems with the ORG . On DATE , an immigration official held a first interview ( eerste gehoor ) with the applicant in connection with her asylum request . A further interview ( nader gehoor ) was held on DATE . The applicant , who had been assisted by an interpreter during both interviews , availed herself on DATE and DATE of the opportunity to submit written comments on the records that had been drawn up of these interviews . As from an unspecified date , the applicant \u2019s husband started to receive medical treatment for a posttraumatic stress disorder .", "In DATE , the applicant gave birth to a child , whose physical features ( complexion and hair ) were alleged to be markedly different to those of the applicant and her husband .", "On DATE , in view of the changed situation in GPE , an additional interview ( aanvullend gehoor ) was held with the applicant who was assisted by an interpreter . On DATE , the applicant submitted written comments on the record drawn up of this additional interview .", "On DATE , the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) notified the applicant of her intention ( voornemen ) to reject the applicant \u2019s asylum request . The applicant submitted her views ( zienswijze ) on this intention on DATE .", "On DATE , the Minister for ORG rejected the asylum request filed by the applicant and her husband . On DATE , the applicant and her husband filed an appeal against this decision with ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE .", "On DATE , a staff member of a GPE refugee aid organisation informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer by way of a written memorandum that , in a recent conversation with this staff member , the applicant had said that her husband was not the father of her child and that he did not know this . Fearing to be sent back to GPE where she risked to be killed if this became known \u2013 which was probable \u2013 , she had now decided to confess to it . She had not dared to tell her husband , but because the situation had become untenable she was planning to do so on DATE when she and her husband would have a meeting with a mental health care counsellor . This document does not contain any mention of the child \u2019s physical features .", "By letter of DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer transmitted the written memorandum of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , submitting that also for this reason the applicant risked exposure to treatment contrary to LAW if expelled to GPE . The lawyer \u2019s submissions were transmitted to the Minister who filed written comments in reply with ORG on DATE .", "On DATE , a hearing on the appeals filed by the applicant and her husband was held before ORG . This hearing was attended by the applicant and her husband , who were assisted by an interpreter .", "On DATE , in the presence and under the guidance of a mental health counsellor , the applicant informed her husband of the origins of the child . According to the applicant , her husband was obviously very upset but he refused to give any reaction . During DATE , he was under heavy medication ( sleeping medication and tranquillizers ) , and did not speak with or touch the applicant . He further completely neglected the child since DATE whereas before that date he had given the impression of simply not knowing what to do with a child in general in that he did not touch or mind the child very much .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the appeals filed by the applicant and her husband . As regards the applicant \u2019s submissions in relation to her child , ORG held that these personal circumstances which had only been raised for the first time in the proceedings on appeal could not be regarded as new facts and circumstances having arisen after the taking of the impugned decision and which should be taken into account under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) , in that the applicant should have raised these circumstances at an earlier stage in the proceedings . It further held that it had not been argued and that it had not appeared that there were special circumstances on the basis of which this could not have been done earlier .", "On DATE , the applicant and her husband filed an appeal with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) . In these appeal proceedings , the applicant submitted that the child had been born after a fleeting sexual encounter she had had in the asylum seekers reception centre where she and her husband had stayed shortly after their arrival in the GPE , and that , as the child grew older , gradually more and more clearly different racial characteristics became noticeable , as a result of which the child obviously bore no resemblance to either the applicant or her husband .", "The appeal filed by the applicant and her husband was dismissed by ORG on DATE . It upheld ORG judgment . As regards the applicant \u2019s submissions relating to her child , it held :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , the court shall , in the determination of the appeal , take into account facts and circumstances having arisen after the taking of the impugned decision .", "ORG . As ORG has held previously ( ruling of DATE in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; JV CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , this provision is aimed at preventing that repeated requests [ for a residence title ] must be filed in case of relevant circumstances having emerged after the [ taking of the ] impugned decision but before the ruling [ on appeal ] and entails that the determination of the question whether there are such facts and circumstances must be made on the basis as the same criteria as under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) . According to the case - law , under newly appeared facts or altered circumstances \u2013 in so far as relevant for DATE must be understood facts or circumstances having taken place after the taking of the earlier decision or which could not and , noting section QUANTITY of LAW DATE , therefore should not be submitted before the taking of that decision .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . As also held by the ORG in that ruling , the alien who asks for protection must \u2013 even where it concerns a forced return to a country where there allegedly exists a risk of treatment in breach of LAW as a rule comply with procedural requirements under domestic law , including LAW CARDINAL of LAW , which [ requirements ] enable the national authorities to determine requests for a residence permit in an orderly manner and only under special , to the individual case relating facts and circumstances , may a necessity arise not to hold a failure to respect these rules against the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . ORG has not taken into account under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL the personal circumstances only submitted on appeal by the appellant , because it found that the appellant could and therefore should have submitted those circumstances earlier and that no special circumstances had appeared justifying that this not be held against her .", "CARDINAL . By letter , received at ORG on DATE , the appellant has submitted a record of DATE on a conversation between a collaborator of ORG ( Vluchtelingenwerk ) PERSON and the appellant concerning personal circumstances in relation to her child born on ... DATE .", "ORG . The applicant has thus after the taking of the decision of DATE submitted for the first time circumstances in relation to her child that had taken place before that decision was taken . It has not been argued that the thus submitted circumstances were not known to her at the time when this decision was taken . ORG has correctly considered that the appellant , also in view of the provisions of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , should have raised those circumstances earlier in the proceedings . ORG has further correctly found no reasons in what has been put before it in this respect for finding that this could nevertheless not be asked from the appellant .", "ORG has correctly found that the circumstances submitted by the appellant in relation to her child were not facts or circumstances within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Neither can the applicant \u2019s submissions to ORG be regarded as special facts and circumstances relating to the individual case , on which basis ORG ought not have held this national procedural rule against the appellant . \u201d", "No further appeal lay against this ruling . To date , the applicant \u2019s husband has not taken any initiative from which it could be concluded that he is considering a separation , divorce or to challenge his paternity of the child ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
