On DATE , at the first hearing on the merits held in the applicant \u2019s case , ORG rejected his subsequent application for release . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision , holding that :", "\u201c In his appeal [ the applicant ] argues that he has already been detained for DATE and considers that in view of the fact that the trial has begun , he should be released . He also refers to his arrears in child support obligations and to [ the situation of ] his mother , on whom he [ previously ] attended .", "This court has taken account of the following :", "The period spent by [ the applicant ] in detention is indeed very long . However , there is no error in [ the lower ] court \u2019s finding that this is not in itself a particular circumstance which would be a ground for not continuing his detention , as referred to in the first sentence of LAW . There is no basis on which to refute ORG statements expressing its concern about the proper conduct of the trial without [ detention ] being imposed on [ the applicant ] . In the course of the investigation [ he ] was elusive for the investigating authority and he was twice searched for by a \u201c wanted \u201d notice ( see p. CARDINAL , volume I ) . [ The applicant \u2019s ] detention still has a basis within the meaning of LAW of LAW ] and the circumstances upon which he relies do not suffice for ORG to question the decision of ORG in respect of the preventive measure imposed on [ him ] .", "The case has now reached the stage of the opening of the trial and the subsequent hearings ( the dates of which have already been fixed ) will soon be held . Accordingly , it is likely that the case will in a short time be terminated which \u2013 still DATE justifies [ an opinion ] that the contested decision of ORG should be upheld . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Meanwhile , on DATE ORG had made an application under LAW of LAW to ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) , asking it to prolong the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The application was posted to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges , sitting in camera as FAC , after obtaining oral comments from ORG ( Prokurator PERSON ) , who represented the prosecution , granted the application and prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention \u201c from DATE to DATE \u201d . ORG decision contained exhaustive reasons , the relevant part of which may be summarised as follows :", "ORG , noting that the application was filed on DATE but posted DATE , first considered what was the proper date of \u201c lodging \u201d such an application for the purposes of LAW .", "ORG next observed that , depending on the answer to this question , it would have to determine the legal consequences of a potential failure on the part of ORG to respect the rule laid down in CARDINAL ( a ) \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , which stated that in cases where no application for a further prolongation of detention on remand had been \u201c lodged \u201d , detention had to be lifted no later than on DATE .", "ORG considered that it should also deal with the question whether it was competent to rule on the application if it had been \u201c lodged \u201d after the deadline referred to in section CARDINAL ( a ) of the Interim PERSON of DATE , i.e. after DATE .", "Referring to the first question , ORG held that the proper date of \u201c lodging \u201d an application under LAW of LAW had to be deemed to be either the date of posting the application or the date of submitting it to the registry of ORG since to hold otherwise would mean leaving a detainee without any guarantee that ORG was properly supervising his detention . Moreover , if the requesting court was not bound by any time - limits for submitting its request , detention , the most severe among the preventive measures , might continue for an unspecified and unlimited time outside ORG supervision . In consequence , an application under LAW of LAW , a mere \u201c proposal \u201d to continue detention , would , for all practical purposes , transform into a basis for continuing detention . Clearly , it was not the intention of the legislator .", "ORG therefore concluded that since in the applicant \u2019s case no application for a further prolongation of his detention had been lodged DATE , the order for his detention should have been quashed at latest on DATE . Accordingly , his detention from that date to the date on which ORG was giving the present decision lacked any legal basis and was , consequently , unlawful . The court noted that such an \u201c unlawful \u201d detention might justify granting compensation for unlawful deprivation of liberty if this period were not deducted from the future sentence .", "ORG went on to find that it was , nevertheless , competent to deal with the application . A lower court \u2019s obligation to release a detainee in case of its failure properly to lodge an application under LAW CARDINAL of LAW was CARDINAL thing but its right to make such an application at any time was another . In ORG opinion , the application in question should be deemed a \u201c fresh request \u201d and be examined as such .", "ORG then dealt with the application and found that further prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention was necessary . It relied on the likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and the risk of his absconding or going into hiding which , in its view , was justified by the fact that the applicant had already absconded after having been arrested and had been searched for by a \u201c wanted \u201d notice . Lastly , ORG stressed the complexity of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a hearing and heard evidence from witnesses . On DATE ORG held the next hearing . On DATE it made the second application under LAW of LAW to ORG , asking it to prolong the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . On DATE ORG granted the application . It held a session in camera . Before taking its decision , it heard arguments of ORG . The decision read , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c ... the principal charge laid against [ the applicant ] concerns the offence of handling stolen goods of a high value . A severe penalty , that is , a sentence of CARDINAL CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment may be imposed for the commission of this offence ... The charges against the applicant have a degree of likelihood , as required by LAW ] , in particular in view of the testimonies given by the co - defendants \u0141 [ ... ] , L [ ... ] and B [ ... ] as well as [ evidence ] which has so far been heard from witnesses . Given that [ the applicant ] , after having been arrested , had on CARDINAL occasion fled and was then searched for by a \u201c wanted \u201d notice , there is a risk of his absconding or going into hiding . ... Accordingly , his detention has its basis under LAW ) and LAW . In the present case there is a need to take various evidence , in particular from witnesses . The process of obtaining evidence is lengthy and , as it emerges from the case - file , it has been extended because of [ the obstacles ] which the [ trial ] court , despite its efforts , could not overcome . Consequently , there are grounds for further prolongation of detention , as defined in LAW of the [ LAW ] . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for his release .

ORG , a regional prosecutor from ORG took part in the session and the court heard her arguments . The relevant decision comprises a CARDINAL - line reasoning , which reads as follows :", "\u201c Since the grounds for continuing detention , mentioned in the decision of ORG of DATE file no . V KCARDINAL CARDINAL , are still valid and as there are no circumstances militating in favour of not continuing the preventive measure imposed , it has been held [ as in the operative part of the decision ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
