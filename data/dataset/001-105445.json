SLOVENIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON ( \u201c the applicant \u201d ) , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in LOC . The applicant lodged the application on his own and his daughter \u2019s , A. \u2019s , behalf . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG Attorney .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Following the separation of the applicant and his daughter \u2019s mother , the latter obtained custody of the daughter .", "Subsequently , on DATE , the applicant lodged a request for determination of contact arrangements with his daughter . ORG issued a decision on those contact arrangements on DATE . It determined that the applicant and his daughter should have DATE contact and contact during holidays . As regards the latter , it stated that the applicant and his daughter should spend DATE during DATE and DATE during DATE together . The mother appealed .", "On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) quashed the part of ORG decision that concerned contact arrangements during DATE . It found that the decision had lacked an indication of the exact periods of contact to be put in place during DATE . On DATE , the case was transferred to ORG , which , further to a reform in this field , had acquired jurisdiction in the matter .", "On DATE a hearing was held before the court . At the hearing , the judge noted that the subject of the proceedings was restricted to contact arrangements during holidays . On the same date the applicant requested that an interim decision be issued regulating contact arrangements during holidays and stipulating a physical taking of his daughter from her mother in the case of her non - compliance with the decision .", "On DATE the court rejected the applicant \u2019s request for an interim decision . It relied on ORG report and a psychologist \u2019s report indicating that the applicant \u2019s daughter did not want to have DATE contact with the applicant , as a result of which no visits had been carried out at that time . The court found that provisional holiday contact arrangements might therefore not be in the child \u2019s interests and that it was better to wait for evidence to be produced in the proceedings and a final decision reached on that basis . The applicant appealed . On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal concerning the request for an interim decision , finding that the lower court had properly conducted the proceedings and had been led by the best interests of the child .", "In the meantime , the applicant and his daughter also lodged a request for contact arrangements between the daughter and relatives on the applicant \u2019s side of the family . On DATE ORG joined the request for contact arrangements between the daughter and her relatives to the proceedings concerning contact during holidays . On DATE the court declared inadmissible the request for contact arrangements with the aforementioned relatives , finding that neither the applicant nor his daughter , who was still a minor , had standing to pursue such proceedings . On DATE the ORG upheld that decision .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter \u2019s mother lodged a request for new ( reduced ) DATE contact arrangements between the applicant and his daughter which would replace those set out in ORG decision of DATE . She also requested that an interim decision be issued in that regard . The latter request was rejected on DATE .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing . Both parties confirmed that the DATE contact arrangements as set out in ORG decision of DATE had been complied with since DATE . Moreover , the applicant and his daughter had also taken a holiday together in DATE .", "At the hearing of DATE the court decided the case and terminated the proceedings . Having regard to several ORG reports , as well as expert reports and statements from the parties , it determined new DATE contact arrangements , which were similar to those set out in ORG decision . In also decided that the applicant and his daughter should spend the DATE and DATE during DATE together and specified the way in which these arrangements should be implemented in practice .", "Both parties appealed . On DATE the ORG quashed the part of the lower court \u2019s decision concerning the DATE contact arrangements and slightly modified the way in which the arrangements for DATE should be implemented in practice . It found that there had been no basis for the lower court to replace ORG final decision of DATE as regards the part of that decision concerning DATE contact arrangements , which therefore remained in force . ORG decision was served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE .", "As regards the relevant provisions of domestic family law see LAW GPE , no .
