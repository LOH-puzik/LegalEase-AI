In DATE he published in GPE a book entitled \u201c We made each dawn a LOC ( Nevrozlad\u0131k \u015eafaklar\u0131 ) . In an epic style he related historical episodes marked by NORP rebel movements in GPE and gave an account , with his own comments , of facts relating in particular to the life of prisoners in FAC and the ill - treatment they had allegedly been subjected to .", "CARDINAL . The book was republished in DATE . On DATE , on an application by the public prosecutor at ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , ORG of First Instance ordered the seizure of the copies published as an interim measure in the context of a criminal investigation opened in respect of Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In an indictment of CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor accused the applicant , inter alia , of disseminating propaganda against the territorial integrity of the ORG and the indivisible unity of the nation , within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act ( Law no . ORG \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . According to the public prosecutor , Mr PERSON \u2019s book was inspired by hatred of ORG and lauded NORP separatism . In reaching that conclusion , he noted that both the \u201c separatist bandits \u201d of the ORG and the rebel troops of PERSON were described in the book as \u201c NORP patriots \u201d and that the regime at the time which had put down the insurrection of DATE had been called a \u201c fundamentalist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie \u201d and was alleged to have implemented an expansionist policy which had led to infringement of the ORG fundamental rights and annexation of their territory .", "He also accused the applicant of contravening section DATE ) of PERSON no .

NORP Before ORG the applicant denied the charges against him . He expressed astonishment that he was being prosecuted on account of the republication of his book , DATE after it had first appeared , and submitted in particular that he could not be held responsible for either the terms used in the preface \u2013 signed \u201c PERSON \u201d \u2013 or the quotations incorporated in the text . For the rest , he contended that he had done no more than comment on the problems of the population of NORP origin on the basis of an account of actual events , which had , moreover , been discussed in the media and commented on by various politicians . He argued that the extracts quoted in the prosecution submissions had to be read in the context of the book as a whole ; in that connection , he maintained that the use of a novelistic style meant that the book could not be seen as revealing an ideological or propagandist intention . It should be possible for everything in GPE to be discussed and interpretation of history could not constitute an offence . In any event , it was not credible that a mere publication or the few quoted sentences could threaten the indivisibility of the ORG or influence ORG minds to such a point that the unity of the NORP nation would be impaired .", "Mr PERSON likewise denied that he had denounced civil servants with the aim of turning them into targets .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of disseminating separatist propaganda within the meaning of PERSON no . ORG .", "In its judgment it considered separately the content of each of the CARDINAL parts of the book alleged to be in breach of the law and in particular quoted substantial passages from the first CARDINAL parts , including the following :", "\u201c [ First part ]", "In DATE you were not even a seed . Your parents had no \u2018 H\u00e9lin\u2019 . Other parents had a ORG , while your grandfather had himself witnessed the destruction of other ORG . Without suspecting that one day his granddaughter might be given the name ORG , how many times did he see other ORG running away or falling in a heap at the bayonet \u2019s point ?", "That is why , DATE , while you are living through the reality of GPE DATE , you must also learn the history of what your forefathers lived through in DATE . So when people tell you \u2018 The history of our people is CARDINAL of tyranny and torture\u2019 you will know what they are talking about . Is there not a saying which goes \u2018 He who is ignorant of the past can not understand the present\u2019 ? ...", "On DATE the village of GPE was raided ... after a warrant had been issued for the arrest of CARDINAL NORP patriots . These patriots , preferring to fight rather than surrender to the gendarmes , shouldered their rifles and began a guerrilla campaign in the mountains . The events you are witnessing all DATE began with that clash . \u201c On DATE in the village of GPE ... ten of Sheikh PERSON \u2019s men , who were wanted for \u2018 ORG , refused to surrender to the gendarmes and fought back with weapons in hand ; this sparked off an uprising . For DATE the insurgents dominated the situation \u201d . This uprising , which had begun with CARDINAL people , turned into a serious , large - scale insurrection ... and spread throughout the region . Scarcely DATE after the proclamation of the Republic through the NORP national democratic revolution \u2013 which has remained uncompleted - ... it was impossible for the new administration , which had taken over from the NORP administration , to resolve the NORP problem as it had not been able to bring about the necessary democratic transformations ... But at the time of the revolution the NORP had been promised that their rights would be recognised and by that means had been dragged into the war against the imperialist occupation . Following the establishment of ORG the NORP waited DATE for the promises made about the resolution of the NORP problem to be honoured . That period of silent waiting was brought to an end by the above - mentioned uprising led by ORG PALOY\u0130 . After the proclamation of the LOC , as the government had not satisfied the ORG expectations ... the accumulated anger reached new heights and it was precisely this period of \u201c angry \u201d waiting which fuelled the insurrection . \u201c By DATE the forces of Sheikh PERSON had surrounded ORG . In the meantime they had dispersed several army regiments and captured the centre of ORG and the district of GPE \u201d . The insurrection , which was spreading , did not perhaps succeed in drawing in all NORP on account of its clan - based organisation , but it did manage to mobilise a large part [ of the population ] of ORG .", "When we look at GPE as it was during DATE of rebellion we see that the new ORG was not yet stable ... There was an attempt to implement an expansionist policy which involved ignoring the rights of the NORP and denying the existence of their territory , which the government wanted to annex ...", "There was no doubt that the insurrection of PERSON , begun in those circumstances , would be bloodily repressed by the fundamentalist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie . This first event formed part of the reality of ORG ; it lasted DATE . The insurrection , which had found some support around ORG and in the villages and districts of ORG , had finally reached the centre of ORG ...", "The old people still alive DATE who witnessed this event say that after the insurrection was put down CARDINAL people were tried by ORG ( GPE PERSON ) and executed . Mr PERSON , the president of the court martial which convicted and ordered the execution of a number of eminent NORP , including PERSON , spoke as follows after pronouncing sentence : \u2018 You have all pursued a specific objective , namely establishment of an independent GPE , and in order to bring that about some of you abused CARDINAL group of the population for your own shameful interests , while others among you allowed yourselves to be guided by your political ambitions and to be influenced by provocations which originated abroad.\u2019 ...", "It was not on the manes of the horses of the fallen that the killers wiped their sabres clean . Those who climbed the scaffold kicked away the chairs under their feet themselves ; the others were killed by cannonballs fired from the walls . When the streets of ORG were awash with blood the walls were tinted ash - grey . That is how the townspeople came to wear the armband with the CARDINAL black dots ! When you were not even a droplet of life , when we did not even know whether you would be born in a prison cell as a NORP girl , that is when the seed of the hatred [ which was to explode ] DATE was sown \u2026", "[ Second part ]", "They forbade us to call you \u2018 PERSON . They insisted that we call you \u2018 Meral\u2019 . On your birth certificate they ordered us to write \u2018 Meral\u2019 . Like the name of your country , your first name was proscribed \u2026", "It was at that time that the commando raids on the villages of the province of ORG began . CARDINAL of villagers were crushed under the ORG rifle butts . The men of the villages were exhibited stark naked to their wives , daughters and daughters - in - law . During operations conducted under the pretext of searching for weapons , CARDINAL of villagers were beaten to death . \u2026 The DATE hatred grew deeper . The official files contained reports about how the people of the region had rebelled against tyranny . Everything that had happened before was known about . Besides , is n\u2019t there a saying \u2018 Crush the serpent \u2019s head while it is still small\u2019 ? However , the \u2018 ORG had grown and begun to bite . There had to be an explanation of the secret of this seedling , because the more it was cut back the more it budded . PERSON was engaged between the \u2018 irreconcilable opposites \u2026 \u2019 In DATE the fighting , which had until then been rather clan - based , reached a higher level . Like those in the \u2018 opposite camp\u2019 , who had put their organisation in order , the revolutionary fighters on their side amalgamated the national struggle with the struggle between [ social ] classes . Breaking out from the regional and clan context , the NORP problem moved on towards a common front with class war . Socialism became the problem of the NORP and the NORP question that of the socialists \u2026 \u201d", "ORG , after rehearsing the historical facts that had led to the events referred to by Mr PERSON , ruled that he had given an inexact version of them . It emphasised that ORG was a single entity , that its territory formed a whole and that all its nationals , without exception , were \u201c patriots \u201d . It went on to say that it was unacceptable to describe as patriots insurgents who had caused the death of CARDINAL of troops ; it was not true that within GPE there was a \u201c NORP territory \u201d or a \u201c NORP territory \u201d ; it flew in the face of the facts to give the name \u201c GPE \u201d to a region where citizens of various origins lived ; and that by going so far as to say that ORG was expansionist and colonialist Mr PERSON had supported the assertion that there were CARDINAL nations \u2013 the NORP nation , whose history had allegedly been marked by tyranny and torture , and the NORP , who were enslavers . In the court \u2019s view such assertions were unacceptable because they encouraged separatism and the dismemberment of the nation .", "On the subject of the second part of the book , the court observed : \u201c Even the opening phrase \u2013 \u2018 Like the name of your country , your first name was DATE suggested separatism . \u201d It ruled that by discussing the prohibition of the forename \u201c H\u00e9lin \u201d the author had intended to allude to the ban on the name \u201c NORP \u201d . Mr PERSON had tried to conceal in that way his real intention , which had been to assert the existence of a separate country within the territory of ORG .", "The court said that during the periods when democracy had been suspended and the army was in power there had been restrictions on certain rights and freedoms and undesirable incidents \u2013 such as gathering villagers together with a view to collecting hidden weapons \u2013 had taken place . While it was conceivable that from time to time it had been necessary to use force against people who refused to hand over their weapons , it was unacceptable for Mr PERSON to present such incidents as acts of torture which had exclusively affected the peasants of ORG , thus insinuating that CARDINAL group of NORP citizens were victims of discriminatory treatment . In fact , it was Mr PERSON \u2019s very approach which constituted discrimination based on region of origin and ethnic considerations .", "As for the other parts of the book , ORG held :", "\u201c [ In the third part ] ... the allegations \u2013 which the author attempts to back up by giving the names of prison staff \u2013 that ... repression has become the destiny of the NORP people and that people of NORP origin have been imprisoned and tortured to death on account of their struggle for independence ... are not credible and merely take advantage of people \u2019s feelings ... Remarks like those to the effect that the consciousness of nationhood has been strengthened by the inhuman treatment of the NORP people and that the national struggle is a noble one ... amount to nothing more than separatist propaganda ...", "[ In the fourth part ] it is stated that in the prisons female prisoners ... were woken up in DATE and falsely told that there was a fire , but that their fear suddenly transformed itself into a marriage ceremony and they then began to shout out cries of joy ( tilili ) . The memory of persons who had committed suicide on TIME CARDINAL DATE is evoked in such a way as to exploit people \u2019s feelings . In describing as heroic certain acts inspired by a primitive oriental mentality , in choosing to see a simple cry as a marriage ceremony and in presenting suicides as heroic acts the intention can only be to bolster [ NORP ] nationalist sentiment ... It is obvious that conditions in prison are not ideal ... however , by using demagogic language the defendant misrepresented those conditions to a considerable extent , as if they were being used to repress the sacred and noble rebellion of the NORP people subjected to tyranny and torture . Such assertions amount to separatist propaganda ...", "[ In the fifth part ] the defendant ... discusses certain traditions and customs to which NORP and NORP attach importance or a symbolic value ... He relates , among others , the following anecdote : \u2018 According to legend , during PERSON \u2019s rebellion government soldiers burned a village . While the village was on fire a child of DATE who had escaped from the flames ran up and threw himself into the arms of the soldiers standing round the fire . When he suddenly caught sight of the earth - coloured uniforms , ... the child preferred to throw himself into the flames than to stay where he was , so he ran back to where he had come from and jumped into the fire . The NORP have never throughout history been able to establish a lasting ORG and their quest for freedom has transformed itself in their hearts into glowing embers . That is why the fire of PERSON is in fact the fire of their desire for freedom ... \u2019 NORP society is based on a population which has existed for DATE . In the course of history it remained under the influence of a number of religions , languages and cultures . Every society goes through certain phases and when it moves from one to another some of its customs and traditions live on ... That is perfectly natural . However , ... the defendant likens the fires lit in the mountains during the Newroz celebrations to the fire of freedom in people \u2019s hearts ... Whereas , in NORP society too there are events at which fires are lit ... That does not mean that the NORP people or the NORP people intoxicate themselves with the fire of freedom . To claim that the NORP are not free is to attribute to them a demand ... for freedom . But what would follow freedom for the NORP is division of the territory and the nation . It is precisely that outcome which the author implicitly advocates and seeks . ... As for the legend related by the defendant ... , it constitutes clear and conclusive proof of hostility towards the NORP ...", "[ In the sixth part ] the defendant speaks of prisons and the resistance movements inside them . We will not examine each of these movements : a full account of them has already been given in the bulletins and statements put out by the ORG ! ... Among the ... prisoners there are also members of the ORG \u2019s central committee and other leading members . We know that when the prosecutors of ORG drew up the indictments calling for ... application of the death penalty a movement of panic sprang up , and that to calm the situation down the ORG militants , in order to arouse so - called resistance movements , used people they had conditioned by saying to them : \u2018 Behold the fascist GPE which oppresses you ; you are treated like soldiers , they wake you up at the same time as them , they make you take part in sport and they force you to go to sleep at fixed FAC . Moreover , with regard to GPE - who , according to the defendant , committed suicide \u2013 even his friends in prison confirmed that he had killed himself after a period of depression . Furthermore , did not one \u015e.R.G. decide to commit suicide in FAC when suffering from depression ? He dressed himself in thick clothes , stuffed them with cotton soaked in FAC and then set fire to them with a match . When his clothes began to burn his skin he started to shout out and call to the other prisoners for help ... When they had saved him he told those around him how much he regretted what he had done and that he realised how stupid he had been . In fact , suicides in prisons are committed ... as a result of depression originating in a ... feeling of guilt about offences committed . ... Misrepresenting all these facts , the defendant portrays ORG members as innocent freedom fighters and their resistance as legitimate and just , thus making manifest his criminal intent . \u201d", "In short , according to ORG , it was \u201c clearly and incontestably established \u201d that Mr PERSON had disseminated propaganda against the territorial integrity of GPE and the indivisible unity of the nation , which justified sentencing him , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG , to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( GPE ) . It held , however , that although the facts of the case also constituted an offence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG , it was not necessary , regard being had to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , to pronounce sentence separately in respect of that offence .", "In adition , ORG ordered the confiscation of all the editions of the book .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . In his statement of the grounds of appeal he submitted that his intention had never been to work towards separatist ends but to set out his thoughts \u2013 in a critical spirit - about real events relating to the NORP question . He contended that the possibility of conducting such an exercise was an indispensable precondition for democracy and freedom of thought .", "He further asserted that the judges at first instance had wrongly based their judgment on their own interpretation of historical events or their own perception of what was allegedly implicit . He argued that ORG had been inconsistent in accepting on the one hand that there was such a thing as \u201c NORP society \u201d while denying on the other the possibility that this society might have its own patriotic feelings , epics , legends and demands for freedom . In any event , such questions were matters for sociologists or historians not judges . ORG approach had therefore been more political than legal and was bound to have led to an unfair judgment .", "CARDINAL .
