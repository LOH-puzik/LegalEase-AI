ORG dismissed the complaints on the ground of lack of proof that offences had been committed . ...", "...

However , they complained to international organisations without first attempting to use the national mechanism for solving such problems . They presented the facts erroneously in order to win their cases ...", "Such practices by lawyers will be investigated by ORG in order to determine whether they have committed the offence provided for in LAW , by making public on an international scale false information about alleged breaches of human rights which gravely prejudice the image of our country .", "Accordingly , ORG is called upon to take account of the facts described above , to bring to the attention of lawyers the situation so created and to prevent as far as possible any prejudice to the authority of GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
