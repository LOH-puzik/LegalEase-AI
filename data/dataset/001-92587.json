It could not be established where exactly on the train the events had taken place . The applicant maintained that he had been hit next to the door of the train , but other witnesses submitted that he had been inside the carriage or outside on the platform . The prosecutor concluded as follows :", "\u201c It appears from the statements of police officers PERSON and PERSON that the passengers on the train , the majority of them football supporters , did not comply with their orders . This gave them a ground to apply coercive measures and to use truncheons or handcuffs . Given the aggressive behaviour of the passengers those coercive measures corresponded to the exigencies of the situation and were necessary to ensure that their orders were obeyed .", "[ It should be concluded ] that there is not sufficient evidence that the police officers overstepped their powers in breach of the interest of [ the applicant ] .

Moreover , he argued that the police officer had overstepped his powers and that there was no justification for use of the truncheon against him , as he had not provoked it . The applicant also complained that the authorities had failed to take into consideration the fact that he was not a football supporter and had nothing to do with the hooligans who were travelling on the same train .", "CARDINAL", "\u201c While it appears from the opinion of the forensic expert that the applicant \u2019s injuries could have been sustained as a consequence of the intervention of the police officers on DATE , nevertheless , in the light of the evidence collected , it can not be established that police officers C. and PERSON overstepped their powers . They acted within their competence and the use of the coercive measures of truncheons and handcuffs corresponded to the exigencies of the situation ; that is , to the aggressive behaviour of the passengers . The court considers that , contrary to the allegations made in the appeals , all the necessary steps were taken during the investigation in order to establish the objective truth .", "The finding of whether or not [ the applicant ] had anything to do with the ORG actions , that is , the vandalism of the train , can not have any bearing on the decision on the merits , in a situation where the police officers were intervening in connection with those events . They were carrying out their duties given the aggressive behaviour of the passengers on the train .", "In the light of the above the court found that the impugned decision was correct and decided as in the operative part . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted before ORG . He was charged with damaging the train carriage and using violence against the police officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant of both charges . The court established that the applicant had been calm and \u201c in contrast to other defendants had been sober and had been coming back from work and not from the football match \u201d .

The court then stated :", "\u201c In reply [ the applicant ] had asked the police officer : \u201c would you hit me , sir ? \u201d As [ the applicant ] had not complied with the order , police officer [ K ] used a coercive measure , i.e. the \u201c tonfa \u201d truncheon .
