The right of persons in police custody to have access to a doctor ( including to CARDINAL of their own choice ) , is still not expressly guaranteed by law . In the report on the DATE visit , the ORG considered that the form of words in LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , sub - paragraph CARDINAL of the CCP ( i.e. the right \u201c to submit requests , including for independent medical assistance \u201d ) fell short of meeting the ORG 's long - standing recommendation in this respect . Many persons who were in police custody in the context of the DATE events complained that , despite repeated requests for independent medical assistance , they had been refused such assistance . In some cases , police staff allegedly denied access to a doctor in order to obtain a confession or other statement from the injured detained persons concerned . Further , it appeared in a few cases of persons who had presented visible injuries that medical care had not been provided to them on the grounds that they had not specifically requested it . Such situations not only deprive detained persons of a safeguard which can play a significant role in the prevention of ill - treatment , but it may also have serious repercussions on the health of persons in police custody . Clearly , access to an independent doctor should not be left to the discretion of police officers . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
