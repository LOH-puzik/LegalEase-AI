ORG planned the construction of DATE houses , sport and play grounds and a restaurant on this site which was composed of marshes and wetland . On DATE ORG decided that the intended development did not comply with the objectives of spatial planning . CARDINAL of the main grounds for that refusal was that the site was located in a nature preserve . There was also the danger of dissection of landscape by secondary residences and of an undesirable effect on the promotion of tourism .", "On DATE and DATE , when purchasing further plots of land ( parcels nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) located in this area , the applicant was informed by ORG ( PERSON ) that the land in question was part of a natural habitat intended to be designated as a nature conservation area .", "On DATE the Regen Municipality published a development plan despite the objections of ORG .", "By decisions of DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG prohibited the applicant from altering the natural condition of the land ( parcels nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , ordered him to refill the drainage ditches and informed him that the decisions would be implemented by the administrative authority at his own expense if he failed to carry out the expected activity within the time - limits fixed at DATE and DATE respectively . On CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE ORG proceeded to refill the ditches on CARDINAL of the land parcels concerned ( no . CARDINAL ) .", "After a suspension for DATE of appeal proceedings brought by the applicant , ORG ( Bayerisches Verwaltungsgericht ) , by a judgment of DATE , found that the limitation periods were too short and that the implementation of the decisions was unlawful .", "On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant a planning permission for the development of the land . This decision became final .", "By a decree of DATE the Government of ORG designated the area , including in part the applicant \u2019s land ( parcels nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , as a nature conservation area .", "On DATE ORG transferred , as requested by the applicant , his real property situated in this area to the ORG of GPE fixing the compensation to be awarded to him at MONEY ( ORG ) . It refused to purchase parcel number CARDINAL on the ground that the use for agriculture on this respective plot of land remained unaffected by LAW of DATE . It also refused to purchase the other remaining plots of the applicant \u2019s land .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeals lodged by the applicant and the State of GPE against this decision . The judgment became final , the parties having withdrawn their respective appeals .", "In DATE the applicant sold the land not included in the area covered by the nature conservation decree ( parcels nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) as pasture respectively forest land .", "On DATE ORG supplemented its decision of DATE , taking into account changes brought about in respect of the applicant \u2019s land , such as the construction of a new road . No appeal was filed against this decision by the applicant . It accordingly became final .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( ORG ) quashed a judgment of ORG ( Landgericht ) of CARDINAL DATE and increased the amount of compensation initially awarded to the applicant from DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL to DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL .

It ordered , however , the administrative authorities to decide on the applicant \u2019s compensation claim in respect of the remaining plots of land ( parcels nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s compensation claim . It found that the land was situated outside the nature conservation area and was thus not affected by restrictions of the land use . The development plan for the DATE residences had never been validated , nor had the applicant ever been the owner of building land . Furthermore , with the exception of parcel number CARDINAL he had sold the plots of land ( parcels nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) in DATE . At the time of filing the compensation claim with ORG in DATE he did not own the land any longer .

CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "According to ORG , important considerations of nature conservation made the proposed development incompatible with the preservation of the valuable wetland in the area concerned . The applicant had never enjoyed a right to develop the land in question nor had he ever had a legitimate expectation of carrying out the proposed development since the development plan had been invalid from the beginning . Furthermore the applicant was not entitled to compensation because agricultural use of the land was not prohibited . ORG advised the applicant to accept the numerous court decisions given in his case which confirmed that the development plan had no legally binding effect and that the land in question was never designated for construction purposes .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision refusing him leave to appeal on the ground that the case raised no issue of principle .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication .", "In the meantime , by notices of DATE and DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) had assessed the applicant \u2019s income tax taking into account the compensation paid to him by ORG . The applicant \u2019s appeals lodged against these decisions were dismissed by ORG on DATE , ORG ( ORG ) on DATE and ORG ( GPE ) on DATE .

On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision refusing him leave to appeal on points of law . It found that the applicant \u2019s grounds of appeal did not satisfy the procedural requirements of the relevant provisions of LAW ( GPE ) . It noted in particular that the complaints concerning the fairness of the proceedings and the interpretation of the facts allegedly in contrast to the clear contents of the files had not been submitted within the statutory time - limit .", "On DATE ORG notified the applicant an enforcement decision of DATE in respect of his tax liability relating to the period from DATE to DATE in an amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , including interests , penalties for late payment and costs of the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication .", "Simultaneously the ORG claimed from the applicant the payment of court costs . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) issued a warrant of arrest against the applicant because he did not make an affidavit ( eidesstattliche ORG ) as to his assets .", "On DATE the ORG assessed the value of the applicant \u2019s real estate at ORG and fixed the date for its compulsory sale at DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
