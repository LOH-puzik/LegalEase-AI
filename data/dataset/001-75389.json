{"ITEMID": "001-75389", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "USEINOV v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a national of the Former GPE ( \u201c the FYR of NORP \u201d ) , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant came to the GPE on DATE and applied for asylum . This request was rejected on DATE . The applicant \u2019s subsequent request for revision ( herziening ) was dismissed on CARDINAL DATE . The final decision on the asylum application was taken by ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) , which rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . However , the applicant did not leave the country and neither was he forcibly expelled .", "In DATE , while the proceedings on his request for asylum were still pending , the applicant formed a relationship with PERSON , a GPE national . PERSON was living next door to the applicant with her parents , but she spent so much time with the applicant that they were de facto living together . On DATE a daughter , PERSON , was born to the applicant and PERSON The applicant did not at that time recognise his daughter given that PERSON father was vehemently opposed to this . Being an asylum seeker , the applicant was not allowed to work in the GPE and he was thus unable to contribute financially to his daughter \u2019s upbringing . However , he did spend CARDINAL or CARDINAL afternoons per week with her .", "On DATE the applicant applied for a residence permit for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature related to his having a GPE partner and daughter . On DATE Ms van B. informed the immigration authorities that her relationship with the applicant had ended .", "The applicant \u2019s request for a residence permit was rejected by the Deputy Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) on DATE . It was held that , even assuming that it could be established DATE that the applicant was the father of PERSON , it had in no way been shown that he had enjoyed family life with her . Neither had it appeared that there had existed a lasting and exclusive relationship between the applicant and PERSON", "The applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision , arguing that he saw his daughter on a regular basis \u2013 at least once and sometimes twice DATE and that , as his relationship with PERSON had ended , it could not be expected of the latter to move to the FYR of GPE in order to enable him to enjoy family life with his daughter . He further submitted a letter written by PERSON to his lawyer , in which she confirmed that the applicant was the biological father of her daughter PERSON ; that the applicant had insufficient means to contribute financially to M. \u2019s upbringing but that he did sometimes buy presents for her ; that , although their relationship had ended , they were still friends ; and that the CARDINAL of them undertook activities together at least once DATE .", "By a decision of DATE , the Deputy Minister rejected the objection , considering that the refusal to grant the applicant a residence permit did not constitute an interference with the applicant \u2019s family life since that refusal was not aimed at taking from the applicant a residence permit which enabled him to enjoy family life in the GPE . Neither did there exist any special facts or circumstances which placed the ORG under a positive obligation to grant the applicant a residence permit . In this context the Deputy Minister noted that the applicant had never officially lived together with PERSON and that his claim that he saw his daughter once or twice a week had remained unsubstantiated . It had further not been shown that he had custody of PERSON or that he contributed financially to her upbringing . In addition , in view of the geographical distance between the GPE and the FYR of GPE and the cost of regular trips between those CARDINAL countries , it was held that the contact which the applicant had with his daughter would not need to undergo a substantial change as a result of the refusal of a residence permit .", "The applicant appealed this decision to ORG , submitting that his return to the FYR of GPE would render regular contact with his daughter impossible . As the FYR of GPE was the poorest country in LOC , it was unlikely that he would be able to afford regular trips to the GPE . If he had a job in the FYR of GPE , he would not have enough holidays to make regular longer trips to the GPE . In addition , there was no guarantee whatsoever that the applicant would be granted a visa . It was further not to be expected that Ms van B. would travel to the FYR of GPE to enable the applicant to see his daughter in view of the difficulties between the applicant and PERSON father and the latter \u2019s influence over his daughter . The applicant also argued that not all relevant circumstances had been taken into account by the Deputy Minister when the interests of the community as a whole were balanced against those of the applicant \u2019s . The circumstances which , in his view , merited to be taken into account were the fact that he had been living in the GPE since DATE , that his daughter was DATE , that he had regular contact with her , that due to an insufficiency of means it was impossible for him to contribute financially to his daughter \u2019s upbringing , and that he did not dare take legal proceedings in order to recognise his daughter out of fear that PERSON father would stop him from seeing his daughter . In the proceedings before ORG the applicant submitted a letter from the owner of a company saying he should like to employ the applicant and requesting that the applicant be granted a residence permit .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It found that the Deputy Minister had been justified in attaching greater weight to the economic well - being of the country than to the applicant \u2019s interest in exercising family life with his daughter in the GPE . In this context ORG had regard to the fact that the applicant and his daughter had never lived together as a family unit ( gezin ) , that there was no arrangement concerning access and that the applicant did not contribute financially to his daughter \u2019s upbringing . Finally , ORG considered that the applicant should be deemed capable of maintaining some kind of contact with his daughter from the FYR of GPE . No further appeal lay against this decision , which was notified to the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant requested the juvenile court judge of ORG to establish an access arrangement between him and his daughter . In her decision of DATE , the juvenile court judge noted that PERSON was born out of the relationship between the applicant and PERSON , and that the parents had themselves agreed on an access arrangement which had latterly , however , not been working out . Given that , pending the proceedings , it had appeared that the parents had reached agreement , the juvenile court judge established the access arrangement as agreed by the parents , to the effect that the applicant would see PERSON every DATE from TIME to TIME and that further contacts would take place by mutual agreement .", "On DATE the applicant recognised his daughter with the permission of PERSON , as a result of which legally recognised family ties ( familierechtelijke betrekkingen ) were created between them . Moreover , on DATE a son , J. , was born to the applicant and PERSON , who was recognised by the applicant on DATE . In a letter to ORG DATE the applicant described his family situation as \u201c living apart together \u201d . PERSON worked DATE , during which the applicant , who lived QUANTITY away , looked after the children . The family spent DATE mainly together .", "As of CARDINAL DATE the local authorities of the town where the applicant was residing stopped providing him with ORG - sponsored accommodation , social benefits and health insurance . Legal proceedings instituted by the applicant against this decision were to no avail .", "On DATE Ms van B. lost her job . As a result , the applicant is prevented from applying for a residence permit for the purpose of residing with his partner and children since one of the requirements for such a permit is that the partner who is already residing in the GPE is in employment and in receipt of a salary of QUANTITY per month .", "At the time relevant to the present application , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) . On DATE a new Aliens Act entered into force but this has no bearing on the present case .", "Under LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW DATE a residence permit could be refused on public interest grounds . The Government pursued DATE and still pursue \u2013 a restrictive immigration policy due to the population and employment situation in the GPE . Aliens are eligible for admission only on the basis of obligations arising from international agreements , or if their presence serves an essential national interest , or on compelling humanitarian grounds . Respect for family life is CARDINAL of those obligations arising from international agreements . To implement this restrictive policy , further conditions have been drawn up relating to each of the various grounds for the admission of aliens wishing to stay in the GPE .", "The admission policy for the purposes of forming a family was laid down in LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingencirculaire DATE ) . Section BCARDINAL/CARDINAL of these Guidelines addressed the requirements of LAW initial admission and continued residence . It had to be determined whether family life existed within the meaning of LAW , whether refusal to grant admission to the alien would constitute an interference with his or her right to respect for family life and whether the interference would be justified LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
