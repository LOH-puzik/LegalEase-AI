Iron - ore mining had been in constant decline since DATE . The company was forced to discontinue its mining activity because worldwide competition meant that it was no longer profitable to mine iron - ore in PERSON .

With a view to the complete cessation of its activity , the applicant company initiated the appropriate procedures for the abandonment and renunciation of its concessions .

It ends when the authorities are able to confirm that the requirements have been fulfilled . The renunciation procedure terminates the concession with the result that its holder is no longer bound by the special mining regulations and is released from the presumption of liability in respect of any damage which occurs above ground . At the time when the cessation of the company 's operations was announced , the abandonment and renunciation procedures were governed by ORG DATE and CARDINAL of LAW and by Decree no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE concerning mining and quarrying regulations . Law no .

Does not the immediate application of the new LAW impair the established rights of the holders of mining concessions or licences , in so far as work commenced prior to this legislation is at issue ? Should or could a limit be set on the regulatory obligations that may be imposed on them , since the objectives now enshrined in the mining regulations were clearly not envisaged when the operations were first started ?", "CARDINAL . Should the principle of the proportionality of acts of the administrative authorities be construed as requiring the prefect to take account of the human , financial or technical means available to the operator when he imposes specific measures on the latter ?", "To what extent , should it prove impossible for the mine operator to implement the prefect 's instructions , would the obligations thus imposed be assumed by the ORG and then performed and financed by the latter ?", "CARDINAL . Could the possible extension introduced by the use of the term \u201c measures \u201d rather than \u201c work \u201d in LAW lead to the imposition of other requirements , apart from those whose result is attainable within a period that is consistent with the need to bring an end to the special mining regulations , for example a pumping requirement , which could only be fulfilled in the long term , or in a period that would be difficult to foresee ?", "In the latter case , is there not a contradiction with Articles DATE and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the decree of CARDINAL DATE , which seem , at least implicitly and for mines operated normally , to limit the imposition of mining regulations to the term of the mining concession ?", "Moreover , should the prefect confine himself to physical measures or is he entitled to impose financial measures such as payment to an organisation by way of performance ?", "CARDINAL . Would it be feasible to arrange for part of the obligations imposed under mining regulations ( for example those concerning the pumping of water or maintenance of equipment ) to be assigned to a third party ( company , consortium of public institutions , etc . ) ? Could the formal confirmation be issued once the prefect is able to observe that the operator has set up a structure providing for the performance of its obligations DATE or , on the contrary , can it only be issued once it has been observed that the prescribed measures have actually been carried out or completed ?", "CARDINAL . In matters of ordre public ( public policy ) , is the court entitled , and on the basis of what criteria , to consider that section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE has an immediate effect on contracts in progress ? Would it be possible , if necessary , in the light of the LAW , to enact legislation giving retrospective effect to the abovementioned section CARDINAL ?", "CARDINAL . On the basis of what criteria is the court entitled to rule out the application of a clause releasing the mine operator from liability in respect of damage caused by its mining activity , in the event of transfer of ownership ? In particular , is the court entitled to find such a clause null and void when the foreseeable or inevitable nature of the damage has been established ? In such cases , is it necessary to prove that the operator was aware of the risk or does the existence of the risk suffice , in so far as the operator should have been aware of it ? Moreover , may the seriousness of the damage be taken into account in the court 's interpretation of the validity of such clauses ?", "[ The PERSON d'Etat ] is minded to answer the foregoing questions as follows :", "CARDINAL . As to the mining abandonment procedure ( LAW ) :", "( a ) A new legal rule will not apply to legal situations which have already become final on the date it enters into force . Accordingly , the abandonment of mining operations which began before the entry into force of the PERSON of DATE will not be governed by the new LAW , introduced by the said PERSON , if on that date the particulars of the work required for the stabilising and rehabilitation of the site have been irrevocably decided , pursuant to the former LAW and to LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , by the acceptance of the declaration of relinquishment or abandonment submitted by the operator , or by virtue of a prefectoral order prescribing the work to be carried out . In other cases the new LAW will be applicable , and it will of course govern the abandonment of mining work started after DATE .", "( b ) The principle of the \u201c proportionality of acts of the administrative authorities \u201d entails that the authorities require the operator to take only those measures that are necessary in order to fulfil the objectives and preserve the interests enumerated in Articles DATE and CARDINAL of LAW . In assessing what is necessary , the authorities are not bound by the human , financial or technical capacities of the operator .", "( c ) The authorities have an obligation to ensure compliance with the measures that they have prescribed pursuant to the abovementioned provisions . In the event of any failure to act on the part of the operator , for any reason whatsoever , they must assume their powers of substitution under DATE . Failing that , the ORG 's responsibility may be totally or partially engaged in the event of non - performance .", "( d ) It follows from all the provisions of LAW that , unless otherwise agreed by the operator , the authorities can not impose measures without fixing a time - limit . The performance of such measures can not be required to continue in the long term , after the mining concession has expired , except in the case provided for LAW CARDINAL of the decree of CARDINAL DATE .", "( e ) In order to obtain formal confirmation , the operator must have performed the prescribed measures itself and is not entitled to have them performed by a third party , even if it provides that party with the requisite financial means .", "CARDINAL . As to the validity of clauses in property transfer agreements which exclude the liability of the mining or prospecting company ( section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE ) :", "( a ) Subject to the independent findings of the competent courts , it would appear that LAW of DATE , which renders null and void on public policy grounds any clause , in property transfer agreements between mining companies and local authorities or natural persons outside the profession , which excludes the liability of the company for any damage related to its mining activity , does not apply to agreements entered into before the entry into force of the said PERSON . Unless retroactive effect is expressly stipulated by the legislature , a new law will not affect the terms and conditions of an agreement that has become final prior to the entry into force of that law .", "( b ) Except in penal matters , the principle of non - retrospectivity of laws is not binding on the legislature , which may therefore decide to give retrospective effect to section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE .", "( c ) It is not possible to give a general answer to the question concerning the possibility for the court to rule out the application of clauses releasing the vendor from liability . It will be for the competent courts to assess such clauses on a case - by - case basis in the light of Article DATE of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant company applied to the PERSON d'Etat for a judgment declaring ultra vires and annulling the above - mentioned prefectoral orders and the implied decisions of DATE and DATE by which the Minister had refused to withdraw those orders . The applicant company sought the reimbursement of the expenses that it had paid out for the implementation of those orders . It claimed , in particular , that it was for the authorities to bear the cost of missions for the monitoring and verification of the measures that they themselves had imposed on the operator for the closure of the mines . Moreover , it argued that it no longer operated the mines at issue since DATE and that , having complied with the requirements laid down by the prefect with regard to the abandonment of mining operations , it had been released from its obligations as concession - holder . In this connection it pointed out that for CARDINAL concessions the renunciation had been accepted ( Valleroy and PERSON ) , whilst in the other cases , the abandonment had become effective after the completion of the work prescribed by the prefect in DATE or was still in progress . It lastly considered that , in respect of the former concessions in question , the declarations of abandonment and applications for renunciation had been filed with the prefecture before the entry into force of the Law of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) amending certain provisions of LAW and that those concessions could only therefore fall within the statutory and regulatory framework that existed prior to the entry into force of that PERSON ( former ORG DATE and CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

This also happened , with a few minor differences , in case no . DATE . Such a situation is difficult to accept . For the purposes of preparing the case properly the judge sets time - limits for the parties . In some cases , if requested , an extension of the time - limit may be granted .", "In the present case , however , it was only after DATE and in spite of a number of reminders that you filed your observations , and you did so after the case had been set down for hearing , placing the PERSON d'Etat before the fait accompli and obliging it to strike out the case .", "In DATE the Prime Minister adopted specific measures to ensure the defence of the ORG in good conditions and the proper operation of judicial proceedings .
