The relevant part of ORG judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c It is true that the law requires that a person claiming restitution of movable property should indicate and show where such property is . However , in the present case the plaintiff undoubtedly has no possibility of inspecting the LOC or safes of the former ORG in GPE as he is not allowed to enter those LOC . By insisting that the applicant should show that the coins are at the last known place , the ORG would impose a burden of proof on him which it is practically impossible to fulfil . On the contrary ... ORG neither showed that the former ORG in GPE had transferred the coins to a different authority nor did it propose to take evidence to that effect ...", "The ORG has established that the last time [ their exact location was known ] the coins ... had been held on the premises of ORG in GPE to which ORG is a successor , and it has not been shown that the coins were not on those LOC when FAC became operative , that is , on DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In the judgment , ORG admitted that the applicant had limited possibilities of locating his father \u2019s property . It had therefore taken further evidence on its own initiative . In particular , ORG noted that , in accordance with the relevant practice , the confiscated property should have been handed over to the public prosecutor and , after the relevant judgment had became final , to the financial department of the competent local government authority . ORG therefore examined the criminal file concerning the case of the applicant \u2019s father . It further established that the archives of ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG in GPE contained no document relating to the coins in question . ORG also heard a witness who had worked at ORG in DATE ; the latter had no knowledge of the case , however . It did not consider it necessary to hear CARDINAL other persons , CARDINAL of whom had been present when the coins were inventoried and taken over by ORG , as those persons had been dismissed from service in DATE and in DATE respectively . Their statements would not , therefore , make it possible to establish the relevant facts of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law .

In the judgment , ORG further stated :", "\u201c The allegation that the movable property in question had been taken over by an employee of ORG in GPE on CARDINAL DATE and that ... it had been examined there by an expert on DATE can not suffice .

The legislator , however , explicitly included in section CARDINAL ) of LAW the obligation to show where the movable property in question was at the time of the entry into force of that Act .", "... It follows from a logical and systematic interpretation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW that a restitution claim can only concern the same property which was taken over by the ORG and not a different object of the same kind .
