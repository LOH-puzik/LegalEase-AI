According to an expert report drawn up during the domestic proceedings in this case , the applicant has a diagnosis of mental impairment and , prior to the facts giving rise to this case , had been admitted to psychiatric hospitals twice . He also had a number of convictions against him , including for indecent assault , burglary and theft .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE , police in GPE were called out to deal with the applicant , who was sitting in a car sounding its horn repeatedly and behaving in a highly agitated manner . He was arrested at TIME and transferred to a police station , where it was noted that he was clearly suffering from some form of mental illness and that a doctor would be required . His detention was authorised under LAW of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The police also went to the applicant \u2019s address , where they found his aunt with serious and extensive injuries to her face and upper body , inflicted by the applicant . She was taken to hospital where a medical examination revealed cracked ribs and a collapsed lung .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was examined in his cell at TIME by ORG , PERSON In view of the applicant \u2019s behaviour , speech and appearance , he assessed him as not fit to be interviewed or charged with any criminal offence . A formal assessment under LAW DATE was requested . This was done at TIME by the psychiatric specialist registrar on call , Dr O. He concluded that the applicant was suffering from a mental illness of a nature or degree warranting detention in hospital in the interests of his health and safety and for the protection of other persons .", "CARDINAL . A second assessment was carried out shortly after TIME by another psychiatric specialist , Dr. PERSON He too advised that the applicant be formally admitted to hospital for assessment . He also advised that the applicant be observed via closed circuit television , since the presence of a police officer outside his cell was causing him to become agitated . For the remainder of his time at the police station , the applicant remained under continuous observation by this means .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , the applicant was visited by an approved social worker , PERSON He was also seen by a community psychiatric nurse , Mr J. Both noted that the applicant was displaying clear signs of mental illness . The social worker filled out the relevant form for admission to a mental hospital , omitting just one point , the name of the establishment , which had yet to be determined .", "CARDINAL . At TIME members of staff from a local psychiatric intensive care unit stated that their establishment would not be able to admit the applicant and advised that he be referred to ORG , which had a medium secure unit . The police thereupon contacted PERSON to inform them of the situation . Shortly after TIME , PERSON , a consultant forensic psychiatrist at PERSON , called back and was informed of the situation concerning the applicant . According to the custody record , he stated that someone would be sent over from the clinic . According to PERSON own notes on the situation , which the ORG have provided , he then consulted with a number of colleagues . Believing that the applicant would be charged and remanded in custody and that an assessment from ORG would be required only afterwards , they considered that there was no need for their involvement before such time . At TIME the police received a call from PERSON informing them that the clinic would not be sending anyone to the station , but would liaise with the social worker .", "CARDINAL . The custody record for the applicant \u2019s first day at the police station refers at several points to his disturbed behaviour : clapping loudly , shouting , banging on the door , lowering his trousers and waving his testicles about , and licking the wall of his cell . PERSON noted that the applicant repeatedly hit his head against the wall , causing himself bruising . He was provided with , and accepted , food and drink at intervals throughout DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , DATE , there were further telephone contacts between the police station and PERSON regarding the applicant \u2019s case . The police also contacted other mental health officials , but admission to PERSON remained the only viable solution . During the morning PERSON spoke with the duty solicitor of ORG , who informed him that should there be any evidence of the applicant assaulting his aunt then he would be charged and remanded in custody . In the event of no charge being brought , they agreed that the matter would be referred back to the doctor and social worker who had assessed the applicant DATE . In discussion with the clinical director of PERSON , PERSON noted that at that point there was no immediate action to be taken . He was later told by PERSON that the applicant would be charged with assault , and arranged an appointment to assess the applicant on DATE at ORG .", "CARDINAL . An entry in the custody record at TIME states that the duty solicitor of ORG had concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge the applicant . An entry at TIME states that there was an \u201c internal argument \u201d between doctors and the social services regarding the applicant . At TIME an entry was made in the custody record expressing concern and frustration at the lack of progress in relation to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s behaviour was observed to deteriorate over the course of DATE . By TIME he had removed all of his clothing . Later he drank water from the bowl of the toilet in his cell . He accepted CARDINAL meals , in DATE , TIME and in TIME . He accepted a drink at TIME , but , according to the custody record , refused all further offers of food and drink for the remainder of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE of the applicant \u2019s detention , DATE , the duty Inspector made an entry in the custody record at TIME noting his concern at the environment in which the applicant was detained , given his obvious illness . The applicant was still naked and was observed during TIME rocking to and fro on a bench , talking to himself , banging his chest and ranting .", "CARDINAL . Dr M. arrived at the police station shortly before TIME , accompanied by other mental health professionals from PERSON to assess the applicant . The police refused to open the door of the applicant \u2019s cell on the ground that this would endanger everyone \u2019s safety . The assessment was conducted through the hatch . PERSON noted that the applicant appeared agitated and was shouting loudly , and that his naked body appeared to be smeared with food or faeces . The applicant was elated , and his speech was incoherent at times . PERSON concluded that the applicant was clearly unwell and required inpatient treatment in a medium - secure setting with adequate nursing resources and a clear and effective care plan . He also advised that the applicant be charged so that he could be dealt with under the criminal justice and mental health systems . The police indicated that their advice from ORG was that there could be no charge at that point in time , given the impossibility of interviewing the applicant . PERSON said he would endeavour to get a place for the applicant at PERSON , although it would not be possible to receive him there until TIME , i.e. beyond the CARDINAL limit laid down by LAW DATE . TIME , ORG spoke to the clinical director of ORG , who agreed to receive the applicant the same evening .", "CARDINAL . Informed of this , PERSON discussed the situation with nursing staff at PERSON . He was informed that the resources needed to admit the applicant could be made available for the following morning at TIME at the earliest . He considered that an admission in TIME , i.e. just before the expiry of the permitted period of detention , would pose unmanageable risks for all concerned . He suggested to ORG that the applicant could be transferred to PERSON at the end of the CARDINAL-hour period , but that police assistance would be required to maintain him in safe conditions until it was possible to admit him . He was informed that the presence of the police could not be guaranteed for the whole period .", "CARDINAL . At TIME a call was received from PERSON to say that the applicant could not be taken until TIME . TIME , an Approved ORG from PERSON came to the police station to complete the necessary forms for the application \u2019s admission under LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was provided with food and drink at TIME , and further drinks of water during DATE ( TIME and TIME ) . At the end of the TIME a meal was not offered because the applicant was sleeping . He requested food at TIME , which was provided but which he dropped on the floor . He refused an offer of a meal and a drink at TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , the applicant was released from police custody at TIME and escorted , in handcuffs , to ORG . According to the Government , it took CARDINAL members of the nursing staff to restrain him once admitted . He was assessed as having pressure of speech , flight of ideas , a labile mood , thought disorder and persecutory delusions . The diagnosis was of a manic episode with psychotic features . The applicant was put into seclusion and given rapid tranquilisation on account of his bizarre behaviour and aggressive , threatening manner . He received continued medication over DATE and showed sustained improvement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged claims against the GPE and ORG for negligence , for breaches of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , and for misfeasance in public office . The defendant applied for summary judgment on the ground that the applicant had no real prospect of succeeding . A hearing was held on DATE before a District Judge . The applicant \u2019s counsel submitted a report prepared by a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist , PERSON , who had not interviewed the applicant but had reviewed the relevant documents . Dr PERSON considered that Dr M. should have assessed the applicant within TIME of being made aware of the situation , since by that stage the applicant had been detained for TIME . The delay in assessing him and in admitting him to PERSON had in turn delayed the applicant \u2019s treatment and recovery .", "CARDINAL . The judge granted the order for summary judgment . He held that although the defendant had owed the applicant a duty of care , and that that duty had been breached , it had not caused the applicant any physical or psychological injury . The action in negligence therefore failed on causation and loss . In any event , any loss had been absolutely minimal . A delay of TIME in the hospitalisation of the applicant could only lead to minimal damages . The judge also rejected the claim based on LAW on the grounds that Dr M. could not be seen as a public authority for the purposes of the LAW , and that the situation did not meet the minimum level of severity inherent in LAW . The applicant \u2019s claim for damages based on LAW was also dismissed , the judge finding that this was not an exceptional case in which compensation would be justified . The claim for misfeasance in public office could only succeed if the applicant could show complete and reckless disregard on the part of the defendant , which he had not done .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted permission to appeal . The case was heard at ORG by Judge PERSON , who dismissed the appeal in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The judge described the applicant \u2019s claim in negligence as \u201c hopeless \u201d , there being no details in the medical evidence submitted of any physical or psychiatric injury caused to the applicant . It was unrealistic to suggest that a delay of a given number of TIME ( the applicant \u2019s counsel having conceded that the delay was considerably TIME ) in some way caused that number of TIME of psychosis .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the claim under LAW , the judge considered that Dr M. should be viewed in that context as a \u201c public authority \u201d . However , the claim failed because the situation did not fall within DATE . The applicant had been lawfully detained and his basic needs had been met . The fact that he had spent CARDINAL - CARDINAL hours at the police station did not make the situation so appalling as to breach LAW . The judge found that there had been no breach of LAW because there had been no arbitrary or deliberate interference with the applicant \u2019s rights . As regards the claim for malfeasance , he concurred with the decision of LOC .", "CARDINAL . In light of these findings , the applicant \u2019s legal representatives advised him that legal aid would not be available for him to appeal the decision further .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides :", "\u201c Mentally disordered persons found in public places .", "( CARDINAL ) If a constable finds in a place to which the public have access a person who appears to him to be suffering from mental disorder and to be in immediate need of care or control , the constable may , if he thinks it necessary to do so in the interests of that person or for the protection of other persons , remove that person to a place of safety within the meaning of section CARDINAL above .", "( CARDINAL ) A person removed to a place of safety under this section may be detained there for a period not exceeding CARDINAL TIME for the purpose of enabling him to be examined by a registered medical practitioner and to be interviewed by an approved social worker and of making any necessary arrangements for his treatment or care . \u201d", "A \u201c place of safety \u201d is defined in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) as follows :", "\u201c In this section \u201c place of safety \u201d means residential accommodation provided by a local social services authority ... , a hospital as defined by this LAW , a police station , an independent hospital or care home for mentally disordered persons or any other suitable place the occupier of which is willing temporarily to receive the patient . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Code of Practice issued under LAW DATE provided at the relevant time :", "\u201c The place of safety", "CARDINAL The identification of preferred places of safety is a matter for local agreement . However , as a general rule it is preferable for a person thought to be suffering from mental disorder to be detained in a hospital rather than a police station . Regard should be had to any impact different types of place of safety may have on the person held and hence on the outcome of an assessment . Once the person has been removed to a particular place of safety , they can not be transferred to a different place of safety .", "...", "CARDINAL . Where a police station is used as a place of safety speedy assessment is desirable to ensure that the person spends no longer than necessary in police custody but is either returned to the community or admitted to hospital . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Extract from Report to the Government of GPE on the visit to GPE carried out by ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) from DATE to DATE :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG also has concerns with respect to the availability of appropriate psychiatric care for persons detained by the police . More than once , members of the ORG \u2019s delegation were told that the behaviour of some detained persons became so erratic that custody officers considered it necessary to tie them naked to a chair in order to prevent any acts of self - harm . Such treatment is clearly unacceptable and should be stopped immediately . In such cases police officers should immediately call a doctor and act in accordance with his instructions . Further , detained persons who display severe psychiatric disorders should be transferred without delay to a mental health facility .", "The ORG recommends that immediate steps be taken to ensure that detained persons with mental health disorders , held in police stations , are provided with appropriate care and treatment , until they are transferred to a mental health facility . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
