The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in Si\u00f3fok . The second applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were on an excursion to GPE . In TIME , they decided not to return home , but to spend TIME in their car , a ORG Punto , parked in a car park next to a pizzeria in GPE . Waking up , they noticed that a car was passing by theirs , coming back and forth several times . They found this frightening and drove on to the village of PERSON , where they stopped their car in the parking lot of a private house .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , TIME , an unknown person telephoned Mr S. , a volunteer law enforcer , to tell him about a ORG suspiciously moving around in the neighbourhood , near a local grocery store . Mr S. informed off - duty police officer PERSON , who was serving with ORG .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , officer PERSON , driving his private car and taking a self - defence pistol , went to inspect the grocery store , together with Mr S. Not having found any trace of a criminal offence , they notified the duty officer of ORG about the sighting of the suspicious car . They were informed about the identity of the owner of the ORG , following which they continued to look for the vehicle in the surrounding area .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , they noticed the ORG Punto parked in front of a private house . Officer PERSON stopped his vehicle , a black PERSON , perpendicularly to the applicants\u2019 car , QUANTITY away . Both officer PERSON and the volunteer law enforcer started to run towards the applicants\u2019 car , approaching from the back . The police officer shouted : \u201c Police ! Get out ! \u201d and held up his police identification card .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , sitting at the steering wheel , only noticed QUANTITY people getting out of a dark civilian car and running towards them in civilian clothes . Finding this frightening , she attempted to drive away , forcing the garden gate of the adjacent property and driving into its yard . Inside the garden , the dimensions of which were QUANTITY , and noticing that there was no other way to exit , she turned the car around and drove back towards the gate .", "CARDINAL . When the car was on its way out , officer PERSON waved at the car shouting \u201c Police ! Stop ! \u201d and fired a warning shot . As it appears from the case file , at this time Mr S. was standing in front of the police officer \u2019s car , rather than in the prospective way of the applicants\u2019 car . When the car passed officer PERSON , he shot twice more , at the car . The first shot was fired downwards from CARDINAL metres\u2019 distance , hitting the mudguard of the car on the left side at the level of the lights . The other shot was fired from QUANTITY following a downward trajectory . It went through the rear window , which fell into the car , missed the head of PERSON by LAW and then went through the window of the right front door .", "CARDINAL . Ms Ha\u00e1sz continued to drive , trying to leave the garden by passing around the police officer \u2019s car to the left . She finally hit the officer \u2019s car at its right side , at the passenger front door . At this moment PERSON was standing next to the police officer \u2019s car , at its left side , next to the open driver \u2019s door .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON again called on the applicants to get out of the car , which they did . He put his gun away , presenting his police ID . Since the CARDINAL men wore plain clothes and neither they nor their car had any police signs , the applicants realised that officer PERSON was a police officer and his associate a volunteer law enforcer only at this point in time .", "Thereupon it became clear that the incident was based on a misunderstanding , since the applicants had only been frightened but had had no intention whatsoever of countering a police measure .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the Veszpr\u00e9m District Investigating Prosecutor \u2019s Office ( Veszpr\u00e9mi Nyomoz\u00f3 \u00dcgy\u00e9szs\u00e9g ) initiated proceedings against officer PERSON on charges of attempted manslaughter ( the charge being later on re - characterised as intentional endangerment committed by a public official ) . The applicants were questioned several times as witnesses , and a confrontation took place . Other witnesses were also heard and the opinion of a forensic firearms expert was obtained .", "CARDINAL . Simultaneously , officer PERSON \u2019s superior , ORG , investigated the use of a firearm by officer PERSON found that the officer had had no intention of endangering human life \u2013 his purpose had been to halt the applicants\u2019 car , which had represented a danger for him and his associate \u2013 but that the officer \u2019s action , although not criminal , had been unprofessional . According to the superior \u2019s internal report , following a first warning shot , a second , intentional shot had been directed at the car , while the third one had been accidental , endangering the life of PERSON . The supervisor initiated disciplinary proceedings , which were suspended pending the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also lodged a complaint formally challenging the lawfulness of the police measures with ORG . These proceedings were suspended on DATE pending the outcome of the criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Veszpr\u00e9m District Investigating Prosecutor \u2019s Office discontinued the investigation . It found that officer PERSON \u2019s use of firearms was lawful in the face of the danger represented by the conduct of the applicants , namely driving , at a speed of QUANTITY , in the direction of his associate .", "ORG accepted officer PERSON \u2019s statements , according to which he had given a warning before shooting and had first shot on perceiving a danger to the life of his associate . It also accepted the police officer \u2019s account of the events , namely that at the material time he could believe that his associate was standing between his car and the car of the applicants , which was approaching rather fast . Nonetheless , relying on the evidence furnished by a ballistic expert , ORG dismissed officer ORG statement that the second shot following the warning had been accidental .", "The decision also relied on the report of the Chief of ORG stating that officer PERSON \u2019s conduct had been unprofessional as regards the second shot fired at the applicants\u2019 car .", "The applicants\u2019 lawyer filed a complaint against the discontinuation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Veszpr\u00e9m County Public Prosecutor \u2019s Office ( Veszpr\u00e9m Megyei F\u0151\u00fcgy\u00e9szs\u00e9g ) dismissed the complaint , holding that the danger caused by the applicants had directly concerned the life and limb of officer PERSON \u2019s associate . Relying on section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW on the Police , the Prosecutor \u2019s Office found that the risk that the associate might be hit by their car had justified the shots by officer PERSON even if they had not been preceded by the requisite procedure , in particular a warning about the use of firearms , since any delay caused by the warning could have compromised the success of the measure . According to the decision , the applicants\u2019 behaviour had constituted a direct threat to the life and limb of both PERSON and officer PERSON", "The applicants were informed that the complaint had been dismissed under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) point b ) of LAW and that they had the possibility of filing a motion for prosecution , acting as substitute private prosecutors , under sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW .", "The decision was served on the applicants on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Veszpr\u00e9m County Public Prosecutor \u2019s Office rejected the ORG renewed complaint . ORG informed the applicants that the prosecution authorities would not deal with any further complaint unless it disclosed relevant new facts .", "In a letter of DATE the Attorney ORG informed the applicants that there was no legal ground to quash the decisions on the discontinuation of the investigation in respect of officer PERSON", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE ORG dismissed , in its resumed proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG complaint about the actions of officer PERSON concluded that although the latter \u2019s conduct had been unprofessional because of the way he had halted the applicants\u2019 car and the use of a self - defence pistol rather than a service pistol , it had not been unlawful . The ORG appeal was dismissed by the ORG Chief Police Department on DATE .", "Since the incident , the applicants have been suffering from psychological troubles ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
