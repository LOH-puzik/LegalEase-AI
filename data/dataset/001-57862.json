SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . PERSON and PERSON , who are husband and wife , are NORP citizens and live in Gryta in the municipality of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicants have owned a property in ORG , adjacent to land on which a company - PERSON ( ORG ) - takes delivery of and treats household and industrial waste , amongst other things . ORG has been authorised to engage in this activity on the land in question since DATE , when ORG ( koncessionsn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r milj\u00f6skydd - \" ORG \" ) first issued it with a permit to this effect under the provisions of the DATE LAW ( milj\u00f6skyddslagen GPE CARDINAL Act \" ) .", "CARDINAL . Prior to this , it had been discovered in DATE that refuse containing cyanide had been left on the dump and analyses of drinking - water emanating from a nearby well had shown excessive levels of cyanide in the water . ORG ( h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rdsn\u00e4mnden , later named milj\u00f6 - och h\u00e4lsoskyddsn\u00e4mnden ) of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s had prohibited the use of the water and had provisionally supplied the property owner dependent on the well with municipal drinking - water .", "Further analyses effected in DATE showed excessive levels of cyanide in CARDINAL other wells near the dump , CARDINAL of which was on the applicants\u2019 property . As a result , the use of the water from these wells too was prohibited and the landowners concerned , including the applicants , were temporarily provided with municipal drinking - water .", "However , in DATE ORG ( livsmedelsverket ) recommended that the maximum permitted level of cyanide be raised from CARDINAL mg to QUANTITY . As a result , as of DATE , the municipality stopped supplying the above - mentioned landowners with water .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG asked ORG to renew its permit and to allow it to expand its activities on the dump . The applicants together with other landowners demanded that the request should not be granted without an obligation being imposed on ORG , by way of precautionary measure under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , to supply drinking - water free of charge to the owners concerned , as the proposed activity entailed and would continue to entail a risk of polluting their water .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG granted ORG \u2019s request and dismissed the ORG and the other ORG claim , on the ground that there was no likely water connection between the dump and the wells . It further stated that , notwithstanding a possible risk of pollution , it would be unreasonable to make the authorisation in question conditional upon such a general measure as that suggested by the claimants .", "On the other hand , the ORG attached a number of conditions to the granting of the permit , including the requirement that the water in the wells be carefully analysed at regular intervals and that the owners be informed of the results . Should the analyses give reason to suspect that the dump was causing pollution of the water , ORG would be under an obligation to take immediately any such action to supply the owners with water as deemed appropriate by ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to the Government , challenging the conditions set for the permit . The Government , as the final instance of appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , upheld these and dismissed the appeal on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the DATE Act , any use of land that may cause , inter alia , water pollution is considered an environmentally hazardous activity for the purposes of the LAW .", "Section CARDINAL provides :", "\" A person who engages in or intends to engage in an environmentally hazardous activity shall take such protective action , comply with such restrictions on the activity and take such other precautionary measures as may reasonably be required in order to prevent or remedy its detrimental effects . The duty to remedy detrimental effects continues to apply after the activity has ceased .", "In assessing the extent of obligations imposed under the first paragraph , regard should be had to what is technically feasible for the activity in question as well as to the public and private interests involved .", "In striking a balance between the various interests , particular weight should be attached , on the one hand , to the nature of the area that may be subjected to disturbance and to the impact of the disturbance and , on the other hand , to the usefulness of the activity , the costs of protective action and other financial implications of the precautionary measures in issue . \"", "CARDINAL . A decision by ORG authorising an environmentally hazardous activity must specify what activity is being permitted and on what conditions ( section CARDINAL ) . It may be appealed against to the Government by any person concerned ( section CARDINAL ) . At the time of the Government \u2019s dismissal of the ORG appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , its decisions were not subject to judicial review ( for further details on this point , see , in particular , the GPE and PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) . Since the entry into force , on DATE , of the Act on ORG of certain ORG , the lawfulness of a number of decisions by the ORG may be challenged before ORG . However , it was not possible for the applicants to avail themselves of this remedy in respect of the Government \u2019s decision as the LAW did not have retroactive effect .", "CARDINAL . ORG is composed of a chairman and CARDINAL other members , all of whom are appointed by the Government . The chairman is required to be well - versed in legal matters and experienced in performing judicial tasks ; in addition , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL members must have expertise and experience in technological matters , the second must have experience in activities falling within the competence of ORG ( naturv\u00e5rdverket ) and the third in industrial operations ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section DATE , a claim relating to an environmentally hazardous activity may be filed with ORG ( fastighetsdomstolen ) , a specially composed chamber of ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) . Such a claim may , for instance , seek to have the activity made conditional upon protective or precautionary measures being taken .", "On the other hand , section CARDINAL provides that the holder of a permit granted under LAW may not be ordered to discontinue the activity in question or to take precautionary measures other than those , if any , specified in the permit . The exceptions to this rule , contained in sections DATE , DATE and DATE , are not relevant to the present case .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the DATE LAW ( milj\u00f6skadelagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL - \" LAW \" ) , a person who has suffered damage or injury as a result of pollution of groundwater or watercourses may lodge a claim for compensation with ORG . The claim may be brought against the person or persons who have caused the deleterious activity to be carried on ( section CARDINAL ) .", "A condition for compensation is that there be a substantial probability of a causal link between the impugned activity and the damage or injury ( section CARDINAL ) . The fact that the activity has been authorised under LAW is not a bar to liability under LAW .", "A decision by ORG on a compensation claim as mentioned above may be appealed against to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) and , with leave , to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
