{"ITEMID": "001-70577", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "HUKIC v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON , PERSON and their CARDINAL children , PERSON and PERSON , are nationals of GPE , and were born in DATE , DATE , respectively . They are currently in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are ORG and , until their departure from GPE , they lived in GPE . On DATE the first applicant arrived in GPE and applied for asylum and a residence permit . On DATE the other CARDINAL applicants arrived and joined the first applicant \u2019s request for asylum and residence permits . Before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) they stated that their primary reason for requesting asylum was that the fourth applicant suffered from PERSON \u2019s syndrome ( a genetic disorder that causes mental retardation , severe learning disabilities and other problems ) and epilepsy for which he had received no treatment or care in GPE . On the contrary , he had been considered as a lower ranking person and treated in a degrading manner by physicians and people in their surroundings .", "The applicants\u2019 second reason for requesting asylum was that the first applicant had belonged to a special unit of the police which , in DATE , had arrested PERSON , a dangerous criminal with ties to the mafia who had been wanted by ORG . PERSON had tried to escape but the first applicant and another police officer had managed to catch him . On his arrest , ORG had repeatedly threatened the first applicant . After DATE in prison , ORG had been released . However , just after F.O. \u2019s arrest , the applicants had started to receive telephone threats and the first applicant had been attacked by unknown men in DATE and again in DATE , DATE and DATE . Each time he had managed to defend himself but his aggressors had threatened him and had mentioned F.O. \u2019s name . The first applicant had talked to his superiors about the threats and attacks , but he had received no support or protection . Thus , he had had to leave the country since F.O. had contacts all over the country and the applicants therefore would not be safe anywhere in GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application . It noted that the purported threats and attacks had been carried out by criminals and were not sanctioned by the national authorities . It considered that the applicants had neither exhausted the possibilities to get help and protection in their home country nor shown that the national authorities would be unwilling or unable to help them . Thus , the applicants could not be granted asylum . As concerned the fourth applicant , ORG considered that his handicap was not of such a kind that the family could be granted residence permits on humanitarian grounds . In reaching this conclusion , ORG noted that there was medical care available in GPE and considered that the availability of care of a higher standard in GPE was not a reason to let the family stay .", "On DATE ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) upheld ORG decision in full and ordered the applicants to leave GPE within DATE .", "The applicants lodged a new application for residence permits on humanitarian grounds with ORG . They stated that the conditions for handicapped children were very poor in GPE and that there was no care or treatment for persons with PERSON \u2019s syndrome . ORG \u2019s attitude was that these children should not have been born . Although almost DATE , the fourth applicant could not yet walk , stand or eat by himself . Moreover , his legs were shaking , he had a low immune defence and was lacking thyroxin ( a hormone that regulates the metabolic activity of the body by controlling the rate of oxidation in cells and , when too low , retards growth and mental development in children ) . In GPE he was receiving treatment and rehabilitation measures which were essential for his development and to which he was responding positively .", "On DATE ORG rejected the new application . It stated that it had already considered the fourth applicant \u2019s health in its previous decision and it found no reason to change that decision on the basis of the new information relied on by the applicants .", "In the meantime , since the applicants had refused to leave GPE voluntarily and ORG had refused to stay the enforcement of the deportation order awaiting its new decision , the matter had been handed over to the police who had scheduled their deportation to GPE for DATE . However , on that date the applicants could not be found at their home . On DATE , the NORP immigration authorities requested GPE to accept the family back in accordance with LAW as they , on DATE , had requested asylum in GPE . On DATE ORG accepted the request and , on DATE , the applicants were returned from GPE to GPE and renewed their request for asylum and residence permits . They maintained their earlier claims and added that during their stay in GPE the fourth applicant \u2019s health had regressed as he had not received proper medication and the entire family was in poor mental health . Furthermore , they had no economic resources to survive in GPE and no social assistance .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application . It observed that the applicants\u2019 reasons for asylum had already been considered once and it found no grounds on which to change its former decision . It further decided that the applicants should be deported immediately since it was evident that they would not be granted asylum or leave to stay for any other reason . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision in full .", "The applicants lodged a new application for asylum with ORG , adding to their earlier claims that the first applicant had lodged a complaint with ORG threats to his family which was being investigated . Although GPE had now been convicted of serious crimes and was in prison , the result of the investigation could show that the applicants were in need of protection in GPE . Moreover , the fourth applicant \u2019s health had regressed somewhat and he was in need of more support and treatment .", "On DATE ORG rejected the new application on the grounds that it was up to the national authorities to protect the applicants against criminals within the country and that there were no circumstances which indicated that the authorities in GPE situation , ORG found that it would not constitute a violation of humanitarian standards to deport the applicants to their home country .", "On DATE ORG rejected yet another new application for residence permits by the applicants as they had invoked no new circumstances .", "The applicants have submitted CARDINAL medical certificates concerning the fourth applicant , both issued by CARDINAL specialists in child and youth neurology , PERSON and PERSON .", "The first medical certificate was dated DATE and stated that the fourth applicant was born with PERSON \u2019s syndrome and that he had a lack of thyroxin . Moreover , he suffered from an epileptic illness ( the PERSON - Kleffner syndrome ) which had caused him to lose his ability to talk and communicate . He received medication and treatment for his handicap and illnesses but was in need of regular examinations . Furthermore , it was very important that he followed continuous treatment on several levels in order to have some quality of life . This sort of treatment was not available in GPE and GPE .", "The second medical certificate was dated DATE and , besides referring to the above certificate , it stated the following : The fourth applicant has PERSON \u2019s syndrome and an epileptic illness which involves epileptic activities in the brain and the loss of language as well as the understanding of language . As concerns his PERSON \u2019s syndrome , he was undergoing good rehabilitation training , physiotherapy , occupational therapy , special education and speech therapy . They were concentrating on communication and motor activity . His problems with swallowing would be examined by a speech therapist together with a dietician . He had shown clear progress after treatment with Lamictal ( an anti - epileptic medicine ) and had regained an interest in communication and could also pronounce one or CARDINAL single words , a progress from having been completely wordless and almost without any interest in interplay with others . For the future , the physicians were planning continued rehabilitation and a renewed evaluation of his epilepsy to see how he had reacted to the medication . He would probably need an increased dose of Lamictal after the evaluation . In conclusion the physicians stated that he was reacting very well to the treatment and for this positive development to continue it was an absolute prerequisite that he remain in GPE or another NORP country where he could receive the same treatment .", "The applicants submitted a letter , dated DATE , by Prof . Dr. PERSON , ScD , and Ass . Dr. PERSON , GPE . at ORG in GPE , which provided the following information :", "At ORG it was possible to diagnose PERSON \u2019s syndrome and to follow up the functions of the thyroid and to offer treatment for thyroid disorders . It was also possible to diagnose epilepsy , to prescribe Lamictal treatment and to have a child followed by neuro - paediatricians , endocrinologists , cardiologists , clinical geneticists and other specialists . However , at the moment , they could not promise that it would be possible to include a child in programmes of neuro - developing and stimulating exercises , speech pathology , psychological treatment or to include a child in a special school or pedagogical programme . Moreover , in the area , there were not enough institutions to receive and help all children with special needs and so parents were forced to care for their children and to implement necessary treatment in accordance with their financial capabilities .", "According to information from DATE , there were special programmes for the social and health protection of children and families , the mentally handicapped , the elderly and civilian war victims . All CARDINAL cantons in GPE and GPE provided social and child protection within CARDINAL local centers . Most of these institutes had been modernized , and some had been newly established . There were also centers for persons with mental and physical handicaps .", "Furthermore , in DATE the LAW on the protection of mentally handicapped persons was adopted in GPE . It provides for basic principles , means of organization and the realization of the protection of mentally handicapped persons , and it contains , inter alia , provisions relating to health care and the rights and obligations of beneficiaries ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
