The first applicant is a child born out of wedlock in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and her mother ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) filed a civil suit against GPE ( \u201c the respondent \u201d ) , a very popular local singer , before ORG in GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in order to establish paternity and obtain child maintenance .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , CARDINAL hearings were scheduled , CARDINAL of which were held and another CARDINAL adjourned . During that time , though duly summoned , the respondent failed to appear in court on CARDINAL occasions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and in compliance with an order issued by ORG , ORG conducted blood tests , having taken samples provided by the CARDINAL parties , and found that the probability that the respondent was the father of the first applicant was PERCENT and , as such , \u201c highly likely \u201d .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE , on CARDINAL separate occasions , DNA testing was attempted but each time , unlike the applicants , the respondent , though duly summoned , failed to appear at the clinic where the appointment was scheduled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled in favour of the applicants . In so doing , it established the respondent 's paternity , partly granted the child maintenance requested and issued an interim maintenance order . In its reasoning , inter alia , the court relied on the findings of ORG , as well as the respondent 's failure to appear at the clinic in order to undergo a DNA test . Finally , it noted that the relevant legislation did not provide for a possibility to subject the respondent to a DNA test against his will and held that there was no evidence that would have justified the rejection of the applicants ' claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a supplementary judgment , granting the applicants ' request for statutory interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the respondent filed an appeal with ORG in GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgments of ORG and remitted the case for a retrial . In its reasons , inter alia , it stated that the respondent had apparently been unable to attend the scheduled DNA tests but that he would now be willing to do so . The court added that the facts of the case concerning child maintenance also required further clarification .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the President of ORG informed the applicants that he had instructed the presiding judge in their case to proceed expeditiously .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again ruled in favour of the applicants . In so doing , it established the respondent 's paternity , partly granted the child maintenance requested and issued an interim maintenance order . The reasons offered , for the most part , were identical to those contained in its prior ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision correcting an obvious error contained in its judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the respondent filed an appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again quashed the decisions of ORG and remitted the case for a retrial . In its reasoning it held that the civil parties needed to be heard again , that the actual moment of conception of the first applicant needed to be determined precisely in order to find out whether the second applicant had sexual relations with the respondent at that particular time , and that the DNA test needed to be attempted yet again . The court further explained that , should the respondent again fail to be tested , ORG would need to address ORG in order to find out whether the fact that the first applicant was DATE when she was last tested ( in DATE ) meant that a new blood test might now be warranted . If so , following a new blood test and even in the absence of a DNA test , a new judgment should be rendered , due consideration being given to the respondent 's refusal to submit to a DNA test . The court concluded by stating that the facts of the case concerning child maintenance also required additional clarification .", "CARDINAL . The actual case file was not physically returned to ORG until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing thereafter was initially scheduled for DATE . In DATE , however , this hearing was cancelled by ORG itself , apparently without any reasons being specified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to request an expert medical opinion in line with the directions given by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same court heard the second applicant as well as the respondent .

On DATE the medical expert invited the parties in the case to attend a meeting scheduled for DATE . On the said date , the applicants appeared but not the respondent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the medical expert provided his opinion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the appointment of a new presiding judge in the case , ORG relieved the second applicant of her obligation to pay for the costs of the proceedings at issue . It stated , inter alia , that she was unemployed and unable to cover these costs without endangering the most basic needs of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , inter alia , heard the parties to the proceedings , ordered them to provide the court with the relevant information concerning the maintenance sought and informed them that the DNA test was to be carried out on DATE and DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants duly appeared on those dates but the respondent did not .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicants submitted the maintenance - related information requested .

On DATE ORG adjourned the hearing scheduled for DATE because the forensic expert in question had been \u201c unavailable \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held on DATE ORG finally heard this expert .", "CARDINAL .

In its reasoning , based on the relevant provisions of LAW , as well as bearing in mind the views expressed by ORG in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , inter alia , attached particular weight to the fact that the respondent had refused to be subjected to a DNA test , as the single most reliable way of confirming or refuting his paternity . Finally , the court noted that the second applicant was unemployed and indigent , which is why the respondent was ordered to pay the said child maintenance . The applicants were served with this judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the respondent filed an appeal with ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , relying on LAW , upheld the impugned judgment but reduced the costs awarded to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the respondent filed an appeal on points of law ( revizija ) . On CARDINAL DATE ORG confirmed the lower courts ' judgments as regards the respondent 's paternity and upheld the maintenance ordered in the amount of ORG CARDINAL DATE ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) . At the same time , however , it quashed the said judgments in respect of the remainder of the maintenance awarded , as well as the costs , and ordered that these CARDINAL issues be re - examined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant was diagnosed with asthma .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed that the second applicant was unemployed and secured her an internship at ORG in GPE .

The applicants further referred to numerous reports in the NORP media concerning the above proceedings , as well as their own and the respondent 's personal circumstances .

Further , LAW provides that it shall be applied to all ongoing judicial proceedings instituted prior to DATE , unless the competent court , in the specific proceedings at issue , had already adopted a first instance decision before that date .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provided that the courts were to determine civil matters according to their own discretion after carefully assessing all the evidence presented individually and as a whole , and taking into account the results of the overall proceedings .", "CARDINAL .
