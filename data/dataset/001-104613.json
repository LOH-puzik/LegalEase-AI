On DATE Mr Ma . was not admitted to see the applicant on the ground that the permit allegedly contained flaws . On DATE he complained about that to the Chief of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Ma . also complained to the KCPO that the investigator was obstructing his participation in the investigative measures . He submitted in particular that he had not been duly notified of the investigative activities , which were conducted in his absence . Furthermore , he complained that the lawyer appointed for the applicant was incompetent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief of ORG wrote to PERSON . that indeed the ORG official had wrongly impeded his meetings with the applicant for which he had been disciplined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a preparatory hearing at which it maintained the first applicant 's detention . The materials submitted by the parties to the ORG did not contain a copy of that ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , under the presidency of Judge PERSON , acquitted the applicant on all the charges , while the other co - defendant , PERSON , was found guilty of an unrelated instance of illegal possession of weapons ( a hunting gun and a box of bullets \u2013 of no relation to the murder of PERSON had been discovered in his garage ) . The court found that there was no evidence of the defendants ' guilt and that their confessions had been extracted by force .", "CARDINAL . The judgment noted as follows :", "\u201c As it had been stated by the defendants in the course of the pre - trial investigation and later confirmed during the trial , ... the police had applied physical and psychological violence to them with the intention of coercing them into confessing to the murder which they had not committed and the circumstances of which they had found out from the police .", "There are no doubts about that , as it clearly transpires from the case file that the defendants were under arrest when they wrote their confessions . They name specific officers of ORG as behaving violently towards them , and give a detailed account of their actions . The medical examinations held at the defendants ' requests [ ... ] revealed injuries to their bodies . During the pre - trial investigation [ the applicant and PERSON ] retracted their confessions to the crime against the family of PERSON . and complained to various authorities that they had been illtreated in police custody . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court noted that both the circumstances and motives of the crime were presented inconsistently in the confessions of the co - defendants . It observed that they had attracted the suspicion of the police only because the son of PERSON , who had happened to see them together in the street , believed that their statures and size were similar to those of the offenders . The court found that that investigation had wrongly taken over that wholly unsubstantiated argument . Moreover , it recognised all the findings of the investigation as mere presumptions not corroborated by any evidence .", "CARDINAL . The court further observed that the pre - trial investigation relied \u201c as one of the key pieces of evidence proving the defendants ' guilt \u201d on the statements of a taxi driver , PERSON , who stated that he had taken CARDINAL passengers somewhere close to the building where the murder took place . The court noted , however , that his description of those passengers changed on DATE in comparison with that given earlier on CARDINAL March CARDINAL . While PERSON had not been able to indicate any specific features of their appearance , he later recognised the first applicant from a choice of CARDINAL persons \u201c by his size \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As to the other evidence , CARDINAL witnesses had seen QUANTITY persons running down the stairs close to the murder site , but they were not able to identify them as the defendants . The investigation had also found a box containing bullets at Mr M. 's home , but they were of a different type from the one with which the victim had been shot .", "CARDINAL . The court lifted the preventive measure concerning the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE , ORG issued a separate ruling , by which it brought to the attention of the ORG , ORG and ORG the following violations :", "\u201c [ the defendants ] had been detained for fictitious reasons ; they had not been examined in the presence of attested witnesses ; neither the reasons for the detention nor their right to defence had been explained to them ; and their relatives had not been informed that they were detained \u201d .", "CARDINAL . It was also noted in the separate ruling that the defendants had consistently complained that they had been ill - treated in police custody , naming the police officers involved , and that injuries had been discovered on their bodies . The court considered that the doctor who had examined the applicant on CARDINAL DATE had come to a superficial and unfounded conclusion that there were no injuries caused by electric current .", "DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG also issued another ruling , by which it quashed the prosecutor 's decision of DATE not to open a criminal case into the applicant 's allegation that he had been ill - treated in police custody .", "CARDINAL . PERSON ( the son and husband of the deceased PERSON having victim status in the proceedings ) appealed against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . In DATE they challenged before ORG the composition of ORG , which was to examine their appeal , on the ground that some of its judges allegedly had friendly relations with Judge PERSON under whose presidency the impugned judgment had been delivered at first instance . They further contended that certain judges there were members of the regional lawyers ' qualification and disciplinary board to which the defendants ' lawyers also belonged . PERSON therefore sought the transfer of the case to any other regional appellate court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy President of ORG instructed ORG to transfer the case to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) \u201c with a view to ensuring the most comprehensive and objective examination of the case \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the first - instance court had failed to assess all the evidence in the case thoroughly and conclusively and that it had accepted the defendants ' allegations that they had been ill - treated in police custody , without having taken into consideration the related findings of the prosecution authorities . It also remarked that no assessment had been made of the confessions by the defendants in the presence of their lawyers . The ORG noted that some hearings had been held without the prosecutor 's participation , and that ORG had not responded to the victims ' request for remittal of the case for additional investigation , by which they had sought application of a stricter provision of LAW . On those grounds , ORG quashed both the acquittal and the CARDINAL rulings of ORG of DATE , and remitted the case to it for fresh examination by a different panel .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the victims ' request for transfer of the case to any other trial court in the NORP region , as such a transfer would be contrary to LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the lawyer representing the victims requested ORG to transfer the case from ORG to a court in a different region . He noted that Judge PERSON under whose presidency the case had earlier been examined ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , was the Deputy President of ORG and that he would therefore influence the proceedings regardless of the panel 's composition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the First Deputy President of ORG , while finding no grounds to transfer the case to a different region , instructed ORG to consider transferring it to another court within the GPE region .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transferred the case to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , within the GPE region .", "DATE . On DATE ORG held a preparatory hearing , during which the victims unsuccessfully sought a change of preventive measure in respect of the defendants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again rejected the victims ' request for pre - trial detention of the co - defendants instead of an undertaking not to abscond . The court noted that the co - defendants had not been evading or impeding the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remitted the case to the KCPO for additional investigation , indicating CARDINAL shortcomings in the investigation previously undertaken , which could not be remedied in the course of the trial .", "CARDINAL . The court noted , inter alia , that the defendants ' confessions lacked consistency , as did the statements by the witnesses and the victim ( Mr I. , the son of PERSON ) . It observed in particular that PERSON had initially stated on several occasions that he and his mother had been attacked by their business competitors . Later in the trial , he changed both his description of the perpetrators ' appearance ( which then contradicted that given by some other witnesses ) and his version as to who they might have been . Furthermore , the case file contained a report from the police , according to which one of the taxi drivers had heard from a neighbour of PERSON that the latter had been receiving threatening telephone calls because she had reduced the prices of her products . There was no further investigation into the matter .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court also noted that the investigator had given no reasoning for having changed the charges against the applicant from murder to inflicting grievous bodily harm causing death , with a new charge of illegal possession of weapons added .", "CARDINAL . The Shepetivka Court next expressed its concern over the way the investigation had received the statements by the taxi driver PERSON ( according to the court 's ruling DATE a key witness in the case ) , who had recognised the applicant as CARDINAL of his CARDINAL passengers whom he had driven to the building where the crime was committed , around the time of the murder , had waited for there for TIME and had then driven to a caf\u00e9 . The court noted that on DATE the investigator had questioned PERSON as a witness in the case concerning the murder of PERSON , while at the same time PERSON was detained in the PERSON on suspicion of illegal drug possession . While both PERSON and the investigator denied the above in the course of the applicant 's trial , the ORG administration confirmed that on the aforementioned date , which was also the documented date of PERSON questioning as a witness , he had been in detention in the ORG . Moreover , according to the register of detainees ' movements , on the above - mentioned date PERSON was in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court noted that the defendants ' allegations that they had been ill - treated in police custody had not been duly investigated . Its critical remarks included the following :", "\u201c The [ KCPO ] refused to open a criminal case relying on the absolutely identical explanations of the [ police officers ] , who are interested persons and whom the defendants accuse of torture , as well as the conclusions of the internal investigation undertaken by senior [ police officers ] in respect of their own subordinates , which the court considers unacceptable .", "At the same time , the [ KCPO ] failed to clarify why , for what reasons , under what circumstances and in what manner [ the applicant ] sustained the injuries while being held in the ORG , but not in the GPE , for DATE .", "... The case file contains a forensic medical report , according to which [ the applicant 's ] injuries might have originated from electric shocks .", "... Given the discrepancies in the medical findings ... , an additional forensic medical examination should be undertaken ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , ORG issued a separate ruling indicating a number of gross violations of the criminal procedural legislation in the course of the pre - trial investigation , similar to those mentioned in the separate ruling of ORG of DATE . The court again criticised the investigation undertaken into the allegations of both defendants about their ill - treatment in police custody . It made , in particular , the following observation :", "\u201c The prosecutor entrusted the official investigation into the use of force on the defendants directly to the supervisors of the officers whom the defendants accuse of torture , and that investigation yielded a decision that there had been nothing criminal in the actions of those officers . The court considers this unacceptable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court noted that the investigators had imposed on the applicant an appointed lawyer , although the applicant had already been represented by a lawyer of his own choosing , who remained uninformed about the investigative measures undertaken .", "CARDINAL . The victims appealed against the aforementioned rulings of ORG . At the same time , they opposed the examination of the case by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the First Deputy President of ORG again instructed ORG to transfer the case to ORG , referring to the reasoning given in support of such transfer in his letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent the case file to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed , on formal grounds , the separate ruling of ORG of DATE and upheld the decision of the KCPO of DATE refusing to institute criminal proceedings against police officers on the first applicant 's complaint that he had been ill - treated . ORG concluded that the requirements of LAW ORG had not been complied with : there had been no written application for quashing the refusal of DATE , and , in any event , such an application would have had to be lodged with ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG also excluded from the ORG ruling of DATE remitting the case for additional investigation all issues other than those concerning the classification of the defendants ' actions under LAW and assessment of the testimony of the son of PERSON Thus , ORG noted in its ruling as follows :", "\u201c In the light of all the materials of the case , namely , the collected evidence , the nature of the criminal actions , the instrument of the crime being a firearm , the conclusions of the forensic medical expert on the location and nature of the wounds , the bench considers that the victim 's ... life was taken deliberately and thus there is every ground to classify the defendants ' actions under a different criminal provision envisaging liability for a more grievous crime \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the first applicant was arrested by the investigator on suspicion of premeditated murder . The investigator substantiated this decision with the standard wording of the arrest report template , which read as follows :", "\u201c the eyewitnesses , including the victims , directly indicate this person as the one who committed the crime \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the KCPO ordered the applicant 's release with a reference to the criminal procedure provisions concerning a replacement of CARDINAL preventive measure by another .", "CARDINAL . On DATE first applicant complained to the ORG about the alleged unlawfulness of his detention during the aforementioned period .", "CARDINAL . In line with the aforementioned ruling of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the first applicant challenged the ORG 's ruling of DATE before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the ruling of DATE and remitted the case to the KCPO , allowing the complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the aforementioned ruling of CARDINAL DATE on the ORG 's appeal and ruled that the investigation into the alleged ill - treatment was to take place within the first applicant 's own criminal case , which was being examined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator brought formal charges against the first applicant on CARDINAL counts of premeditated murder for profit ( considering that he had also attempted to kill the son of PERSON and failed for reasons beyond his control ) , violent robbery and illegal possession of weapons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator applied to ORG for replacement of the preventive measure in respect of the first applicant from the undertaking not to abscond to pre - trial detention . Referring to the seriousness of the charges as advanced on DATE and the inherent risk of absconding , the investigator submitted that detention was a more appropriate preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG \u2013 at the hearing with the participation of the first applicant and his lawyer \u2013 examined the aforementioned application of the investigator as well as the first applicant 's complaint about the alleged unlawfulness of his detention from DATE . The court lifted the applicant 's undertaking not to abscond and remanded him in custody at the prosecutor 's request . It dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant 's complaint about his arrest of DATE . The court gave as the reasons for the new preventive measure the fact that the applicant was suspected of serious crimes and that he could abscond or hinder the establishment of the truth . The court referred to unspecified statements made by the victims . As regards the applicant 's complaint about his detention from CARDINAL to DATE , it noted that there were no reasons to consider it unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant 's father and lawyer appealed , submitting that the applicant had always complied with the investigator 's summons while under the undertaking not to abscond and that the allegations of the victim 's family about his attempts to influence their testimony had been confined to their suspicion that \u201c somebody had been following them \u201d . Furthermore , they noted that the first applicant had health problems , referring to the fact that at the time of the arrest order he was undergoing in - patient treatment in a neurological hospital , of which he provided documentary evidence . They also submitted that he had a permanent place of residence , no criminal record in the past , had a small baby to support , and was studying at a university . They therefore insisted that there were no reasons to believe that he would abscond . The first applicant 's representatives also challenged the finding of ORG concerning his detention from DATE . They did not make any comments or complaints regarding their or the applicant 's access to the case - file materials prior to the examination of the prosecutor 's appeal by the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following a hearing with the participation of the first applicant 's lawyer and father , rejected the applicant 's appeal and upheld his detention with a reference to the gravity of the charges against him and \u201c the witnesses ' fears for their safety \u201d . It also dismissed the applicant 's complaint concerning his detention from DATE having found \u201c no significant grounds for recognising [ it ] unlawful \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the first applicant 's pre - trial detention , on the investigator 's application , to DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE with his detention from DATE to CARDINAL DATE included therein ) . The court referred to the gravity of the charges against the applicant and his unspecified attempts to impede establishment of the truth , as well as to the significant volume of the case file .", "CARDINAL .

Mr PERSON denied as inaccurate the first applicant 's allegation that he had admitted to the latter having slandered him under pressure from the police . The court noted as follows :", "\u201c There is no information from which it could be discerned that unlawful investigation methods were applied to witness [ Mr K. ] entailing his incriminating statements against the defendants as they allege .", "The allegation of [ the first applicant ] that [ Mr PERSON ] was arrested on DATE , remained in police custody until DATE and that is why he recognised [ the first applicant as the offender ] is unfounded .

The police officers allegedly involved in the defendants ' ill - treatment were questioned in the trial and denied those allegations . The court also noted that the first applicant had not complained about his ill - treatment to the ORG or to the GPE authorities . It questioned the doctors who had examined the first applicant in DATE , and they again concluded that his injuries were not typical of the effects of electric current . Furthermore , the court relied on the ruling of ORG DATE refusing to open a criminal case in respect of the first applicant 's complaint .

The first applicant stressed that PERSON had admitted in court that he had indeed met him in DATE and that their conversation could have been recorded . He further complained that although the defence had sought the examination of the aforementioned audiotape in the hearing and putting questions in that respect to PERSON , the trial court had dismissed that motion without any explanations .
