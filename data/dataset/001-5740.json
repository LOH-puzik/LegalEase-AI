THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The Government were represented by their Agent , Mr M. ORG , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows . The applicant joined ORG in or DATE . He completed CARDINAL tours of duty in GPE in DATE and DATE , during and after which he suffered from depression and experienced certain problems with his superiors . On DATE he went absent from the ORG . In DATE his brother committed suicide after which the applicant could not envisage going back to the ORG .", "On DATE he was arrested and held in close arrest , during which detention he was diagnosed as suffering from ORG . While in close arrest he gave his Defending Officer a list of CARDINAL witnesses who could testify as to the manner in which he had been treated by his superior officers while in the ORG . He claims that his Defending Officer only spoke to CARDINAL of those potential witnesses , that he failed to investigate a relevant incident and that that officer had told him that , if he took CARDINAL GPE additional treatment in the naval hospital and opted for a summary trial before his Commanding Officer ( Captain PERSON ) , the punishment for his absence would be discharge only . He also alleges that that officer discouraged him from making a complaint against the relevant superior officers and avoided giving the applicant access to a naval barrister .", "On DATE the applicant was brought before his Commanding Officer and was charged with desertion contrary to LAW DATE ( for which offence the potential punishment after trial by court - martial is an unlimited period of imprisonment ) . He was given DATE to consider whether he wished to have a summary trial or be tried by court - martial . On DATE he opted for a summary trial and on DATE he was tried by his Commanding Officer , when the applicant pleaded guilty . The applicant claims that his Defending Officer did not procure the attendance of any of the CARDINAL witnesses he had proposed as regards mitigation of sentence . He was sentenced to CARDINAL days\u2019 detention ( with no remission for DATE of close arrest already served ) and discharge from the ORG . By letter dated DATE from the applicant \u2019s Commanding Officer to the latter \u2019s next superior officer ( the Flag Officer Training and Recruitment \u2013 \u201c FAC \u201d ) , the Commanding Officer described in some detail the charge against the applicant , his plea , the prosecution case , the evidence in mitigation of sentence and the reasons for the punishment imposed . On DATE the sentence was confirmed by the ORG . The applicant commenced his sentence .", "On DATE he lodged a petition against the severity of his sentence , arguing that his ORG had not been sufficiently taken in account . By letter dated DATE the Commanding Officer provided written comments on the applicant \u2019s petition . By letter dated DATE the ORG outlined in detail why he rejected the applicant \u2019s petition . On or DATE , Major PERSON informed the applicant of the outcome of his petition and made the following hand - written note at the end of the letter of DATE : \u201c Informed + does not wish to pursue further \u201d .", "The Government maintain that Major PERSON informed the applicant , as he was required to do , that the applicant had the right to take the matter further and that the applicant did not wish to . The applicant submits that Major PERSON told him that he could take the matter further only if he had fresh evidence and that there is nothing in Major PERSON \u2019s hand - written note that contradicts this .", "Having no fresh evidence , the applicant did not pursue the matter further , served his sentence and left the ORG in DATE .", "On DATE the applicant wrote to his solicitors pointing out that he believed that he had not been given a fair trial since statements from witnesses had not been collected or presented at trial , medical reports and the time spent in close arrest were ignored , and the case was decided on elements that had nothing to do with the reasons for his leaving .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitor wrote to the successor of the applicant \u2019s Commanding Officer ( Captain Hart ) , in the following terms :", "\u201c I represent PERSON in connection with his detention arising from a hearing at the Captain \u2019s table on DATE . I should be most grateful if you would please advise me if there is any method of appeal or review of that decision . Could you please let me have a copy of the reasons for the decision made for his detention . I understand that no legal representation was available at the hearing before the Captain . \u201d", "Captain PERSON replied by letter dated DATE indicating that the applicant had had CARDINAL review before the ORG and that , while he had been advised that another review to a specific higher authority ( Second Sea Lord / Commander ) was open to him , he had chosen not to pursue that option .", "On DATE ORG handed down its judgment in the PERSON case ( PERSON v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and ORG , no . CARDINAL ) . The applicant claims that it was not until the publication of that judgment and having taken counsel \u2019s advice that he realised that he had the right to request that his complaint be taken further .", "The applicant \u2019s solicitor therefore wrote to Captain Hart on DATE referring to the FAC judgment , pointing out that the applicant considered that he had not had a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal ( within the meaning of that judgment ) , and as required by the rules of natural justice . He stated that he wished to renew his complaint against sentence to a higher authority for which no time - limit had been set down by the relevant regulations .", "Captain PERSON replied by letter dated DATE . He set out the history of the case and rebutted certain of the applicant \u2019s allegations about his trial and noted that the applicant had since left the service thereby losing any right to request a further review . He concluded by noting that nothing new had been raised in the applicant \u2019s lawyer \u2019s letter about the facts of the applicant \u2019s case , that the PERSON case was of no relevance and that , accordingly , there were no justifiable grounds to review the case again .", "On DATE the applicant applied for legal aid to pursue judicial review proceedings against ORG in respect of the decision of Captain Hart not to forward the applicant \u2019s complaint to the next higher authority . On DATE ORG refused legal aid . ORG considered that the applicant had not shown reasonable grounds for taking , defending or being a party to proceedings and that the applicant had not shown that the decision of Captain Hart was illegal , irrational or procedurally improper . The Board noted that DATE limitation period for judicial review proceedings appeared to run from DATE and , given that Captain Hart \u2019s letter of DATE merely confirmed what had previously taken place , judicial review proceedings were out of time . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s appeal against the refusal of legal aid , the ORG not being satisfied that the applicant had reasonable prospects of success in the proposed judicial review proceedings .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) reads , in so far as is relevant , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
