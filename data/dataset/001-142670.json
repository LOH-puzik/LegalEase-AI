On DATE the applicant was promoted to head of the LOC section . On DATE a certification commission ( atest\u0101cijas komisija ) deemed him suitable for his new position .", "CARDINAL . After the Law on State Secrets ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) came into force on DATE and the adoption of Regulation no . CARDINAL of the Cabinet of Ministers , entitled \u201c Regulations for the Protection of State Secrets \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on DATE , the applicant was invited to apply for security clearance for work with ORG secrets . He filled in a questionnaire on DATE . According to a letter sent to ORG by ORG ( ORG aizsardz\u012bbas birojs , hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , CARDINAL of the NORP intelligence services responsible , inter alia , for issuing security clearances , he had been invited to attend a \u201c discussion \u201d ( p\u0101rrunas ) on DATE in respect of his application . The Government provided a copy of additional written explanations submitted by the applicant DATE . Therein he had explained that he had been a reserve lieutenant in ORG and a member of ORG until DATE . He denied having had any links with foreign secret services , and in that regard referred to a prior interview he had apparently had with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of ORG showed the applicant a letter from the ORG , which indicated that he had been refused the first category security clearance . The letter did not contain any motivation of the refusal apart from a reference to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Law on State Secrets ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant presumed that clearance had been refused because he had been suspected of past collaboration with ORG of the former GPE ( PERSON \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 in LANGUAGE , hereinafter DATE \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . He accordingly made use of the remedy available under the domestic system to have the question of his alleged collaboration adjudicated in court . As a result , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG established that the ORG archives contained a document which indicated that on CARDINAL DATE the applicant had been recruited as a ORG \u201c agent \u201d and given a codename . His recruiter had been a ORG operative , V.P. The court , however , went on to note that there was no indication that the applicant had ever submitted any reports in his alleged capacity as a ORG agent . Moreover , the court considered that there was no evidence to suggest that the applicant had been aware that he had been an \u201c informer \u201d of the ORG . Accordingly , the court concluded that the applicant had not knowingly collaborated with the ORG . That judgment was not appealed against and became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , prior to the completion of the inquiry into the applicant \u2019s alleged collaboration with the ORG , and after he had refused to leave his job voluntarily , an order was made by the head of ORG on DATE to dismiss him from service with effect from DATE . The reasons given for the termination of his employment were the letter of the ORG and section MONEY ) of the Law on Border Guard Service ( PERSON likums ) , which provided that border guards were to be retired from service if they were deemed unsuitable for their duties . Another border guard , Major PERSON , was appointed to fill the applicant \u2019s position .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant wrote to the ORG , seeking a review of the decision concerning his clearance . On DATE the ORG responded , refusing to change the \u201c findings of ORG , in accordance with which it is impossible to issue PERSON the first category special clearance on the basis of section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON on State Secrets \u201d . Section CARDINAL ) provided that clearance would not be issued to persons suffering from alcoholism , drug addiction , mental illness or who were otherwise deemed unsuitable for work with ORG secrets ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It was DATE that the applicant discovered that on DATE the director of the ORG had changed the legal basis of the refusal of the clearance from section MONEY ) to section CARDINAL ) of the relevant law .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant then appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision to ORG . On DATE the latter issued a decision , upholding the refusal to issue him clearance on the basis of section CARDINAL ) while referring to :", "\u201c circumstances that attest to [ the applicant \u2019s ] personal and professional characteristics which give rise to legitimate doubts as to [ his ] ability to preserve ORG secrets \u2013 [ the applicant \u2019s ] frequent contact with the former ... ORG employee [ ORG ] , his hiding of information concerning the involvement of officers of the LOC section of ORG in illegal activities and needless and dangerous brandishing of a firearm in the presence of other employees of ORG while intoxicated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Law on State Secrets provided that ORG decision was final and not amenable to further appeal , either in court or elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then attempted to obtain access to the materials in the investigation file on the basis of which he had been refused clearance . On DATE he was informed by the ORG that the materials were confidential ( in accordance with the regulation no . CARDINAL of the Cabinet of Ministers ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and not accessible to the person subject to the investigation . However , on DATE the applicant received permission to access some parts of the file and obtained copies of several documents contained therein . CARDINAL of the documents contains excerpts from a report by a border guard , officer GPE ( who was promoted to head of the PERSON section following the applicant \u2019s dismissal , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to the deputy director of the ORG containing intimations that the information the applicant had disclosed about his former collaboration with the ORG had been inaccurate . Another report ( which did not contain any indication of its source ) indicated that the applicant , while intoxicated , \u201c had behaved aggressively with a service weapon , threatening to either shoot himself or [ GPE ] \u201d . The third document was a report by GPE reciting information supposedly provided by third parties concerning the applicant \u2019s former collaboration with the ORG and concerning \u201c the covering up of extraordinary incidents of alcohol use and smuggling in the LOC section \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained about his dismissal from service to CARDINAL levels of courts of general jurisdiction . In a judgment of DATE the GPE Latgale District Court noted the change that had been made to the legal basis on which refusals of clearance had been made ; however , it did not find it necessary to analyse that issue , since the judgment of ORG had not refuted the fact that the applicant had been an \u201c agent \u201d of the ORG , and that section MONEY ) of the PERSON on ORG provided that clearance should not be issued to former \u201c agents \u201d of , inter alia , the ORG , irrespective of how active their involvement had been . The applicant had also asked the first - instance court to renew the procedural time - limit for appealing against the refusal to issue him security clearance . The court rejected this request by noting that the applicant had already made use of the procedure for appealing against the refusal .", "CARDINAL . An appeal hearing took place on DATE at ORG but the applicant did not attend . DATE prior to the hearing , he had informed the court that he was ill and that a doctor had ordered him to stay in bed ( \u201c gultas re\u017e\u012bms \u201d ) . The case file contains a copy of a medical certificate , dated DATE , which states that the applicant had been put on sick leave until DATE . The certificate is made out on a pre - typed form and contains no specific details of the applicant \u2019s medical condition . Under the heading \u201c the reason for a temporary inability to work \u201d the doctor preparing it has ticked \u201c other reasons \u201d , as opposed to being infected with tuberculosis , having an occupational disease or having had an accident at the workplace . The court considered that the applicant had not submitted any evidence in support of his claim that his health condition had prevented him from attending the hearing . Neither had he substantiated his claim that he had been ordered to stay in bed .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that his arguments had been fully expressed in his written appeal and on that basis had decided to proceed with the hearing in his absence . The applicant was not fined for failure to attend the hearing without a justified reason . As summarised by the appeal court , the applicant in his appeal had complained , among other things , that he had been dismissed from service even before the appeal procedure against the refusal to issue security clearance had been completed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not represented by counsel . A representative of ORG , the respondent in the proceedings , was present at the hearing and in his oral observations before the court endorsed the validity of the judgment of the first - instance court and disagreed with the applicant \u2019s claim and appeal .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits of the appeal , the appellate court in its judgment of DATE indicated that the first - instance court had not adequately analysed the arguments of the parties and had exceeded the scope of its competence . It nevertheless decided to dismiss the applicant \u2019s claim . It held that the order of DATE discharging the applicant from service could not be deemed to be a restriction of his rights , since he had already been aware of the ORG \u2019s refusal to issue him security clearance since DATE . In any event , the court considered that it was impossible to reinstate the applicant to his position , since the position required him to obtain security clearance , which had been refused by a final decision of ORG , which was not amenable to appeal . The appeal court also held that there were no legal grounds to renew the time - limit for appealing against the decision to refuse the applicant a security clearance and that in any case the applicant had exhausted the appeal procedure legally available to him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . On DATE the ORG of ORG adopted a judgment dismissing his appeal . It dismissed his complaint concerning the fact that the appellate court had conducted the hearing in his absence . The ORG noted that the appellate court had regarded the applicant \u2019s reason for having failed to appear at the hearing as unjustified , but said that it was a question of fact which the ORG , being a level of jurisdiction which deals with alleged violations of procedural and substantive law and not with the re - evaluation of facts , was not competent to review . As regards the merits of the case , the ORG agreed with the conclusions of the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant then submitted a complaint to ORG ( PERSON birojs , the predecessor of the ORG ) . On DATE he received a response , in which the ORG expressed doubts as to the constitutionality and compatibility with the Convention of the process for appealing refusals of security clearance , given that such appeals could only be made to the director of the ORG and to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a complaint of unconstitutionality with ORG , alleging firstly that there had been no opportunity for him to address his complaint concerning a refusal of security clearance to a court , and secondly that he had been denied access to the investigation file on the basis of which the refusal had been made . On DATE ORG adopted a judgment in which it declared the legal provisions in question constitutional . CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judges dissented ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The majority considered that the right of access to a court guaranteed by the LAW did not include a right to resolve in a court every issue that might be of importance to an individual . Accordingly it started its analysis by questioning whether the disputed legal norms concerned the applicant \u2019s rights or lawful interests . Firstly , it was noted that the freedom to obtain information did not incorporate access to ORG secrets , since there were legitimate grounds for restricting access to such information . Secondly , refusing the applicant security clearance had restricted his right to employment and equal access to employment in public service . Nevertheless , it concluded that such a restriction had been legitimate , since it had occurred for reasons related to national security .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite finding that the refusal did not impinge upon the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights , the majority of ORG proceeded to analyse the question whether the appeal process involving the director of the ORG and ORG was sufficient to satisfy the requirement of access to a court . In that regard it was firstly pointed out that ORG could not be understood to be a \u201c court \u201d for the purposes of the right of \u201c access to a court \u201d . Secondly , the court referred to ORG judgments in the cases of PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and ORG v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR MONEY ) , in which it was held that the right to access to a court was not absolute and was subject to limitations . The court then went on to analyse whether the impossibility of disputing the validity and legality of a refusal of security clearance before a court pursued a legitimate aim , and whether there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved . It considered that the legitimate aim was the need to protect the confidentiality of materials contained in the investigation file regarding the person in question \u2019s suitability for security clearance . As concerns the issue of proportionality , ORG took into account the fact that the legislation provided CARDINAL possible method of disputing a refusal of clearance before an independent authority , namely by way of an appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the adequacy of the appeal process , the court noted that the domestic legislation did not contain any details of the decision - making process involved in refusing clearance or of the subsequent appeal procedure . In particular , the observance of the audiatur et altera pars principle was not guaranteed . That led ORG to conclude that :", "\u201c in a country governed by the rule of law it is possible to provide for a more thought - out mechanism which would permit , in the course of deciding upon whether to issue a special clearance , to take into account , in so far as is possible , both interests of ORG security and the individual interests of each person under consideration . \u201d", "To illustrate that point , the court referred to the system in GPE as an example , where security clearance candidates were given an opportunity to make representations concerning facts relevant to the decision and to be represented by a lawyer , save in cases where a personal interview could significantly harm State security . ORG then went on to conclude that NORP legislation did not , in principle , prevent the competent authorities from implementing the audiatur et altera pars principle , particularly if the legislation were to be interpreted in the light of the LAW . It followed that the limitation of the rights of security clearance candidates was proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting ORG security .", "CARDINAL . As regards the fact that the applicant had been denied access to the investigation file , ORG viewed it as a restriction of the right to respect for private life . Referring to ORG Rights\u2019 judgment in the case of GPE v. GPE ( DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , it noted that interests of national security could justify such an interference with private life and concluded that in the applicant \u2019s particular situation such an interference had been justified .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON in her dissenting opinion focused on the fact that the process for appealing a refusal of security clearance to the director of the ORG and ORG did not ensure an adequate implementation of the audiatur et altera pars principle . She criticised the majority \u2019s reliance on the assumption that the applicable legislation would be interpreted broadly and in accordance with LAW so as to implement the principle of hearing both parties\u2019 arguments because \u201c the practice shows that in transitional legal systems , such as GPE , the principle of hearing all parties is not implemented unless it is provided for in the law , which is a fact borne out by the present case \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON", "CARDINAL . After gaining partial access to his investigation file ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and acting on the advice of ORG , the applicant , relying on new information , applied for the proceedings concerning the alleged illegality of his dismissal to be reopened . On DATE ORG dismissed his application , finding that the new information related to the reasons for the refusal of security clearance , the illegality of which had not been the subject matter of the original proceedings . The applicant then missed the time - limit for submitting an ancillary complaint against ORG decision . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG of ORG refused to accept the applicant \u2019s belated ancillary complaint ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
