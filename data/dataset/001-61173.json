The applicant was born in DATE and lived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a lease dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant was granted a building lease of industrial land by ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) for DATE from DATE . The lease required him to erect CARDINAL buildings at his own expense for light industrial use and included an option to renew for a further twenty - one years in the following terms ( at sub - clause CARDINAL ) ) :", "\u201c If the Lessee shall be desirous of taking a lease of the said demised premises for a further term of DATE from the expiration of the terms hereby granted and shall , not DATE nor DATE before the expiration of the said terms , give the ORG notice in writing of his desire and if he shall have paid the rents hereby reserved and shall have reasonably performed and observed the covenants , provisions and stipulations herein contained ( ... ) , then the LAW will let the demised LOC to the Lessee for the said further term of DATE ( ... ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant states that he had requested a DATE term in the course of negotiations but that this request was refused by GPE . The applicant was represented by solicitors when negotiating and entering into the lease .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with sub - clause CARDINAL ) of the lease the applicant gave notice to exercise the option on DATE . At this date , he was paying a ground rent of MONEY ( GBP ) per annum . He had paid GBP CARDINAL in total rent over DATE and his income from his sub - leases of the CARDINAL units was GBP CARDINAL for DATE .", "CARDINAL . By this time GPE Council ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) had become the statutory successor to GPE . On DATE , GPE acknowledged the applicant \u2019s notice and indicated that it would be instructing surveyors to negotiate a new rent for DATE of the term . Negotiations commenced between the parties as to renewal of the lease and a draft lease was drawn up on the basis of an increased ground rent , which the applicant states was agreed at GBP CARDINAL per annum . The applicant signed his copy of the draft and meanwhile commenced discussions with various of his tenants concerning increases of rent under their subleases . In DATE however , GPE notified the applicant that it considered that the option could not be exercised . In the subsequent proceedings , it took CARDINAL points : that the applicant was in breach of the repairing covenants in the DATE lease ; that the option was not capable of being exercised by the applicant because by granting CARDINAL subleases for terms greater than the term of the DATE lease he had assigned his interest in the units under sublease ; and that the option was ultra vires GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG of ORG for a declaration that he was entitled to the grant of the further term and for an order of specific performance to enforce his right . His application was dismissed on DATE . The judge rejected GPE claim as to breach of covenant but found in favour of GPE on their CARDINAL other objections . He noted that the ultra vires point had not been raised until relatively late in the proceedings , namely , in an affidavit lodged by GPE dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judge \u2019s decision , on the ground that the grant of the option had been beyond GPE \u2019s powers .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings before ORG , the applicant sought to rely upon CARDINAL separate statutory provisions , each of which he said gave GPE power to grant the option . The first was section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . This provides ( as relevant ) :", "\u201c Where the council of a borough desire to dispose of corporate land otherwise than as aforesaid , they may , with the consent of the Minister , dispose of the land either by way of sale , exchange , mortgage , charge , demise , lease or otherwise , in such manner and on such terms and subject to such conditions ... as the Minister may approve . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The term \u201c corporate land \u201d is defined in section CARDINAL of LAW as :", "\u201c ... [ L]and belonging to , or held in trust for , or to be acquired by or held in trust for , a municipal corporation otherwise than for an express statutory purpose \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following an examination of the history surrounding GPE \u2019s appropriation of the land in question , ORG concluded that it had been held by GPE for an \u201c express statutory purpose \u201d at the time of the lease and was thus not \u201c corporate land \u201d , with the result that section CARDINAL ) did not apply .", "CARDINAL . The second statutory provision upon which the applicant sought to rely was section CARDINAL of LAW , which provides :", "\u201c A local authority may let any land which they may possess \u2013", "( a ) with the consent of the Minister , for any term ;", "( b ) without the consent of the Minister , for a term not exceeding DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The crucial question on this provision was whether the power to let included the grant of an option to renew . ORG had answered this in the negative , albeit obiter dicta , in the case of Trustees of ORG v. ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL P & CR CARDINAL . A deputy High Court judge reached the same conclusion when it was directly in issue before him in DATE . ORG in the applicant \u2019s case referred to both of these decisions in finding that a grant of an option to renew was not the same as the exercise of a power to let . As a result , section CARDINAL did not apply so as to give GPE the power to grant the option .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON , in summing up his judgment in ORG , observed :", "\u201c ... I would dismiss this appeal . I do so with little satisfaction . It seems to me unjust that when public bodies misconstrue their own powers to enter into commercial transactions with unsuspecting members of the public , those bodies should be allowed to take advantage of their own errors to escape from the unlawful bargains which they have made . For a local authority to assert the illegality of its own action is an unattractive stance for it to adopt . It is the more striking when , as in this case , the transaction in question is as mundane as a building lease ; and the local authority , by taking the point against the member of the public with whom it or its predecessor contracted , thereby robs that member of the public of part of the consideration for entering into the lease . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s petition for leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Local authorities are statutory bodies whose powers are governed by domestic legislation . The legal consequences of entry into contractual commitments beyond statutory authority were explained by ORG in the case of ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] ORG , where he stated ( at CARDINAL D - F ) :", "\u201c Where a statutory corporation purports to enter into a contract which it is not empowered by the relevant statute to enter into , the corporation lacks the capacity to make the supposed contract . This lack of capacity means that the document and the agreement it contains do not have effect as a legal contract . It exists in fact but not in law . It is a legal nullity . The purported contract which is in truth not a contract does not confer any legal rights on either party . Neither party can sue on it . \u201d", "He also emphasised :", "\u201c Any third party dealing with a local authority should be aware of that fact [ of limited capacity and competence ] and of the potential legal risk . \u201d", "He cited the old authority of LAW v. FAC ( ( DATE ) QUANTITY at p. CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c ... persons who deal with corporations or societies that owe their constitution to or have their powered defined or limited by ORG , or are regulated by deeds of settlement or rules , deriving their effect more or less from Acts of ORG , are bound to know or to ascertain for themselves the nature of the constitution , and the extent of the powers of the corporation or society with which they deal . The plaintiffs and everyone else who have dealings with a building society are bound to know that such a society has no power of borrowing , except such as is conferred upon it by its rules , and if dealing with such a society they neglect or fail to ascertain whether it has the power of borrowing or whether any limited power it may have has been exceeded , they must take the consequences of their carelessness . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Where contracts are rendered legal nullities or void ab initio restitutionary principles may apply to require the restoration of the moneys paid under the contract ( for example , ORG v. GPE ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL AER CARDINAL ) . The application of the principles of unjust enrichment may thus provide redress in circumstances where a contract or part of a contract is void .", "CARDINAL . The statutory regime in force has changed since DATE when the lease was granted in this case . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , where applicable , does not now prohibit the grant of an option such as was granted in this case nor does LAW DATE . Pursuant to ORG , the strictness of the principles of incapacity applying to a local authority which purports to contract beyond its statutory powers has been relaxed . LAW provides for such a contract to have effect as if the local authority had had power to enter into it and had properly exercised that power , so long as the contract has been certified in the manner set out in the LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
