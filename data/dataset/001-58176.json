THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 2 - Right to life (Article 2-1 - Life) (Substantive aspect);No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect)", "JUDGES": "John Freeland", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . DATE the GPE carried out a number of atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons in LOC and at GPE , GPE , involving over CARDINAL servicemen . Among these tests were the \u201c LOC \u201d and \u201c Grapple Z \u201d series of CARDINAL detonations at LOC in LOC ( DATE ) of weapons many times more powerful than those discharged at GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . During the DATE Island tests , service personnel were ordered to line up in the open and to face away from the explosions with their eyes closed and covered until TIME after the blast .", "The applicant alleged that the purpose of this procedure was deliberately to expose servicemen to radiation for experimental purposes . The Government denied this and stated that it was believed at the time of the tests , and was the case , that personnel were sufficiently far from the centre of the detonations to avoid being exposed to radiation at any harmful level and that the purpose of the line - up procedure was to ensure that they avoided eye damage and other physical injury caused by material blown about by the blast .", "CARDINAL . While the applicant \u2019s father was serving as a catering assistant in ORG , he was present at DATE Island during CARDINAL nuclear tests in DATE and DATE . He also participated in the clean - up programme following the tests .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE . In or DATE she was diagnosed as having leukaemia , a cancerous disease of the organs which manufacture blood .

The applicant received chemotherapy treatment which lasted until she was DATE . Because of her illness and associated treatment she missed CARDINAL of her primary school education and was unable to participate in sports or other normal childhood activities .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant became aware of the contents of a report prepared by FAC ( \u201c GPE ) indicating a high incidence of cancers including leukaemia in the children of DATE Island veterans . The applicant is a member of the BNTVA .", "CARDINAL . She still has regular medical check - ups and is afraid to have children of her own in case they are born with a genetic predisposition to leukaemia .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an ORG , chaired by Sir ORG , was set up in GPE to investigate reports of an abnormally high number of children contracting leukaemia in the area around the nuclear power reactor at PERSON ( formerly called PERSON ) in northern GPE . The ORG confirmed that childhood leukaemia was more common in this area than normal , but was not able to determine the reason for this . CARDINAL of the members of the ORG , Dr PERSON , went on to conduct CARDINAL studies into the phenomenon . The third , published on CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , found a statistical association between the incidence of leukaemia in children from the town of GPE , near PERSON , and relatively high recorded doses of external whole - body radiation received by their fathers employed at the nuclear power plant prior to conception .", "CARDINAL . Following the publication of this report , CARDINAL cases were brought against the authority responsible for the Sellafield reactor by plaintiffs who had contracted leukaemia and non - Hodgkin \u2019s lymphoma respectively , claiming that their ORG employment at ORG had caused their illnesses . The CARDINAL cases were heard concurrently in ORG , GPE , on DATE between DATE and DATE . Over CARDINAL expert witnesses gave oral evidence before the court and CARDINAL written reports were submitted , primarily directed at the question whether the statistical association found by Dr PERSON could be relied upon and was directly causal , as claimed by the plaintiffs .", "CARDINAL . Judgment was given by PERSON NORP on DATE .", "He found , inter alia , that ORG was \u201c a good study , well carried out and presented \u201d . However , certain technical criticisms which had been made of it were valid so as to diminish confidence in its conclusions and underline the need to seek confirmation from other independent studies before relying on it . He did , however , find that the evidence bore out a strong prima facie association between paternal preconceptional irradiation and childhood leukaemia in GPE , although considerable reserve was necessary before it could be concluded that there was a causal link .", "Although the judge was content to assume that there was a heritable component to the plaintiffs\u2019 diseases , he considered that this was very small . He placed particular reliance on studies of the children of survivors of the GPE and GPE bombings , which did not show any significant increase in leukaemia or non - Hodgkin \u2019s lymphoma , and were therefore quite inconsistent with the PERSON hypothesis . CARDINAL of the defendant \u2019s witnesses , Sir PERSON , had referred to research emphasising the role of infection in causing childhood leukaemia , particularly in areas where unusual population mixing had occurred , as was the case in GPE , which had a very mobile population of high socio - economic class situated in a remote rural area . The judge found that a theory of causation based on such factors , combined with chance , was no less plausible than the PERSON hypothesis .", "In conclusion , he held that , \u201c on the evidence before me , the scales tilt decisively in favour of the defendants , and the plaintiffs , therefore , have failed to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that paternal preconceptional radiation was a material contributory cause of the Seascale excess or , it must follow , of [ their diseases ] \u201d ( PERSON v.
