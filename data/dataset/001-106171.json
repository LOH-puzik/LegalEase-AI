The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE onwards PERSON and PERSON , a married couple , lived in different places as PERSON was working in GPE while PERSON remained in GPE . The spouses have a daughter born in DATE . In DATE PERSON and the applicant entered into a relationship . PERSON became pregnant in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that he was the father of the child to be born , and that the birth had been planned by PERSON and him . This was contested by the ORG and the third party interveners .", "CARDINAL . In DATE left the applicant and subsequently went to live with her husband in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant acknowledged paternity of the child to be born before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON gave birth to a boy , PERSON , in GPE . PERSON and PERSON have been living in GPE since then ; they raise F. together with their daughter . They acknowledged that the applicant might be PERSON \u2019s biological father . They claimed , however , that it could just as well be PERSON as they had also had intimate relations at the relevant time . The latter allegation is contested by the applicant . The spouses preferred not to verify paternity in the interest of their family relationship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s requests of DATE for access to F. twice per month and for regular information on the boy \u2019s development .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the applicant claimed to be F. \u2019s biological father . The applicant had submitted that he and PERSON who at the time was considering a divorce DATE had planned to have the child . When PERSON had become pregnant , the applicant had accompanied her to her medical consultations as the child \u2019s father . PERSON and PERSON , for their part , had not contested that there had been an intimate relationship between the applicant and PERSON at the relevant time . However , PERSON had not planned to have a child and PERSON could equally be F. \u2019s biological father .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant , even assuming that he was PERSON \u2019s biological father , did not fall within the group of persons who had a right of access and information under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . He did not have a right of access under LAW as he was not PERSON \u2019s legal father . According to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) the boy \u2019s legal father was PERSON , the husband of the child \u2019s mother . The applicant \u2019s acknowledgement of paternity before ORG was not valid under LAW as PERSON paternity prevailed ( see paragraph DATE below ) . Nor was he entitled to challenge Mr H. \u2019s paternity as the conditions of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) were not met . He had no right to contest PERSON paternity because there was a social and family relationship between PERSON and PERSON , who was living with PERSON and PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the applicant did not have a right of access under LAW either . He claimed to be ORG \u2019s biological father , but whether this was in fact the case was unclear . Moreover , he was not a person with whom the child had close ties and there was no social and family relationship between them . The fact that in the applicant \u2019s submission , PERSON and he had planned to have the child and had wanted to live together did not alter that conclusion . The applicant had never lived with PERSON or the child . The child had lived with PERSON and PERSON , a married couple , since his birth . During that time there had been no possibility for the applicant to build up a social and family relationship with F.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG , without hearing the parties in person , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as well as his request to be allowed to offer PERSON presents on special occasions .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed ORG finding that the applicant did not have a right of access and information under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as those provisions conferred rights only on a child \u2019s legal parents . Under LAW no . CARDINAL of LAW it was PERSON , who was married to PERSON at the time of PERSON \u2019s birth , who was PERSON \u2019s legal father . The applicant \u2019s acknowledgement of paternity of F. did not alter that fact as it was not valid ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the applicant did not have a right of access and information under LAW . There was no social and family relationship between the applicant and PERSON as the applicant had so far never even seen PERSON , let alone built up a relationship with him .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the fundamental right to respect for one \u2019s family life under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW did not afford the applicant more far - reaching rights . It was not even established that the applicant was PERSON \u2019s biological father . Paternity could , however , only be determined in separate proceedings and under certain conditions , which the applicant was most probably unable to meet . In any event , even assuming that the applicant was PERSON \u2019s biological father , he would still not have a right of access and information , for lack of a social and family relationship with F. The case of PERSON v. GPE , in which ORG had strengthened the rights of biological fathers who had not yet built up a social and family relationship with their child , was not comparable to the present case . The facts of that case , in which the child \u2019s mother had given up the child for adoption , were not comparable to those of the present case as the interests of all persons concerned had to be weighed in the balance . In the present case , the applicant \u2019s right in his position as biological father could not outweigh the protection of the family , the mother and the child under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In this conflict of interests , anything which could upset a child \u2019s trust in his family had to be prevented . It was preferable that PERSON grew up in his family without learning about the problematic circumstances of his origin .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection alleging a violation of the right to be heard ( Anh\u00f6rungsr\u00fcge ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his constitutional complaint dated DATE the applicant claimed that the decisions of the family courts refusing him contact with and information about the personal circumstances of his child had violated , in particular , his right to respect for his family life under LAW and his right to equal treatment under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . He argued that for a biological father to relate closely to his child , so as to have a right of access and information , it was sufficient that the father was willing to take responsibility for the child . Otherwise , the child \u2019s mother would have the right to prevent any contact between father and child . Such contact , and knowledge of his own origins , were in the child \u2019s best interest . The applicant further claimed that the family ORG refusal to determine whether he was PERSON \u2019s biological father and their failure to examine , with regard to the circumstances of his case and by taking evidence , whether contact with him would be in PERSON \u2019s best interest had disproportionately interfered with his right to respect for his family life . Moreover , the domestic courts\u2019 decisions had discriminated against him in his right of access and information compared to fathers of children born in or out of wedlock , mothers , grandparents and siblings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . DATE ) . It held that the complaint had no prospect of success as it was , in any event , ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant had complained about the family courts\u2019 failure to determine paternity of F. , his complaint was inadmissible owing to the subsidiarity of a constitutional complaint . The applicant should have contested PERSON paternity in separate proceedings under LAW prior to lodging his constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant complained about the family ORG refusal to grant him access to and information about PERSON , his rights under LAW and LAW had not been breached .", "CARDINAL . The parental rights guaranteed by LAW afforded protection to the person having parental responsibility , irrespective of whether that person was the biological or the legal parent of the child . In the present case , this provision thus protected Mr H. and not the applicant . Neither LAW , which provided for rights of access and information only for legal parents , nor the decisions of the family courts which were based on those provisions , were in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The family ORG refusal to grant the applicant access under LAW had not violated his rights under LAW either . LAW protected the relationship between a biological , but not legal , father and his child only where there was a social relationship between them which was based on the fact that the father had borne actual responsibility for the child at least for some time . Conversely , the ( presumed ) biological father \u2019s wish to take over responsibility or to build up a social and family relationship with the child was not sufficient to attract the protection of LAW . As there had never been a social and family relationship between PERSON and the applicant , the family courts had complied with LAW in denying the applicant a right of access pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the fact alone that the presumed biological father , unlike the biological mother , had no right of access to the child did not render the decisions of the family courts arbitrary and thus in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , everyone is equal before the law ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ; men and women have equal rights ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , in so far as relevant , provides :", "( CARDINAL ) Marriage and the family shall enjoy the special protection of the state .", "( CARDINAL ) The care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them . The state shall watch over them in the performance of this duty .", "CARDINAL . Parental custody includes the right to determine access to the child ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a child has a right of access to each parent , and each parent in turn has the right and the duty to have contact with the child . The family courts can determine the scope of the right of access and prescribe more specific rules for its exercise , also with regard to third parties ( LAW ) . They may restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child \u2019s welfare . A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if the child \u2019s well - being would otherwise be endangered . The family courts may order that the right of access be exercised in the presence of a third party , such as a ORG or an association ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , grandparents and siblings have a right of access to the child if this serves the child \u2019s best interest . LAW , in its version applicable at the relevant time , further provides for persons with whom the child has close ties ( PERSON ) to have a right of access to the child if this serves the child \u2019s best interest and if they are bearing actual responsibility for the child or have done so in the past ( social and family relationship ) . It is to be assumed , as a rule , that a person who lived with the child in domestic community for a lengthy period of time has borne such actual responsibility . LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL apply mutatis mutandis ( see LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , each parent who has a legitimate interest in obtaining information about the child \u2019s personal circumstances may request such information from the other parent in so far as this is not contrary to the child \u2019s best interest .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a child \u2019s father is either the man who at the date of the child \u2019s birth was married to the child \u2019s mother ( no . CARDINAL ) , or the man who acknowledged paternity ( no . CARDINAL ) or whose paternity is judicially established under LAW ( no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . An acknowledgement of paternity is not valid as long as the paternity of another man exists ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Paternity may be challenged . Under LAW , entitlement to challenge paternity lies with the man whose paternity exists under LAW . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , with the mother and with the child , and also with the man who makes a statutory declaration that he had sexual intercourse with the child \u2019s mother during the period of conception . However , pursuant to LAW , this last man has a right to challenge the paternity of the man who is the child \u2019s legal father under LAW . CARDINAL or CARDINAL only if he is the child \u2019s biological father and if there is no social and family relationship between the legal father and the child . If there is no paternity under LAW . CARDINAL or CARDINAL of LAW , paternity is to be established by the family court ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Research undertaken by ORG in relation to CARDINAL ORG GPE shows that there is no uniform approach in GPE to the question whether , and if so , under what circumstances , a biological father ( who is not only a sperm donor ) has a right to contact with his child where a different father exists in law .", "CARDINAL . In a considerable number of GPE ( including GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , where a child is born to a woman who is living with her husband , a biological father can ensure his contact rights by first challenging the paternity presumption in place , in some cases within a fixed time - limit . In these GPE , as indeed in all of the countries surveyed , a presumption exists in law to the effect that a child born of a married woman during the subsistence of the marriage is also the child of her husband . Having been recognised as the ( legal ) father of the child concerned , the biological father then has a right to contact with his child like any other noncustodial parent , subject to the child \u2019s best interest .", "CARDINAL . According to an expert report drawn up in DATE by ORG Family Law ( Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr PERSON . ORG , a registered association and non - governmental organisation ) , which was submitted by the Government and covered , in addition to GPE , CARDINAL other ORG , the same applied in GPE . That report , however , interpreted differently the provisions applicable in GPE and GPE . The applicant submitted that there were several other countries where a biological father could challenge the legal father \u2019s paternity under conditions which were less restrictive than those applicable in GPE , such as GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below for the research undertaken by ORG in respect of GPE ) . He contested in general terms the comparative law analysis submitted by the Government , arguing that the legal situation in only QUANTITY of the CARDINAL Member States of ORG was not representative .", "CARDINAL . In a considerable number of ORG , according to the ORG \u2019s research , the biological father of a child would , on the contrary , not be able to challenge the said paternity presumption in circumstances similar to those in the present application ( see , in particular , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . Biological fathers in those countries lack standing to bring an action to challenge that presumption , be it in all circumstances or at least in cases in which the mother is still living with her husband ( see in this latter regard the law in force in GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the expert report of ORG Family PERSON submitted by the Government , the same applies in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . In these Member GPE it is open to the biological father to apply for contact only as a third party , not as a parent . However , in some of GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) the biological father does not have standing to apply for contact even as a third party , as the law provides a right of contact only to legal parents and ( to some extent ) to other relatives .", "CARDINAL . According to the same expert report of ORG , the biological father would also not have standing to apply for contact in GPE and in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the remaining Member GPE surveyed by ORG in which the paternity presumption may not be challenged by a biological father ( GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE and GPE ) , different preconditions apply for that father to be granted contact if such contact is in the child \u2019s best interest . According to LAW , there has to be \u201c proof of a tie of special affection with the child \u201d ; according to LAW of LAW , the father must have lived together with the child for a long time in the same household . In GPE a third person can be granted contact by a judge where that would be in the best interest of the child , without additional preconditions having to be met ( compare LAW ) . In the GPE , third persons ( including mere sperm donors ) may be granted contact under Articles DATE and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of the GPE if they have a close personal relationship with the child , unless contacts run counter to the child \u2019s best interest . According to section QUANTITY of LAW , the biological father may be granted access if he is regarded as being \u201c close \u201d to the child ( according to the expert report submitted by the Government , a similar provision applies in GPE ) , and under LAW CARDINALa of LAW , he has a right to contact in exceptional circumstances ( according to the expert report submitted by the Government , the same precondition applies in GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the report submitted by ORG , LAW of LAW on ORG provides that access may be granted only to close relatives having close personal ties with the child concerned and only if the parents have no or hardly any contact with the child . The report further states that under LAW of LAW , a biological father may be granted access to his child if the child \u2019s welfare is endangered otherwise ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
