SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , of ORG , as Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The case concerns criminal proceedings brought against the applicant in relation to charges of assault and threats allegedly committed against his cohabitant , PERSON , on DATE .", "The same day PERSON reported the incident to the police . According to PERSON , the relationship between her and the applicant had deteriorated over a period of time . The applicant had also started to drink during DATE preceding the incident . During TIME of DATE E. began to pack her belongings because she had decided to leave the applicant . The applicant became aggressive and put his finger in her mouth . He then pulled her to the floor , injuring the back of her head and her shoulder . E further stated that the applicant slapped her in the face and threatened to kill her .", "The applicant admitted that they had quarrelled during TIME , but denied that he had assaulted or threatened E Instead , he alleged that E had fallen on the floor by accident . He also stated that he placed his hand over her mouth in order to prevent her from screaming .", "The applicant was charged with the offences of \u201c assault \u201d and \u201c unlawful threat \u201d against E , who also joined her claim for compensation to those proceedings .", "The applicant denied the charges at the hearing before ORG trying the case , as well as civil liability to pay compensation , though he had already paid E certain sums totalling MONEY ( SEK ) . E was heard before the court and maintained the statements she had made during the police investigation . The prosecutor also relied on a medical certificate and a photograph attesting to E \u2019s injuries .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG convicted the applicant and sentenced him to CARDINAL - months\u2019 imprisonment , and made him liable to pay compensation to E , not to exceed the amount ( SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) already paid .", "The applicant appealed to ORG .", "The main hearing before ORG was first scheduled to take place on DATE . On DATE , when an official of ORG called the applicant at the apartment which used to be his and E \u2019s home , E was present in the apartment and was informed of the date and place of the hearing . E was , however , not formally summoned to the hearing . In any event , E failed to appear at the main hearing on DATE and the hearing was cancelled .", "The trial hearing was postponed until DATE . However , PERSON was not notified of the hearing and it was cancelled . The parties were invited to give their views on whether it was necessary to take evidence from her again or whether the audio - tape recording of her testimony in ORG could be played back . Both the prosecutor and the applicant were of the opinion that it was essential to take evidence from her also in ORG .", "DATE was then fixed as the new date for the hearing and E was notified of the summons . However , as she failed to appear and her testimony was deemed necessary , the hearing was cancelled . PERSON was ordered to pay a fine of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL and it was decided that next time she should be brought to the hearing by the police .", "On DATE , as the attempt to fetch PERSON failed ( she had not been notified of the hearing ) , ORG cancelled the hearing since it was deemed necessary to take evidence from her . A new hearing was scheduled for DATE . The court ordered that PERSON be fetched and taken into custody TIME in advance of the hearing in order to secure her attendance .", "Subsequently , a hearing scheduled for DATE was cancelled as it had not been possible to fetch PERSON and her renewed testimony was considered necessary . A new hearing was scheduled for DATE . ORG ordered once again that E was to be fetched and that she could be taken into custody prior to the transportation to the court .", "A sixth attempt to hold a hearing , on DATE , was also in vain since the police had failed to find PERSON The hearing was cancelled even though the prosecutor now claimed that E \u2019s absence was no longer an impediment to holding a hearing . It was then decided to hold the hearing on DATE and that the police should secure E \u2019s attendance by fetching her and keeping her in custody TIME before taking her to the court room .", "ORG finally held the appeal hearing on DATE , in E \u2019s absence , as the police had not been able to fetch her . Under the LAW , LAW CARDINAL , the ORG decided to go ahead with the hearing since all legal possibilities to secure E \u2019s attendance had been exhausted and impediments therefore existed to her giving testimony once more .", "The prosecutor invoked the audio - tape recording of her testimony previously given before ORG . Defence counsel was of the view that E should be heard in person and that a new attempt to bring her to ORG should therefore be made . However , counsel left it to the ORG to decide whether E \u2019s absence was an impediment to the holding of the hearing .", "ORG heard the applicant and an audio - tape recording of E \u2019s testimony to ORG . The evidence also included CARDINAL letters that E had addressed to the defence counsel , the public prosecutor and ORG respectively on DATE and DATE and DATE .", "In her letter to defence counsel of CARDINAL DATE , which was only submitted by counsel to ORG on DATE , E offered to take back all of what she had claimed previously against the applicant . She did not know how matters would evolve between them and thought that this was unimportant . In her view , the applicant had suffered enough by being detained on remand . She stated in addition that \" I know , as he does , what he has done to me \" . E finally asked defence counsel to lodge an appeal against ORG judgment and stated that she waived damages .", "In her letter to the prosecutor of DATE , E stated that she had made a big mistake , had lied about what had happened , that her motive had been revenge and that she retracted everything she had stated in court .", "Her letter addressed to defence counsel on the same date stated that her afore - mentioned letter to the prosecutor had not been worded in the right manner . When the event took place and the applicant \" took hold of her \" , she had relived a rape that she had experienced as a girl . She had become very uncertain about what had actually occurred and thought that she might have mixed up the situations .", "In her letter of DATE to ORG , E explained that she had lacked the financial means to attend its hearing on DATE . In her view , the police report was incorrect and this she had pointed out during the previous trial . Moreover , she claimed not to remember events that took place DATE in her and the applicant \u2019s apartment .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG upheld ORG conviction and sentence of the applicant and , because of E \u2019s statements , quashed the compensation order . It observed that ORG had heard E extensively , for TIME , and that the prosecutor , E \u2019s counsel and the applicant \u2019s counsel had asked her a large number of questions . The court went on to state :", "\u201c .... [ E. ] maintained during the hearing the information that she had first given to the police and she did not give any contradictory answers . Her testimony in ORG was full of details and gives the impression that she is talking about something that she indeed experienced . [ E ] had been eager not to exaggerate what happened . She had also pointed out that [ the applicant ] had not been violent previously and she also tried to give an explanation as to why he had acted as he did on the occasion in question . There is nothing to indicate that [ E ] should have any reason to tell lies about [ the applicant ] .", "[ E ] has stated in one of her letters that she sought revenge against [ the applicant ] . Nevertheless , she did not state why . [ The applicant ] has declared that he thinks that she would like to seek revenge on the ground that he called her a whore and that the relationship was over . It does not appear very likely that [ E ] would give false information deliberately for that reason .", "As to the rest of the information given by [ E ] in the case , it is to be observed that her statements remained substantially the same , from her report to the police until her testimony before ORG . Further , as regards the reliability of her statements , this must be considered as being strengthened by the medical certificate and the photograph . It appears unlikely that the injuries accounted for in the medical certificate had been caused by the course of events described by [ the applicant ] .", "The letters from [ E ] do not contain any information about what happened on the actual TIME , but only the allegation that she had lied . In CARDINAL of the letters she only stated that she had been uncertain about what had happened and that she could not remember the incident DATE after . Her letters are vague and lacking in detail . In the light of these facts the court attaches no weight to [ E \u2019s ] statements in the letters . \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
