The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed rape and uttered threats against a certain PERSON On DATE he was brought before FAC ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) and , upon the application of FAC ( Prokurator Rejonowy ) , detained on remand for DATE starting from the date of his arrest , that is , until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court held that the evidence against the applicant , in particular his partial confession , justified a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged . It also considered that there was a considerable risk that the applicant , if released , would obstruct the proceedings against him or induce witnesses to give false testimony . Moreover , CARDINAL of the offences in question ( rape ) carried a maximum sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , which made it likely that a severe penalty would be imposed on him . In sum , in the court \u2019s opinion , keeping the applicant in custody was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings .", "Earlier , the applicant and PERSON had been in a relationship that had lasted DATE , but they had terminated it DATE before the above events .", "CARDINAL . As regards the circumstances surrounding PERSON \u2019s decision to ask the prosecution to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant , the ORG submitted that , when testifying during the initial stage of the proceedings , she had stated that she had been afraid to terminate their relationship because she had been threatened by the applicant , and that on several occasions he had beaten her . On DATE , when ORG again heard evidence from her , she confirmed her decision .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , FAC had extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , holding that the grounds stated in the initial decision remained valid . It added that his detention was necessary to secure the process of obtaining evidence from experts in sexology , forensic psychiatry and psychology .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed on DATE . He contested the factual basis for the rape charge , arguing that it was doubtful whether his acts could be qualified as rape , in particular as they had been directed against his co - habitee , PERSON , whom he had beaten during intercourse because she had told him that she had had a relationship with another man . He had already confessed to battery . Moreover , since in his view it was the victim \u2019s evidence , not his , that was the most relevant for the outcome of the proceedings , there was no risk of his exerting pressure on her . He also relied on LAW , maintaining that , in these particular circumstances , his detention amounted to serving a prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was examined and rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . The court held that the charges against the applicant were supported by the existing evidence and that keeping him in detention was justified by a serious risk of collusion and of his interfering with the collection of evidence . These conclusions were based on the fact that the applicant had threatened the victim and used physical violence against her , and that one of the offences carried a severe penalty .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , PERSON had prolonged the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until DATE , relying on the grounds given in the previous decisions . The applicant appealed on DATE , again contesting the basis for the rape charge and submitting that there were serious doubts as to whether he had committed the offence since PERSON wished to marry him .", "CARDINAL . Earlier , on DATE , the applicant had asked PERSON to release him under police supervision , stating that on DATE he had received a visit from PERSON He had apologised to her and she had forgiven him for everything he had done . They wanted to get married and live a normal family life together . In consequence , she wished to withdraw all her accusations . As DATE was approaching , he wanted to spend it with PERSON and her daughter to strengthen their relationship and make amends for all the harm he had done to her . He feared that his continued detention would be detrimental to their relationship and to PERSON \u2019s young daughter , who treated him as her father and whom he treated as his own daughter .", "ORG rejected the application on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON asked ORG to release the applicant , unconditionally or under police supervision . She said that he had apologised and she had forgiven him . She thought he should be released because the time he had already spent in detention had changed him for the better and made him realise that what he had done was wrong . She believed that he would mend his ways as he was aware that if he did not he would be severely punished . She admitted that she had made her accusations against the applicant under the influence of the anger and pain he had caused her , adding that , for those reasons , she would like to be absolved from testifying against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to release him under police supervision . He stated that he loved PERSON and had apologised to her and been forgiven . What had happened would never happen again . They wanted to get married and live together . They could move into a flat that he had meanwhile inherited from his grandfather . PERSON needed his financial support and help taking care of her daughter , whom he used regularly to fetch from school . He added that , having been in detention since DATE , he had understood that what he had done had been wrong . He knew that he would never do it again . He wanted very much to be with PERSON and make amends to her for what he had done .", "The application was rejected on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant also filed a complaint that his appeal of DATE had been examined as late as DATE , that is to say DATE . This was incompatible with LAW , which required the court to examine the lawfulness of his detention \u201c speedily \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted before ORG on charges of rape and uttering threats .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard the applicant \u2019s appeal of DATE against the decision extending his detention until DATE . It dismissed the appeal , finding that the decision had been fully justified by the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings . In particular , the court stressed the risk of the applicant \u2019s exerting pressure on PERSON , especially in view of the fact that she had stated during the investigation that even when in detention he had sent her a letter hinting that after his release he might seek revenge on her . Moreover , the offence of rape carried a maximum sentence of DATE which , together with the serious circumstances of the incident as related by PERSON , gave sufficient grounds to believe that the applicant , given the severity of the penalty , might be prompted to bring pressure to bear on her in order to make her refuse to testify , or change her testimony .", "CARDINAL . The trial started on DATE . PERSON stated before the court that she \u201c was a family with the applicant \u201d and wished to exercise her right not to testify .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be held in detention pending trial until DATE . In particular , it relied on the risk of his bringing pressure to bear on PERSON It further reiterated all the previous grounds for his continued detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed and again contested the factual basis for the rape charge and stressed that his detention had exceeded a \u201c reasonable time \u201d within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , presumably on DATE , PERSON had made a written declaration to the court , submitting that she wished to exercise her right not to testify because she was , as defined in LAW ( NORP post\u0119powania karnego ) , \u201c in a particularly close personal relationship \u201d ( w szczeg\u00f3lnie bliskim stosunku osobistym ) with the applicant . She also asked the court to release the applicant and stated that she wished to marry him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON repeated that statement at a hearing and asked the court to absolve her from her duty to testify . However , the court rejected her request . It held , first , that her refusal was dictated by her fear of the applicant rather than by her affection for him and , secondly , that their relationship \u2013 both past and present DATE lacked the necessary psychological , physical and financial bonds to be regarded as a de facto marriage and , consequently , a \u201c particularly close personal relationship \u201d within the meaning of LAW that would override her duty to testify against the applicant at the trial . Since PERSON persisted in refusing to testify , the presiding judge imposed a fine on her for obstructing the trial .", "On DATE PERSON unsuccessfully appealed against the court \u2019s decision to fine her for refusing to testify . She again stated that she did not want to testify against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE , holding that ORG had correctly assessed the evidence before it and had rightly concluded that it fully indicated the probability that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged . It also analysed the circumstances surrounding PERSON \u2019s refusal to testify , explaining that , even though she had again informed the trial court that she would like to exercise her right not to testify because she regarded herself as a \u201c person in a particularly close relationship \u201d with the applicant , that question had to be decided finally by the trial court . In ORG opinion , regardless of how the trial court eventually qualified their relationship there was still the risk that the applicant would attempt to influence the witness , especially in view of his previous aggressive behaviour towards her . Lastly , referring to the complaint of a breach of LAW , the court rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments as to the allegedly excessive length of his detention . It observed that ORG had proceeded swiftly with the trial . Since DATE , the date on which the bill of indictment had been lodged , it had already held QUANTITY hearings and , as it had heard most of the evidence , the first - instance proceedings were soon to be concluded .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the applicant sent numerous letters to PERSON In DATE their number reached CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG gave CARDINAL further decisions prolonging the applicant \u2019s detention . On DATE it extended his detention until DATE and on DATE until DATE . The court relied on the grounds given in the previous decisions , attaching special importance to the risk of the applicant \u2019s tampering with the witness PERSON At that time the witness still maintained her decision to marry the applicant and her refusal to testify .", "CARDINAL . The applicant unsuccessfully appealed against those decisions , submitting that the trial court , by holding him in custody , repeatedly imposing fines on PERSON and refusing to grant them leave to marry in prison , had not only penalised him without him having been convicted but also showed no respect for their private life . In his view , this amounted to a \u201c misunderstanding \u201d and unjustified interference with their right to private life . He also relied on the fact that PERSON had stated before the court that she \u201c no longer felt that she had been raped \u201d , maintaining that the change of both parties\u2019 attitude to each other and to the applicant \u2019s deed was an important circumstance militating in favour of his release . In his appeals , he invoked LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . Before the end of the trial PERSON eventually testified , stating , among other things , that she no longer considered that the applicant had raped her and that she had forgiven him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It ordered that the applicant be held in custody pending the outcome of his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard the applicant \u2019s appeal . It upheld the conviction but reduced the sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , finding that the complete change of the victim \u2019s attitude to the applicant over the course of the proceedings fully justified the reduction . It also observed that that change could not have been dictated simply by her fear of the applicant because , had it been so , she would have preferred to have him locked up for the longest period possible .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a cassation appeal ( kasacja ) with ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) . ORG heard and dismissed the appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the trial court to grant him leave to marry PERSON in FAC . He maintained , among other things , that they both wished to solemnise their relationship and that they had already planned to get married in the past . In DATE their plans were delayed because PERSON , who had been pregnant with their child , had had a miscarriage . DATE was to be fixed for DATE but that fell through because he was arrested and detained on remand in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON requested PERSON to grant them leave to marry in prison . She stated that they had been together for DATE and remained in a close relationship for DATE . She also referred to their past decisions to get married DATE which had not been realised because of her miscarriage in DATE and , as regards the plans to fix a marriage date in DATE , because the applicant had been arrested . Furthermore , she submitted that their marriage would also be important for her daughter , who had developed a close emotional bond with the applicant , treated him as her father and missed him badly . Finally , she said that she loved the applicant very much and asked for her request to be granted .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held on DATE the applicant again asked the court to grant him leave to marry PERSON in prison . He said that he loved her very much and would like to marry her as soon as possible .", "PERSON , summoned by the presiding judge to the hearing room , confirmed that she had already applied to the court for leave to marry the applicant in ORG . She asked the court to enable her to contact him in order to discuss arrangements for the marriage . She continued to refuse to testify against him , saying that she loved him very much and deeply regretted what she had said at the police interview . She asked the court to regard her as his common - law wife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again asked ORG for leave to marry in FAC , maintaining that the judge had informed him at the hearing of DATE that leave had been granted and that he would receive it in writing . He further asked the court to grant him permission to have photographs taken of the ceremony and to serve light refreshments , such permission being required by the Governor of ORG in order to organise the event .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the presiding judge informed the applicant , his lawyer and PERSON that their requests for leave to marry in the remand centre had been refused . The letter read , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c FAC hereby informs you that the application for leave to contract a marriage in prison made by the accused PERSON and the injured party ( pokrzywdzona ) [ PERSON ] has not been granted in view of the interests of the proceedings .", "A prison or remand centre is no place to hold ... ceremonies so important in a person \u2019s life as a wedding .", "In this court \u2019s opinion no circumstances justify contracting a marriage in the remand centre . If indeed DATE which in the court \u2019s view is doubtful DATE the accused and the injured party are sure of their decision that is so important for them and for their families and want to hold a ceremony , they may plan it for another time and in another place than a remand centre .", "It should be noted that marriage is always connected with a ceremony and the participation of other persons whose presence is obligatory ; certainly , the conditions in a remand centre or prison are not suitable for it .", "If the accused and the injured party have known each other for DATE and they have not yet managed to officialise their life , in the circumstances of the present case their sudden decision to enter into a marital union sheds doubt on their intentions , to say the least .", "The accused and [ PERSON ] \u2019s decision to marry has emerged at TIME in the course of the proceedings , namely when the court refused to consider [ PERSON ] as a \u2018 close person\u2019 ( osoba najbli\u017csza ) \u2013 [ a status ] which would have given her the right to refuse to testify DATE and when it imposed a fine on her for unjustified refusal to testify .", "Thus , the court can not but find that a request for leave to contract a marriage [ made ] at this particular time is a further attempt to persuade the court that the relations between the accused and the injured party are of a close nature DATE which , in reality , in the court \u2019s opinion , is not the case and was invented only for the sake of the proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer replied to the letter on DATE . He stated that the court \u2019s arguments could not erase the applicant \u2019s and PERSON \u2019s right to marry guaranteed by LAW . He added that the mere fact that he was in detention did not deprive him of that right .", "CARDINAL . It appears that later the applicant and PERSON made further requests for leave to contract their marriage in the remand centre , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . In his cassation appeal against ORG judgment of DATE the applicant invoked LAW as one of the legal grounds for the appeal . ORG , in its above - mentioned judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , held that the refusal to grant the applicant leave to contract a marriage in prison constituted a violation of LAW . Nevertheless , in ORG view , this kind of \u2013 admittedly serious \u2013 breach of the law on the part of the trial court did not have any real bearing on the applicant \u2019s conviction and could not result in it being quashed .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of the reasoning of ORG judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c However , one must agree with the appellant that there has been a violation of LAW ] in the present case . This provision concerns the right to marry and in this context ORG Human Right \u2019s case - law states that a detainee can not be prohibited from marrying , except in order to prevent fictitious unions .... However , in the court \u2019s decision refusing the request made by the injured party and the accused for leave to marry , it was observed that if they had known each other for DATE and had not managed to officialise their life \u201c their sudden decision to enter into a marital union shed doubt on their intentions \u201d , especially as the request \u201c emerged at a particular moment ... when the court refused to consider [ PERSON ] as a \u2018 close person\u2019 \u201d ; this , in the [ court ] \u2019s view , was accordingly merely \u201c a further attempt to persuade the court that the relations between the accused and the injured party [ were ] of a close nature , which , in reality ... [ was ] not the case \u201d .", "These arguments are not convincing . It is in a way natural that the request for leave to contract a marriage emerged after the court \u2019s refusal to recognise the injured party \u2019s status at the trial because the injured party and the accused had previously regarded themselves as close persons . It is also evident that if the accused had not been kept in detention but had been released , there would have been no obstacles to his contracting a marriage . Only his incarceration made it impossible for him and the injured party to decide autonomously to get married . A prospective nuptial couple ( nupturienci ) do not have to prove and demonstrate to the relevant authority the depth of their feelings justifying their marriage . The court \u2019s decision , especially in view of the reasons given for it , was consequently wrong and amounted to a flagrant breach [ of the law ] since it infringed the standards laid down in LAW , which is binding on GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the detention on remand ( aresztowanie tymczasowe ) , the grounds for its prolongation , release from detention and rules governing other , so - called \u201c preventive measures \u201d ( \u015brodki zapobiegawcze ) are stated in the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of ORG v.

As regards the general situation of a detainee , during criminal proceedings against him he is considered to be \u201c at the disposal \u201d ( w dyspozycji ) of the authority \u2013 be it a prosecutor or a court DATE currently dealing with the case . CARDINAL of the consequences of this is that a detainee wishing to have visits from relatives in prison , or a visit from any third person or , as in the present case , to contract a marriage during his detention , must first obtain leave from the relevant authority . While the number and nature of visits in prison are regulated by the provisions of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences ( ORG karny wykonawczy ) and the Rules for Execution of Detention on Remand ( Regulamin wykonywania tymczasowego aresztowania ) , such matters as leave to contract a marriage in prison are entirely at the competent authority \u2019s discretion .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure grants an unqualified right not to testify only to the accused \u2019s closest relatives and an accomplice witness who has been charged with the same offence in another case ( Article CARDINAL ) . Except for national security , in all other situations , even such as client - lawyer privilege , doctor - patient privilege and journalist privilege , the prosecutor or the court can either absolve witnesses from their duty not to disclose confidential information or order them to testify ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a similar rule applies to persons who are in a \u201c particularly close personal relationship \u201d with the accused . This provision reads as follows :", "\u201c A person who remains in a particularly close personal relationship with the accused may , if he or she has so requested , be absolved from testifying or from replying to a question . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the light of ORG case - law and legal writing , a \u201c particularly close personal relationship \u201d is generally defined as a strong and long - lasting emotional bond between the accused and the witness , resulting , for instance , from friendship , colleagueship , engagement , cohabitation or tutorship such that the act of testifying causes the witness internal conflict .", "CARDINAL . Under the provisions of ORG ( PERSON i PERSON ) the registrar of ORG ( PERSON ) may refuse to solemnise a marriage only if there exists a statutory obstacle rendering the marriage null and void , such as age , legal incapacity , mental disorder , bigamy , close affinity of the parties or adoptive relationship ( Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE ) . In case of doubt , the registrar must ask the competent court to rule on whether the marriage can be contracted ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "Pursuant to LAW , a marriage before the registrar may not be concluded until DATE after the persons concerned have made a written declaration that they have no knowledge of any statutory obstacle to the solemnisation of their marriage . At their request and for important reasons , the registrar may solemnise the marriage before the expiry of that term .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of ORG lays down the rules for a proxy marriage . Contracting a marriage through a representative is subject to leave that can be granted by a family court in a non - contentious procedure . It depends on CARDINAL principal conditions . First , the court must be satisfied that there exist \u201c important reasons \u201d justifying the departure from the normal procedure .
