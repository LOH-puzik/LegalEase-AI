In the judgment , which runs to CARDINAL pages , the court reproduced and analysed the statements that the applicant had given in the pre - trial proceedings ( CARDINAL and DATE ) and at the trial ( DATE ) , as well as the medical report dated DATE and the oral evidence of the expert of DATE . Noting that the applicant \u2019s statements were inconsistent , the court gave weight to his confession statement of CARDINAL DATE , finding that it contained a clear , complete and logical description of the events of the critical date . It was given in accordance with the law : the applicant had been informed of his rights , and he had read the written transcript of the court hearing and had signed it . It held that that statement was consistent and reliable , because the applicant had given a chronological description of the events ; he had also given a detailed description of the device , the place and the means by which he had detonated it , which corresponded to the experts\u2019 reports regarding the incident . The statement of CARDINAL DATE was also corroborated with a detailed list of calls on the mobile phones confiscated from the convicted individuals , which confirmed that there had been intense communication between them before and after the incident .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court further established that in the statement of CARDINAL DATE the applicant had retracted his confession of QUANTITY DATE , which he had stated had been given under duress , namely that he had been beaten on that date by police while detained in the police station . On the basis of that testimony , the investigating judge had ordered an expert examination of the applicant . The experts , relying on medical science and practice , had established that the applicant \u2019s injuries had been inflicted DATE before the date of the examination ( DATE ) . Accordingly , the injuries had not been inflicted on DATE when he had been arrested and detained ; they had therefore not been inflicted by the police .", "CARDINAL . The court went on to say that after the expert examination the applicant had concocted another version of the events he had presented in his statement of CARDINAL DATE . In that statement the applicant had given another description of events , namely that he had not been detained on DATE and beaten up in the police station , but that on DATE the police had abducted and detained him in a luxurious house in ORG ; that he had been held under water in a swimming pool ; tied up ; and beaten , to make him confess to the crime . The court held that nothing suggested , as implied by the defence , that there had been CARDINAL periods of detention , the first unlawful ( DATE ) and the second ( DATE ) , lawful . The court held , referring to the decision of the investigating judge ( see paragraph DATE above ) , that the applicant had been detained on DATE in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . It further found that no evidence had been presented that the applicant had been arrested by the police on DATE and ill - treated in a house in ORG . That version of events , according to the court , was fictional and invented in order to match the date when the injuries had been inflicted , as established in the expert report . The court held that the applicant \u2019s statements of CARDINAL DATE and DATE were inconsistent and implausible . In his testimony of CARDINAL DATE the applicant had made no comment as regards his alleged abduction on DATE and interrogation in ORG . Contrary to the applicant \u2019s argument that he had been scared and confused when he had given his confession statement on DATE , the court record of his questioning of that date suggested no disorder or lack of capacity for rational perception . Had the investigating judge noticed any indication of unsafety , fear , panic or lack of capacity on the part of the applicant , he would have terminated the questioning .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court concluded that the applicant \u2019s confession statement of CARDINAL DATE coincided with the motives for committing the crime and the intention to provoke fear and unsafety . The drawing of the map of LOC and photographs of himself wearing military uniform and carrying weapons found in the applicant \u2019s possession confirmed his political determination to create an imaginary , non - existent entity by DATE through jihad . The court examined the evidence produced by ORG , but dismissed it as unreliable , for the following reasons : the witnesses were neighbours of the applicant ; the applicant \u2019s house was in the immediate vicinity of the LOC police station where the explosive had been placed , which had allowed him to leave the scene without being noticed ; they had been instructed to provide alibis , but their statements were incoherent .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG . He submitted , inter alia , that he had been convicted on the basis of unlawfully obtained evidence , namely his testimony of DATE , which had been given under duress . That the applicant had been subjected to police brutality was confirmed by his injuries described in the expert report of CARDINAL DATE . Besides that medical evidence and his clear description of events as to what had happened CARDINAL DATE , he could not produce any other evidence to support his allegations of abduction and ill - treatment . He further complained that he had not been legally represented when he had given the statement of CARDINAL DATE , notwithstanding that legal representation was obligatory . Lastly , he contested the lawfulness of the search of his father \u2019s house .", "CARDINAL . At a public session held on DATE , ORG , sitting in a CARDINAL - judge panel , upheld the trial court \u2019s judgment and dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court stated :", "\u201c The complaints ( that the applicant \u2019s conviction had been based on his confession statement given under duress ) were the subject of a complete and careful review by the adjudicating panel , which found them unsubstantiated . The trial court did not commit a substantive violation of procedural rules ... since there had been no evidence that ( the applicant \u2019s ) statement of DATE before the investigating judge had been given under duress ; ill - treatment ; physical assault ; or threats . That this statement was lawful was explained by the trial court in detail ( on CARDINAL pages ) ...", "The trial court , after examining all CARDINAL statements of ( the applicant ) , gave weight to his statement of CARDINAL DATE given before the investigating judge , as lawfully obtained and reliable evidence .
