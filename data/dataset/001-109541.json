On DATE , he entered into a contract with ORG ( \u201c the PCT \u201d ) in accordance with ORG ( ORG Regulations DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Under the terms of the contract , the applicant was obliged to ensure the provision of medical services to ORG patients registered with his medical practice . He could ensure this provision either by performing services himself or by employing another doctor to do so . The applicant was entitled , under the contract , to receive DATE payments from the PCT based on the number of patients registered with his practice . The PCT also paid him notional rent for his premises as they were used for ORG purposes . This was a discretionary payment , rather than an entitlement .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG handed down its judgment in the applicant \u2019s claim for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . As regards the purported suspension of DATE , Mr Justice PERSON found :", "\u201c It was apparent that this was a purported exercise of the power conferred by regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) . It was unlawful . It breached regulation ORG ) in that the claimant was neither told of the allegations against him nor given any opportunity to deal with them . It was also manifestly unfair . I can only express surprise that a PCT should so blatantly disregard not only the clear terms of the regulations but also the guidance given by the ORG and act in such an unfair manner . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the hearing in the applicant \u2019s absence on DATE , the judge considered that :", "\u201c Again , [ the PCT ] clearly acted in a manner which was unfair since the agreement to maintain a voluntary suspension meant that patients could not have been at risk if the hearing had been delayed . In fact , if they had taken advice , they would have been informed that the whole procedure was unlawful since they should not have suspended the claimant on DATE and so the hearing could not properly have considered representations against the decision to suspend . Rather , the PCT had to decide whether suspension was required and the burden was on them to justify suspension . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He found that the decision following that hearing to continue the applicant \u2019s suspension was also unlawful , commenting :", "\u201c In yet further breach of the regulations , this time regulation CARDINAL ) , the defendants failed to specify the period for which the suspension was to last . They gave as their reason for not accepting the offer of voluntary suspension that that \u2018 would not prevent you from working as a locum at another practice\u2019 . I am singularly unimpressed with that reasoning . The undertaking could easily have been extended to cover that if the defendants had bothered to raise it with the claimant and his advisers . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Regarding the hearing of DATE , the judge concluded :", "\u201c Unfortunately , there were serious flaws at the hearing of DATE which in my judgment rendered it unfair and so unlawful . The presenting officer was not content to rely on the matters of which notice had been given but proceeded to refer to a number of other matters against the claimant none of which had been put to him . This was a breach of regulation ORG ) . The chairman failed to stop him doing this , but contented herself , according to the notes provided subsequently , with instructing her colleagues on the panel after they had retired that \u2018 a lot of unnecessary information had been ORG and advising them \u2018 to confine their discussion to the issues which had been considered by the previous panel and those which PERSON had been notified of\u2019 . The notes show that this did not happen since during the discussion reference was made to PERSON being \u2018 unclear about the prescribing of colostomy bags and food GPE . Those related to matters not the subject of prior information . In any event , the matters raised must inevitably have prejudiced the claimant and the failure to exclude them at the hearing was itself unfair . Added to this , there was the failure to have [ a relevant witness ] attend despite the promise that he would and the observations of the presenting officer , compounded by the chairman , that the meeting was to review the decision to suspend the claimant . That has not been pursued by [ counsel for the applicant ] , but it is symptomatic of the failure by the PCT to follow the proper procedures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the decision to suspend the applicant following that hearing , he said :", "\u201c That [ decision ] was , quite apart from the unfairness of the hearing , unlawful since he had already been suspended on DATE and so could not be suspended beyond DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , in respect of DATE hearing , the judge concluded that , in light of the fact that the PCT had failed to revoke the previous suspension :", "\u201c ... the hearing on DATE was clearly unlawful since there was already an existing suspension in being ( assuming that that imposed on DATE was lawfully imposed ) and further the claimant had already been suspended ( whether lawfully or not being irrelevant ) for DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Having concluded that the applicant \u2019s suspension was unlawful , the question then arose whether there had been a breach of LAW No . CARDINAL . The relevance of the question was that only a breach of the applicant \u2019s human rights would have entitled him to damages under LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . Noting that under the terms of domestic legislation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) a doctor was prohibited from selling the goodwill in his practice , the judge found :", "\u201c In this case , inclusion in the list is akin to the possession of a licence . While the goodwill of the practice is not marketable , the inclusion has an intrinsic value in that it enables the doctor to practise . Since the amount of his remuneration will be affected by his patient numbers , suspension may well affect the economic value to him of his practice . Thus inclusion in the list has a present value apart from the right to future income and , as it seems to me , the decision in PERSON v The GPE supports the view that it can and does amount to a possession ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He was therefore persuaded that inclusion in the list was a \u201c possession \u201d for the purposes of LAW No . CARDINAL . Had the suspension been properly and lawfully imposed , he indicated that he would have had no doubt that the interference would have been proportionate and so justified . However , as it was unlawful for the reasons given , the interference was not justified . He concluded :", "\u201c ... Thus if the claimant can establish that he has suffered recoverable damage he may be entitled to some sums to recompense him for such loss . Since he should have been receiving payment which should have maintained his income , he may have difficulty in establishing any loss . However , I am not in a position to decide that issue . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The PCT and the Secretary of ORG appealed against the finding that there had been a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL . No appeal was lodged against the finding that the suspensions had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to the PCT referring to the ORG declaration that the suspension of the applicant from the Performers List was unlawful . They indicated that the applicant wished to return to practice as soon as practicable . By letter dated DATE the ORG agreed that the applicant could return to practice . However , given previous concerns regarding the medical practice LOC , the PCT wished to arrange a site inspection as soon as possible .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors confirmed that he consented to the site inspection and reiterated that he was anxious to return to practice as soon as possible . However , they explained that in order to ensure an orderly and organised return , he favoured a gradual reintroduction to work , with part - time work alongside another general practitioner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors requested from the PCT information concerning the size of the applicant \u2019s patient list immediately before the purported suspension in DATE and as it currently stood .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors informed the ORG that his health had deteriorated and that he was suffering from a stress - related illness . Accordingly , they requested that plans for the applicant \u2019s return to practice be held in abeyance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG \u2019s solicitors confirmed that the applicant \u2019s patient list size was CARDINAL patients on DATE and CARDINAL patients on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG handed down its judgment . Lord ORG identified CARDINAL questions for the court \u2019s consideration . The first question was in what respect future income could be an LAW possession \u201d . He considered it well established that LAW protected a right to existing possessions but not a future right to receive possessions . He continued :", "\u201c ... [ G]oodwill in the sense of an established client - base with its own inherent market value along with other existing assets of a business , may often not be readily distinguishable from future earning prospects from existing trading circumstances , since the existence or valuation of goodwill will turn at least in part on projected future earnings . However , no such blurring of the line can occur here , since Dr PERSON \u2019s clientele in the form of the patients registered with him has no economic value and so can not constitute a \u2018 LOC because of statutory denial to him of any marketable goodwill in his patients list ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the approach of this ORG to the question , the judge noted :", "\u201c PERSON , unlike PERSON and other such cases , did not , on its facts , turn on loss of goodwill and/or diminution in value of physical assets , but on what the ORG appears to have regarded as a sort of acceptable middle position , CARDINAL of a legitimate expectation of future earnings ...", "However , and with respect to ORG , the shadowy nature of such possessory entitlement is evident from the way in which it disposed of the case against the applicants . It held \u2013 assuming without deciding that the NORP ORG \u2019s decision had the effect of interfering with that entitlement DATE that the interference would have been justified under the second paragraph of the Article as being in the general interest ...", "In my view and with respect , ORG and ORG in Countryside displayed a surer touch , both of principle and practicality in rejecting the possibility of any such middle position between goodwill as a possession and future income which is not ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Thus on the question whether future income could be a \u201c possession \u201d , the judge concluded :", "\u201c In summary on the issues of goodwill and legitimate expectation , there is clear GPE authority , in GPE and other cases , and domestic authority , in GPE , that the assets of a business may include possessions for the purpose of LAW in the form of \u2018 PERSON or goodwill of the business . Where such clientele / goodwill exists , measures that diminish its value , as , for example in PERSON , interference with professional practice , may engage LAW . But where it does not exist , as it does not here , ORG decision in Countryside ... is also clear authority for the proposition that , without it , mere prospective loss of future income can not amount to a possession for the purpose . Equally , any consideration of a further category of LAW based on a notion of legitimate expectation in this context would unacceptably blur that distinction of principle . It would also , as I have indicated , lead to great difficulties of practical application in the next stages of the LAW exercise of identifying precisely what legitimately expected \u2018 ORG had been interfered with and to what extent , and in considering the \u2018 legitimacy\u2019 of the expectation against considerations of the general interest on the issue of justification . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the second question DATE whether a personal permission , in the form of inclusion on a professional list , or a licence was a possession \u2013 he noted :", "\u201c ... Something may have value to a person though it may have no value in the market . One can not comprehensively define possession for this purpose by reference to a person \u2019s ability or wish to sell it ... objects that may be of no economic value to their possessors \u2013 wholly unmarketable DATE may have a sentimental or other personal value to them for the protection of their enjoyment of which LAW should , if necessary , provide .", "...", "Where ... the possessory right claimed is , as here , to some intangible entitlement conferred by a licence or other form of permission to the grantee to continue to follow an activity to his advantage , it seems to me that some additional factor is necessary to render it a \u2018 possessory\u2019 entitlement as distinct from the broader concept of a legal right to do so . In many or most cases , such identification is likely to depend on the existence of some present economic value of the entitlement to the individual claiming it conferred by a licence or other form of permission .", "The questions of principle in this case DATE which is concerned with potential loss of livelihood \u2013 is , therefore , whether economic value is a distinguishing feature of a possessory right and whether it can only be identified in the sense of marketability . If it is not so confined , where , in any given case is the boundary between an LAW and some other and broader Convention right not amounting to such a possession ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . He considered that it was necessary to distinguish between claimed future monetary entitlements derived from an instrument such as a licence or permit and a claimed future entitlement based on a personal interest in enjoyment of it but not involving any monetary claim . He concluded :", "\u201c The matter has , in any event , been put beyond doubt in my view by the ruling of ORG , which binds us , upholding the reasoning of ORG that an individual \u2019s monetary loss , in the sense of loss of future livelihood , unless based on loss of some professional or business goodwill or other present legal entitlement , can not constitute a possession attracting the protection of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding his conclusion that there was no possession in the applicant \u2019s case , the judge went on to consider whether , if inclusion on the performers list had been a possession , the actions of the PCT would have deprived him of it . On this matter , he found :", "\u201c If inclusion in a performers list is , contrary to my view , an LAW , it would follow that suspension from it under LAW Lists Regulations is an interference with that \u2018 LOC . But ... the Judge did not reason the matter in that way ... [ PERSON recognised the need to examine the impact of suspension on PERSON practice , and concluded that there was such interference because his inclusion in the list had \u2018 a present value apart from the right to future income\u2019 in that the amount of his remuneration was affected by his patient numbers and suspension might well affect the economic value to him of his practice . However , there was no evidence before the Judge to support such finding of interference , in particular , no effective loss of remuneration or of actual or prospective loss of patients , since he continued to receive PERCENT of his ORG remuneration by reference to his patient list , pursuant to regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ... and his practice was preserved by the PCT arranging and paying for his patients to be seen by a locum ...", "I should add that there is nothing in the further point ... that interference could be established in the GPE \u2019s cessation of payment , following PERSON suspension , ... of notional rent for the use of his LOC ... During the period of his suspension Dr PERSON \u2019s practice continued to provide services to patients on his list , but did so , as I have said , through a locum engaged by the PCT to perform those services . Because of the unsatisfactory condition of PERSON surgery LOC , the PCT was obliged to refer his ORG patients to a locum at another nearby practice . However , his premises were still available for his use , for example , for the purpose of seeing private patients . More importantly , such notional rent as he might have continued to receive but for the suspension would not have constituted a possession for the purpose . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the question whether goodwill could constitute a \u201c possession \u201d in the present case , Lord Justice PERSON noted :", "\u201c The distinction between marketable goodwill , or at any rate that goodwill which it is acknowledged is a vested possession , and what ORG describes as being merely a present - day reflection of anticipated future income , has never had to be determined on the facts ... CARDINAL solution may be ... looking only to marketability . I am not sure of that , however , for CARDINAL reasons : CARDINAL is the substantive distinction drawn by ORG ; the other is the emphasis placed by the GPE jurisprudence on goodwill as a possession in the case of professionals with respect to their clientele . I suspect that such goodwill is not readily marketable : on the other hand , I can conceive that a professional practice can perhaps only or best be thought of as involving a vested possession in terms of the goodwill consisting in its clientele .", "In the present case , however , this difficulty does not need resolving , for , as ORG has pointed out ... , regulation CARDINAL of ORG on ORG Regulations DATE ... effectively means that an ORG doctor \u2019s goodwill has no economic value . As such , I do not see how it can be regarded as an asset or , therefore , a possession for the purposes of [ LAW . It is neither a physical thing ( land or chattels ) nor a right or other chose in action , nor an asset of any kind ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s inclusion in the Performers List , he considered the analogy between inclusion on the list and the grant of a licence to be unhelpful . He continued :", "\u201c ... licences come in all forms . Some licences are valuable assets in their own right .... Other licences are valuable only in the sense that they give value or greater value to some other asset . In such a case , the jurisprudence considered above , such as PERSON GPE itself in the case of a liquor licence , shows that the possessions in question which need to be considered are the underlying assets , not the licence . So also in GPE , which in its way is the closest authority to the facts of the instant case , it was not the affiliation to GPE \u2019s social security system which was regarded as the possession with which there had been interference by reason of its withdrawal , but the doctor \u2019s \u2018 vested interests\u2019 in his practice which had had to be closed down ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He considered that in the applicant \u2019s case , inclusion on the list was not a licence in itself but a condition precedent to a doctor being able to perform services himself in the ORG . Once on the list , a doctor was qualified to obtain a contract to provide medical services himself . If he was subsequently suspended from the list , he did not thereby lose his contract but lost only his ability to provide services under it by his own personal performance . He noted :", "\u201c So in PERSON case , his suspension from the performers list did not prevent his contract continuing , only his personal performance as a sole practitioner under it . Even so , because his contract remained in force , the PCT continued to pay him his ORG remuneration , subject only to a PERCENT deduction to take account of expenses that he would otherwise have incurred . ... PERSON patients continued to receive medical services through a locum for whom the PCT paid . He continued to be entitled to practise as a doctor privately , from his surgery .", "... It seems to me that inclusion on the performers list is a matter of regulation , a condition or qualification for performing ORG services , rather than a possession or property right in itself ... [ O]ne can not readily speak of the inclusion on the list as an economic interest . It is not an asset . It has no monetary value . If CARDINAL was looking for a possession in this context , one would look naturally to the ORG contract , but that remained on foot , and is not the subject matter of PERSON ... claim ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge considered whether there was some other possession which the applicant could rely upon , and concluded :", "\u201c ... For reasons discussed above , it is not possible for PERSON to show that his practice had any asset in the nature of goodwill separate from his anticipation of future income under his ORG contract . Reference to his patient list ... is in CARDINAL sense somewhat more to the point , because at least it can be said that the numbers on his list had a direct bearing , as I understand the matter , on his ORG remuneration , since that had to be recalculated DATE in accordance with those numbers . However , even so , his patient list remained in place , continued to earn him remuneration under his contract , and even if those numbers fell somewhat during the period of his suspension , as to which there was no evidence before the judge and no findings , that seems to me to be simply a matter relating to future income rather than an interference with vested rights in possession . The judge said that inclusion on the list had \u2018 an intrinsic value\u2019 in that it enabled the doctor to practise and he went on immediately to explain that because the amount of remuneration would be affected by patient numbers , \u2018 suspension may well affect the economic value of his practice\u2019 ... Although the judge then said that that reflected a present value apart from the right to future income , it seems to me that it plainly did not . The only way to measure any loss is by reference to future income . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the question whether , had there been a possession , there would have been an interference , he said :", "\u201c There has been no separate ground of appeal in relation to the separate question of whether , assuming that a relevant possession had been involved , there had been an interference with it ... It seems to me that it is strongly arguable that , if a relevant possession had been involved , then there would only have been an interference for the purposes of [ LAW if there had been material economic consequences : see PERSON , GPE , and PERSON above . It is not as though any case of deprivation has been made . But it has not been found that there were any material economic consequences . As stated above , the purpose of the regulations was to ensure that during a period of temporary suspension the financial consequences for the doctor concerned were intended to be neutral ; and there were mechanisms in place to resolve any disputes in that context . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , on the question whether there was a \u201c possession \u201d in the present case , Lord Justice PERSON noted :", "\u201c My concern , and , I suspect , that of the judge , for any unjustified damage to the doctor \u2019s reputation ... brings me to an essential issue relating to goodwill , which has arisen in the instant appeal . This court has had to grapple with the need to maintain a clear and workable distinction between goodwill which is a possession within the meaning of [ LAW , and a right to future income , which is not .", "ORG which is marketable is undoubtedly a possession , notwithstanding that its DATE value reflects a capacity to earn profits in the future . But does goodwill have to be marketable in order to be identified as a possession within the meaning of [ LAW Goodwill is composed of a variety of elements , which differs in different businesses and professions ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He considered that reputation was undoubtedly an element of goodwill , although it was not marketable . However , he concluded", "\u201c ... I agree , on the basis of the reasoning of PERSON ... and of ORG ... that that element of goodwill ... which is founded on the doctor \u2019s reputation , is not a possession within [ the meaning of LAW . It can not be sold , it has no economic value other than being that which a professional man may exploit in order to earn or increase his earnings for the future . If the principle that the ability to earn future income is not a possession within [ the meaning of LAW is to be maintained , it must follow that if the element of goodwill which has or may be damaged is reputation , or the loyalty of past clients , that element is not to be identified as a possession . In ORG terms , the doctor \u2019s complaint is as to an unjustified loss of reputation , caused by unlawful acts . But , in economic terms , that is no more than a complaint of a risk of loss of future income . It is not possible to distinguish his claim that his goodwill has been damaged from a claim to loss of future income . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently sought permission to appeal to ORG . Consideration of his petition for leave was deferred pending the outcome of an appeal in ORG , a case also concerning the applicability of LAW No . CARDINAL , in which the applicant was given leave to intervene in writing . On DATE , ORG handed down its judgment in ORG ( DATE ORG CARDINAL ) . In the course of the judgment , Lord PERSON of PERSON noted :", "\u201c GPE jurisprudence has drawn a distinction between goodwill which may be a possession for purposes of article CARDINAL of the first protocol and future income , not yet earned and to which no enforceable claim exists , which may not ... The distinction was less clearly applied in GPE v GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL DR CARDINAL where a doctor \u2019s vested interest in his medical practice was regarded as a possession , PERSON v GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL where an accountant \u2019s clientele was held to be an asset and hence a possession , and PERSON , above , at CD CARDINAL , where the same rule was applied to law practices : in these cases no finding was made that the assets were saleable , although this may have been assumed . In R ( PERSON ) v ORG ... ORG held that the inclusion of PERSON name on a list of those qualified to work locally for the ORG was in effect a licence to render services to the public and , being non - transferable and non - marketable , not a possession for purposes of LAW . While I do not find the jurisprudence on this subject very clear , I consider that ORG reached a correct conclusion in that case ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
