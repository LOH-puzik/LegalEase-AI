According to the ORG , since DATE FAC had been a part of the NORP trans - republican motorway running from GPE ( GPE ) to GPE ( GPE ) . In DATE ( after disintegration of the GPE ) the NORP authorities undertook a motorway stocktaking project and re - classified part of the motorway routed through the applicant \u2019s street as the \u201c MCARDINAL GPE - Lugansk - Izvarine motorway \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , until the DATE stocktaking project , the GPE - Volgograd motorway had never been routed through FAC . Instead , it ran through FAC in GPE . FAC , which is QUANTITY wide , is lined with private houses and gardens and is completely unsuitable for accommodating cross - town traffic . It has no drainage system , pavements or proper surfacing able to support heavy lorries and has been initially designed as an exclusively residential street . In DATE , in the course of the stocktaking project , ORG of ORG agreed , for the first time , that the MCARDINAL motorway should pass via FAC . In support of this allegation , the applicant provided a copy of a letter sent by the abovementioned ORG on DATE addressed to ORG ( PERSON ) , in which it notified that agency of its consent to the MCARDINAL motorway being routed via a number of streets in GPE , including FAC .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , following this change in the routing of traffic , her house eventually became practically uninhabitable . It suffered heavily from vibration and noise caused by up to CARDINAL lorries passing by TIME . In addition , air pollution increased substantially over DATE and numerous potholes emerged in the inadequate surface of the road . As a result of driving across these potholes , the vehicles emitted additional fumes and stirred up clouds of dust . In trying to deal with the potholes , the road service department started filling them with cheap materials , such as waste from nearby coal - mines , which had a high heavymetal content .", "CARDINAL .

During the test period of TIME , CARDINAL vehicles were recorded as having passed by , CARDINAL of which ( PERCENT ) emitted pollutants ( nitrogen dioxide , carbon monoxide , saturated hydrocarbons , lead , copper , etc . ) in excess of applicable safety standards . It was further established that the content of copper and lead in dust stirred up exceeded the safety standards by CARDINAL and CARDINAL times respectively . The monitoring team also noted that the road surface was damaged .", "CARDINAL . By way of evidence concerning the damage to the applicant \u2019s house , she presented a certificate dated DATE signed by a group of assessors consisting of a city council deputy , the head of the local ORG association and a private individual . The group attested that it had examined the house and found that it had been damaged . In particular , the basement was cracked and the walls were covered with coal dust , which had allegedly been used during ad - hoc repairs of the road aimed at filling the potholes and subsequently disturbed by passing traffic . It also noted that the road surface near the applicant \u2019s house had been badly damaged , thus amplifying vibrations from passing vehicles and causing vibration of the furniture inside the applicant \u2019s house and pieces of plaster to occasionally fall from its ceiling and walls .", "CARDINAL . By way of evidence of health damage , the applicant presented medical certificates attesting that her father , mother and minor son were suffering from numerous diseases .

On numerous occasions PERSON complained on the family \u2019s behalf to various authorities ( including the President of GPE , ORG , the municipal authorities and the prosecutor \u2019s office ) about intolerable levels of nuisance and pollution from FAC . According to the case file , the first complaints were lodged by her no later than DATE . On various occasions analogous complaints were also lodged individually and collectively by other K. Street residents . It is unclear from the case file what actions , if any , were taken by the authorities in response to these complaints prior to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the assessment of pollution levels undertaken on DATE ( mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the NORP Regional Chief Sanitary Officer ( \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043b\u0456\u043a\u0430\u0440 PERSON \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456 ) ordered the ORG Mayor to consider stopping through traffic using FAC and repairing FAC road surface . In his decision , that official mentioned that FAC was designated as a temporary transit thoroughfare and that heavy traffic had ruined the surface of the road . He further noted that the level of air pollution on FAC was in breach of the PERSON of GPE \u201c On ORG ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) and that such pollution could have adverse effects on the ORG health .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON complained to ORG about the level of pollution and demanded the initiation of a criminal investigation into the situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected her demand , having found that while the fact of excessive pollution was not in dispute , there was no basis for linking this situation to any criminal wrongdoing on any authority \u2019s behalf . There was no appearance that the decision to use FAC as a transit road had been in and of itself unlawful . As regards repairing the road , ORG had ordered ORG ( hereafter \u201c the Executive Committee \u201d ) to redress violations of environmental law . It further notified PERSON that according to its information , repairs were planned for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC was blocked to prevent the further passage of automobile traffic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP Regional Prosecutors\u2019 Office further informed PERSON that on DATE ORG had decided to order repairs to FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief of ORG of the ORG recommended that the municipality find funding for the repair of the surface of PERSON and L. Streets .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG ( DATE \u201c the Highways Agency \u201d ) wrote to the Mayor of ORG , acknowledging that the section of the MCARDINAL road in the region was not sufficiently equipped to accommodate the increased traffic and that there was an urgent need to build transit routes bypassing populated communities , including ORG . However , regard being had to the lack of available funding , these works had not been carried out and ORG had asked its central headquarters to deal with the situation . It further suggested that the GPE municipality should renovate the intown part of the road using funds garnered from automobile tax retained by the city treasury .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed ORG that repairing the surface of FAC had been entered into ORG for DATE . However , no funding for the works had ever been received . It further noted that ORG lacked any alternative roads meeting the standards of a transit thoroughfare and that the use of FAC for this purpose \u2013 which it was unequipped for \u2013 had resulted in heavy deterioration of its surface .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP Regional Chief Sanitary Officer confirmed in his correspondence that the passage of vehicles through FAC had been impossible , the street having been blocked by concrete blocks and other barriers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG , without providing any supporting materials , that the use of K. Street as a motorway had been recently restarted without any in - depth repairs having been carried out .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON lodged a civil claim on the applicant \u2019s behalf , seeking to oblige ORG to resettle the family and to pay CARDINAL hryvnias ( ORG ) in compensation for damage caused to their house and health by the operation of the MCARDINAL motorway .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the trial , the court examined written evidence presented by the applicant and questioned officials of the municipal ORG , and officers from the traffic police . ORG official stated that FAC was QUANTITY wide ; it had no drainage or pavements because there was no funding available for constructing these amenities . ORG official acknowledged that his department was partly responsible for ORG maintenance , which was to be funded by ORG and from automobile taxes . As the funding had not been forthcoming , the street had not been maintained properly . He also opined that the damage to the applicant \u2019s house had more likely been caused by construction flaws than by the operation of the motorway . The official from ORG submitted that FAC , being part of a motorway , was to be managed by it jointly with ORG . Finally , a traffic police officer submitted that for DATE there had been no complaints of traffic accidents on FAC and that twice a year the traffic police examined the state of the road .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected PERSON claim . The full text of its reasoning reads as follows :", "\u201c It has been established in court that FAC in GPE hosts ORG motorway .", "The plaintiff did not provide the court with evidence that on account of ORG fault the road is operated in breach of technical requirements existing for this category of roads . The plaintiff did not specify which particular provisions have been breached .", "In addition , the plaintiff did not provide evidence that it is the [ ORG ] fault that her lawful rights have been infringed , namely , [ that ] her house has been destroyed , [ and that ] herself and her family suffer from various illnesses , resulting in mental distress .", "Based on the above , the court considers it necessary to reject the claim as illfounded ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed . Referring primarily to LAW and LAW , she noted , in particular , that by focusing on the issue of the road \u2019s maintenance , the first - instance court had deviated from the object of her claim . In fact , instead of seeking to oblige the plaintiff to repair the street , she had demanded resettlement , as in her opinion the street was completely unsuitable for hosting a motorway in the first place . The defendant had been at fault , not only for allowing through traffic , but also for failure to organise its regular supervision by traffic police , environmental and sanitary services to ensure safety , and anti - pollution measures . The claimant asserted that the witnesses had presented inaccurate data . In particular , there had been numerous traffic accidents on FAC , and a recent police response to CARDINAL of the ORG complaints about that issue had been included in the case file . PERSON further complained that the court had failed to summon officials from the environmental and sanitary services to present comprehensive information about the environmental situation around the road and so had failed to ensure her and her family \u2019s right of access to environmental information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed this appeal . The full text of the court \u2019s reasoning was as follows :", "\u201c Rejecting the claim of PERSON ORG , the court lawfully concluded that ORG motorway has been assigned on the basis of full managerial maintenance to the [ Highways Agency ] ... and not to ORG .", "The plaintiff did not provide the court with any evidence that the defendant had wrongly caused her non - pecuniary damage and did not specify the legal basis for compensation of the [ alleged ] non - pecuniary damage and [ for ] resettlement ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON appealed in cassation . She submitted that in her view ORG had been the proper defendant . In support of this argument , she provided a letter from ORG dated DATE informing her that FAC was not on its books and that it was to be managed by the municipality . She further alleged that the court had never examined whether the decision of ORG for GPE and ORG taken in DATE to route through traffic via FAC had been lawful and reasonable . She considered that it had been unlawful to turn a QUANTITY - wide street into a motorway , especially in light of the subsequent failure of the municipality to organise proper environmental monitoring and management of the road . PERSON additionally mentioned that the first measurement of pollution levels had been carried out only in DATE , following numerous complaints by the street \u2019s residents .", "CARDINAL .
