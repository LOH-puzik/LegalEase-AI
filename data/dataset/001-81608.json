On DATE the applicant sought leave to summon another CARDINAL witnesses from PERSON to prove his allegation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s requests to summon these witnesses . Relying on LAW , second sentence , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it considered the testimony of these witnesses to be of little evidential value . CARDINAL of these witnesses had made written statements which had already been read out in court . CARDINAL of them had actually claimed to have visited the applicant in prison . Having regard to the evidence already taken , the court could exclude the possibility that the testimony of the witnesses named by the applicant , if heard in person , might influence the court \u2019s assessment of the evidence . It pointed out that CARDINAL witnesses who had already been heard in court , including CARDINAL journalists who had not been victims of the crimes the applicant was accused of , had seen the applicant in different places outside prison during the time he claimed to have been detained . The documents submitted by the applicant in relation to the beginning and end of his detention in PERSON did not warrant a different conclusion , as they had obviously been signed by a person whom the applicant knew well .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the court to call CARDINAL witnesses from PERSON in order to prove that he had been detained between CARDINAL May and CARDINAL DATE . He also requested an inspection of the scene of the crime ( PERSON ) in PERSON or , alternatively , that a topographical map be drawn up in order to prove that the ORG statements concerning his purported acts in PERSON were untrustworthy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s requests . As regards the refusal to summon the CARDINAL witnesses named , the court , again relying on LAW , found that the testimony of these witnesses would be of little evidential value . Having heard the evidence given by other witnesses , it was satisfied that the applicant had not been detained at the material time . It further considered an inspection of the scene of the crime or the drawing - up of a topographical map thereof to be unobtainable evidence ( unerreichbare ORG ) within the meaning of LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which it therefore did not have to accept .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG convicted the applicant on CARDINAL counts of genocide ( Article CARDINALa nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW see paragraph DATE below ) and for the murder of CARDINAL people in CARDINAL case , CARDINAL people in another case , and CARDINAL person in a third case . In the remaining cases , he was convicted on several counts of dangerous assault and deprivation of liberty . It sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment and stated that his guilt was of a particular gravity ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The court found that the applicant had set up a paramilitary group , with whom he had participated in the ethnic cleansing ordered by the NORP political leaders and the NORP military in the PERSON region . He had in particular participated in the arrest , detention , assault and ill - treatment of male NORP of CARDINAL villages in GPE at DATE and DATE . He had killed several inhabitants of these villages . He had in particular shot DATE inhabitants of the village of PERSON \u2013 women and disabled and elderly people \u2013 in DATE .

In DATE the applicant had killed a prisoner , who was being ill - treated by soldiers in the PERSON prison , with a wooden truncheon in order to demonstrate a new method of ill - treatment and killing .", "CARDINAL . The court stated that it had jurisdiction over the case pursuant to LAW CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . There was a legitimate link for criminal prosecution in GPE , as this was in accordance with GPE \u2019s military and humanitarian missions in GPE and the applicant had resided in GPE for DATE and had been arrested there . Furthermore , agreeing with the findings of an expert in public international law , the court found that the NORP courts were not debarred under public international law from trying the case . In particular , neither LAW ) , nor LAW for the former GPE ( ICTY Statute ) ( see paragraphs DATE below ) excluded the jurisdiction of NORP courts over acts of genocide committed outside GPE by a foreigner against foreigners . The court considered that this view was confirmed by the fact that ORG for the former GPE ( ORG ) had stated that it was not willing to take over the applicant \u2019s prosecution .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court found that the applicant had acted with intent to commit genocide within the meaning of Article PERSON of LAW . Referring to the views expressed by several legal writers , it stated that the \u201c destruction of a group \u201d within the meaning of Article PERSON of the Criminal Code meant destruction of the group as a social unit in its distinctiveness and particularity and its feeling of belonging together ( \u201c ORG sozialer PERSON in ihrer GPE und Eigenart und ihrem GPE \u201d ) ; a biological - physical destruction was not necessary . It concluded that the applicant had therefore acted with intent to destroy the group of NORP in the north of GPE , or at least in the PERSON region .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following an appeal by the applicant on points of law and after a hearing , convicted the applicant on CARDINAL count of genocide and CARDINAL counts of murder . It sentenced him to life imprisonment and stated that his guilt was of a particular gravity .", "CARDINAL . Endorsing the reasons given by ORG , it found that NORP criminal law was applicable to the case and that the NORP courts consequently had jurisdiction over it by virtue of Article CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW . It found , in particular , that no rule of public international law prohibited the applicant \u2019s conviction by the NORP criminal courts in accordance with the principle of universal jurisdiction ( ORG / PERSON ) enshrined in that Article . It conceded that the said principle had not been expressly laid down in LAW , despite earlier drafts of LAW in which it had been proposed to do so . However , the said Article did not prohibit persons charged with genocide from being tried by national courts other than the tribunals of the ORG in the territory of which the act was committed . Any other interpretation would not be reconcilable with the erga omnes obligation undertaken by ORG in LAW to prevent and punish genocide ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The aforesaid interpretation of LAW was also confirmed by LAW , which provided for concurrent jurisdiction of the ORG and all other national courts .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , ORG found that the NORP courts also had jurisdiction pursuant to LAW no . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not expressly deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG , in its decision of DATE , had refused to summon abroad any of the defence witnesses he had named on the basis of LAW . However , it referred in general to the submissions of ORG ( ORG ) , who had argued that the applicant \u2019s appeal was inadmissible in this respect , as he had failed to set out the relevant facts in sufficient detail . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG , in its decision of DATE , had refused to summon CARDINAL further defence witnesses abroad , ORG considered his complaint to be inadmissible , as he had not sufficiently set out the relevant facts and had not provided sufficient reasons in his appeal . The court further referred to ORG submissions regarding the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG had refused to have a topographical map drawn up . According to ORG , the applicant \u2019s complaint was ill - founded in this respect , especially as ORG already had a video of the relevant locality .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld ORG finding that the applicant had intended to commit genocide within the meaning of Article PERSON of LAW , but found that his actions as a whole had to be considered as only CARDINAL count of genocide . It referred to the wording of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL ( imposition of measures which are intended to prevent births within the group ) and no . CARDINAL ( forcible transfer of children of the group into another group ) in support of its view that genocide did not necessitate an intent to destroy a group physically , but that it was sufficient to intend its destruction as a social unit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the criminal courts had not violated any provision of LAW by establishing their jurisdiction pursuant to LAW CARDINAL of the Criminal Code taken in conjunction with LAW . The principle of universal jurisdiction afforded a reasonable link to deal with subject matter arising outside the territory of GPE , while observing the duty of non - intervention ( ORG ) under public international law . The competent ORG reasoning , namely , that LAW CARDINAL of the Criminal Code taken in conjunction with LAW entitled them to examine the applicant \u2019s case , was not arbitrary . It could properly be reasoned that LAW , while not expressly regulating the principle of universal jurisdiction , provided that the Contracting Parties were not obliged to prosecute perpetrators of genocide , but had jurisdiction to do so . In fact , genocide was the classic subject matter to which the principle of universal jurisdiction applied . The criminal courts\u2019 reasoning did not interfere with GPE and GPE \u2019s personal or territorial sovereignty , as that ORG had expressly refrained from requesting the applicant \u2019s extradition .", "CARDINAL . Pointing out that in the case of an admissible constitutional complaint it was entitled to examine the act complained of under all constitutional angles , ORG further found that the applicant \u2019s right to a fair trial as guaranteed by LAW had not been violated . There was no doubt that LAW and CARDINAL of LAW were constitutional . The legislature was not obliged to set up specific rules of procedure for certain criminal offences . The right to a fair trial did not grant the applicant a right to have certain evidence taken , such as calling witnesses who had to be summoned abroad .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the interpretation of Article PERSON of LAW , ORG found that there had been no violation of the principle that criminal law was not to be applied retroactively as guaranteed by LAW . It stated that the way in which ORG and ORG had construed the notion of \u201c intent to destroy \u201d in the said LAW was foreseeable . Moreover , the interpretation conformed to that of the prohibition of genocide in public international law \u2013 in the light of which Article PERSON of LAW had to be construed \u2013 by the competent tribunals , several scholars and as reflected in the practice of ORG , as expressed , inter alia , in LAW of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG declared inadmissible a request by the applicant to reopen the proceedings . The fact that one of the witnesses who had been examined by ORG , and who was the only person claiming to have been an eyewitness to the applicant murdering CARDINAL people in PERSON , was suspected of perjury did not warrant a reopening . Even assuming that the said witness had invented the allegations against the applicant , the latter would still have to be sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide and on CARDINAL counts of murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( decision served on DATE ) ORG decided that the applicant \u2019s request to reopen the proceedings was admissible in so far as it concerned the murder of CARDINAL people in PERSON . It pointed out , however , that , even assuming that the applicant \u2019s conviction on CARDINAL counts of murder was not upheld , his conviction for genocide and on CARDINAL counts of murder , and therefore his life sentence , including the finding that his guilt was of a particular gravity , would prevail .", "CARDINAL . In a constitutional complaint of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant claimed that the decisions of ORG and ORG concerning the reopening of the proceedings violated his right to liberty as guaranteed by LAW . He argued that they had erred in their finding that , in the proceedings to have the case reopened , the question whether the applicant \u2019s guilt was of a particular gravity did not have to be assessed anew .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to reopen the proceedings in respect of the applicant \u2019s conviction for shooting CARDINAL people in PERSON . It found that the only person claiming to have been an eyewitness to these murders was guilty of perjury at least in respect of some other statements . Therefore , it could not rule out the possibility that the judges then adjudicating the case would have acquitted the applicant on that charge if they had known that some statements by this witness had been false .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant \u2019s request to reopen the proceedings was granted , ORG discontinued the proceedings . It argued that the sentence to be expected by the applicant , if he was again found guilty of having murdered CARDINAL people in PERSON , was not significantly greater than the sentence which had already been imposed upon him with binding effect for genocide . Consequently , the judgment of ORG of DATE remained final regarding the applicant \u2019s conviction for genocide and on CARDINAL counts of murder , including the court \u2019s finding that his guilt was of a particular gravity .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant is the first person to be convicted of genocide by NORP courts under Article PERSON since the incorporation of that LAW into LAW . At the time the applicant committed his acts in DATE , a majority of scholars took the view that genocidal \u201c intent to destroy a group \u201d under Article PERSON of LAW had to be aimed at the physical - biological destruction of the protected group ( see , for example , PERSON in ORG GPE , CARDINALth edition , GPE DATE , Article CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL with further references ) . However , a considerable number of scholars were of the opinion that the notion of destruction of a group as such , in its literal meaning , was wider than a physical - biological extermination and also encompassed the destruction of a group as a social unit ( see , in particular , PERSON , PERSON GPE DATE . DATE und die PERSON , DATE ) , p. CARDINAL , and PERSON in ORG , CARDINALth edition , GPE , GPE DATE , LAW , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

It is sufficient that the court , in the proper exercise of its discretion , deems the examination of the witness not to be necessary for establishing the truth .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant provision of LAW , which came into force for GPE on CARDINAL DATE , provides :", "\u201c In the present Convention , genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such :", "( a ) Killing members of the group ;", "( b ) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ;", "( c ) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ;", "( d ) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ;", "( e ) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Several recent declarations and decisions , however , have interpreted the intent to destroy ... so as to encompass evidence relating to acts that involved cultural and other non - physical forms of group destruction .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , ORG labelled ethnic cleansing as a form of genocide . ...", "CARDINAL . ORG of Germany said in DATE that", "the statutory definition of genocide defends a supra - individual object of legal protection , i.e. the social existence of the group ... the intent to destroy the group ... extends beyond physical and biological extermination ... The text of the law does not therefore compel the interpretation that the culprit \u2019s intent must be to exterminate physically at least a substantial number of the members of the group . ...", "CARDINAL . ORG is aware that it must interpret the Convention with due regard for the principle of nullum crimen sine lege . It therefore recognises that , despite recent developments , customary international law limits the definition of genocide to those acts seeking the physical or biological destruction of all or part of the group . Hence , an enterprise attacking only the cultural or sociological characteristics of a human group in order to annihilate these elements which give to that group its own identity distinct from the rest of the community would not fall under the definition of genocide . ORG however points out that where there is physical or biological destruction there are often simultaneous attacks on the cultural and religious property and symbols of the targeted group as well , attacks which may legitimately be considered as evidence of an intent to physically destroy the group . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Trial Chamber \u2019s judgment was upheld in this respect by the judgment of DATE rendered by ORG of the ORG , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-A , which found :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

The fact that the forcible transfer does not constitute in and of itself a genocidal act does not preclude a ORG from relying on it as evidence of the intentions of members of ORG .

Similarly , in the case of Prosecutor v. PERSON and Others ( ITCARDINAL-T , judgment of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , which concerned the killing of CARDINAL NORP in order to expel the NORP population from a village , the ORG found :", "\u201c Persecution is CARDINAL step away from genocide \u2013 the most abhorrent crime against humanity DATE for in genocide , the persecutory intent is pushed to its utmost limits through the pursuit of the physical annihilation of the group or of members of the group . In the crime of genocide the criminal intent is to destroy the group or its members ; in the crime of persecution the criminal intent is instead to forcibly discriminate against a group or members thereof by grossly and systematically violating their fundamental human rights . In the present case , according to the Prosecution \u2013 and this is a point on which ORG agrees DATE the killing of NORP civilians was primarily aimed at expelling the group from the village , not at destroying the NORP group as such . This is therefore a case of persecution , not of genocide . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of GPE and GPE ( \u201c Case concerning application of FAC \u201d ) , ORG ( ICJ ) found under the heading of \u201c intent and \u2018 ethnic cleansing\u2019 \u201d ( at \u00a7 CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The term \u2018 ethnic PERSON has frequently been employed to refer to the events in GPE and GPE which are the subject of this case ...

It [ i.e. , ethnic cleansing ] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the LAW , if it corresponds to or falls within CARDINAL of the categories of acts prohibited by LAW . Neither the intent , as a matter of policy , to render an area \u2018 ethnically homogeneous\u2019 , nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy , can as such be designated as genocide : the intent that characterizes genocide is \u2018 to destroy , in whole or in ORG a particular group , and deportation or displacement of the members of a group , even if effected by force , is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group , nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement . This is not to say that acts described as \u2018 ethnic cleansing\u2019 may never constitute genocide , if they are such as to be characterized as , for example , \u2018 deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in ORG , contrary to LAW , paragraph ( c ) , of the LAW , provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent ( dolus specialis ) , that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group , as distinct from its removal from the region .
