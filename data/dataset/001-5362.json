AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE ( GPE ) . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the father of CARDINAL daughters born in wedlock in DATE and DATE , respectively .", "On DATE ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) granted the petition of the applicant and his wife for divorce by consent . In the settlement regulating the legal consequences of the divorce , the applicant and his wife agreed , outside the framework of section CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) which was at that time under review by ORG , to exercise joint custody over their daughters . The settlement provided that the applicant and his wife would share responsibility for their children . Further , it stated that the children would mainly live with their mother , the applicant being granted extensive access rights . It also contained provisions for the children \u2019s maintenance . The settlement was subject to approval in separate custody proceedings .", "On DATE the ORG refused to approve the settlement . Referring to section QUANTITY of LAW , the court found that joint custody could not be granted . The ORG granted sole custody to the applicant \u2019s divorced wife , noting that according to both GPE submissions she was better suited to exercise custody . Thus , the transfer of custody was also in the interests of the children . Further , the court endorsed the settlement insofar as it concerned the applicant \u2019s rights of access and his maintenance obligations . The applicant did not appeal against this decision .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Award of custody over children upon divorce or separation", "Section CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) In case the marriage of the parents of a minor born in wedlock ends in divorce , or is dissolved or declared null and void , or in case the parents live separately for more than a limited period , they may submit an agreement to the court stating which CARDINAL of them will exercise sole custody over the child in the future . The court will approve the agreement if it corresponds to the interests of the child \u2019s well - being .", "( CARDINAL ) If no agreement is reached within a reasonable time or if the agreement does not correspond to the interests of the child \u2019s well - being , the court has to decide which parent should have the right to sole custody in the future . In case the parents live separately for more than a limited period , the court only decides upon the request of CARDINAL of them .", "( CARDINAL ) Section CARDINAL applies accordingly . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides , for children born out of wedlock , that the court may award joint custody to the parents upon their common request if they permanently live in a common household with the child and if such a ruling is not disadvantageous to the child \u2019s well - being .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG ruled on the constitutionality of section CARDINAL of LAW . It noted ORG constant case - law according to which section CARDINAL excluded an award of joint custody to both parents in case of divorce , except in the rare case when they continued to live together with the child in a common household . As to LAW , it found that the award of sole custody after divorce to CARDINAL parent was an interference with the other parent \u2019s right to respect for his or her family life , which was justified under the second paragraph of this Article . Given the legislator \u2019s margin of appreciation , it was to be considered necessary for the protection of the rights of others . In particular , it was proportionate , as the parent not having custody retained a number of rights , such as the right of access and the right to be informed and heard on certain important matters . Moreover , the law did not prevent parents who wished to share their parental rights after divorce from doing so in practice by mutual agreement , but provided a clear solution in case such agreement ceased to exist . As to LAW , ORG found that this provision did not prevent the legislator from creating different legal positions for spouses after divorce as long as such differences were not based on gender alone . It did not generally demand that joint custody be awarded to parents after divorce .", "Rights of the parent not having custody", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , the parent not having custody has a right of access .", "Moreover , according to section CARDINAL of LAW , the parent not having custody has the right to be informed by the other parent about certain measures listed in LAW ( which in cases of joint custody require the agreement of both parents ) , and has the right to be heard within a reasonable time . The submissions of the non - custodial parent are to be taken into account if the wishes expressed therein better serve the interests of the child \u2019s well - being . The measures at issue include the change of the child \u2019s first or family name , the entry into or secession from a church or other religious group , the child \u2019s placement in care , the acquisition or renunciation of a particular nationality , the early termination of an apprenticeship or employment contract , the recognition of paternity of a child born out of wedlock , as well as certain important provisions concerning the child \u2019s property ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
