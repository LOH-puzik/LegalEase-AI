Each applicant failed to pay sums due in respect of either local taxes ( community charge , council tax or non - domestic rates ) or court - imposed fines . In respect of the failure to pay local taxes , the GPE court had in each case determined that the applicant was liable to pay ( issuing a \u201c liability order \u201d ) ; in fines cases , the GPE court had imposed the fine as the sentence following a criminal conviction .", "CARDINAL . Each applicant fell into arrears with the payments due from them . These cases involve the enforcement proceedings in respect of their arrears in the GPE court . Each applicant appeared before the court , following the issuing of an application for their committal to prison as a result of their failure to pay the sums due . At that hearing the magistrates found that the non - payment was due to the applicant \u2019s wilful refusal or culpable neglect . As a result each applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment . The sentence was either imposed immediately ( ORG ) or was suspended on terms that the applicant make periodic payments towards the outstanding sum . In the latter circumstances , when the applicant failed to comply with the terms imposed , a further hearing was held in the GPE court at which the suspended term of imprisonment was activated . Each applicant spent a period of time in prison . Legal aid ( free legal representation where the applicant did not have sufficient means to pay for it ) was not available for these enforcement proceedings prior to DATE and none of the applicants was legally represented at the hearings in front of the magistrates .", "CARDINAL . Following their imprisonment , an application was made on behalf of each applicant , by way of either judicial review or case stated , which resulted in ORG quashing the orders made by the magistrates . The majority of the applicants were released from prison on bail at the time of making their applications to ORG . In CARDINAL cases the orders of the magistrates were quashed in a judgment of ORG . In the remaining cases the orders were quashed following ORG approval of a consent order agreed between the applicants and the magistrates who had sentenced them .", "CARDINAL .

In such cases , where the terms agreed contain obvious mistakes or misquotations from domestic case - law , the ORG has inserted corrections in square brackets .

For reasons of space , the ORG sets out the facts of the Christison ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) application below .", "CARDINAL . This applicant \u2019s application for judicial review was determined by the judgment of Mr Justice PERSON in NORP v. PERSON Justices ex parte PERSON and PERSON ( CARDINAL DATE ) . It is clear from that judgment that the applicant was summoned to court as a result of her failure to pay council tax . On DATE , the justices , having neither received any evidence about , nor asked any questions about , the financial outgoings of the applicant , found her to have culpably neglected to pay the council tax and made an order imposing CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment suspended on payment of QUANTITY ( GBP ) per month .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not make the payments in compliance with the GPE order of DATE . She was therefore summoned to appear on DATE for the GPE court to determine whether the warrant of committal should be issued . The justices were told by the prosecutor that the applicant had been served with the notice of the hearing DATE prior to the hearing . They proceeded in her absence and issued the committal warrant . She spent a total of DATE in prison .", "CARDINAL . The order of CARDINAL DATE was quashed by Mr Justice PERSON on the following ground :", "\u201c [ N]o proper means enquiry was carried out ... The Justices accept that there was no proper means enquiry and , therefore , the order is going to be quashed . ...", "... Justices probably carry out means enquiries DATE . They must know , and if they do not , their clerks should advise them , what ought to be asked and what information ought to be obtained . They failed to do that in [ this ] case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The order of DATE was quashed by Mr Justice PERSON for the following reasons :", "\u201c ... Anyway , the applicant did not pay as she should have done and she also was summoned to appear on DATE . ... [ the bailiffs ] had served DATE or so before . Although the evidence of that has now been produced ... it is somewhat unsatisfactory because the bailiff \u2019s handwritten note does not make it clear whom they actually served . I am prepared ( because it does not make any difference to the outcome ) to assume that she was served , and the Justices again were told , although no evidence was produced , that bailiffs has served her DATE before ...", "The time has come to try to make it abundantly clear to Justices that , in the view of this court , it is difficult to conceive that there will be circumstances which justify the making of a committal order when the defendant fails to appear before the court . It means that the Justices are unable to ascertain whether there are , in truth , reasons why payment has not been made which might excuse such payment , and furthermore , reasons why in an individual case it would be wrong to send the person immediately to prison . Alternatively , it might be proper to reduce the period of imprisonment that is considered appropriate , if any is considered appropriate . It may transpire that by the time that the question of implementing the suspended committal order is considered , the circumstances of the defendant have changed . Whereas before she might have been able to pay perhaps , through illness or whatever reason , by now she can not . Thus , it would be wrong to commit her . Committal , I must re - emphasise , can only occur if the Justices are satisfied that there is a continuing wilful refusal or culpable neglect .", "The Justices have a perfectly sensible and powerful weapon available to them to deal with cases where a defendant does not attend , and that is a Warrant Not Backed for Bail . That is the means by which a person can be brought before the court and made to explain why he or she has not paid . Then the Justices will have the proper information before them to enable them to decide whether the committal is indeed correct . I can not emphasise strongly enough my view that Justices should not , unless there are very exceptional circumstances ( such as positive evidence that a defendant is refusing to attend and has expressed an unwillingness to comply with the court order ) commit to prison in the absence of a defendant . ...", "It is true that in these cases , the Justices were told that service had been effected , but service DATE before is nothing to the point . Much can happen in that time ... Furthermore , there was no evidence put before the Justices to support the contention that service had been effected , and for my part I do not think it right , when someone \u2019s liberty is at stake , for Justices to rely upon the word of the prosecutor unsupported by any evidence .", "A civil court which commits for contempt , which may be contempt occasioned by failure to comply with a court order , requires proof of service and that is usually done by a bailiff or whoever , indicating that service has been effected . It seems to me that it is quite wrong that Justices should put up with a lesser standard than that . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON also awarded costs against the justices on the following basis :", "\u201c It is unusual for costs to be awarded against Justices who do not attend applications against them for judicial review . The principle which is applied has recently been referred to by PERSON in NORP v. GPE - upon - Tyne Justices ex parte PERSON ( DATE ) RA CARDINAL . At page ORG of the report , the learned judge refers to a decision of ORG , NORP v. GPE ex parte Farmery CARDINAL JP CARDINAL , the head note of which reads :", "\u2018 ... the court would be guided by the principles set out in NORP v. PERSON , ex parte PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL PERSON wherein it was decided respectively : ( i ) that costs would only be awarded against Justices in the rarest of circumstances when they have done something which calls for strong disapproval ; and ( ii ) that it was the practice not to grant costs against Justices merely because they have made a mistake in law , but only if they have acted perversely or with some disregard for the elementary principles which every court ought to obey , and even then only if it was a flagrant instance.\u2019 ...", "... In [ this ] case the committal took place in the absence of the defendant .", "This court has made it clear that Justices must be satisfied , at the very least , that there has been proper service , and , as I have said , I find it very difficult to conceive of circumstances which would justify a committal in the absence of a defendant . Thus it seems to me that the conduct of these Justices can properly be said to fall within the description that I have set out and which is referred to in the GPE case by PERSON", "CARDINAL . By virtue of section CARDINAL of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act DATE a party to proceedings before a GPE court may \u201c question the proceeding on the ground that it is wrong in law or is in excess of jurisdiction by applying to the justices composing the court to state a case for the opinion of ORG on the question of law or jurisdiction involved ... \u201d . This is known as the \u201c case stated \u201d procedure .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , magistrates may grant bail to a party who applies to them to state a case ; but if they refuse to do so , in cases categorised as \u201c civil \u201d under the domestic law , ORG has no jurisdiction to grant bail until it is seized of some substantive proceedings to which the grant of bail can be ancillary .", "CARDINAL . According to GPE \u2019s ORG , ORG , Volume CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) at paragraph CARDINAL :", "\u201c Judicial review is the process by which the High Court exercises its supervisory jurisdiction over the proceedings and decisions of inferior courts , tribunals and other bodies or persons who carry out quasi - judicial functions or who are charged with the performance of public acts and duties ...", "Judicial review is concerned with reviewing not the merits of the decision in respect of which the application for judicial review is made , but the decision making process itself ...", "The duty of the court is to confine itself to the question of legality . Its concern is with whether a decision making authority exceeded its powers , committed an error of law , committed a breach of the rules of natural justice , reached a decision which no reasonable tribunal could have reached or abused its powers . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The principles underlying the domestic law as set out under this heading are largely as previously stated in the case - law of the Convention organs , in particular in the judgments of the ORG in the cases of PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions PERSON , p. CARDINAL ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , and Perks and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and Others , DATE ( \u201c Perks \u201d ) , as confirmed in ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL and others , decision on admissibility of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In LANGUAGE law , orders of a GPE court which are in excess of jurisdiction are void from the outset , whereas orders made within jurisdiction remain valid until set aside by a superior court . It is only in respect of the former type of error that a court can be held civilly liable in damages ( under LAW DATE , which replaced section CARDINAL of the Justices of the Peace Act DATE see below ) .", "CARDINAL . The appropriate test for whether an order of a GPE court is void for lack of jurisdiction is that set out by ORG in ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL . In that case magistrates had made an order sending a CARDINAL-year - old boy to a training school after a hearing at which he was not legally represented , had not applied for legal aid and had not been informed of his right so to do . The order was quashed on judicial review on the ground that , by virtue of LAW ) of the Treatment of Offenders ( GPE ) DATE , magistrates were not permitted to pass a custodial sentence for the first time on a juvenile who was not legally represented , unless he had applied for legal aid and had been refused on grounds of means or had been informed of his right to apply for it but had refused or neglected to do so .", "CARDINAL . The boy then applied for damages for false imprisonment against the magistrates . Since the case was decided prior to the enactment of ORG DATE and at a time when magistrates were liable in damages for false imprisonment if they acted in excess of jurisdiction , ORG was required to decide the jurisdictional question . Indeed , Lord Templeman in his judgment stated as follows :", "\u201c The question to be determined on this appeal is whether the magistrates acted within their jurisdiction or without jurisdiction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addressing that question , Lord Bridge specifically referred to the case of ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL Appeal Cases CARDINAL ( ORG ) and stated as follows :", "\u201c I do not believe that the novel test of excess of jurisdiction which emerges from the PERSON case , ... however valuable it may be in ensuring that the supervisory jurisdiction of the superior courts over inferior tribunals is effective to secure compliance with the law and is not lightly to be ousted by statute , has any application whatever to the construction of s[ection ] CARDINAL of the DATE LAW or s[ection ] CARDINAL of the DATE [ Justices of the Peace ] Act . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the judgment of ORG , it was held that a GPE court acted in excess of jurisdiction in CARDINAL circumstances only : ( CARDINAL ) if it acted without having jurisdiction over the cause , ( CARDINAL ) if it exercised its powers in a procedural manner that involved a gross and obvious irregularity , or ( CARDINAL ) if it made an order that had no proper foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent . The instant case fell within the third limb of the rule : the magistrates were liable in damages because they had not observed the requirements of LAW . As such , they had failed to fulfil the statutory condition precedent to the imposition of the sentence of detention .", "CARDINAL . During the course of his judgment , Lord PERSON commented on the jurisdiction of magistrates in conducting a criminal trial :", "\u201c ... once justices have duly entered upon a summary trial of a matter within their jurisdiction , only something quite exceptional occurring in the course of their proceeding to a determination can oust their jurisdiction ... [ A]n error ( whether of law or fact ) in deciding a collateral issue on which jurisdiction depends will not do so . Nor will the absence of any evidence to support a conviction ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Bridge also said the following in relation to the second situation set out above in which a GPE court acted in excess of jurisdiction :", "\u201c Justices would , of course , be acting \u2018 without jurisdiction or in excess of GPE within the meaning of s[ection ] CARDINAL if , in the course of hearing a case within their jurisdiction , they were guilty of some gross and obvious irregularity of procedure , as for example if CARDINAL justice absented himself for part of the hearing and relied on another to tell him what had happened during his absence , or of the rules of natural justice , as for example if the justices refused to allow the defendant to give evidence . But I would leave for determination if and when they arise other more subtle cases one might imagine in which it could successfully be contended in judicial review proceedings that a conviction was vitiated on some narrow technical ground involving a procedural irregularity or even a breach of the rules of natural justice . Such convictions , if followed by a potential trespass to person or goods , would not , in my opinion , necessarily expose the justices to liability in damages . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The final limb of the rule formulated by ORG in ORG v. PERSON ( that is , that magistrates exceed their jurisdiction when they make an order which has no foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent ) was applied by ORG and ORG in NORP v. ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL W.L.R. CARDINAL and [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG , a case concerning rates ( a local tax which was the predecessor to the community charge ) . Mr Justice PERSON considered that the justice \u2019s plain failure to address themselves to the question whether or not the applicant \u2019s failure was due to culpable neglect was not a gross and obvious irregularity but a failure to satisfy the statutory condition .", "CARDINAL . In that case , the plaintiff had been unable to pay all of the rates for which he became liable in DATE , and in DATE he failed to follow his accountant \u2019s advice to close his business and elect bankruptcy . Applying legislation similar to regulation CARDINAL of ORG ( for which , see below ) , the magistrates found that his failure to follow the accountant \u2019s advice constituted culpable neglect and they committed him to prison . On appeal from the judgment of Mr Justice PERSON , ORG held that no causal connection had been established between the failure to follow the advice in DATE and the failure to pay the rates in DATE ; and that the magistrates had not properly entered into the inquiry as to whether the failure to pay was due to culpable neglect , which was required by the legislation as a statutory condition precedent to the exercise by the justices of their power to issue a warrant of commitment . They were therefore acting in excess of jurisdiction and were liable in damages .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL ORG judges expressed their findings in slightly different terms . Lord ORG O\u2019Connor observed that \u201c they never carried out the inquiry required [ by the law ] \u201d . Lord Justice PERSON found that \u201c some inquiry about the applicant \u2019s finances was made \u201d , but that \u201c a clear and crucial distinction can be drawn between the inquiry required by the statute and the inquiry which was in fact carried out . The justices never examined the question whether failure to pay was due to culpable neglect ... In my judgment , the statutory inquiry was not held in the present case \u201d . He explained that the making of an enquiry was a statutory condition precedent to the issue of a warrant of commitment : \u201c In other words , if the justices failed to hold any inquiry at all as required by the section they would have no jurisdiction to issue a warrant . \u201d Sir PERSON ( who dissented from the majority decision ) said : \u201c ... it is quite clear that the justices carried out an inquiry into means carefully and in detail ... It is equally plain that they misdirected themselves completely ... They ... failed to realise that the question they had to decide was whether the applicant \u2019s failure to pay his rates was \u2018 due either to his wilful refusal or to his culpable ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
