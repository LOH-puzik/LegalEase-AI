This was largely due to reluctance on the part of the ORG members to enter some areas of the city . In other instances and for reasons best known to themselves the ORG members would not allow our members to interview some persons . A case in point was the check made at ... ( tel . DATE ) .

In a report published in DATE , the ORG acknowledged that there was a widespread demand to find out the truth about specific crimes for which no - one had been made amenable . Foremost amongst these was the later GPE / Monaghan bombings of DATE ( see O\u2019Loughlin and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL DATE .

Mr Justice PERSON was eventually appointed to head the inquiry and issue a report to the Government , after which a committee of ORG would decide whether any further steps should be taken . The inquiry was informal , did not sit in public and had no legal powers . It initially received terms of reference in relation to the GPE / Monaghan bombings of DATE and the bombing of ORG GPE in DATE . In DATE , the ORG also requested the inquiry to take into consideration other bombings and shootings in GPE DATE . Following a preliminary examination the inquiry felt that the GPE bombings in DATE should be the subject of a second report .", "On DATE the Inquiry wrote to the Secretary of ORG for GPE seeking such further information as ORG might have concerning the bombings in GPE in DATE .", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG replied that this would appear to require a further major search through their records and given the experience of the task of identifying relevant material in the GPE / Monaghan and GPE bombings this would take some time .", "By letter dated DATE , the Inquiry asked the Secretary of ORG if , in the first instance , documentation could be supplied relating to the intelligence services\u2019 initial reactions to the bombings and their opinions as to those who were responsible .", "By letter dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG replied that this would require a major and time - consuming search of records and that he could not give any indication at present of when that would be possible .", "Following further letters from the inquiry dated DATE and DATE , the Secretary of ORG replied that they had yet been unable to commence the time - consuming search through the various records .", "Further letters were sent by the inquiry dated DATE and CARDINAL May CARDINAL stressing the urgency and asking for at least the police records on the incidents . No reply was received .", "In DATE , the first inquiry report ( sometimes known as \" ORG \" ) was made public . The inquiry had heard evidence , inter alia , implicating the ORG and former ORG officers in organising and supplying explosives for the GPE / Monaghan bombings in DATE . Written evidence before the inquiry included materials from the ORG who had carried out a number of interviews at the request of the NORP police , including some of the implicated officers who had rejected allegations of collusion in the attacks .", "In his statement to ORG , Mr ORG stated that from the early stages the inquiry had received assurances of co - operation from ORG GPE . From its dealings with the ORG / ORG , the ORG had received a considerable amount of information , including records of the questioning in DATE of ORG officers suspected of participating in attacks on NORP civilians and ballistics evidence . There had been considerable delay in obtaining information from the Secretary of ORG of GPE . The inquiry was told that this was because there were CARDINAL files of possible relevance in ORG alone , while files in ORG could be counted in the CARDINAL . The teams examining these files were stated to have finished at DATE . On DATE , a CARDINAL page letter was sent by the Secretary of ORG containing the promised information . An appendix of CARDINAL pages gave details of the structure and control of intelligence gathering at the relevant time . No copies of original documents had been provided . Further requests for specific information did produce some additional information in a similar form :", "\" Correspondence with ORG undoubtedly produced some useful information ; but its value was reduced by reluctance to make original documents available and the refusal to make other information available on security grounds . While the Inquiry fully understands the position taken by ORG on these matters , it must be said that the scope of this report is limited as a result . \"", "The Inquiry nonetheless made findings as to the likely identities of the loyalist perpetrators ( mostly members of ORG \u201c ORG \u201d ) and concluded that it was likely that members of the GPE and ORG participated in , or were aware of , the preparations for the GPE - Monaghan bombings .", "On DATE , ORG on ORG , ORG Women \u2019s Rights , published the inquiry \u2019s second report on the bombings in issue in the present case ( known as ORG of ORG into the Dublin Bombings of DATE \" ) .", "In this report , Mr Justice PERSON found that on the information available to date there was no credible evidence of any collusion by GPE security forces in the bombings . It was established that the car which exploded in FAC was a silver - grey FAC registered no . CARDINALVZ and the car which exploded on FAC was a blue PERSON Avenger registered no . OGX CARDINALK. The NORP police investigation in GPE revealed that they had both been hired on DATE by a man using a driver \u2019s licence in the name of PERSON . The latter made a statement to the ORG from which it appeared that his driving licence had been stolen in DATE . The ORG and NORP police were satisfied that he had no connection with the bombings . The NORP police received full co - operation in their enquiries in GPE following up the hiring of the cars and were successful in interviewing most of the persons involved in the transactions , building up photofit impressions of the hirer from the witnesses . The NORP police took possession of all the hiring documents for fingerprint examination . Further enquiries revealed that the driving licence had been used to hire CARDINAL other vehicles ( CARDINAL of which had been returned ) . Details of the photofit picture and the licence were circulated in the LOC and in GPE , without apparent success in uncovering any further information . As regarded fingerprint evidence on the documents , some were established as belonging to innocent persons . CARDINAL unidentified prints were sent to the ORG for their comparison . The inquiry noted that while no written report was ever received in reply , it could not be excluded that an oral negative reply had been given over the telephone .", "The inquiry further noted that the investigation report at the time stated that a miscellany of intelligence information had been received and acted upon but it commented that without going into details it sufficed to say that nothing of real interest resulted . It could no longer be established from the available documentation what the nature of this information was . CARDINAL known element indicated that a named individual , an ex - NORP army man , was investigated by the police in GPE who notified the NORP authorities of various details including his whereabouts on relevant DATE and concluded that he had not been in GPE at those times .", "As regarded possible loyalist responsibility for the bombings , the inquiry stated that on DATE an NORP police inspector had reported that one of his informants had given him confidential information to the effect that the ORG was responsible for the bombings . A report of this was passed to the ORG with a request for any relevant information that might be available , in particular concerning the bomb maker said to be a retired member of the NORP forces now a ORG member in the GPE area of GPE . By letter dated DATE , the ORG summarised their enquiries stating that they had no hard intelligence on those responsible for the bombings . The retired member of the armed forces in the GPE area had not been identified but the information could refer to an ex - colonel living outside GPE . The ORG stated that they were following this up . While there were no further letters dealing with this subject , it could not be excluded that verbal contact was maintained on the issue .", "The inquiry report contained an examination of the allegations of collusion or NORP army or intelligence involvement which had been aired from the time of the bombings and had been even referred to on television by the NORP Prime Minister shortly after the events . It noted that in DATE a member of the NORP army , PERSON , who had deserted from his unit and joined the ORG , was convicted of the murder of CARDINAL NORP and CARDINAL robberies . He also gave evidence against other ORG members . A newspaper article in DATE reported that PERSON had stated the cars used to bomb GPE were driven from GPE by ORG men but that the explosives and cars themselves had been supplied by a leading member of the ORG from GPE who had a close association with NORP intelligence . While the author of the article claimed to know the names of the ORG men involved , he told the inquiry that no NORP police officer approached him on the matter . In a later statement in prison in DATE , PERSON claimed that there was collusion between the ORG and the ORG , in particular that a ORG sergeant was passing weapons to the ORG and that the ORG had been instructed not to let him talk to the NORP police about the ORG bombings in GPE . An official from ORG visited PERSON in DATE and while on that occasion he made allegations concerning links between a ORG man who made a bomb and NORP intelligence he referred only to \" a single bombing incident in the south in DATE \" , without identifying the date or place of the attack .", "On the other hand , the inquiry report noted that another journalist had published allegations suggesting that the ORG were responsible , in particular PERSON who was killed in DATE . According to a recent book published by the journalist , a former Chief of Staff of ORG had told him shortly before his own death in DATE that at an ORG meeting in DATE PERSON had claimed that the ORG had planted the bombs in GPE but that the army provided the cars . The journalist did not respond to the invitation to talk to the inquiry . A third journalist told the inquiry that by DATE PERSON was the senior military commander for the ORG in GPE and that he was a close friend of CARDINAL officers in ORG in GPE and of an army officer , possibly from the ORG attached to intelligence . PERSON had not mentioned to him any involvement in the bombings and that in any event PERSON was to some degree a fantasist , embellishing and fabricating stories to make himself seem more impressive .", "Mr Justice PERSON commented as follows on the inquiry \u2019s access to information from GPE sources :", "\" ... It is now DATE since the Inquiry \u2019s first request for information on the GPE bombings of DATE was made . But on this occasion not only has no information been forthcoming ; but as of CARDINAL DATE ORG has not yet begun the process of searching for relevant information . ...", "... The Inquiry is surprised and disappointed at this lack of co - operation on the part of the NORP authorities . \"", "A sub - committee was established to examine the report in public session with a view to reporting back to the Houses of the ORG . It invited submissions from interested persons and bodies and held public hearings DATE and DATE . The committee issued a final report with recommendations on DATE . The committee noted the lack of co - operation that Mr ORG had received from ORG and the NORP authorities and stated that it had experienced the same difficulty and had met with no adequate response to its own requests for information . It referred to a letter dated DATE from Prime Minister PERSON to the NORP Prime Minister which explained that on the matter of NORP co - operation with ORG extended inquiry it was their judgment that , given their experience of the scale of the task in identifying relevant materials in the GPE , GPE and GPE bombings , it would not have been possible to conduct another major search through their records within the timescale of the inquiry .", "The committee further noted that when it narrowed its request to CARDINAL sets of papers , including those of ORG from DATE , this was no more successful . It stated that in its view the fact that to date the papers had not been made available raised the question as to whether the NORP authorities had something to hide and that this non - co - operation exacerbated the difficulties in establishing the truth . It made no findings as to collusion otherwise and made no specific recommendations concerning further investigations into these bombings .", "Meanwhile , during DATE the lawyers acting for the victims and relatives in the organisation \" Justice for the Forgotten \" discovered that the inquests into the death of the CARDINAL people who had died in the bombings in DATE had been adjourned . The GPE agreed that the inquests should resume on DATE once the inquiry report had issued .", "Prior to and during the inquest the legal representatives of the GPE families made known their views that witnesses from GPE and other parts of GPE would be necessary to ensure a thorough and proper inquest took place . By letter dated DATE the Coroner had already requested information from the ORG , including any files in relation to the criminal investigation concerning the cars stolen in GPE and identified as involved in the bombings in GPE and any files relating to specific inquiries conducted by the ORG in support of the inquiries made by the NORP police into the DATE GPE bombings . He also invited a representative of the ORG to attend the inquest . The ORG declined to send a representative on the grounds that there was no one who had been sufficiently senior at the time and was still a member of the service .", "CARDINAL witnesses from GPE voluntarily attended the inquest at the invitation of \" Justice for the Forgotten \" . Other witnesses declined to attend , such as Mr PERSON whose car had been hijacked and used in the DATE bombing and whose CARDINAL statements to the ORG contained inconsistencies which the GPE families wished to explore .", "Members of the NORP police gave evidence at the inquest concerning their contacts with the ORG during the investigation . A detective superintendent outlined that during the investigation members of the NORP police conducted enquiries in GPE with the assistance and co - operation of members of the ORG . For example , photofit pictures of the hirer of CARDINAL of the cars were compiled from witness descriptions , the NORP police were given all the hiring documents for fingerprinting and the ORG interviewed a number of people in relation to the hiring and hijacking of cars .", "On DATE , the jury gave verdicts of unlawful killing by a person or persons unknown .", "COMPLAINTS", "The applicants complained that GPE had failed , in breach of its obligations under LAW , to co - operate with ORG , the consideration of the report by the sub - committee of ORG and the resumed inquests by LOC . They complained that it was known that the perpetrators came from the jurisdiction of GPE and that GPE authorities held information essential to any effective investigation or inquiry . They pointed to the well - established nature of the public administration in GPE , its renown for its management techniques , its recently adopted expertise in file identification and retrieval in the Bloody Sunday Tribunal , the fact that the relevant departments and bodies still existed and the dates and events were specific to known areas of responsibility in arguing that the GPE claims of difficulty in identifying and accessing relevant information were grossly exaggerated .", "THE LAW", "The applicants complained that GPE had failed to co - operate with recent investigations into the deaths and injuries caused by bombs in GPE in DATE , invoking LAW which provides as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone \u2019s right to life shall be protected by law . ... \u201d", "The ORG \u2019s case - law establishes that the obligation to protect the right to life under LAW , read in conjunction with the ORG \u2019s general duty under LAW to \u201c secure to everyone within [ its ] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [ the ] LAW , requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force ( see , mutatis mutandis , ORG and Others v. the GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and GPE v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-I , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and , in those cases involving ORG agents or bodies , to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility . What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances . However , whatever mode is employed , the authorities must act of their own motion , once the matter has come to their attention . They can not leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures ( see , for example , mutatis mutandis , PERSON GPE [ ORG ] no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VII , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Where there are cross - border elements to an incident of unlawful violence leading to loss of life , the ORG has already had occasion to observe that the authorities of the ORG to which the perpetrators have fled and in which evidence of the offence could be located may be required by LAW to take effective measures in that regard , if necessary of their own motion . Otherwise those indulging in cross - border attacks would be able to operate with impunity and the authorities of ORG which has suffered the attack would be foiled in their own efforts to protect the fundamental rights of their citizens ( see the above - cited O\u2019Loughlin and Others case ) .", "In the present case , the ORG finds no indication of any lack of effective co - operation by the police in GPE in the aftermath of the bombings in DATE . The PERSON inquiry report refers in positive terms to the fact that NORP police officers were able to conduct inquiries in GPE and had full access to available evidence ( e.g. the documents relating to the cars used in the bombings ) . The criticism made that ORG officers were reluctant at times to enter areas of GPE , at a time of considerable unrest , and insisted on occasion on interviewing suspects alone ( the example given was an eccentric old lady ) does not , in the ORG \u2019s view , disclose any bad faith or establish that there were any obstacles effectively preventing the NORP police from pursuing any substantive leads . It would appear that the investigation had largely wound down by DATE without any success in identifying possible suspects or further useful leads .", "The applicants\u2019 complaints indeed focus , not on the co - operation in the investigation furnished at the time , but on the GPE authorities\u2019 failure to respond to the PERSON inquiry and ORG requests for information from their files , as well as the lack of response to the Coroner \u2019s approaches for the purpose of the Inquest .", "The ORG would note , firstly , that the PERSON inquiry report which commented on the failure of GPE authorities to produce information from their files was published on DATE , DATE before the application was lodged with the ORG , raising issues as to whether this part of the ORG complaints has been lodged timeously as required by LAW .", "That said , the ORG would observe that both the PERSON inquiry and the ORG hearings were non - statutory , non - judicial procedures , inspired by the considerable sympathy felt for the victims and their families who continued to suffer from a lack of resolution to the atrocities committed . The GPE authorities had already been requested to assist in providing information concerning the GPE - Monaghan bombings and had provided some information and copies of documents , after trawling through CARDINAL of files . The ORG finds that the ORG response to a subsequent extension of the enquiry and a new series of requests concerning earlier incidents was unsurprisingly not enthusiastic . It sees no reason to doubt that responding to such requests would have been time - consuming in the extreme and is unpersuaded by assumptions that the work had already been done for the GPE - Monaghan bombings or that the task would be of relative simplicity for NORP staff well - practised in document retrieval due to experience in their own inquiries .", "While administrative difficulties do not as such excuse a failure to provide an effective investigation into a potential breach of LAW , the ORG must give weight in this case to the lack of any concrete elements of collusion by NORP security forces in the bombings , which may be contrasted with the evidence brought to light concerning other incidents both north and south of the border . That evidence can not be regarded as in any way probative of any likely security force implication in the bombings in issue in this case . Nor have the applicants pointed to any line of substantive enquiry or access to potential suspects being blocked by GPE authorities . In the circumstances , given the lapse of time and the level of assistance given by the ORG to the NORP police in their investigations at the time , the ORG does not find that the failure of GPE to complete a search of all their files for information of possible relevance to the inquiries in GPE discloses any appearance of a breach of a positive obligation to conduct an effective investigation required by LAW .", "As regards the inquests , which were conducted by Coroner and jury in GPE in DATE , the ORG recalls that this procedure had been adjourned for DATE . No explanation has been provided as to why the NORP authorities , or the families , did not take steps to conclude the inquests within a reasonable time after the events . While it appears that the GPE police declined to send a representative to the hearings , this was apparently on the basis that there was no relevant officer still on the force who could give useful evidence DATE . Nor is it apparent that any former ORG officer or the requested information from ORG files would have been likely to shed any further light on events , given the level of co - operation between the NORP police and ORG during the investigation at the relevant time . The ORG finds accordingly that it has not been shown that GPE authorities were required , for the purposes of assisting in an effective investigation under LAW , to participate in the manner requested in the resumed inquest hearings .", "The ORG therefore rejects the application as manifestly ill - founded pursuant to LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "For these reasons , the ORG unanimously", "A N N E X", "List of applicants", "CARDINAL .
