He was acting before the ORG both in his own right and as representative of his minor son , who was born on DATE and lives in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant and PERSON , who were an unmarried couple , had a son , PERSON , who was born on CARDINAL DATE . Prior to the birth they had made a joint declaration before the registration officer at ORG on DATE recognising their son .", "On DATE , a NORP national , unilaterally decided to take PERSON away to live with her in GPE .", "Several sets of proceedings were subsequently instituted .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG granted QUANTITY custody of the child and reserved judgment regarding the applicant \u2019s right to apply to ORG to determine his rights of access in respect of the child .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an application with the President of the GPE tribunal de grande instance , who was the matrimonial causes judge , for joint parental responsibility ( with the mother ) for his son and for the latter \u2019s habitual residence to be fixed at FAC , where he had lived before leaving GPE with his mother .", "In an order of DATE , the judge declared that the applicant was estopped by record from applying for joint parental responsibility and determination of PERSON \u2019s habitual residence because the judgment of the NORP courts was final . He requested the applicant and PERSON to sign a parental agreement determining the arrangements regarding PERSON \u2019s relations with his parents , if necessary by having recourse to family mediation . Subject to a better agreement being reached between the applicant and PERSON , he granted the applicant access for the school holidays .", "An appeal does not appear to have been lodged against that decision .", "On DATE the applicant brought an action against PERSON in the NORP tribunal de grande instance , claiming joint parental responsibility for PERSON", "In an order of DATE , the family - affairs judge held that the applicant was doubly estopped by record from bringing the action because there had been a final decision both by ORG on DATE and by the GPE matrimonial causes judge on DATE .", "No appeal was lodged against that order .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG sentenced PERSON to a suspended term of imprisonment of DATE and a fine of MONEY for failure to hand over a child and to notify a change of address .", "On DATE the applicant applied to the Minister of ORG , designated by GPE as ORG responsible for discharging the duties imposed on GPE by LAW of DATE on ORG ( \u201c LAW ) . He asked the Minister to assist him in the manner prescribed by that convention in securing the return of his son , born on DATE , whom his mother , a NORP national , had , he alleged , wrongfully removed to GPE on CARDINAL DATE to live with her in GPE .", "On DATE the Minister of ORG replied in the following terms :", "\u201c In reply , and on the basis of the information in my possession , the mother alone had parental responsibility at the time of the removal . Accordingly , the removal can not be described as \u2018 wrongful\u2019 within the meaning of the aforementioned convention and an application for the child \u2019s return is in principle bound to fail . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant sought a declaration from ORG that he had had parental responsibility for his son at the time of his abduction by the mother and asked the court to set aside the decision of DATE by which the Minister of ORG had refused to intervene pursuant to LAW .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application for the following reasons :", "\u201c It is not ORG function to deal with disputes between private individuals . The submissions must be dismissed as having been made to a court that lacked jurisdiction to entertain them . ...", "The question as to whether it fell to the Minister of ORG to intervene in the manner requested necessarily requires an examination of the relations between the NORP ORG and a foreign government . That issue falls outside the jurisdiction of ORG . Accordingly , the submissions can not succeed . ...", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG set aside the judgment of ORG to the extent that it found that the application to have the Minister of ORG \u2019s decision set aside fell outside the jurisdiction of ORG . However , it rejected the application for the Minister of ORG \u2019s decision to be set aside for the following reasons in particular :", "\u201c ... in the judgment being appealed against , ORG wrongly declared that it lacked jurisdiction to examine the submissions made by [ the applicant ] against that decision ; in that respect the judgment must be set aside .", "...", "Even supposing that LAW , as amended by PERSON no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , which is applicable in the instant case , is contrary to the provisions of ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE and the provisions of LAW of DATE , the evidence does not show that [ the applicant ] had parental responsibility for his son on CARDINAL DATE , when the child was taken to GPE by his mother . Accordingly , on that date he did not have rights of custody in respect of the child . It was therefore clear that the conditions required by LAW were not fulfilled ; the Minister was subsequently able , under the aforementioned provisions of LAW , to reject the application for intervention made by the applicant . It follows that [ the applicant ] has no basis on which to argue that , in the decision being challenged , the Minister of ORG wrongly rejected that application ... \u201d", "On DATE the applicant applied to the ORG d\u2019Etat to set aside the judgment of DATE . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat set aside the judgment of ORG and the judgment of ORG of DATE in so far as it had dismissed the submissions as having been made to a court that lacked jurisdiction to entertain them . It rejected the application lodged by the applicant with ORG and the remainder of the submissions in the application lodged before it for the following reasons in particular :", "\u201c ... [ The applicant ] is ... justified in requesting the ORG to set aside the part of the operative provisions of the judgment of ORG which , after setting aside the judgment delivered at first instance by ORG , dismissed the submissions he had lodged with the court to have the Minister of ORG \u2019s decision of DATE set aside .", "In the circumstances of the present case , an examination under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON of DATE is necessary in order to dispose of the case on the merits .", "... It is incumbent on an administrative court to rule on the submissions [ by the applicant ] to have [ the decision of the Minister of ORG ] set aside . ORG thus wrongly dismissed the submissions as having been made to a court that lacked jurisdiction to entertain them . Its judgment of CARDINAL DATE must be set aside in that regard .", "The application lodged by [ the applicant ] with ORG must be heard and determined immediately .", "...", "[ The ] provisions [ of LAW , in the applicable version ] which , in a case such as this where the child has been recognised by both parents , provide that parental responsibility is to be exercised by the mother but give the father the possibility , by a decision of the matrimonial causes judge , to exercise that authority himself , either alone or jointly with the mother , and , if appropriate , to have his home designated as the child \u2019s habitual residence , are not incompatible with the combined requirements of LAW and CARDINAL of LAW by which the right to respect for family life must be secured without discrimination on any ground , such as sex .", "... the aforementioned provisions of LAW which determine , in the child \u2019s interests alone , which of the parents is to exercise parental responsibility for him or her , are not incompatible with the provisions of ORG DATE and CARDINAL of the [ LAW [ of DATE on the Rights of the Child ] , which proclaim the paramount interests of the child and the child \u2019s right to the protection of the law .", "The evidence clearly shows that [ the applicant ] , who does not allege that the aforementioned provisions of the second or third paragraphs of LAW would have been applied in his favour , did not have the exercise of parental responsibility for his son [ PERSON ] when the child \u2019s mother took him to GPE on CARDINAL DATE . Accordingly , he did not have rights of custody over the child on that date for the purposes of LAW , and , in particular , he did not have a right to determine the child \u2019s habitual place of residence . Accordingly , the Minister of ORG did not commit any error of law in his decision of DATE in considering that the removal of [ PERSON ] could not be described as \u2018 wrongful\u2019 within the meaning of that convention .", "... the submissions by which [ the applicant ] sought a stay of ORG decision regarding his application must therefore be dismissed . ... \u201d", "\u201c A child \u2019s father and mother are responsible for protecting the child \u2019s safety , health and morals .", "They have a right and a duty to look after , supervise and bring up their children . \u201d", "\u201c Where a child born out of wedlock has been recognised by CARDINAL of his or her parents , parental responsibility shall vest in the parent who has voluntarily recognised the child . Where the child has been recognised by both parents , parental responsibility shall vest in the mother .", "Parental responsibility may be exercised jointly by both parents if they make an appropriate joint declaration before the guardianship judge .", "At the request of the father or the mother or ORG , the matrimonial causes judge may modify the arrangements for exercising parental responsibility and decide that it shall be exercised either by CARDINAL of the parents or by the father and mother jointly ; in that event the judge shall indicate with which parent the child shall habitually reside .", "The matrimonial causes judge may always grant an access and supervision right to the parent who does not have parental responsibility .", "Where parental responsibility is exercised jointly , Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL shall apply as though the child had been born in wedlock . \u201d", "LAW was ratified by GPE on DATE and came into force on DATE , when it also came into force in respect of GPE .
