NORP The applicant in the first case , Mr PERSON ( hereinafter also referred to as \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He was represented before the ORG by the law firm LAW , PERSON , ORG colleagues , GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant in the second case , PERSON ( hereinafter also referred to as \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The instant applications relate to decisions by the domestic courts ordering the taking of cellular material from the applicants , who had both been convicted of criminal offences in the past . The measures were ordered pursuant to LAW domestic law below ) outside pending criminal proceedings at the prosecution authorities\u2019 request with a view to determining the applicants\u2019 DNA profiles for identification purposes on the occasion of future criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The courts ordered in each case that in the event the applicants should refuse to voluntarily provide cellular material by means of a saliva sample , a blood sample was to be taken from them by a doctor in accordance with LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) . They further specified that any cellular material obtained from the applicants had to be handed over to the expert in charge of its examination without disclosing the applicants\u2019 identity , that the sample was to be used exclusively for the molecular genetic examinations referred to in LAW and that it was to be destroyed without delay once it was no longer required for establishing the applicants\u2019 DNA profiles .", "CARDINAL . In its related decision of CARDINAL DATE with respect to Mr PERSON ORG noted that the first applicant had been convicted by a judgment of ORG dated DATE of CARDINAL counts of drug trafficking and been sentenced to an aggregate prison sentence of DATE and DATE . On CARDINAL occasions the crime had been preceded by the offence of illicit importation of drugs and on CARDINAL occasions the first applicant had in addition instigated the illicit importation of drugs . ORG further pointed to CARDINAL previous convictions of PERSON in GPE for having infringed the Swiss Narcotics PERSON . It referred in this context to judgments by the Horgen ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) dated DATE and by ORG dated DATE imposing a prison sentence of DATE and DATE and a suspended prison sentence of DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . In view of the seriousness of the offences committed in the past and the resulting negative criminal prognosis for the first applicant , ORG found that the order to take a DNA sample from him and the execution of such measure were proportionate .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG , endorsing ORG decision , dismissed the first applicant \u2019s related appeal and held that the conditions for the taking of an DNA sample pursuant to LAW were met in the instant case . In ORG opinion the considerable length of the prison sentence imposed on the first applicant by ORG in DATE showed that the underlying drug offences constituted serious crimes in the meaning of the said provision . In this connection and in particular in view of the considerable amount of drugs that had been trafficked it was irrelevant that the applicant had \u201c only \u201d dealt with marihuana . ORG further found that there were grounds to assume that criminal proceedings concerning serious offences would have to be conducted against the applicant in the future . The first applicant \u2019s negative criminal prognosis followed in particular from the fact that his conviction in DATE had not only related to a single spontaneously committed offence of drug trafficking but to a series of offences committed over the period from DATE to DATE . Moreover , he had previously been convicted of similar offences in GPE . The fact that his first conviction by the PERSON ORG dated back as long as DATE did not put into question his negative criminal prognosis . It had been demonstrated by the judgment of ORG dated DATE that the applicant had committed further drug - related offences in the period from DATE to DATE in GPE , i.e. prior to his conviction in GPE in DATE . ORG further specified that the applicant \u2019s potential expulsion to GPE did not have an impact on its assessment of the case . Pursuant to NORP criminal law crimes of the kind at issue were subject to NORP jurisdiction even when committed abroad . Moreover , the fact that an individual had his place of residence abroad did not prevent him from committing offences in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By written submissions to ORG dated CARDINAL DATE the first applicant argued that there was nothing to indicate that he would commit further offences similar to the ones that had been at the origin of his previous convictions . He invoked in particular that the crimes referred to by ORG in its decision of DATE dated back DATE and that he had already served prison sentences of a considerable duration in this respect . Furthermore , since he was supposed to be expelled to GPE after having served CARDINAL of his prison sentence , it was unlikely that he would reoffend in GPE and take the risk of having to serve the residual term of his prison sentence as a consequence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the first applicant \u2019s submissions did not provide any additional arguments that would require it to deviate from its previous decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint without providing reasons .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of CARDINAL DATE with respect to Mr GPE ORG , referring to the latter \u2019s criminal record since DATE , held that the repeated commission of offences by the second applicant in the past had reached a degree of unlawfulness equal to the commission of an offence of considerable significance within the meaning of LAW . In DATE the second applicant had been convicted by ORG of having caused bodily harm by dangerous means ( gef\u00e4hrliche GPE ) and had been sentenced to a suspended prison sentence of DATE . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG had found him guilty of CARDINAL counts of attempted coercion ( PERSON ) and had imposed a fine of CARDINAL euros payable in CARDINAL DATE instalments . On DATE the same court had convicted the second applicant of a further offence of having caused bodily harm by dangerous means and sentenced him to a suspended prison sentence of DATE . Finally , by a judgment of ORG ( Landgericht ) , GPE , of CARDINAL DATE , he had been found guilty of having persistently stalked a woman and had been sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . As regards the CARDINAL incidents involving bodily harm in DATE and DATE the GPE ORG specified that the second applicant had sprayed tear or pepper gas into his respective GPE faces from a short distance leaving CARDINAL victim with painful skin irritations and the other with an eye inflammation .", "CARDINAL . In LOC opinion the manner in which the offences had been committed showed that the second applicant had a tendency to compromise considerably the physical well - being of others and that further serious criminal offences were to be expected from him in the future . The court further found that having regard to the intervals in which the offences had been committed , it could be expected that the second applicant would repeatedly commit further offences similar to the ones that had been at the origin of the criminal proceedings instituted against him in the past . Having regard to the nature of the offences at issue it was conceivable that DNA traces would be left at the scene of a future crime and the measure ordered by the court was thus justified and necessary for the purpose of establishing identity and gender on the occasion of future criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By written submissions dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed ORG decision . He maintained in particular that the offences committed by him in the past had not been of a gravity that justified an interference with his personal rights under LAW . He further complained that ORG had not complied with his request to hear him in person and had not adequately reasoned its decision .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the NORP - ORG dismissed the appeal holding that the conditions for the taking of a DNA sample pursuant to LAW had been clearly met in the instant case and that ORG order had consequently been proportionate . ORG held that , firstly , the CARDINAL incidents involving bodily harm that had been at the origin of the second applicant \u2019s convictions in DATE and DATE constituted serious offences in the meaning of the said provision . On each of these occasions the second applicant had shown aggressive behaviour towards third persons without having been particularly provoked by the latter . Both offences had been committed in a similar way and demonstrated a significant criminal energy on the part of the second applicant and his potential for aggression .", "ORG further recalled that LAW put the repeated commission of offences on an equal footing with the commission of a serious crime for the purpose of justifying the taking of a DNA sample . ORG pointed out that the legislator had specified in this context that repeated offences in the context of so - called stalking of the type that had been at the origin of the second applicant \u2019s conviction by judgment of ORG in DATE , constituted an example where the repeated commission of an offence reached a degree of unlawfulness that was equal to the commission of a serious offence . The second applicant \u2019s previous convictions further showed that he had a tenacious and incorrigible character which was also reflected in his partly confused and incomprehensible submissions to ORG in the instant proceedings . Having regard to the second applicant \u2019s numerous past convictions , his personality and the circumstances under which the offences had been committed , ORG found that there clearly remained a risk that criminal proceedings concerning similar offences would have to be conducted against him in the future .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at the prosecution authorities\u2019 request , revoked the suspension of the second applicant \u2019s prison sentence imposed by its judgment dated DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . With reference to the conviction for stalking by ORG dated CARDINAL DATE which had meanwhile become final , ORG argued that the fact that the second applicant had reoffended in the course of his probationary period demonstrated that a suspended sentence was not sufficient to counter the risk of recidivism .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint of CARDINAL DATE against the NORP - ORG decision of DATE without providing reasons . It further held that , as a consequence , there was no need to decide on the applicant \u2019s request for interim measures .", "CARDINAL . While the applicants\u2019 submissions suggest that the court orders were subsequently executed and DNA samples taken from each of them , neither of the applicants has specified on which date the intervention occurred and whether the samples were obtained by means of saliva or blood samples .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALa to f of the German Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafprozessordnung ) provide for the taking of DNA samples for the purpose of convicting suspects within the scope of pending criminal proceedings . By contrast , LAW regulates the taking of cellular material from suspects and convicts with a view to determining their DNA profile for use in future criminal proceedings . LAW g \u00a7 CARDINAL in its current version , as also applicable at the time of the proceedings at issue , provides for such measure if a person is suspected of having committed or has been convicted of a criminal offence of considerable significance ( PERSON erheblicher GPE ) or of a crime against sexual self - determination and in the event the nature of the offence or the way it was committed , the personality of the concerned person or other information provide grounds for assuming that criminal proceedings will be conducted against him or her in future in respect of a criminal offence of considerable significance . Under these conditions cellular material may be obtained from the person concerned and subjected to molecular and genetic examination with a view to determining his or her DNA profile ( DNA - Identifizierungsmuster ) or gender for identification purposes in future criminal proceedings .", "It is further specified in the provision that the repeated commission of criminal offences may reach a degree of unlawfulness ( GPE ) that is tantamount to a criminal offence of considerable significance . This alternative ground for the taking of cellular material has been introduced into LAW g \u00a7 CARDINAL by the LAW on the revision of forensic DNA - analysis dated DATE ( Gesetz PERSON forensischen ORG , ORG I , p. CARDINAL ) . According to the explanatory memorandum to the LAW the repeated commission of offences does not automatically reach the same level of significance as a serious crime . An order for the taking of cellular material under this alternative is only admissible in the event the circumstances of a particular case taken together provide evidence that the repeated commission of offences reaches the same degree of unlawfulness as a serious crime in the meaning of the provision . While , for instance , repeated fare evasion for public transport would as a rule not reach such threshold , this could , by contrast , be the case in the event of repeated trespassing in the context of stalking .", "CARDINAL . The second paragraph of LAW stipulates that cellular material obtained may be used only for the aforementioned molecular and genetic examination and shall be destroyed without delay once it is no longer required for that purpose . Information other than that required for establishing the DNA profile or the gender may not be ascertained during the examination and tests to establish such information shall be inadmissible . Without the written consent of the person concerned , the taking of cellular material may be ordered only by a court and , in case of imminent danger ( Gefahr i m Verzug ) , by the public prosecution authorities including the officials assisting it ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . Without the written consent of the person concerned , the molecular and genetic examination of cellular material may be ordered only by a court . The related court order shall specify in each case the determining facts relevant to ascertaining the seriousness of the criminal offence at issue , the information giving rise to the assumption that the accused will be the subject of criminal proceedings in the future , as well as an evaluation of the relevant circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW g read in conjunction with the second paragraph of LAW the courts shall appoint the experts responsible for the examination of the DNA material and determination of DNA profiles . The experts have to meet certain requirements with a view to ensuring their independence from the investigating authority as well as their professional integrity . They shall provide for the technical and organisational safeguards to ensure that inadmissible molecular and genetic examinations and unauthorised access to data are excluded . The cellular material to be examined shall be given to the expert with no indication of the name , address or date or month of birth of the data subject .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL g \u00a7 CARDINAL states that the data obtained may be stored at ORG ( Bundeskriminalamt ) and be used in accordance with the relevant provisions of ORG ( Bundeskriminalamtgesetz ) . Data may only be transmitted for the purpose of criminal proceedings , preventive aversion of dangers ( Gefahrenabwehr ) or international legal assistance in respect thereof .", "CARDINAL . In the event of the taking of cellular material by means of a blood sample LAW apples mutatis mutandis . The taking of blood samples is to be effected by a physician in accordance with the rules of medical science , provided no detriment to the concerned person \u2019s health is to be expected . Blood samples or other body cells taken may be used only for the purposes set out in LAW and shall be destroyed without delay as soon as they are no longer required for such purposes .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE ORG maintains a national DNA database in which DNA profiles obtained in compliance with ORG to g of LAW are stored . ORG contains rules on the storage and use of such DNA profiles . According to section CARDINAL of ORG , ORG in its capacity as central agency for police information and intelligence in connection with the prevention and prosecution of criminal offences of federal , international or considerable significance , shall collect and analyse all relevant information for carrying out such task . Pursuant to LAW a convict \u2019s personal data may be saved in files for the use in future criminal proceedings in the event particular circumstances give reason for believing that the person concerned will commit criminal offences of considerable significance . Personal data taken from an individual suspected of having committed a criminal offence have , as a rule , to be deleted in the event the proceedings against the concerned person have been definitely discontinued or once the suspect has been acquitted ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The data compiled in the national DNA database may be made available to the Federal and NORP police authorities and according to LAW the public prosecution authorities may retrieve information from the database for the purpose of administering criminal justice . Section CARDINAL of ORG stipulates that personal data saved in files have to be deleted once their storage has become inadmissible or in the event the retention of the data is no longer necessary for the performance of ORG Office\u2019", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; CARDINAL ORG and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG held that the provision of LAW was constitutional . It emphasised that the scope of the provision was limited to the determination of a suspect \u2019s or convict \u2019s DNA profile for the purpose of establishing identity in future criminal proceedings and that the cellular material obtained in this respect had to be destroyed once the DNA profile was determined . The DNA profile as such did not allow for conclusions to be drawn as regards the personal characteristics of a concerned individual such as his or her hereditary dispositions , character traits or diseases and did not enable for an individual \u2019s personal profile to be established . In ORG opinion the core area of personality ( PERSON ) that enjoyed absolute protection under constitutional law was thus not affected by the measures permitted under LAW .", "ORG found , however , that the determination , retention and future use of DNA profiles constituted an interference with the constitutionally guaranteed right to self - determination over personal data ( informationelles Selbstbestimmungsrecht ) . Any restriction of such right was only permitted if prescribed by law and in the event it was justified by an overriding public interest and complied with the principle of proportionality . ORG specified in this respect that while LAW was not aimed at the prevention of future criminal offences , it did however facilitate the investigation of future crimes of considerable significance and thus served the proper administration of justice . ORG further held that the provision was sufficiently precise to qualify as a law from a constitutional point of view . The term \u201c criminal offence of a considerable significance \u201d could be found in a number of provisions of LAW and had been defined in the established case law of the domestic courts as comprising crimes of medium gravity ( mittlere ORG ) which seriously compromised law and order and were of a nature that could considerably affect the population \u2019s sense of legal certainty ( GPE ) .", "The court finally held that the precautionary ( \u201c vorsorglich \u201d ) taking of evidence permitted under LAW did not infringe the principle of proportionality . The taking of such evidence could only be ordered in the event the concerned person had previously been convicted of an offence of considerable significance and in the event there were concrete indications that further proceedings concerning criminal offences of considerable significance were to be conducted against him or her in the future . Moreover , by strictly limiting the use of cellular material collected for the purposes defined in the LAW and by making its destruction compulsory once the concerned person \u2019s DNA profile was established , the legislator had provided for safeguards to prevent abuse of cellular material obtained .", "ORG specified that when ordering a measure pursuant to LAW had to establish and clarify the circumstances of each particular case . In their assessment they had to take into account the available criminal files and records with respect to the person concerned and had to provide plausible reasons for their assumption that it was likely that the latter would commit further crimes of considerable significance in the future .", "CARDINAL . By a subsequent judgment dated DATE ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) LAW further held that the possibility of ordering the taking of a DNA sample in the event the repeated commission of criminal offences showed a degree of unlawfulness similar to the commission of a serious criminal offence - an alternative introduced by LAW on the revision of forensic DNA - analysis dated DATE - did not give rise to concerns from a constitutional point of view . With reference to the explanatory memorandum to the said LAW see above paragraph CARDINAL ) , ORG noted that this alternative did not allow the domestic courts to automatically conclude that the repeated commission of offences justified an order for the taking of cellular material . By contrast , the domestic courts were obliged to have regard to the specific circumstances of the individual case and in particular the personality of the person concerned and the manner in which the offences had been committed . On this basis they had to proceed to an overall assessment of the degree of unlawfulness reflected in the offences committed and to be expected in the future while always observing the principle of proportionality in their decision - making .", "CARDINAL .
