The rulings have had the effect that in practice the importance of the investigation at the trial - which is never conducted before a jury - has dwindled . In the great majority of cases witnesses are not heard at the trial but either only by the police or also by the examining magistrate .", "CARDINAL . ORG The law does not make the presence of counsel for the defence obligatory during the investigation by the police .

In a series of judgments ORG has made this possible .", "CARDINAL . ORG A precursor to this development was a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) in which ORG held that hearsay evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) above ) could be admitted even if the witness did not name his informant .

The same ruling was made in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) , concerning a case where the witness had been heard anonymously by both the police and the examining magistrate ; on that occasion ORG also held - in accordance with its above - mentioned judgment of DATE - that the mere fact that the official reports of the hearings did not name the witness was not an obstacle to their utilisation in evidence , subject to an identical proviso as to caution .", "It may be inferred from a judgment of DATE ( GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) that the caution called for does not necessarily imply that anonymous witnesses must have been heard by the examining magistrate also .", "The next judgments in the series are those given by ORG on DATE in the cases of PERSON and his co - accused , CARDINAL of which is published in GPE DATE , CARDINAL .
