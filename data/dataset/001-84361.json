The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the customs authorities in GPE after QUANTITY of heroin had been found in her car . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of drug - trafficking and sentenced her to DATE imprisonment . On DATE she was released from a prison in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instituted an investigation concerning drug - trafficking from GPE to GPE by the applicant and other persons , acting in connection with a request for legal assistance submitted by the NORP and NORP prosecution authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE . On DATE ORG served on her the statement of charges . The applicant was charged with supplying significant amounts of heroin to the market DATE in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . She was also charged with acting in an organised criminal group of drug traffickers . During her questioning by the prosecutor , she confessed that she had attempted to smuggle heroin to GPE and responded to all questions put by the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG remanded the applicant in custody until DATE on reasonable suspicion that she had committed the offences referred to above . It held that there was a risk that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings by influencing witnesses since she had not confessed . The court also took into account that the applicant had been charged with acting in an organised criminal gang and had regard to the severity of the anticipated penalty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . It found that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant might tamper with evidence , having regard to the number of suspects involved . It also relied on the severity of the anticipated penalty , given the organised character of the criminal activities , their scale and the amount of drugs involved . Lastly , it referred to the need to continue the process of gathering evidence .", "CARDINAL . In her appeal the applicant submitted that her continued detention was not necessary to secure the proper conduct of the investigation . She argued that she had already given evidence and that she had had no contacts with the witnesses or other suspects , so the risk of tampering with evidence did not exist in her case . Her appeal was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged with ORG a motion for the prolongation of the applicant 's detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG notified the applicant 's counsel of the hearing scheduled for DATE at which the prosecution 's motion would be examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing ( posiedzenie ) on the prolongation of the applicant 's detention .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , before the hearing had begun the applicant 's counsel consulted the prosecution 's motion without authorisation from the judge .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing the applicant 's counsel applied for access to the investigation file . ORG stated that his motion for prolongation of the detention constituted an integral part of the file and that access to it required his permission . The prosecutor also stated that the counsel had not applied earlier for leave to consult the file . Counsel unsuccessfully requested the court to adjourn the hearing until she had been granted access to the file . ORG , having regard to LAW , held that it could not decide on the counsel 's request for access to the file since such decision was within the exclusive competence of the authority conducting the investigation . The judge informed both parties that the counsel 's request would be transmitted without undue delay to ORG for examination .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's counsel requested the court to dismiss the motion for prolongation because the prosecutor had simply stated that he maintained it without giving specific reasons for it .", "CARDINAL . The GPE ORG granted the prosecution 's motion and extended the applicant 's detention until DATE . In the reasons for its decision , the court noted that the applicant had pleaded not guilty and had denied that she had taken part in an organised criminal group trafficking in heroin . Having regard to the applicant 's statements and the number of suspects involved , the court considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant might tamper with evidence . In this connection , it had regard to the fact that several other potential suspects were still being sought .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's counsel appealed . She alleged , relying on LAW , that ORG had violated the principle of adversarial proceedings . In this connection , she submitted that ORG motion for prolongation of detention had been received at ORG on DATE . However , it was only in the TIME of DATE that the applicant 's counsel had been notified by telephone that the court 's hearing would be held on DATE at TIME Having further regard to the fact that counsel had not been served with a copy of the prosecutor 's motion , she argued that she could not properly defend the interests of the applicant . Counsel further submitted that the prosecutor had not read out the grounds of his application during the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It noted that the applicant had been charged with participation in an organised criminal group which operated in a number of NORP countries . In this context , it considered that there was a risk that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings if released . ORG further relied on the severity of the anticipated penalty and emphasised the danger to society posed by the drug trafficking . Furthermore , ORG dismissed the applicant 's allegations regarding access to the file and the belated summoning of her lawyer to the hearing . It held , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c The limitation on the lawyer 's access to the investigation file results from the binding procedural rules .", "The court 's hearing on the matter of detention is ancillary to the main proceedings and thus notification of this hearing can be effected shortly before the date for which it has been fixed . The lawyer was notified of the hearing at TIME on DATE the hearing . Thus , it can not be said that the court was at fault in this respect . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears that the request of the applicant 's counsel for leave to consult the file made during the hearing held on DATE was received by ORG only on DATE . On DATE the ORG refused that request , invoking the interests of the investigation ( wa\u017cny interes post\u0119powania ) . The prosecutor observed that the investigation was at its early stages and still in progress . Furthermore , he found that for reasons which had not been attributable to the prosecution a number of important witnesses had not yet been heard . The applicant appealed against that decision , relying on the principle of equality of arms . On DATE ORG upheld the refusal of CARDINAL DATE . He observed that the restrictions on access to the file had been temporary and justified by the interests of the investigation . In the latter respect , ORG referred to the organised character of the criminal activities at issue and the number of suspects involved . He considered that in those circumstances , the interests of the investigation weighed against the applicant 's right to be acquainted with all the evidence obtained so far in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged with ORG a motion for prolongation of the applicant 's detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's counsel was informed about the hearing scheduled for DATE regarding prolongation of detention . On ORG CARDINAL the applicant 's counsel requested LOC to adjourn the hearing until she had received a copy of the prosecutor 's motion . The court refused that request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's counsel requested ORG to provide her with a copy of his motion for the prolongation of the applicant 's detention with a view to preparing for the court 's hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the prosecution 's motion and ordered that the applicant be held in custody until DATE . It relied on the same grounds as in its earlier decisions . During the hearing ORG indicated that his motion for prolongation referred to , inter alia , the need to question one person whose details could not be disclosed . The counsel stated that the prosecutor simply referred to the relevant provisions of LAW but did not provide any specific grounds justifying the prolongation of the applicant 's detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant 's counsel access to the file following her application of DATE , having regard to the interests of the investigation . He considered that the lawyer 's request was tantamount to a request for access to the entire contents of the investigation file . Consequently , it refused the request on the same grounds as in the decision given on DATE . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG upheld the refusal on the same grounds as in his earlier decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's counsel appealed against the decision of DATE prolonging the applicant 's detention . She argued that she had not been provided with a copy of the prosecution 's motion and that she had not been notified in good time of the hearing . She submitted that consequently she had been prevented from properly discharging her obligations as the applicant 's counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . As regards the refusal to provide the applicant with a copy of the prosecution 's application for prolongation of detention , ORG found that the prosecutor was the only authority competent to decide on the issue of access to the file at the investigation stage and that any decision in this respect might be reviewed by a higher prosecutor . In respect of the notification of the hearing to the lawyer , the court found the applicant 's complaint unfounded . It considered that in cases of detention , such notification could be made by telephone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged with ORG a motion for prolongation of the applicant 's detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's counsel was notified by telephone about the hearing scheduled for DATE . On DATE counsel unsuccessfully requested ORG to adjourn the hearing since she had not been provided with a copy of the prosecutor 's application for prolongation of detention and thus could not prepare for the hearing fixed for DATE .

On DATE the ORG refused that request , having regard to the interests of the investigation and to the fact that it was still in progress .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing . It granted the prosecution 's motion and ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody until DATE . It had regard to the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which she had been charged . It relied in this respect on the evidence gathered to date , including evidence given by the applicant and her co - suspect , and the documentary evidence obtained from abroad . It also considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant might tamper with evidence , given that some of the co - suspects were still at large and that the case concerned an organised criminal group . It also had regard to the need to take further measures in the investigation as indicated in the prosecution 's application for prolongation of detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the statutory time - limit of DATE for the applicant 's detention pending the investigation expired . Consequently , any further prolongation of the applicant 's detention was to be decided by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the Katowice Appellate Prosecutor lodged with ORG a motion for prolongation of the applicant 's detention until DATE . On DATE ORG notified the counsel about the hearing scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing . It appears that during the hearing ORG agreed to provide counsel with a copy of his motion for prolongation of the detention . ORG granted the prosecution 's motion and extended the applicant 's detention until DATE . It noted that the investigation in the present case , which concerned trafficking in substantial amounts of drugs in a number of NORP countries , had been very time - consuming . It was further complicated by the need to obtain evidence from abroad and to hold a confrontation between the suspects and a certain GPE who had been recently transferred to GPE from GPE to serve his sentence . The court noted that another important suspect GPE , who had lived abroad , had been arrested in DATE . It thus considered that the investigation was being conducted without undue delays , and that the extension of the detention pending the investigation beyond the statutory time - limit was due to the exceptional circumstances . ORG also had regard to the scale of the alleged criminal activities and the severity of the anticipated penalty . The applicant appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the impugned decision . It referred , inter alia , to the presumption established by LAW to the effect that the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on the applicant might induce her to obstruct the proceedings . In view of the said presumption , ORG underlined that it was not required to consider the imposition of other preventive measures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's counsel requested ORG to release the applicant subject to certain guarantees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant 's release , having obtained a bail deposit and an additional personal guarantee from a local councillor that the applicant would not obstruct the proceedings . The applicant 's passport was seized and she was ordered not to leave the country . The prosecutor noted that despite the fact that DATE had elapsed since the applicant 's arrest , the investigation had not been concluded . He observed that the prosecution was endeavouring to obtain evidence from abroad , however it could not be predicted when that evidence would be made available . The prosecutor considered that the applicant should not be prejudiced by those delays and that other preventive measures would be sufficient to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer was informed by ORG that she could apply for access to the investigation file pursuant to LAW as the investigation was coming to an end . On DATE the applicant 's counsel was allowed to consult the file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution filed a bill of indictment with ORG .
