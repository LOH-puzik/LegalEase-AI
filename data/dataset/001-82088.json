CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP citizen who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s mother was a holder of a specially protected tenancy on a flat in ORG , owned by a public company , ORG Telecommunications ( ORG po\u0161ta i telekomunikacije ) . On DATE ORG enacted ORG ( Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo ) , which regulates the sale of publicly owned flats previously let under a specially protected tenancy . On the basis of that LAW , on DATE the applicant \u2019s mother requested the owner of the flat to conclude a contract for the sale of the flat between the owner as the seller and herself as the buyer . Since the owner declined her request , the applicant \u2019s mother brought a civil action in ORG ( PERSON ) seeking a judgment in lieu of the contract of sale .", "On DATE ORG gave a judgment by default . However , on an application by the defendant , the judgment was set aside and the proceedings continued . On DATE ORG gave a fresh judgment in place of the contract of sale . The defendant appealed against the first - instance judgment and the case file was forwarded to ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u Karlovcu ) . During the appellate proceedings the applicant \u2019s mother died . Subsequently , on DATE , the appellate court quashed the first - instance judgment on the ground that the plaintiff had died . The applicant took over the proceedings from his deceased mother .", "ORG on DATE dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim , finding that he did not fulfil the conditions for buying the flat in question . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL of the Inheritance Act provides that the deceased \u2019s assets are ex lege transferred to his or her heirs at the time of the death . Since at the time of ORG death on DATE , she was not the owner of the flat in question because a contract of sale had not been concluded beforehand and the judgment replacing such a contract had not become final , her heir could not have inherited the ownership of the flat in question . In other words , the plaintiff PERSON would be in a position to realise his inheritance and property rights on the flat in question only if the deceased , ORG , had concluded a contract of sale or if a final judgment replacing such a contract had been adopted .", "Furthermore , under the Specially Protected Tenancies ( Sale to Occupier ) Act , the right to purchase a flat is vested in the occupier and is a personal right which can not be transferred to heirs within the meaning of LAW ( Official Gazette nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) and is linked to the tenancy right , which likewise can not be inherited .", "It follows that PERSON , as an heir of ORG , who had submitted a request to purchase the flat , is not allowed to continue these proceedings .", "PERSON allegation that as a member of [ his mother \u2019s ] household he has an independent right to purchase the flat under LAW is deemed unfounded by the court .", "Without examining the question whether the plaintiff has the status of a member of [ his mother \u2019s ] household , the court has established that he does not have and can not have his mother \u2019s consent because it has been established that ORG herself made a request to purchase the flat in question and that she died during the appellate proceedings against this court \u2019s judgment dismissing her claim .", "Under section CARDINAL of ORG , a member of [ the tenant \u2019s ] household has the right to purchase a flat with the tenant \u2019s consent . Finding it established that the plaintiff does not have such consent , the court sees no need to establish his status as a member of [ his mother \u2019s ] household because these CARDINAL conditions have to be fulfilled cumulatively . Bearing in mind this legal characterisation of the dispute at issue , the court declined to hear further witnesses on behalf of the plaintiff ... who were to testify as to whether the plaintiff had lived in the same household as ORG . \u201d", "On a subsequent appeal by the applicant , ORG upheld the first - instance judgment on DATE . The relevant part of the appellate judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c Contrary to the appellant \u2019s submissions , under [ the relevant ] provisions of ORG , the right to purchase a flat is a personal tenant \u2019s right that can not be inherited or transferred to a heir within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW because it is linked to the tenancy right , which likewise can not be inherited . Therefore , the legal heir of the plaintiff , PERSON , does not have the right to purchase the flat in question , can not inherit it and can not continue these proceedings and obtain a judgment replacing the contract of sale , as found by the court of first instance . Furthermore , the first - instance court correctly applied section CARDINAL of the above - mentioned ORG to LAW , under which the right to purchase a flat is vested in a member of the [ tenant \u2019s ] household with the tenant \u2019s consent . Since the plaintiff herself submitted a request [ to purchase the flat ] as the tenant and thus expressed her choice , her son as a member of her household does not have this right . Therefore , [ the first - instance court ] correctly decided not to hear evidence concerning his status as a member of [ his mother \u2019s ] household . \u201d", "In his subsequent constitutional complaint the applicant argued , inter alia , that his right to a fair hearing had been violated , as well as his property rights . On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . In so far as relevant , the decision of ORG reads as follows :", "\u201c The applicant \u2019s allegations of a violation of LAW are unfounded . In the proceedings before ORG this court has not established any facts or circumstances indicating a violation of the constitutional right to a fair trial . In the disputed situation the judgments were adopted by courts established by law which acted within their competence , also established by law . The documents submitted about the civil proceedings in question show that the first - instance court conducted the proceedings and heard evidence in accordance with the need to establish relevant facts , while the appellate court entirely and thoroughly addressed the applicant \u2019s submissions . \u201d", "ORG ( Official Gazette nos . DATE , DATE , CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) regulates the conditions for the sale of flats let under specially protected tenancies . In general , the LAW entitles the holder of a specially protected tenancy on a publicly owned flat to purchase it under favourable conditions of sale .", "The relevant provisions of the LAW provide as follows :", "\u201c Every holder of a specially protected tenancy ( hereinafter \u2018 the tenant\u2019 ) may submit a written application to purchase a flat to the ... owner ( hereinafter \u2018 the seller\u2019 ) ... and the seller shall be obliged to sell the flat .", "... \u201d", "\u201c The right to buy a flat shall be vested in the tenant and , with his consent , the members of his household ...", "...", "The consent referred to in paragraph CARDINAL of this section shall be given in the contract ( of sale ) or in a separate document in which the signature must be certified . In the event of its refusal , the issue of consent shall be assessed in judicial proceedings . \u201d", "\u201c The seller shall be obliged to draw up a contract ( of sale ) with the buyer at the latest within DATE after the buyer has made an application to this effect .", "If the seller refuses to draw up a contract at the buyer \u2019s request within the time - limit laid down in paragraph CARDINAL of this section , the buyer may institute judicial proceedings seeking a judgment in lieu of the contract of sale . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
