De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s daughter PERSON was born on DATE . Since their separation in DATE , the applicant and A. \u2019s mother , PERSON , have been quarrelling over the custody of and contacts with A. The child was initially living with her mother . In DATE , PERSON was placed in a home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ms J. laid an information against the applicant with the police , accusing him of having raped their daughter since DATE . As PERSON had persistently declared not to be ready to make a statement before the police , the proceedings were initially discontinued . Following a visit of A. to her mother , the latter informed the police that A. was now ready to testify . A. was heard by the police twice in DATE . On DATE psychological expert PERSON , having examined A. , submitted a report on the credibility of A. \u2019s submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant with CARDINAL counts of serious sexual abuse of children ( Article CARDINALa of LAW , see paragraph DATE below ) and of sexual abuse of a person entrusted to him for upbringing ( Article CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , his daughter PERSON , committed between DATE and DATE mostly in or in the vicinity of GPE . The applicant was accused of having raped A. in his car on CARDINAL occasions and in a holiday apartment on QUANTITY occasions when he met her on DATE and during vacations following her GPE separation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was in detention on remand between DATE and DATE , when the execution of the detention order was suspended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having held CARDINAL hearings , acquitted the applicant of the charges on account of insufficiency of proof . It further ordered the ORG to bear the costs of the proceedings and the applicant \u2019s necessary expenses and to pay the applicant compensation for his detention on remand from CARDINAL to DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having regard to the testimonies of several witnesses and the ( diverging ) reports of CARDINAL psychological experts , PERSON and PERSON , on the credibility of A. \u2019s submissions , found that the offences the applicant had been charged with had not been proven with the certainty necessary for a criminal conviction . It noted that the applicant had contested the charges . He was only incriminated by PERSON \u2019s statements . ORG stated that it has not been convinced by PERSON \u2019s testimony in the hearing that the charges were completely correct , in particular , in terms of a clear definition of the criminal acts and their time frame .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having regard to the witness statements of CARDINAL educators who had noted signs of sexual abuse in DATE conduct , CARDINAL psychologists who had treated PERSON and a friend of A. , was not persuaded that A. had been influenced by third persons , including her mother , so as to incriminate her father .", "CARDINAL . ORG then stated in its judgment :", "\u201c ... To sum up , the ORG does not discern any signs of suggestive influence .", "Therefore , the ORG assumes , in sum , that the core events described by the witness have a factual basis , that is , that the accused actually carried out sexual assaults on his daughter in his car . Nevertheless , the acts could not be substantiated , in terms of either their intensity or their time frame , in a manner that would suffice to secure a conviction . The inconsistencies in the witness \u2019s testimony were so marked that it was impossible to establish precise facts . \u201d", "[ \u201c ... PERSON einer Suggestion f\u00fcr die PERSON .", "So geht die Kammer i m LOC aus , dass das von der GPE geschilderte PERSON realen PERSON hat , n\u00e4mlich dass es tats\u00e4chlich zu sexuellen ORG zu Lasten seiner Tochter in LOC ist . PERSON lie\u00dfen sich aber dennoch weder ihrer ORG noch ihrer zeitlichen PERSON in PERSON f\u00fcr eine ORG hinreichenden Art und Weise konkretisieren . PERSON in den ORG der PERSON so gravierend , dass konkrete Feststellungen nicht getroffen werden konnten . \u201c ]", "CARDINAL . NORP In coming to that conclusion , ORG took into account that witness PERSON had made the impression of being authentic . It was true that her statements had been short and she had appeared being relatively uninvolved . However , CARDINAL witnesses who knew PERSON partly for a longer period of time had confirmed that she generally spoke and acted in that manner and did not discuss problems in detail .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed , however , that even having regard to these elements , the inconsistencies in witness PERSON \u2019s statements prevailed to an extent that it was not in a position to establish concrete offences . There were inconsistencies in the witness \u2019s statements on the number of the acts described by her ( CARDINAL ) , the place of these acts ( notably concerning acts in a holiday apartment which the witness mentioned only at a later stage ) and the time frame in which they took place ( starting when the witness was CARDINAL and ending either on the witness \u2019s placement in the home or continuing also after that placement ) . Moreover , A. had been uncertain in the hearing about the exact manner in which the acts described by her were committed in the car and did not recall any details on several points . A. had , for instance , been very uncertain in the hearing whether the applicant had moved within the car onto the front passenger seat where she had sat or whether he had left the car and walked around it to come on her seat . Moreover , A. had declared several times in the hearing not to have any precise recollection of the events any more .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE and subsequently became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He claimed that ORG statements \u201c that the core events described by the witness have a factual basis , that is , that the accused actually carried out sexual assaults on his daughter in his car \u201d had breached his constitutional right to a fair trial , his personality rights and human dignity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
