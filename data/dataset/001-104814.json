THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Sverre Erik Jebens;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr F. Shiels of the ORG firm in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant was tried on the charges of possession of firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life , and of membership of a proscribed organisation . The only evidence against him at trial was an admission recorded in the police notes of his interrogation . The applicant denied in court that he had made such admissions , and challenged the veracity of the police records . He further argued that he had been physically ill - treated and subjected to intimidation during his arrest . CARDINAL police officers took the stand to vouch for the truthfulness of what they asserted was a contemporaneous record of the interrogation . The applicant was convicted of the charges and received concurrent sentences of DATE . His appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed DATE . The applicant spent DATE in prison .", "In DATE the applicant sought review of his conviction by ORG ( ORG ) . It arranged for expert analysis of the interview notes , which established that these had been modified at some later stage . This was sufficient for the ORG to refer the case to ORG , which ruled on DATE that the conviction could not be regarded as safe and quashed it accordingly .", "The ORG also referred the conduct of the CARDINAL police officers to ORG ( ORG ) , who in turn asked ORG to investigate . The latter did so and recommended prosecution of the officers for perjury . The ORG did not follow the recommendation . When asked by the applicant \u2019s solicitor to give reasons for this , he explained that an experienced lawyer within his office as well as an independent senior counsel had come to the view that there was no reasonable prospect of obtaining a conviction .", "The applicant sought judicial review of the ORG \u2019s refusal to give specific , detailed reasons . The matter was finally disposed of by ORG in a judgment of DATE , which reiterated its previous case law that the ORG is not bound by the rules of procedural fairness and thus not required to provide reasons for not prosecuting in a particular case . The court considered itself bound to follow its previous case law that the general policy of not giving reasons was neither irrational nor aberrant . Nor could it be concluded that in this particular case that the ORG \u2019s failure to depart from his general policy was unreasonable .", "The applicant also advanced an argument based on LAW . He contended that compelling him to serve a lengthy prison sentence on the strength of evidence that he knew to be false was inhuman and degrading . ORG did not examine this argument , since it related to facts occurring long before LAW came into force .", "On DATE ORG of ORG refused leave to appeal .", "The applicant pursued a claim for compensation following the quashing of his conviction . The claim was rejected by the Secretary of ORG for GPE . The applicant has informed the ORG that subsequently , in DATE , the Minister of ORG decided to make an ex gratia payment to him ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
