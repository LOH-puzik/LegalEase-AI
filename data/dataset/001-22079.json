AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicants , ORG are NORP nationals , born in DATE and DATE and living in PERSON and PERSON , respectively . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . The respondent Government are represented by Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are the parents of a son born in wedlock in DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) granted the applicants\u2019 petition for divorce by consent . In the settlement regulating the legal consequences of the divorce the applicants agreed , contrary to section CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) , to continue exercising joint custody over their son . The settlement was subject to approval in separate custody proceedings .", "On DATE ORG , in the custody proceedings , refused approval of the settlement on the ground that the law did not provide for joint custody after divorce except where the former spouses continued to live in a common household , which was not the applicants\u2019 case . The applicants appealed against this decision . They submitted an expert opinion which , having regard to both applicants\u2019 relationship with their son and their ability and willingness to care jointly for him , stated that awarding joint custody would be desirable in the interests of the child \u2019s well - being .", "On DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) adjourned the proceedings and requested ORG ) to review the constitutionality of section CARDINAL of LAW . ORG , by judgment of DATE ( see below ) , found that the said section was in conformity with the LAW .", "Thereupon , on DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal . It noted that , having regard to the clear wording of section CARDINAL of LAW , the courts were not empowered to grant joint custody after divorce except where the former spouses continued to live in a common household , even where this would be in the interests of the child \u2019s well - being in the circumstances of the particular case .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW , in the version in force at the material time , provided as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) In the event that the marriage of the parents of a minor born in wedlock is dissolved or declared null and void , or that the parents have lived separately for more than a limited period , they may submit an agreement to the court stating which CARDINAL of them will exercise sole custody over the child in the future . The court has to approve the agreement if it corresponds to the interests of the child \u2019s well - being .", "( CARDINAL ) If no agreement is reached within a reasonable time or if the agreement does not correspond to the interests of the child \u2019s well - being , the court has to decide which parent should have the right to sole custody in the future . In case the parents have lived separately for more than a limited period the court only decides upon the request of CARDINAL of them .", "( CARDINAL ) Section CARDINAL applies accordingly . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides , for children born out of wedlock , that the court may award joint custody to the parents upon their common request if they permanently live in a common household with the child and if such a ruling is not disadvantageous to the child \u2019s well - being .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG ruled on the constitutionality of section CARDINAL of LAW . It noted ORG constant case - law according to which section CARDINAL excluded an award of joint custody to both parents in case of divorce , except in the rare case when they continued to live together with the child in a common household . As to LAW , it found that the award of sole custody after divorce to CARDINAL parent was an interference with the other parent \u2019s right to respect for his or her family life , which was justified under the second paragraph of this Article . Given the legislator \u2019s margin of appreciation , it was to be considered necessary for the protection of the rights of others . In particular , it was proportionate , as the parent not having custody retained a number of rights , such as the right of access and the right to be informed and heard as regards certain important matters . Moreover , the law did not prevent parents , who wished to share their parental rights after divorce , from doing so in practice . As to LAW No . CARDINAL , ORG found that this provision did not prevent the legislator from creating different legal positions for spouses after divorce as long as such differences were not based on gender only . It did not generally demand that joint custody be awarded to parents after divorce .", "By amendment which entered into force on DATE ( ORG - Bundesgesetzblatt - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , section CARDINAL of LAW was changed . It now reads as follows .", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) In the event that the marriage of the parents of a minor born in wedlock is dissolved or declared null and void , the parents continue to exercise joint custody . They can , however - even for the purpose of changing an existing arrangement - submit an agreement concerning custody to the court which may provide for sole custody of CARDINAL parent . ...", "( CARDINAL ) Where the parents want to exercise joint custody they have to submit an agreement to the court stating with which parent the child has its main residence .", "( CARDINAL ) The court has to approve the GPE agreement to ensure that it is in the best interests of the child . \u201d", "A newly introduced section CARDINALa provides that where an agreement about the child \u2019s main residence is not achieved within a reasonable time , or where an agreement on custody is not reached or is not in the child \u2019s best interests , the court has to award sole custody to CARDINAL parent . Equally , where both parents exercise joint custody after dissolution of their marriage the court , upon the request of CARDINAL of them , has to award sole custody to CARDINAL parent according to the child \u2019s best interests where an agreed solution can not be reached .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , in the version in force at the material time , the parent not having custody has a right of access .", "Moreover , according to section CARDINAL of LAW in the version in force at the material time , the parent not having custody has the right to be informed by the other parent about certain measures listed in section QUANTITY ( which in cases of joint custody require the agreement of both parents ) , and has the right to be heard within a reasonable time . The submissions of the non - custodial parent are to be taken into account if the wishes expressed therein better serve the interests of the child \u2019s well - being . The measures at issue include the change of the child \u2019s first or family name , the entry into or secession from a church or other religious group , the child \u2019s placement in care , the acquisition or renunciation of a particular nationality , the early termination of an apprenticeship or employment contract , the recognition of paternity of a child born out of wedlock , as well as certain important provisions concerning the child \u2019s property .", "Following the above - mentioned amendment of the LAW section CARDINAL provides that the parent not living in a common household ( be it that he / she is the non - custodial parent or that the parents exercise joint custody ) has a right of access . Section CARDINAL still contains the rights of the non - custodial parent , but has slightly strengthened his / her position in case he / she is prevented from exercising the right of access and in case the custodial parent fails to give the required information ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
