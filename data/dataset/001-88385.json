The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is the owner and managing director of M , a building company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a worker employed by the M company mounted a scaffold ( which was owned , however , by another building firm ) at CARDINAL of the company \u2019s building sites at FAC in GPE . He fell and died DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the GPE ORG ( GPE ) started preliminary inquiries ( FAC ) against the applicant on suspicion of having caused death by negligence ( fahrl\u00e4ssige PERSON ) , an offence under LAW . On DATE he discontinued the inquiries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE issued a penal order ( PERSON ) against the applicant as manager of the M company , imposing a fine for an administrative offence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , no . CARDINAL , of LAW ( Arbeitnehmerschutzgesetz ) read in conjunction with several provisions of ORG ( Bauarbeiterschutzverordnung ) . It found that the applicant had disregarded the duties of an employer concerning the properties , conditions , use , inspection or maintenance of equipment ( PERSON betreffend die PERSON , die PERSON , die PERSON , die Pr\u00fcfung oder die PERSON ) as , on DATE , a scaffold used at the building site at FAC , GPE , had lacked protective barriers on CARDINAL sides at head , chest and foot level and the protective barriers on the fourth side had not been properly secured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , assisted by counsel , appealed to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d \u2013 PERSON ) . He submitted that at the building site at FAC in GPE CARDINAL scaffolds owned by different construction companies had been in use . While the CARDINAL belonging to the M company had all the necessary protective elements , the defective scaffold used by the employees of the M company , which had led to the industrial accident , was owned by another company . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant submitted further that the ORG should quash the penal order as the administrative criminal proceedings had been conducted in breach of the principle of ne bis in idem .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the penal order of DATE . Referring to ORG case - law on LAW No . CARDINAL , the ORG found that criminal proceedings for causing death by negligence under LAW and proceedings under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , no . DATE , of LAW , read in conjunction with ORG , concerned essentially the same conduct as in both cases the authorities and courts had to examine whether the provisions for the protection of construction workers had been complied with . In such circumstances , the person responsible for compliance with these rules was also criminally liable under LAW in the event of an accident at work leading to the death of the victim . Therefore the ORG was prevented from conducting administrative criminal proceedings against the applicant even though finally ORG had discontinued his inquiries into the charge of causing death by negligence against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Federal Minister for Economy and Labour ( PERSON LOC und PERSON ) filed a complaint with ORG against the ORG \u2019s decision . The Federal Minister pointed to ORG case - law , according to which a conviction under LAW concerned essentially the same punishable conduct as the offence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , no . DATE , of LAW . Thus , to conduct CARDINAL sets of criminal proceedings concerning these offences would be in breach of LAW No . CARDINAL . The ORG had , however , overlooked the fact that in the present case no proceedings had been conducted against the applicant before a criminal court . The inquiries by ORG , an employee of ORG , had the purpose of verifying whether or not a charge should be brought against a person and whether proper criminal proceedings should be opened . As a result ORG had discontinued the preliminary inquiries since he had not found sufficient reasons to prosecute the applicant . That being so , it could not be said that an act had been committed which fell within the scope of LAW . The ne bis in idem principle did not therefore apply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE . ORG found that the ne bis in idem principle was not at stake if a public prosecutor discontinued preliminary inquiries on a criminal information pursuant to LAW , as in such a case the public prosecutor \u2013 either immediately or after conducting inquiries \u2013 arrived at the conclusion that the criminal information was unfounded , and that the act to which it referred was not punishable or did not justify prosecution . Such a case must be distinguished from the material facts in ORG decision to which the ORG had referred , as that case had not concerned the termination of investigations LAW CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave a fresh decision on the applicant \u2019s appeal and this time upheld the GPE \u2019s penal order after having held oral hearings on DATE and DATE . The ORG noted that the workers present at the building site had used a scaffold belonging to another building company . The applicant , as the person responsible , had not installed a properly functioning control system , verifying that the scaffolds and other materials used by the workers complied with safety regulations and that the workers had been trained in complying with these regulations . The applicant had therefore been responsible for the non - compliance with the safety regulations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , alleging , inter alia , that the impugned decision disregarded the principle of ne bis in idem .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint for lack of prospect of success , and on DATE ORG also declined to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint for lack of prospect of success in accordance with section MONEY of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW Strafproze\u03b2ordnung ) concern the conduct of preliminary inquiries ( Vorerhebungen ) and preliminary investigations ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . In order to procure the necessary evidence for the institution of criminal proceedings or for the closing of the file ( LOC ) on a criminal information , the public prosecutor may first have preliminary inquiries carried out by the investigating judge , ORG or the police authorities ( Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Where the public prosecutor is satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for bringing a criminal prosecution , he or she must either request the institution of preliminary investigations or file a formal indictment ( PERSON , PERSON ; LAW ) . LAW provides that preliminary investigations pursue the aim of provisionally examining the criminal charges laid against a person and of establishing the facts to the extent necessary to decide whether to discontinue the criminal proceedings or to commit the person for trial and prepare the taking of evidence at the trial .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that preliminary investigations are in principle conducted by the investigating judge personally and directly .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Administrative Offences provides :", "\u201c Unless a provision of administrative law states otherwise , negligent behaviour is sufficient to establish guilt . Negligence is to be assumed in the case of failure to observe a prohibition or a prescription where damage or danger is not an element of the administrative offence , and the defendant does not convincingly show that no fault lies with him for the contravention of the provision of administrative law . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
