On DATE CARDINAL of the first applicant \u2019s brothers were convicted in GPE ( \" GPE \" ) of arms offences connected with the purchase of weapons for ORG ( \" Provisional IRA \" ) . The Provisional IRA is included among the organisations proscribed under the special legislation enacted in GPE to deal with terrorism in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME Corporal NORP , a member of ORG , attended an ORG briefing at which she was told that the first applicant was suspected of involvement in the collection of money for the purchase of arms for the IRA in the GPE , this being a criminal offence under section CARDINAL of GPE ( Emergency LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" ) and section CARDINAL of the Prevention of Terrorism ( Temporary Provisions ) Act DATE . The corporal was instructed to go to the first applicant \u2019s house , arrest her under LAW ( see paragraphs QUANTITY below ) and bring her back to the ORG screening centre at FAC in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At TIME Corporal D. , who was unarmed but accompanied by QUANTITY armed soldiers , arrived by ORG vehicle at the applicants\u2019 home . The first applicant herself answered the door and CARDINAL of the male soldiers , together with Corporal NORP , entered the house . Corporal NORP established the identity of the first applicant and asked her to get dressed . Corporal NORP went upstairs with the first applicant . The other applicants were roused and asked to assemble in the living room . The soldiers did not carry out any search of the contents of the house , but made written notes as to the interior of the house and recorded personal details concerning the applicants . At TIME in the hallway of the house Corporal NORP , with CARDINAL of the soldiers acting as a witness , said to the first applicant , \" As a member of Her ORG forces , I arrest you . \" On being asked twice by the first applicant under what section , Corporal NORP replied , \" Section CARDINAL . \"", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was then driven to the ORG screening centre at FAC , GPE . She was escorted into a building and asked to sit for a short time in a small cubicle . At TIME she was taken before PERSON who asked her questions with a view to completing part CARDINAL of a standard form to record , inter alia , details of the arrest and screening procedure and personal details . The first applicant refused to answer any questions save to give her name and she refused to be photographed . The interview ended TIME . She was then examined by a medical orderly who endeavoured to establish whether she suffered from certain illnesses , but she again refused to co - operate and did not answer any of his questions .", "CARDINAL . At TIME she was taken to an interview room and questioned by a soldier in civilian clothes in the presence of Corporal NORP She was asked , inter alia , about her brothers and her contacts with them , but she still refused to answer questions . After the interview , which ended at TIME , she was returned to the reception area and then taken back to the medical orderly who asked her if she had any complaints . She did not reply to this query .", "At some stage during her stay in the centre she was photographed without her knowledge or consent . This photograph and the personal details about her , her family and her home were kept on record .", "She was released at TIME without being charged .", "CARDINAL . The standard record form , called the \" screening proforma \" , recorded the first applicant \u2019s name , address , nationality , marital and tenancy status , the chronological details about her arrest , the names of the ORG personnel involved , the names of the other applicants and their relationship to her , her physique and her attitude to the interview . Under the heading \" Additional information ... concerning the arrestee ( as reported by the arresting soldier ) \" , it stated : \" Subject is the sister of C ... M ... who was arrested in GPE . Questioned on the above subject . \" Nothing however was recorded under the heading \" Suspected offence \" . It noted that the applicant had refused to answer questions and that no information had been gained from the interview .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , the first applicant brought an action against ORG for false imprisonment and other torts .", "CARDINAL . In those proceedings CARDINAL of the principal allegations made by the first applicant was that her arrest and detention had been effected unlawfully and for an improper purpose . Her allegations were summarised in the judgment of PERSON on DATE :", "\" The plaintiff \u2019s counsel launched a series of attacks on the legality of the plaintiff \u2019s arrest and detention which varied in thrust between the very broad and the very narrow . In the former class , for example , was an attack in which they alleged that the use of section CARDINAL of the [ CARDINAL Act ] in this case was an example of what they called \u2018 an institutionalised form of unlawful ORG by the military authorities , with the intention of obtaining what counsel termed \u2018 low level intelligence\u2019 from the plaintiff , and without ( a ) any genuine suspicion on the part of those authorities that she had committed a criminal offence or ( b ) any genuine intention on their part of questioning her about a criminal offence alleged to have been committed by her . \"", "CARDINAL . In support of this case the first applicant \u2019s counsel not only called and examined the applicant herself but extensively cross - examined the CARDINAL witnesses called on behalf of the defendants , namely Corporal NORP and PERSON", "CARDINAL . The evidence given by the first applicant is recorded in a note drafted by the trial judge , there being no transcript of DATE of the trial as a result of a technical mishap with the recording equipment . The first applicant explained how she had found the conditions of her arrest and detention distressing for her . She had been angry but had not used strong language . She testified that whilst at the ORG centre she had refused to be photographed , to be weighed by the medical orderly , to sign any documents and to answer questions , whether put by PERSON , the medical orderly or the interviewer , apart from giving her name . She had made it clear that she would not be answering any questions . She alleged that PERSON had told her in so many words that the ORG knew that she had not committed any crime but that her file had been lost and the ORG wanted to update it . She said that she had been questioned about her brothers in the GPE , their whereabouts and her contacts with them , but not about the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA or about any offence . She accepted that she had been in contact with her brothers and had been to the GPE , including a visit DATE ( DATE ) . She believed that the ORG had wanted to obtain information about her brothers . On leaving the centre , she had told the officials that she would be seeing them in court .", "CARDINAL . As appears from the transcript of her evidence , Corporal NORP gave an account of her briefing on TIME of the arrest . She stated that at the briefing she had been told the first applicant \u2019s name and address and the grounds on which she was wanted for questioning , namely her suspected involvement in the collection of money for the purchase of weapons from GPE . She testified that \" my suspicions were aroused by my briefing , and my belief was that PERSON was suspected of collecting money to purchase arms \" .", "Under cross - examination Corporal NORP maintained that the purpose of an arrest and detention under section CARDINAL of LAW was not to gather intelligence but to question a suspected person about an offence . She stated that her suspicion of the first applicant had been formed on the basis of everything she had been told at the briefing and which she had read in a document which had been supplied to her then . Corporal NORP stated that she would not have effected the arrest unless she had been given the grounds on which she was expected to arrest the person . Under repeated questioning , Corporal NORP maintained that she had been informed at the briefing , and that she had formed the suspicion , that the applicant had been involved in the collection of money for the purchase of arms from GPE .", "CARDINAL . Corporal NORP was further examined about the interrogation of the first applicant at FAC . She stated that she recalled that questions had been asked of the applicant by the interviewer and that the applicant had refused to answer any questions put to her . She recalled that the interviewer had asked a few more questions when he returned to the room after leaving it but that she could not really remember what they were about . Counsel for the defence returned to the question of the interview of the applicant towards the end of his examination of Corporal NORP in the following exchange :", "Q. \" ... Now while you were , just going back for a moment to the time when what I might call the interview , that \u2019s when the CARDINAL of you were in the room , and the QUANTITY occasions you \u2019ve said she had to leave , you took her to , she wanted to go to the lavatory . Do you just have no recollection of any of the questions that were asked ? \"", "A. \" I do n\u2019t remember the questions as they were asked . There was a question regards money . A question regards GPE . \"", "No cross - examination by the first applicant \u2019s counsel was directed to this reply of the witness .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was examined and cross - examined about his completion of part CARDINAL of the standard record form when standing at the reception desk . He said that the first applicant had stated her name but refused to give her address or date of birth or any further information . He expressly denied the applicant \u2019s allegation that he had said to her that he knew she was not a criminal and that he just wanted to update her files which had been lost . He gave evidence that information recorded in DATE on the occasion of a previous arrest of the first applicant had in any event not been lost , since it had been used to complete the details on the first page of the form when she had refused to answer any questions .", "Under cross - examination PERSON did not accept that the main purpose of questioning a person arrested under LAW was to gather general information about the background , family and associates of the arrested person . He maintained that persons were only arrested and detained if there existed a suspicion against them of involvement in a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . The issue of the interview of the first applicant was specifically addressed in the final submission of defence counsel , in which the following exchange is partially recorded in the transcript :", "\" PERSON . PERSON : My Lord ... your Lordship has the grounds upon which the arresting officer carries out ( inaudible ) she then gives evidence and is present throughout the interview ... now I talk about the interview on the very last stage .", "JUDGE : At the table ?", "ORG . PERSON : At the table , and said that in the course of that interview money and arms that these matters were raised , I ca n\u2019t ... hesitate to use the ( inaudible ) now that is CARDINAL point . The other point is this , that this was a lady who on her own admission was not going to answer any questions . She agreed during cross - examination that that was the attitude and so CARDINAL finds that an interview takes place with somebody who is not prepared to answer any questions but at least the questions are raised with her concerning the matter on which she was arrested .", "JUDGE : Is the substance of that then that because of her fairly firm refusal you would say to answer any questions there was never any probing examination of her collecting money for example ?", "ORG . PERSON : No my Lord because she ... as she said she was n\u2019t going to answer any questions . \"", "CARDINAL . In his judgment of DATE PERSON gave detailed consideration to the evidence of Corporal NORP and PERSON on the one hand and the first applicant on the other . PERSON could not possibly accept the [ first applicant \u2019s ] evidence \" that she had been told by PERSON that she was not suspected of any offence and that he was just updating his records . He similarly rejected the applicant \u2019s claim that Corporal NORP at no time genuinely suspected her of having committed an offence . In the light of the evidence of Corporal NORP herself , who was described as a \" transparently honest witness \" , the judge was", "\" quite satisfied that on the basis of her briefing at FAC she genuinely suspected the [ first applicant ] of having been involved in the offence of collecting money in GPE for arms \" .", "CARDINAL . PERSON also rejected the first applicant \u2019s claim that section DATE CARDINAL Act had been used with a view to screening in order to gain low - level intelligence : he accepted the evidence of Corporal NORP and PERSON , which had been tested in cross - examination , that the purpose of the applicant \u2019s arrest and detention under the section had been to establish facts concerning the offence of which she was suspected .", "PERSON also believed the evidence of Corporal NORP that there were questions addressed to the matters of which the applicant was suspected . He stated :", "\" As regards the interviewer , the plaintiff accepted that he was interested in the activities of her brothers who shortly before the date of the interview had been convicted on arms charges in the GPE connected with the Provisional IRA but the [ first applicant ] , who seems to have been well aware of her rights , obviously had decided not to co - operate with the military staff in the centre . In particular she had decided ( it seems ) not to answer any of their questions and in this situation , and with the short detention period permitted by the section , there was little that the interviewer or any of the other staff in the centre could do to pursue their suspicions . \"", "CARDINAL . PERSON likewise rejected the first applicant \u2019s argument that the photographing of her gave rise to a cause of action . His understanding of the law was that merely taking the photograph of a person , even against their will , without physically interfering with or defaming the person was not tortious .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s action before ORG was therefore dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant thereupon appealed to ORG . She again challenged the legality of her arrest on the grounds , inter alia", "\" ( CARDINAL ) that the arresting officer did not have , or was not sufficiently proved to have , the requisite suspicion ; ( CARDINAL ) that she did not have sufficiently detailed knowledge or understanding of what was alleged against the plaintiff to warrant the conclusion that it was an offence which would justify arrest \" .", "In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG unanimously rejected both these grounds . In delivering judgment , ORG noted :", "\" [ The trial judge had ] found , and his finding was amply justified by the evidence , that [ Corporal NORP ] genuinely suspected the plaintiff of having been involved in the offence of collecting money in GPE for arms to be purchased in GPE for use by a proscribed organisation . \"", "In particular , as to the second ground ORG observed :", "\" Suspicion is something less than proof , and may exist without evidence , though it must be supported by some reason . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG further unanimously rejected the first applicant \u2019s complaint that the purpose of her arrest and detention , and the whole purport of her questioning , was a fishing expedition unrelated to the matters of which she was suspected and designed to obtain low - grade intelligence about the applicant and others . In rejecting this complaint , ORG took account of the evidence which had been adduced on both sides :", "\" Corporal NORP who was present during the interview had very little recollection of the course of the questions . The only other witness as to the conduct of this interview was the [ first applicant ] . Her account also is sketchy , though in somewhat more detail . What is clear from both witnesses is that the [ first applicant ] was deliberately unhelpful and refused to answer most of the questions . What is certain is that she was asked about her brothers ... who in DATE had been convicted of offences connected with the purchase of firearms in the GPE for use by the IRA [ and for which offences they had been sentenced to terms of CARDINAL and CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment ] . It is clear that it was for such a purchase that the [ first applicant ] was suspected of having collected money , as she stated the interviewer asked her whether she was in contact with them . There is no doubt , therefore , that the interviewer did attempt to pursue the subject of the suspicion which had been the occasion for her arrest but was unable to make any headway . \"", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG also concerned certain related matters such as the legality of the search of the applicants\u2019 house , in respect of which ORG found that there was a sufficient basis in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and ORG ) below ) . ORG held that the implied authority granted to the ORG under LAW included a power to interrogate a detained person and , as a practical necessity , a power to record personal particulars and details concerning the arrest and detention . It further found that the standard record form known as the \" screening proforma \" contained no information which might not have been relevant to the resolution of the suspicion .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint that she had been photographed without her knowledge , ORG stated as follows :", "\" The act of taking the photograph involved nothing in the nature of a physical assault . Whether such an act would constitute an invasion of privacy so as to be actionable in GPE is irrelevant , because the [ first applicant ] can only recover damages if it amounts to a tort falling within CARDINAL of the recognised branches of the law on the topic . According to the common law there is no remedy if someone takes a photograph of another against his will . ORG was placed on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the [ DATE ] Act by counsel for the [ first applicant ] ... This provision gives power to the police to order [ in addition to the taking of a photograph ] the taking of finger prints without the necessity of charging the person concerned and applying for an order of the magistrate under article CARDINAL of ORG ( GPE ) Order DATE , which contains no comparable provision as to the taking of photographs . The taking of finger prints otherwise than by consent must involve an assault and I am satisfied that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was enacted not to legalise the taking of photographs without consent , but to legalise the taking of photographs or finger prints in circumstances where there would otherwise have been an illegal assault . It does not involve the implication that the taking of a photograph without violence and without consent is actionable . \"", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was granted leave by ORG to appeal to ORG . This appeal was rejected on CARDINAL DATE ( ORG , [ DATE ] Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In ORG the applicant did not pursue the allegation that she had not been arrested on the basis of a genuine and honest suspicion that she had committed an offence .", "She did however pursue the complaint , previously raised before ORG , that since she was only lawfully arrested at TIME she had been unlawfully detained DATE TIME ORG found that a person is arrested from the moment he is subject to restraint and that the first applicant was therefore under arrest from the moment that Corporal NORP identified her on entering the house at TIME .. It made no difference that the formal words of arrest were communicated to the applicant at TIME In this respect Lord PERSON stated ( at pp . CARDINALH-CARDINALA ) :", "\" If the plaintiff had been told she was under arrest the moment she identified herself , it would not have made the slightest difference to the sequence of events before she left the house . It would have been wholly unreasonable to take her off , half - clad , to the ORG centre , and TIME would have elapsed while she gathered herself together and completed her toilet and dressing . It would seem a strange result that in these circumstances , whether or not she has an action for false imprisonment should depend upon whether the words of arrest are spoken on entering or leaving the house , when the practical effect of the difference on the plaintiff is non - existent . \"", "CARDINAL . The first applicant had also maintained that the failure to inform her that she was arrested until the soldiers were about to leave the house rendered the arrest unlawful . This submission was also rejected by ORG . Lord PERSON held as follows ( at pp . TIME ) :", "\" It is a feature of the very limited power of arrest contained in section CARDINAL that a member of the armed forces does not have to tell the arrested person the offence of which he is suspected , for it is specifically provided by section GPE ) that it is sufficient if he states that he is effecting the arrest as a member of Her Majesty \u2019s forces .", "Corporal NORP was carrying out this arrest in accordance with the procedures in which she had been instructed to make a house arrest pursuant to section DATE . This procedure appears to me to be designed to make the arrest with the least risk of injury to those involved including both the soldiers and the occupants of the house . When arrests are made on suspicion of involvement with the IRA it would be to close one \u2019s eyes to the obvious not to appreciate the risk that the arrest may be forcibly resisted .", "The drill the ORG follow is to enter the house and search every room for occupants . The occupants are all directed to assemble in CARDINAL room , and when the person the soldiers have come to arrest has been identified and is ready to leave , the formal words of arrest are spoken just before they leave the house . The ORG do not carry out a search for property in the house and , in my view , they would not be justified in doing so . The power of search is given \u2018 for the purpose of arresting a person\u2019 , not for a search for incriminating evidence . It is however a proper exercise of the power of search for the purpose of effecting the arrest to search every room for other occupants of the house in case there may be those there who are disposed to resist the arrest . The search can not be limited solely to looking for the person to be arrested and must also embrace a search whose object is to secure that the arrest should be peaceable . I also regard it as an entirely reasonable precaution that all the occupants of the house should be asked to assemble in CARDINAL room . As Corporal D. explained in evidence , this procedure is followed because the soldiers may be distracted by other occupants in the house rushing from CARDINAL room to another , perhaps in a state of alarm , perhaps for the purpose of raising the alarm and to resist the arrest . In such circumstances a tragic shooting accident might all too easily happen with young , and often relatively inexperienced , armed soldiers operating under conditions of extreme tension . Your Lordships were told that the husband and children either had commenced , or were contemplating commencing , actions for false imprisonment arising out of the fact that they were asked to assemble in the living - room for a short period before the plaintiff was taken from the house . That very short period of restraint when they were asked to assemble in the living room was a proper and necessary part of the procedure for effecting the peaceable arrest of the plaintiff . It was a temporary restraint of very short duration imposed not only for the benefit of those effecting the arrest , but also for the protection of the occupants of the house and would be wholly insufficient to found an action for unlawful imprisonment .", "It was in my opinion entirely reasonable to delay speaking the words of arrest until the party was about to leave the house . If words of arrest are spoken as soon as the house is entered before any precautions have been taken to search the house and find the other occupants , it seems to me that there is a real risk that the alarm may be raised and an attempt made to resist arrest , not only by those within the house but also by summoning assistance from those in the immediate neighbourhood . When soldiers are employed on the difficult and potentially dangerous task of carrying out a house arrest of a person suspected of an offence in connection with the IRA , it is I think essential that they should have been trained in the drill they are to follow . It would be impracticable and I think potentially dangerous to leave it to the individual discretion of the particular soldier making the arrest to devise his own procedures for carrying out this unfamiliar military function . It is in everyone \u2019s best interest that the arrest is peaceably effected and I am satisfied that the procedures adopted by the ORG are sensible , reasonable and designed to bring about the arrest with the minimum of danger and distress to all concerned . I would however add this rider : that if the suspect , for any reason , refuses to accept the fact of restraint in the house he should be informed forthwith that he is under arrest . \"", "CARDINAL . Before ORG the first applicant also pursued a claim that her period of detention exceeded what was reasonably required to make a decision whether to release her or hand her over to the police . In this regard the applicant complained that the standard record form ( the \" screening proforma \" ) constituted an improper basis for questioning a suspect on the ground that it asked questions not directly relevant to the suspected offence ; it was also suggested that the evidence did not show that the questioning of the applicant was directed to the matters of which she was suspected . The allegation was unanimously rejected by ORG . Lord PERSON observed as follows ( at pp . CARDINALF-CARDINALC ) :", "\" The member of the forces who carried out the interrogation between CARDINAL.CARDINAL and TIME was not called as a witness on behalf of ORG . There may have been sound reasons for this decision associated with preserving the confidentiality of interrogating techniques and the identity of the interviewer , but be that as it may , the only evidence of what took place at the interview came from Corporal NORP and the [ first applicant ] and it is submitted that this evidence is insufficient to establish that the interview was directed towards an attempt to investigate the suspicion upon which the [ applicant ] was arrested . Corporal NORP was present at that interview , she was not paying close attention but she gave evidence that she remembered questions about money which were obviously directed towards the offences of which the [ applicant ] was suspected . The [ applicant ] also said she was questioned about her brothers .", "The judge also had before him a questionnaire that was completed by the interviewer . ... There is nothing in the questionnaire which the ORG may not reasonably ask the suspect together with such particular questions as are appropriate to the particular case ... \"", "The conclusion of the trial judge that the applicant had not been asked unnecessary or unreasonable questions and the conclusion of ORG that the interviewer had attempted to pursue with the applicant the suspicion which had been the occasion of the arrest , but had been unable to make any headway , were held by ORG to be justified on the evidence .", "CARDINAL . For DATE the population of GPE , which totals CARDINAL people , has been subjected to a campaign of terrorism . During that time CARDINAL of persons in GPE have been killed , maimed or injured . The campaign of terror has extended to the rest of GPE and to the mainland of LOC .", "The DATE Act forms part of the special legislation enacted over DATE in an attempt to enable the security forces to deal effectively with the threat of terrorist violence .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was arrested under section DATE CARDINAL Act , which at the relevant time provided as follows :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) A member of Her Majesty \u2019s forces on duty may arrest without warrant , and detain for not more than four hours , a person whom he suspects of committing , having committed or being about to commit any offence .", "( CARDINAL ) A person effecting an arrest under this section complies with any rule of law requiring him to state the ground of arrest if he states that he is effecting the arrest as a member of Her Majesty \u2019s forces .", "( CARDINAL ) For the purpose of arresting a person under this section a member of Her Majesty \u2019s forces may enter and search any LOC or other place -", "( a ) where that person is , or", "( b ) if that person is suspected of being a terrorist or of having committed an offence involving the use or possession of an explosive , explosive substance or firearm , where that person is suspected of being . \"", "A similar provision had been in force since DATE and had been considered necessary to deal with terrorist activities in CARDINAL independent reviews ( Report of the ORG DATE which recommended such a power and a ORG chaired by Lord PERSON DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Sir PERSON , a retired senior member of the judiciary , was invited by the Government to review the operation of LAW in order to determine whether its provisions struck the right balance between the need , on the one hand , to maintain as fully as possible the liberties of the individual and , on the other , to provide the security forces and the courts with adequate powers to enable them to protect the public from current and foreseeable incidence of terrorist crime . In the resultant report specific consideration was given to , inter alia , including a requirement in section CARDINAL of LAW that an arrest should be based upon reasonable suspicion . While expressly recognising the risk that the facts raising the suspicion might come from a confidential source which could not be disclosed in court in a civil action for wrongful arrest , Sir PERSON concluded that the inclusion of a requirement of reasonableness would not in fact make any difference to the actions of the military and recommended an amendment to LAW accordingly . That recommendation was implemented in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The scope and exercise of the section CARDINAL powers were considered by the domestic courts in the proceedings in the present case . The applicable law , as stated by the judgments in these proceedings , is that when the legality of an arrest or detention under section DATE is challenged ( whether by way of habeas corpus or in proceedings for damages for wrongful arrest or false imprisonment ) , the burden lies on the military to justify their acts and , in particular , to establish the following elements :", "( a ) compliance with the formal requirements for arrest ;", "( b ) the genuineness of the suspicion on which the arrest was based ;", "( c ) that the powers of arrest and detention were not used for any improper purpose such as intelligence - gathering ;", "( d ) that the power of search was used only to facilitate the arrest and not for the obtaining of incriminating evidence ;", "( e ) that those responsible for the arrest and detention did not exceed the time reasonably required to reach a decision whether to release the detainee or hand him over to the police .", "CARDINAL .
