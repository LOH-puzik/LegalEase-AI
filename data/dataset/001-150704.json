NORP The relationship between the applicant and PERSON deteriorated and the latter left the family home on DATE , taking their daughter with her .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG ( tribunale per i minorenni di GPE ) for an award of sole custody of the child and asked the court to issue a travel ban prohibiting her from leaving GPE without his consent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a travel ban in respect of the applicant \u2019s daughter . On DATE the applicant learned that PERSON had left GPE with the child and had travelled to GPE , where she intended to take up residence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lifted the travel ban in respect of the applicant \u2019s daughter , granted preliminary joint custody of the child to both parents , and authorised her to reside with her mother in GPE , having regard to her young age and close relationship with her mother . It also appointed an expert who was entrusted with the task of collecting the necessary information for a final decision on custody . In addition , the court granted the applicant access rights twice a month in a neutral location , noting that the meetings should alternate between GPE and GPE and that the dates and arrangements should be agreed with the expert .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , PERSON brought their daughter to GPE only once . Visits took place in GPE , although PERSON did not facilitate their organisation . At DATE visits ceased , allegedly due to ORG obstructive behaviour . In a report of CARDINAL DATE the expert noted that she was not in a position to evaluate the applicant \u2019s ability to take care of his daughter .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government the applicant met his daughter CARDINAL times in GPE , where supervised visits took place DATE and DATE . Subsequently , he refused to travel to GPE without giving any reasons .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for assistance to secure his daughter \u2019s return under LAW . His application was forwarded via the respective central authorities in GPE and GPE to GPE ) , where proceedings began on DATE . Subsequently , the court appointed an expert .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for the return of the child under LAW . Referring to the expert \u2019s opinion and having regard to the very young age of the child , the court found that her return would constitute a grave risk for her within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) set aside that decision because the applicant had not been duly heard in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Leoben ORG , having heard the applicant , again dismissed his application for his daughter \u2019s return , referring to ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Meanwhile , in DATE PERSON brought proceedings before ORG , seeking an award of sole custody of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that it had jurisdiction with regard to custody , access and maintenance issues in respect of the child by virtue of Article PERSON ) of ORG Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same court made a preliminary award of sole custody to PERSON , referring to the child \u2019s close links with GPE and the risk of danger to her well - being upon a possible return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG awarded PERSON sole custody of the child .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant made an application to ORG for his daughter \u2019s return under LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG , having held a hearing , ordered the child \u2019s return to GPE . The child would live with her mother , should the latter decide to return to GPE with her . In that event the PERSON GPE social services department was required to provide them with accommodation . In addition , a programme for the exercise of the applicant \u2019s access rights would have to be established . If the child \u2019s mother did not wish to return to GPE , the child was to reside with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that it remained competent to deal with the case , as ORG had wrongly determined its jurisdiction under LAW ) of ORG . It noted that its previous decision of DATE had been designed as a temporary measure in order to re - establish contact between the applicant and his daughter through access rights and to obtain a basis for an expert opinion for the decision on custody of the child . However , the child \u2019s mother had failed to co - operate with the appointed expert and had refused a programme of access rights for the applicant prepared by the expert . The latter had stated in her preliminary opinion that she was not in a position to answer all questions relating to the child \u2019s best interests in a satisfactory manner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a certificate of enforceability under LAW of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought the enforcement of ORG judgment of DATE . He was represented by counsel in these and all subsequent proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for enforcement of ORG order to return the child . It noted that the child \u2019s mother was not willing to return to GPE with her . However , the child \u2019s return without her mother would constitute a grave risk for her within the meaning of Article CARDINAL(b ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG quashed that decision and granted the applicant \u2019s request for enforcement .", "CARDINAL . The Leoben Regional Court noted that under LAW a judgment refusing return under LAW was irrelevant where the court which was competent pursuant to ORG had ordered the child \u2019s return in a subsequent judgment . It confirmed that ORG had been competent to issue the judgment of DATE , as ORG had unlawfully removed the child from GPE and the applicant had immediately requested her return . Moreover , the applicant had submitted a certificate of enforceability under LAW of ORG in respect of the judgment at issue . The NORP courts therefore had to recognise the judgment and to enforce it . They were not to establish anew whether the child \u2019s return would be contrary to her best interests . In any event , there was no indication that the circumstances had changed since ORG had given its judgment . It was for the court of first instance to order appropriate measures of enforcement .", "CARDINAL . D.P. lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested a preliminary ruling by ORG of ORG ( CJEU ) , submitting a number of questions concerning the application of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG issued a preliminary ruling ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG ) confirming the jurisdiction of the NORP courts in the case and the enforceability of ORG judgment of DATE . It found , in particular , that :", "( CARDINAL ) a provisional measure [ such as the CARDINAL issued by ORG in DATE ] did not constitute a \u2018 judgment on custody that does not entail the return of the child\u2019 within the meaning of Article CARDINAL(b ) subparagraph ( iv ) of ORG and could not be the basis of a transfer of jurisdiction to the courts of the Member ORG to which the child had been unlawfully removed ;", "( CARDINAL ) Article CARDINAL ) of the ORG applied to a judgment of the court with jurisdiction ordering the return of the child , even if it was not preceded by a final judgment of that court relating to custody of the child ;", "( CARDINAL ) Article CARDINAL ) subparagraph ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG had to be interpreted as meaning that a judgment delivered subsequently by a court of the Member ORG of enforcement which made a provisional award of custody could not preclude enforcement of a certified judgment previously delivered by the court which had jurisdiction in the Member ORG of origin and had ordered the return of the child ; and", "( CARDINAL ) enforcement of a certified judgment [ ordering the child \u2019s return ] could not be refused by the Member State of enforcement because , as a result of a subsequent change of circumstances , it might be seriously detrimental to the best interests of the child . Such a change had to be pleaded before the court which had jurisdiction in the Member ORG of origin , which also had to hear any application to suspend the enforcement of its judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s appeal on points of law . It noted that according to the ORG \u2019s ruling the NORP courts\u2019 only task was to take the necessary steps for the enforcement of the return order , without proceeding to conduct any review of the merits of the decision . If PERSON asserted that the circumstances had changed since ORG had given its judgment , she had to apply to that court , which would also be competent to grant such an application suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that it was now for the first - instance court to enforce ORG judgment . In doing so , it had to take into account the fact that ORG had in the first place envisaged that the child should reside with her mother upon her return to GPE and had ordered the PERSON GPE social services department to make accommodation available for them . The first - instance court would therefore have to ask the applicant to submit appropriate evidence , in particular confirmation from ORG or PERSON municipal council , that accommodation was indeed available . The first - instance court would then have to order the mother to return with the child within DATE . Should she fail to comply within that time - limit , the first - instance court would , upon the applicant \u2019s request , have to order coercive measures for the child \u2019s return , while still giving the mother the opportunity to avoid such drastic measures by voluntarily returning to GPE with the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant an application by PERSON for the enforcement of its judgment of DATE to be stayed . Referring to that decision , the applicant asked the NORP ORG to order his daughter \u2019s return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that he had offered to make accommodation ( apparently a flat belonging to him ) available to ORG and his daughter , but that ORG had found that this did not fulfil the conditions set by ORG in its judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG asked the applicant to submit evidence that appropriate accommodation would be made available to his daughter and her mother by the PERSON GPE social services department , as required by ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the NORP ORG of Justice , as ORG , informed its NORP counterpart accordingly and also noted that to date the condition had not been complied with . A similar letter was sent to ORG on CARDINAL DATE . CARDINAL further letters with similar content were sent to ORG prior to DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG withdrew ORG custody rights and awarded the applicant sole custody of the child . It further ordered the child \u2019s return to GPE to reside with the applicant in PERSON . The court ordered the PERSON GPE social services department DATE if need be in co - operation with the neuropsychiatry department of the local health authority \u2013 to ensure that contact between the child and her mother was maintained and to give the child linguistic and educational support in order to assist her integration into her new family and social environment .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred to its decision of DATE , which had been aimed at preserving the child \u2019s relationship with her mother while re - establishing contact with the applicant , noting that such attempts had failed owing to a lack of co - operation from the mother . It had therefore ordered the child \u2019s return to GPE in its judgment of DATE . It further considered that PERSON had unlawfully removed the child to GPE and had subsequently deprived her of contact with the applicant without good reason . She had thus acted contrary to the child \u2019s best interests . It therefore found that sole custody was to be awarded to the applicant . Given that to date any attempts to establish contact step by step had failed , his daughter was to reside with him immediately . The court noted that this would entail a difficult transition for her , but considered that the damage caused by growing up without her father would weigh even heavier . The court considered that the social services department would have to give the child educational and linguistic support to help her settle in her new family and social environment and to maintain contact with her mother . Finally , the court considered that the child \u2019s return would not entail any grave risk of psychological or physical harm within the meaning of LAW of ORG , which in turn referred to LAW .", "CARDINAL . D.P. did not appeal against this judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant notified the NORP ORG of ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE . He also submitted a certificate of enforceability under LAW of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for enforcement of ORG order for the child \u2019s return . Referring to ORG decision of DATE , it considered that he had failed to submit proof that appropriate accommodation would be made available for the child and her mother upon their return .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He submitted , in particular , that ORG judgment of DATE had granted him sole custody of the child and had ordered her return to GPE , where she was to reside with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant \u2019s appeal and ordered PERSON to hand the child over to the applicant within DATE , noting that enforcement measures would be taken in case of failure to comply .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the condition that appropriate accommodation be made available to the child and the mother was no longer valid : in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG had awarded sole custody of the child to the applicant and had ordered that she return to reside with him . The applicant had submitted that judgment together with a certificate of enforceability under LAW of ORG . The mother \u2019s obligation to return the child to the applicant thus resulted directly from ORG judgment of DATE . Finally , ORG noted that the award of custody made by ORG on DATE could not prevent the enforcement of ORG judgment . The latter had retained its competence to rule on custody matters , as PERSON had unlawfully removed the child to GPE and the applicant had made a timely request for her return under LAW .", "CARDINAL . D.P. did not comply with the return order . She lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law with ORG .", "DATE . On DATE ORG rejected PERSON \u2019s extraordinary appeal on points of law , as the case did not raise an important legal issue . It noted that the return order had become final and was enforceable . The first - instance court now had no other task than to define the steps to be taken to enforce the return order . The ORG had clarified that where there was a certificate of enforceability under LAW , the requested court had to proceed with the enforcement of the main judgment . Any questions relating to the merits of the return decision , in particular the question whether the requirements for ordering a return had been met , had to be raised before the courts of the requesting ORG in accordance with the laws of that ORG . Consequently , any change in circumstances affecting the issue of whether a return would endanger the child \u2019s well - being had to be raised before the competent court of the requesting ORG . PERSON \u2019s argument that the child \u2019s return would lead to serious harm for her and entail a violation of LAW was therefore not relevant in the proceedings before the NORP courts , but rather had to be raised before the competent NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Leoben ORG held that it was not competent to conduct the enforcement proceedings and transferred the case to ORG , apparently on account of a change of residence by PERSON and the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Wiener ORG issued a decision on the next steps to be taken in the enforcement proceedings . The judge noted , in particular , that a continuation of the path chosen by both parents , namely the use of the child in the conflict between them , would lead to the child being traumatised , especially if the GPE unbending position eventually led to an enforcement of the return order by coercive measures as a last resort . He noted that the best interests of the child required the parents to reach a workable compromise . The judge therefore proposed that a hearing in the presence of both parents be held in order to seek a constructive solution . Accordingly , he asked both parents to indicate within DATE whether they were ready to take part in the proposed hearing . The judge further noted that if the parents were not willing to take part in the hearing , the enforced return of the child would be arranged . In this connection , the judge stated that any trauma suffered by the child because of such enforcement would then have to be laid at the door of the parents . Moreover , the applicant would be required to find a way to deal with the trauma caused to the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed GPE that he was not ready to take part in a hearing with the child \u2019s mother , but wanted to arrange the return of the child with the least traumatic impact possible . He therefore suggested that he come to GPE with his parents to pick up the child or , alternatively , that PERSON travel to GPE with the child to hand her over . He therefore asked PERSON to either set a pick - up date in GPE or to inform him of a date when she would bring the child to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON informed ORG that she was ready to take part in the proposed hearing . She also informed the court that she had appealed against the decision which had transferred the case from ORG to GPE . Consequently , the decision establishing the latter court \u2019s competence had not become final . She therefore asked the court to await the decision on her appeal before taking any further steps .", "CARDINAL . In the related case brought before ORG by the mother of the child ( GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , the ORG granted a request for interim measures on DATE . It asked the Government to stay the child \u2019s return to GPE . Having obtained information from the NORP and NORP ORG and from the applicants , the ORG lifted the interim measure on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel requested that the enforcement proceedings be continued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Wiener ORG decided to continue the enforcement proceedings and , on DATE , requested that the parties submit their views within DATE in order to reach a comprehensive solution for the benefit of the child . According to the Government , the applicant refused to contribute to that process .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the Wiener ORG ordered GPE to hand over the child to the applicant by DATE and stated that in case of failure to comply coercive measures would be applied . ORG noted that it was for PERSON to choose whether she would accompany her daughter to GPE or whether she would set a date within that timeframe for the applicant to pick up the child in GPE . Furthermore , ORG , referring to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , repeated that it was for the NORP courts to examine any issues relating to the child \u2019s well - being . It noted finally that the deadline for handing over the child had been set in such a way as to allow her to finish DATE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . As PERSON did not comply with the order to hand over the child , an attempt to enforce it by means of coercive measures was made in TIME of DATE without prior notice . The attempt , in which the judge , trained bailiffs and police officers participated , was unsuccessful , as PERSON and the child were not present at their place of residence . The applicant had been informed of the planned enforcement and was present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON asked ORG to stay the enforcement of its judgment of DATE . Furthermore , she sought an award of sole custody in her favour . She alleged that she had not been adequately heard in the initial proceedings . Furthermore , she asserted that there had been a change of circumstances , in that her daughter was fully integrated into her living environment in GPE and had formed bonds with ORG family , consisting of her mother , the latter \u2019s partner and her younger CARDINAL - brother . There had been no contact between father and child for a lengthy period and the child had no knowledge of NORP . PERSON submitted an expert opinion , according to which the child \u2019s return to her father through the use of coercive measures would cause serious harm to the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Wiener ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s application for a stay of enforcement , but decided to provisionally refrain from returning the child until ORG gave a decision on PERSON \u2019s action before it .", "CARDINAL . In his observations of CARDINAL DATE the applicant claimed that he had not yet been duly notified of the fresh proceedings before ORG . The Government , in their submissions of DATE , stated that the proceedings were pending before the NORP courts and that the parties had been notified of the dates of hearings . Moreover , the ORG submitted that the applicant had not taken advantage of numerous opportunities to re - establish communication between himself and his daughter .", "CARDINAL . According to information provided by the applicant in a letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held hearings in DATE in the presence of both parents and fixed a series of meetings between the applicant and his daughter . A number of meetings took place DATE at intervals of DATE in GPE and then in DATE in GPE . The mother of the child was present at the meetings and on some occasions also her partner . The applicant alleges that on CARDINAL occasions the mother \u2019s partner threatened him and disrupted the meetings . According to the applicant meetings which had been scheduled for DATE and DATE did not take place as the mother refused to bring the child to GPE . ORG held a further hearing on DATE and scheduled further meetings in GPE between the applicant and his daughter for DATE and DATE . The proceedings before the NORP courts are still pending ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
