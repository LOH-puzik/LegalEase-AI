Since the facts of the case were disputed , particularly concerning the events in or around DATE , ORG conducted an investigation , with the assistance of the parties , and accepted documentary evidence , including written statements and oral evidence taken from CARDINAL witnesses : the applicant ; PERSON , previous muhtar of ORG ; PERSON , the wife of PERSON ; PERSON , who had been detained at ORG provincial gendarmerie headquarters from DATE to DATE ; PERSON , who had been gendarmerie commander of ORG in DATE and had commanded the operation at ORG on DATE ; PERSON , a villager from ORG ; PERSON , public prosecutor in GPE from DATE ; PERSON , the ORG central station commander at ORG district gendarmerie headquarters from DATE to DATE ; PERSON , the gendarme responsible for keeping the custody records at ORG provincial gendarmerie headquarters since DATE ; PERSON , a gendarme who had served at GPE station from DATE to DATE ; and PERSON , the brother of the imam who had been kidnapped with CARDINAL teachers from PERSON .", "A further CARDINAL witnesses had been summoned but did not appear : PERSON , ORG public prosecutor in DATE ; Colonel PERSON , ORG provincial gendarmerie commander ; PERSON , who was alleged by the applicant to have seen his brother in detention at GPE ; PERSON , the father of the applicant and PERSON ; PERSON and PERSON , who had both been detained at ORG provincial gendarmerie headquarters from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . It appeared that PERSON had died prior to the hearing . The Government claimed that they were unable to locate the witness FAC for the hearing in DATE despite the fact that they had been provided with information from the applicant that he was detained in FAC . The Government stated that FAC was served with the summons for the hearing to take place before the delegates on DATE but that he refused to sign the acknowledgment of service and was released from prison on DATE . The Government failed to provide the Commission with any explanation as to the timing and reason for his release . PERSON had informed the ORG by letter that he had no direct or indirect knowledge of the incident and that he did not consider himself obliged to attend . At the hearing in DATE , ORG explained to the delegates that they were unable to require public prosecutors to attend , nor could they oblige a senior officer such as PERSON to attend either .", "The ORG made a finding in its report ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) that the ORG had fallen short of their obligations under former LAW CARDINAL ( a ) of the LAW to furnish all the necessary facilities to the Commission in its task of establishing the facts . It referred to", "( i ) the Government \u2019s failure to provide the ORG \u2019s delegates with the opportunity to view original custody records ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ;", "( ii ) the Government \u2019s failure to facilitate the attendance of the witness FAC ;", "( iii ) the Government \u2019s failure to secure the attendance of the witnesses PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the oral evidence , the ORG was aware of the difficulties attached to assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters . It therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance which should be attributed to the statements made by witnesses appearing before its delegates .", "In a case where there were contradictory and conflicting factual accounts of events , the Commission particularly regretted the absence of a thorough domestic judicial examination . It was aware of its own limitations as a first - instance tribunal of fact . In addition to the problem of language adverted to above , there was also an inevitable lack of detailed and direct familiarity with the conditions pertaining in the region . Moreover , the Commission had no power to compel witnesses to appear and testify . In the present case , while CARDINAL witnesses had been summoned to appear , CARDINAL gave evidence . The lack of documentary materials is adverted to above . The Commission was therefore faced with the difficult task of determining events in the absence of potentially significant testimony and evidence .", "The Commission \u2019s findings may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . GPE was in a district where terrorist activity was intense in DATE . On or about DATE , members of the ORG kidnapped CARDINAL teachers , an imam and the imam \u2019s brother , PERSON , from the village of PERSON and marched them across country , passing near the village of GPE . PERSON was required to shelter CARDINAL of the teachers , who was of NORP origin , TIME before allowing him to leave . The ORG shot and killed CARDINAL teachers and the imam , while PERSON , though wounded , was able to reach safety . He gave the gendarmes at ORG gendarmerie headquarters descriptions of the persons whom he had seen , including the villagers who had brought food and stood guard . ORG was a village under the jurisdiction of ORG gendarmes . The kidnap victims had also passed close to the village of ORG , QUANTITY from GPE , but which was under the jurisdiction of the ORG gendarmes .", "CARDINAL . ORG The gendarmes from ORG and ORG conducted a coordinated operation on DATE . This operation concerned the collecting of evidence and information relating to the kidnapping and murder and the apprehension of persons suspected of involvement . PERSON was in command of the gendarmes from ORG . The operation order drawn up by him on DATE indicated that the purpose of the operation was the capture of ORG terrorists and their collaborators and the destruction of shelters , and it named PERSON as the place of the operation . The Commission rejected the testimony of ORG that they were not looking for PERSON when they went to ORG . The delegates assessed his evidence as evasive and unhelpful , and demonstrating a lack of sincerity . The Commission had regard to the evidence from CARDINAL other gendarmes that PERSON was already wanted by the authorities in relation to suspected ORG involvement before this operation and found that in all probability the ORG gendarmes went to ORG with the intention of locating and apprehending PERSON in relation to the kidnapping incident .", "CARDINAL . The Commission assessed the evidence of the witnesses from the village , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , who stated that they saw PERSON being taken from the village by the gendarmes , as being on the whole consistent , credible and convincing . They found the ORG \u2019s objections to their credibility to be unfounded on examination . Accordingly , the ORG found that when the gendarmes arrived in ORG on DATE , PERSON attempted to hide but was found and taken from the village in custody by the ORG gendarmes . Meanwhile , in GPE , the ORG gendarmes took into detention CARDINAL individuals , PERSON , PERSON and ORG .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , PERSON and Tahsin Demirba\u015f were taken to ORG gendarmerie headquarters where they spent TIME . They were not entered into the custody records . DATE , on DATE , they were taken to ORG provincial gendarmerie headquarters , where entries in the custody record stated that they had been detained on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG gendarmerie station custody record made no entry on CARDINAL DATE with respect to PERSON . Nor did the copies of the entries for the period DATE at the ORG provincial gendarmerie headquarters . The ORG examined in detail the entries for both . It found disturbing discrepancies . In particular , it found that entries were not in sequential or chronological order ; that all the entries in the ORG custody record were in the same handwriting ; and that the number of persons recorded as detained in ORG exceeded the officially available number of cells . This gave rise , inter alia , to a strong suspicion that entries were not made contemporaneously . The oral explanations of PERSON , who was responsible for the ORG provincial gendarmerie records , were found by the ORG to be highly unsatisfactory , indicating that an entry in the register did not necessarily indicate the physical presence of a suspect and that no entries were made to reflect the movements of suspects in and out of the custody area . It concluded that the record did not constitute an accurate or comprehensive record of the persons who might have been detained over that period and the absence of PERSON name in the ORG and ORG records was not sufficient to prove that he had not been taken into custody .", "CARDINAL . The Commission accepted the oral evidence of PERSON , who stated that while he was detained at ORG provincial gendarmerie headquarters he saw and spoke to PERSON , who was detained over a period of DATE in the same room . It also accepted his evidence that PERSON looked in a bad condition , with dried blood on his clothes , and that PERSON had told him that he had been beaten , CARDINAL of his ribs broken , his head split open and that he had been given electric shocks twice . Supporting evidence for the fact that PERSON had been detained and ill - treated was to be found in the written statement of PERSON , taken by the ORG .", "The Commission gave consideration to the written statements made by PERSON and relied on by the Government as undermining his oral testimony . It found the first statement taken from PERSON by a police officer on DATE to be a brief and imprecise denial . The statement taken by a public prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE was also brief and contained contradictory and ambiguous phrasing . It concluded that this statement was not a full and frank reflection of PERSON testimony and did not destroy the credibility of his evidence to the delegates . It accordingly found it established that PERSON was taken after his apprehension at ORG to ORG where he spent TIME CARDINAL DATE and that he was transferred to ORG provincial gendarmerie headquarters where he was last seen by PERSON on or DATE when the latter was released .", "CARDINAL . The Commission made no findings as to the allegation made by the applicant that PERSON was taken from ORG provincial gendarmerie headquarters to ORG and from ORG to GPE gendarmerie station . These allegations were based on oral statements made to the applicant by PERSON , who did not appear before the delegates and who had not produced any written statement . While there were some supporting elements , the ORG found that the evidence failed to reach the requisite standard of proof .", "CARDINAL . The family of PERSON were not informed of his alleged death in a clash between the ORG and the security forces on CARDINAL to DATE . Although Colonel PERSON had been requested to provide the authorities with information as to the whereabouts of PERSON , he made no official report as to the alleged finding of PERSON identity card on the body of CARDINAL of the dead terrorists at FAC . The first report as to the finding of the identity card was made by the ORG gendarmes , who had been passed information that the clash had occurred , accompanied by unspecified documents , by Colonel GPE . There were however no documents provided to the Commission relating to the identification of the body or release of the body for burial . The Commission was not prepared to find it established that PERSON was killed as alleged or that his body was amongst those found at PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that the applicant and his father , PERSON , made petitions and enquiries to ORG prosecutor at ORG in relation to the disappearance of PERSON . The only steps taken by the authorities were to verify whether the ORG records contained the name of PERSON and for an enquiry to be sent to the ORG public prosecutor , who examined his records .", "CARDINAL . Following communication of the application to the ORG , further enquiries were made by the ORG and ORG public prosecutors . Statements were taken from PERSON , PERSON and the applicant . The addresses of ORG and PERSON were not discovered . ORG found that the ORG public prosecutor made enquiries from the ORG district gendarmerie as to their alleged apprehension of PERSON but that he did not inspect the original custody record . Nor was any inspection carried out by a public prosecutor of the ORG provincial gendarmerie custody records . No steps were taken to verify the information submitted by the ORG district gendarmerie that PERSON was amongst the dead terrorists at PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In reaching his decision of lack of jurisdiction of DATE , the ORG public prosecutor had available to him the statements taken from PERSON , PERSON and the applicant and the information from the ORG gendarmerie with regard to the alleged discovery of PERSON body . He also may have had documents relating to the applicant \u2019s application to the ORG and copies of custody records .", "CARDINAL . The Government have not submitted in their memorial any details on domestic legal provisions which have a bearing on the circumstances of this case . The ORG refers to the overview of domestic law derived from previous submissions in other cases , in particular the PERSON v.
