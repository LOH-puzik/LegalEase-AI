The applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . After the dissolution of GPE , the land and property of the former collective farms ( kolkhozes ) were divided among the villagers who had been members of the collective farms . In some localities new collective farms were formed , to which the villagers contributed their land and other goods inherited from the former collective farms . The collective farms were headed by leaders . In some cases the villagers worked in the collective farms , whereas in other cases they merely received a part of the revenue of the farm at DATE . At the time of the events in question , the applicant was a member of such a collective farm and had a tense relationship with its leader , GPE , whom he suspected of abusing his position . It does not appear that the applicant and PERSON had an employer - employee relationship .", "CARDINAL . In DATE during a local election campaign , the applicant , who was a member of the electoral staff of CARDINAL of the candidates , wrote a letter to the President of GPE , the Speaker of ORG and the local ORG which was critical of ORG , who was also a candidate for the position of mayor of their village . In the letter , the applicant accused ORG of numerous abuses . The applicant requested that the ORG authorities intervene in order to solve the problems of : ( i ) access to a lake and pasture on the part of local villagers ; and ( ii ) PERSON 's abusive behaviour .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE TIME initiated civil defamation proceedings against the applicant and claimed compensation of CARDINAL lei ( ORG ) . He argued , in particular , that the following passages from the applicant 's letter had been defamatory of him :", "\u201c [ CARDINAL ] ORG who , as a matter of coincidence , was the leader of the collective farm is shameless ... [ CARDINAL ] He has no education and only attended primary school ... He obtained false diplomas and can not even read properly ... [ CARDINAL ] He illegally possesses shares in the collective farm ... [ CARDINAL ] The property [ of the collective farm ] which was gathered by the people over a very long period of time is now used by shameless people . [ CARDINAL ] He has guns and threatens people with them ... \u201d", "ORG also submitted that the applicant had been spreading such rumours in the village and that because of this he had lost the elections for the position of mayor .", "CARDINAL . In his written defence before ORG , the applicant rejected PERSON 's accusations and stated that the information concerning ORG 's education and diplomas had been provided to him and to many other villagers by a person named GPE and that it had been common knowledge in the village . As to GPE 's reading skills , the applicant submitted that all the members of the collective farm could confirm that ORG had had difficulty reading a text during a meeting . As to ORG 's threatening people with guns , the applicant stated by way of example that during a village festival GPE had fired twice from a gun into the air in order to intimidate CARDINAL people . As to the allegation that ORG had abusively limited the villagers ' access to the lake , the applicant submitted that a court had deprived GPE of possession of the lake in the interim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found in favour of ORG and ordered the applicant to pay him MDL CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage and MDL CARDINAL for costs and expenses . The judgment was upheld by ORG but quashed by ORG , which ordered a fresh examination of the case . In so doing , ORG instructed the inferior courts to determine : ( i ) when and on exactly which occasion the impugned expressions were made by the applicant ; and ( ii ) whether the impugned expressions had constituted value judgments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again found in favour of ORG and ordered the applicant to pay him MDL CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage and MDL CARDINAL for costs and expenses .", "The court heard several witnesses , who declared that they had heard the applicant spreading the impugned rumours among the villagers . The applicant objected and argued that all the witnesses put forward by ORG had been his relatives . The applicant also submitted that the impugned statements had only been made in the letter addressed to ORG , the President and the Speaker of ORG .", "On the basis of the evidence before it , the court found the impugned passage from the letter of DATE to be defamatory . It did not find the applicant guilty of spreading the impugned statements by any other means . The court found the first statement to be false and defamatory because ORG had been legally elected as the leader of the collective farm . The court also held the second statement to be defamatory because ORG had been able to present a diploma from a university in GPE . In so far as the third statement was concerned , in declaring it defamatory the court relied on a letter of ORG in reply to the applicant 's letter of DATE , in which ORG stated that ORG 's title to the shares was legitimate . As to the fourth statement , the court found that since ORG had been the leader of the collective farm , he had had the right to administer its property and , therefore , the statement \u201c used by shameless people \u201d was defamatory of ORG Finally , the court also found the last statement to be defamatory on the basis of a document issued by the police , according to which ORG did not possess any registered guns . The court did not refer in its reasoning to the submissions of a witness put forward by the applicant , who claimed to have been threatened with a gun by GPE In calculating the compensation for the non - pecuniary damage suffered by GPE , the court held that the fact that the impugned letter had been written during the election campaign and that the applicant had been a member of the electoral staff of the candidate running against GPE in the elections were aggravating factors on the part of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed and submitted , inter alia , a document issued by ORG of his village , according to which ORG 's use of a barn belonging to the collective farm had not had a legal basis . The applicant also attached to his appeal a letter from ORG indicating that a criminal investigation was pending against ORG in respect of his possession of a false diploma . It appears that in DATE the mayor 's office of the applicant 's village had made an inquiry of the university in GPE which ORG had stated that he had graduated from . According to a letter signed by the president of the university dated DATE , no person named PERSON had graduated from that university in DATE indicated on ORG 's diploma . It is not clear from the parties ' submissions whether this document was part of the case file in the defamation proceedings . It would appear that it was part of the case file in the criminal proceedings pending against GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . The court held , inter alia , that the pending criminal proceedings against GPE for possession of a false diploma were not a sufficient ground for quashing the judgment of the first - instance court . Only a final judgment finding ORG guilty which had been adopted before the impugned letter had been written would have justified such an accusation being made against him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law and reiterated , inter alia , that his letter of DATE had not been made public but rather had only been sent to a limited number of people .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG but reduced the amount awarded in respect of compensation for non - pecuniary damage from MDL CARDINAL to MDL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Every person has the right to the respect for his or her honour , dignity and professional reputation .", "( CARDINAL ) Every person has the right to request the renunciation of information which affects his or her honour , dignity and professional reputation if the person circulating such information can not prove that it corresponds to reality .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) Where information which affects a person 's honour , dignity and professional reputation is circulated in a mass medium , the court shall order [ that medium ] to publish a disclaimer in the same column , page , programme or series of programmes , within a maximum of DATE of the date of entry into force of the court judgment .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) A person whose rights and lawful interests have been violated by a publication in a mass medium has the right to publish a reply in the medium in question , at the latter 's expense .", "( CARDINAL) Every person about whom information has been published [ thereby ] violating his or her honour , dignity and professional reputation has the right to request compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage in addition to the publication of a renunciation . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
