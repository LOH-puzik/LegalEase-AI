As relevant to the case before the ORG , it included the following reasoning :", "\u201c I have been informed by the governor of ORG that the person concerned has played an active part in the uprising on DATE in FAC . The person concerned ( was among those who ) created the uprising . He displayed inflammatory behaviour and repeatedly incited other detainees to rise up . He has refused to follow instructions given by staff and has encouraged others to do the same . He has forced the staff in a threatening way to release detainees who had been already locked in . The staff has complied in order to prevent further escalation . The person concerned has seriously intimidated the staff and seriously endangered order and security . The person has been placed in a regular remand centre for operational reasons in view of the disturbance he has caused in the GPE detention centre , his prison history ( which has also led to his being declared an undesirable alien ( ongewenste vreemdeling ) ) , and because he escaped from the GPE detention centre on DATE .", "In taking a placement or transfer decision I may reasonably trust the relevant information given me by the governor of the institution .

On DATE the applicant , through his lawyer , appealed against the latter decision to ORG . As relevant to the case before the ORG , he denied any wrongdoing ; he complained of failures to hear staff of the GPE detention centre and fellow detainees as witnesses and of the failure to make videotaped recordings of the incident available for viewing .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision on DATE . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . As to the fact that the applicant \u2019s placement in the remand centre within \u201c PERSON \u201d DATE had not been based on any decision , ORG took note of the governor \u2019s letter of DATE recognising that fact ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and referred the applicant to the governor of the GPE detention centre himself for the compensation to which he was entitled .
