ORG Mr. PERSON , a NORP national born in DATE , was in custody in FAC when he applied to the Commission .", "DATE , he was convicted of a number of offences . In DATE , he was sentenced to a DATE \u2019s imprisonment for , among other things , extortion with menaces ( r\u00e4uberische GPE ) ; the sentence was suspended , however , and he was put on probation ( Bew\u00e4hrung ) for DATE . In DATE , ORG passed on him an aggregate sentence of DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 immediate imprisonment , thereby combining his last CARDINAL sentences .", "CARDINAL . ORG Earlier , on DATE , the applicant had been arrested and then , on DATE , detained on remand ; according to the warrant for his arrest issued by ORG , he was suspected of extortion with menaces on CARDINAL occasions and of having caused actual bodily harm ( PERSON ) and committed a rape . On DATE , he had been indicted ( angeklagt ) for these offences before ORG ( CARDINAL . ORG ) of ORG ( Landgericht ) .", "According to the prosecution , Mr. PERSON had", "( i ) in a restaurant on DATE , threatened to use force against a customer - namely to lie in wait for him CARDINAL night , break his bones and shoot him dead with a revolver - and by this means extorted DM CARDINAL from him and demanded a further DM CARDINAL , to be paid on DATE ;", "( ii ) on DATE , punched Mr. PERSON a distant relative of his , in the face , injuring him ;", "( iii ) at his lodgings in Bad ORG on DATE , taken from Mr. PERSON \u2019s wife - whom he was temporarily accommodating , together with her husband , as they had nowhere to live - all her cash , amounting to DM CARDINAL , by threatening to kill her ; and", "( iv ) subsequently , after threatening that he would otherwise beat her up and kill her , sexually abused Mrs. PERSON while her husband was asleep under the influence of drink .", "CARDINAL . ORG During the trial on DATE , ORG stayed the proceedings in respect of the first CARDINAL charges under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on the ground that the sentence which the defendant could expect was \" almost negligible \" ( nicht betr\u00e4chtlich ins MONEY ) compared with the sentence he was likely to be given if convicted on the other charges .", "On DATE , ORG convicted Mr. PERSON of the crime ( Verbrechen ) of extortion with menaces and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ; it acquitted him on the rape charge .", "The court found that the defendant had given Mr. and Mrs. K shelter . On DATE , the couple had drawn DM CARDINAL in welfare benefits . After buying food , they had spent TIME with the applicant and had had a few drinks at his home . After Mr. PERSON had fallen asleep , Mr. PERSON made Mrs. PERSON give him DM CARDINAL , threatening that he would kill her if she refused . DATE , the couple reported the matter to the police . As regards the allegation of rape , the court found , having regard to a medical report , that it could not be ruled out that the victim , who was mentally handicapped , had not shown her will to resist clearly enough for it to be noticed by the applicant .", "The acquittal became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON appealed on points of law against conviction ; he filed full pleadings on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) set the judgment aside and remitted the case for retrial by a different criminal chamber of ORG . It found that ORG had not heard evidence from a parish priest whom , according to the defence , Mrs. PERSON had told that she had consented to sexual intercourse with the applicant . ORG held that despite the applicant \u2019s acquittal on the rape charge , the witness should have been heard because his evidence might have put Mrs. PERSON \u2019s credibility in doubt in respect of all the charges .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the priest informed the police that he could not give evidence unless Mrs. K released him from his obligation of professional confidentiality . Mrs. K , who had left her husband in the meantime , refused to do this .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the public prosecutor \u2019s office applied for the proceedings to be stayed under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , as the sentence Mr. PERSON could expect was almost negligible in comparison with the one passed on him in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Having been invited to make any comments he might have , the defence counsel assigned by the court , Mr. PERSON , informed ORG on DATE that he could agree on the defendant \u2019s behalf to Mr. PERSON \u2019s bearing his own necessary costs and expenses ( notwendige PERSON ) but that his client had no intention of forgoing compensation for his detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG stayed the proceedings under LAW ; it ordered that the costs of the proceedings - but not Mr. PERSON \u2019s necessary costs and expenses - should be borne by the ORG , and it refused to award the applicant any compensation in respect of his arrest on DATE and of his detention on remand from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "The reasons for the decision ( PERSON ) included the following :", "\" ...", "The costs of the proceedings shall be borne by the ORG , pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , but the court will not order the ORG to pay the defendant \u2019s necessary costs and expenses . Counsel for Mr. PERSON stated on his client \u2019s behalf that he - Mr. PERSON - agreed to bear these . Moreover , it would have been fair , having regard to all the circumstances of the case , to order the person convicted to pay his own necessary costs and expenses . The same reasons are relevant here as justify the refusal of compensation for the time spent in detention on remand .", "Mr. PERSON made known through his counsel that he was not prepared to forgo [ such ] compensation ... He can not , however , claim compensation for the time he spent in detention on remand in the instant case . In the light of the course of the trial so far , the circumstances rebutting the presumption of innocence are , in the view of the ORG , so overwhelming that a conviction is clearly more likely than an acquittal ( PERSON bisherigen GPE \u00fcberwiegen nach GPE der Kammer die ORG , welche die PERSON entkr\u00e4ften , derart , dass eine GPE deutlich wahrscheinlicher ist als ein Freispruch ) . Furthermore , Mr. PERSON - even if he were acquitted - could not be compensated for his detention , since it was his own actions that gave rise to the strong suspicion that he had committed an offence of extortion with menaces .", "On TIME CARDINAL DATE , [ he ] stated that Mrs. PERSON had given him MONEY , which he had spent while shopping that TIME in GPE , except for DM CARDINAL that were found at his home . After Mrs. K had said , when a statement was taken from her on TIME DATE , that Mr. PERSON had put the DM CARDINAL he had extorted from her into his swimming costume , [ he ] was searched , and a DM CARDINAL note was indeed found in his swimming costume , as [ she ] had said . Not until DATE , when the investigating judge ( Haftrichter ) questioned him , did Mr. PERSON explain how he came to have a DM CARDINAL note belonging , as he admitted , to Mrs. PERSON The reasons why that explanation is unconvincing were set out in detail by ORG in its judgment of DATE . Even if the version offered by Mr. PERSON was true , however , it has to be said against him that he himself prompted the criminal proceedings by his grossly negligent ( grob fahrl\u00e4ssig ) behaviour , for he failed to consider the obvious and elementary fact that he could be proved to have lied about the money in his possession and that this would provide evidence of the credibility of Mrs. PERSON \u2019s statements and his own lack of credibility . Compensation must therefore be refused him , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( PERSON \u00fcber die PERSON f\u00fcr GPE ) . \"", "ORG pointed out , lastly , that as no appeal lay ( PERSON ) against the order staying the proceedings , the decision on costs and on compensation for detention on remand was likewise final .", "CARDINAL .

His lawyer \u2019s pleadings consisted of a single sentence : \" On behalf of the defendant , I appeal against point III of the ... decision of CARDINAL DATE . \"", "ORG declared this appeal ( Beschwerde ) inadmissible on DATE .

It pointed out that the principle of the presumption of innocence derived from the principle of the rule of law , and it also referred to LAW ( article LAW ) of the LAW . The Convention did not have the status of constitutional law in GPE , but regard should be had to it and to the case - law of ORG in interpreting the principles and fundamental rights enshrined in LAW ) .", "Reaffirming its case - law , ORG reiterated that , by virtue of the principle of the presumption of innocence , no measures amounting in effect to a penalty may be taken against a defendant without his guilt having been established beforehand at a proper trial and no defendant may be treated as guilty . The ORG added that this principle requires that guilt be proved according to law before it can be held against the person concerned . A finding of guilt will accordingly not be legitimate for this purpose unless it is pronounced at the close of a trial which has reached the stage at which a verdict can be given .", "Citing the PERSON judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) , ORG ruled that a decision discontinuing criminal proceedings may offend the presumption of innocence if it contains in its reasoning a finding of the defendant \u2019s guilt without that guilt having been proved according to law . On the other hand , nothing precluded a court from making findings in such a decision as to the defendant \u2019s guilt and ordering him to pay the necessary costs and expenses of the complainants as well as the costs of the proceedings if it had held a hearing enabling it to reach a verdict ( ORG ) .", "On the basis of these considerations , the Constitutional Court quashed CARDINAL of the CARDINAL decisions challenged but dismissed the application in the first of the CARDINAL cases concerned , as the defence had made the closing address after a trial ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
