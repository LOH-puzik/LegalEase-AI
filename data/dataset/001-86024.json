On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against RM for manslaughter in regard to the deaths of the applicants\u2019 sons ( Article CARDINAL of LAW as then in force ) and for resisting the orders of the police ( LAW ) . The applicants submitted their civil claims and were recognised as complainants in those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE convicted RM of resisting the lawful orders of the police , an offence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The following account of the incident can be reconstructed from the evidence admitted by the court in those proceedings . On DATE , after TIME , the police received a telephone call from a private individual , informing them about a car driving in the streets of GPE in breach of various road - traffic regulations .", "CARDINAL . Officers AM and ORG submitted that they had been patrolling in police car no . CARDINAL when they had heard the information about the ORG Escort on the police radio and had unsuccessfully tried to stop it at TIME Officers AM and ORG had followed the car , but had soon lost sight of it . ORG submitted to the court that , to his knowledge , CARDINAL passengers and a driver had been in the car .", "CARDINAL . The information about the car being driven in a dangerous manner was transmitted through the control centre to other patrol officers on duty , and CARDINAL more policemen , GPE and EP , in police vehicle no . CARDINAL , were involved in the chase .", "CARDINAL . They were joined by CARDINAL more policemen , RZ , GPE and ORG , patrolling in police vehicle no . CARDINAL . These officers submitted to the court that they had received information about the car via the police radio at TIME and had followed the order to arrest the driver . They had therefore arrived as reinforcements and had joined car no . CARDINAL in chasing the ORG Escort , which was fleeing at QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . The QUANTITY police cars had their light and sound signals turned on , and tried to block the ORG Escort , while orders to stop were given over the loudspeakers . However , the car tried to escape , attempting to push the police vehicles off the road .", "CARDINAL . RZ fired CARDINAL warning shots into the air , but the car only accelerated .", "CARDINAL . A moment later , the driver of the car lost control of the vehicle , hitting the fence of a building . The car was brought to a halt . Police vehicle no . CARDINAL stopped QUANTITY behind the car , and vehicle no . CARDINAL moved to its left , trying to block its way . Suddenly , the car started moving backwards , damaging police vehicle no .

An expert medical examination later confirmed that RZ had suffered slight bodily injuries , including several scratches and bruising to his left calf .", "CARDINAL . When the car hit him , officer RZ fired a shot , apparently damaging its radiator , as he noticed that the cooling liquid was leaking .", "CARDINAL . In addition , immediately after RZ had been hit , ORG , who had left police vehicle no . CARDINAL , fired CARDINAL shot towards the car \u2019s wheels . RZ then fired several more shots towards the car as it escaped . Officer SG likewise fired a number of shots towards the fleeing car . The other policemen did not use their guns .", "CARDINAL . Soon afterwards , the car was forced to stop in another area of GPE as a result of the leak of the cooling liquid from the radiator which had been damaged by ORG shot . Police officers ORG and AM , who were driving vehicle no . CARDINAL , arrested RM while he was trying to flee . In the car , the policemen found the bodies of the applicants\u2019 sons , whose deaths were confirmed on the arrival of a medical team at TIME was found to have been drunk and not in possession of any of the relevant documents permitting him to drive a car .", "CARDINAL . The court did not specify how many shots had been fired by GPE , even though it noted that CARDINAL of his shots had caused the deaths of the applicants\u2019 sons . The court took account of GPE \u2019s statements that he had suspected that one of the passengers of the car had a weapon which he thought he had seen through the front window which was wound down , and that he had fired only after having heard a first shot ( in fact fired by his colleague PERSON ) , and having no idea where that shot had come from . The court also noted that no firearms or other weapons had been found in the car .", "CARDINAL . The court did not establish the exact time when the chase had started , concluding that the crime of which ORG was convicted had been committed at TIME", "CARDINAL . RM was acquitted of the offence of manslaughter , the court having noted that the deaths had been caused not by his acts , but by the \u201c lawful actions of a third person who had used an official weapon . \u201d The court noted in this connection :", "\u201c the internal institutional inquiry shows that all the policemen acted in a lawful and reasonable manner . The court has no grounds to doubt the conclusions of the internal investigation , as they have been confirmed by the circumstances established during the criminal investigation . LAW authorised the policemen to use firearms against the vehicle and the offender . The acts committed by the defendant , including his resisting the police officers , constituted grounds for using firearms . The use of firearms was lawful and reasonable ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 civil claims for damages against the police were not examined . The court nonetheless noted that it was open to the applicants to bring their claims by way of a separate set of civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The court sentenced ORG to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for resisting the lawful orders of the police , and ordered the confiscation of part of his property amounting to CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment . It was also decided to institute criminal proceedings against SG for the manslaughter of the applicants\u2019 sons ( LAW as then in force ) and for exceeding his authority ( LAW . In this connection , the court noted :", "\u201c in the situation under consideration , there were no circumstances permitting the use of a firearm against a person ( Article ORG ) of LAW ) . The police officers had the right to use firearms against the vehicle only ( Article PERSON ) of that Act ) . ...", "Nobody disputes that the police officer [ SG ] had the right to use a firearm against the car ( Article PERSON ) of LAW ) ; however , despite the fact that CARDINAL innocent people were shot , it has not been examined whether he used that right properly . In taking this decision , the court is seeking to establish the truth . It does not intend to weaken the determination of police officers when carrying out their duties . Nevertheless , the duty of professional integrity , self - control and endurance can not be underestimated ; when using firearms , police officers must seek to avoid severe consequences ( Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . ... The investigation should aim to examine [ the elements pointed out by the applicants ] , inter alia , the allegedly poor visibility at the scene of the incident , and the fact that [ SG ] hit the interior of the car and not its tyres , which he had allegedly fired at . According to [ the applicants ] , this fact alone indicated that [ SG ] had fired the shots while being guided by his anger and ill - temper . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings brought against SG by virtue of the decision of ORG on DATE were discontinued by the prosecutor on DATE . The prosecution found no indication of any crime in the actions of officer SG . It was noted , in particular , that SG had used his gun in accordance with instructions , had targeted the wheels of the car and had had recourse to his firearm only after the driver had committed a crime by hitting CARDINAL of his colleagues . The driver , ORG , had apparently been predisposed to escape by any means , threatening the safety of other people . The deaths of the QUANTITY victims had been the result not only of the shooting as such , but also of the unpredictable actions of the driver .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution based their conclusions , inter alia , on the following sources of evidence : the submissions of the policemen ; the records of the on - site examinations of the scene , conducted on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE ; a letter from the meteorological service on weather conditions at the time of the events ; illumination tests at the scene of the shooting ; the results of the ballistic examination of CARDINAL DATE , and records of the on - site reconstruction of the event , including diagrams of the position and movement of the cars and policemen , drawn in accordance with the submissions of the officers concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Kaunas ORG quashed the prosecutor \u2019s decision . The court noted , inter alia , that the prosecutors had not made a detailed assessment of \u201c the way \u201d in which SG had used the gun with reference to the relevant domestic legal provisions .", "CARDINAL . During the investigation , none of the policemen made clear submissions as to the moment when GPE had begun shooting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor again discontinued the investigation , noting that no evidence of any crime had been found in the actions of SG . The prosecution referred to the evidence mentioned in the earlier decision of DATE as well as the additional submissions of the policemen .", "CARDINAL . The following order and impact of the use of firearms had been established . CARDINAL warning shots had been fired into the air by RZ during the chase ; CARDINAL shot by RZ had damaged the radiator after the car had hit the fence , and soon afterwards CARDINAL shot fired by ORG had hit the wheel of the car . Finally , CARDINAL shots had been fired by RZ towards the fleeing car and CARDINAL by SG . The prosecutor found that CARDINAL of SG \u2019s shots had hit the applicants\u2019 sons , causing their deaths . Some of the other shots had marked the car \u2019s tyres , wheel rims , seats , front panel and windows , and the rear window was broken . The car body work also bore traces of bullets .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the submissions of GPE , taken at the scene of the shooting , the prosecution concluded that SG had directed the shots at the wheels of the moving car from a distance of QUANTITY ( the first shot ) up to QUANTITY ( the fourth shot ) . He had fired the shots after the driver had hit his colleague PERSON , that is , after he had committed an offence punishable by the criminal law ( LAW ) , of which he had already been convicted . Hence , it could not be alleged that the firearms had been used only because the car had been driven in defiance of traffic regulations . The prosecution took account of ORG statement that he had been hit by the car and thrown onto the bonnet and then the ground . For this reason the policemen could have reasonably considered it necessary to avert the danger which the car represented for other people , given in particular that ORG had been drunk and had been seeking by dangerous means to escape arrest and punishment .", "CARDINAL . It was stressed that SG had used the firearm not against the people in the car , but against the vehicle , and he had only tried to hit the tyres . There had been no significant obstacles to visibility , such as inadequate lighting or dust . However , the fact that the car had moved in sudden and swerving directions was emphasised as a cause of the deaths , rather than any breach of regulations governing the use of firearms . In view of these circumstances , and given that ORG had had a valid reason to use the gun as a last resort in accordance with LAW , the prosecutor concluded that there was no evidence that he had committed a crime .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the prosecution stated that , during the proceedings against ORG , none of the CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction had questioned the lawfulness of the use of the firearm by GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the decision to discontinue the investigation . They alleged that ORG had sought revenge against the driver of the car and had fired recklessly at the moving vehicle , disregarding the fact that he might hit the passengers . The applicants argued that SG had known about the presence of other people in the car and must have understood that innocent passengers might be killed ; however , he had allowed this to happen , as he had fired at the vehicle .", "CARDINAL . As to the quality of the investigation , the applicants stressed that the prosecution had failed to provide any explanation for the fact that one of the bullets fired by ORG had hit the side window of the car , whereas it had been concluded that GPE had first fired at the vehicle only after it had moved QUANTITY away .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE upheld the decision of the prosecution . The court mentioned that SG had fired at the moving car during a very a short period of time , within a perimeter of QUANTITY . The court held that SG had used the firearm lawfully , the shots being directed at the wheels of the car , not at the people sitting in it . It was found that the car had been moving in swerving directions , CARDINAL shots having , as a result , hit the passengers . SG had thus not been able to foresee the consequences of his actions . At the same time the court noted that , even though the incident had taken place at TIME , the street and the car had been well lit .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court emphasised that the ground for using firearms was the fact that RM had been driving while drunk , and had not only violated traffic regulations , but had tried to escape in a dangerous manner . His behaviour had put other people at risk . The policemen had tried all alternative means to stop RM , and firing at the tyres of the fleeing car had been used as a measure of last resort .", "CARDINAL . The court also stated that there had been no causal link between the actions of GPE and the impugned consequences , namely the death of the applicants\u2019 sons . It held that manslaughter had not occurred as a result of the actions of GPE ; he had made an appropriate assessment of the circumstances and had not exceeded the requirements of the relevant legal provisions in using his gun . The death of the applicants\u2019 sons had been an accident for which SG could not be held criminally responsible .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , as then in force , punished the act of manslaughter ( nu\u017eudymas d\u0117l neatsargumo ) .
