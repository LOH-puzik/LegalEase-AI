{"ITEMID": "001-5664", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "J.M. v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a naturalised NORP national of GPE origin , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON Schrevelius , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant entered the GPE in DATE , where he has lived since . In DATE , his wife and their CARDINAL youngest children , who until that time had lived in LOC , joined the applicant in the GPE and were granted residence permits . The applicant \u2019s CARDINAL eldest children , PERSON and PERSON , born in DATE and DATE respectively , remained in the LOC because the applicant had not sufficient means to bring them over as well . They were cared for by the applicant \u2019s parents .", "The applicant obtained GPE nationality in DATE . His wife has retained her LOC nationality . CARDINAL further children were born to the applicant and his wife in the GPE . These children have GPE nationality .", "After the death of the applicant \u2019s father in DATE , his mother came to the GPE in DATE , where she was granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds in view of her advanced age . The applicant \u2019s children PERSON and PERSON , who were still attending school , remained in LOC in the house that had formerly been inhabited by the applicant \u2019s parents . They were being cared for by a neighbour .", "On DATE , the applicant applied for a provisional residence visa ( machtiging voor voorlopig verblijf ) for his children PERSON and PERSON for the purposes of family reunification . On DATE , in accordance with the advisory opinion of the Minister of ORG , the Minister of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request on the ground that the family ties between the applicant on the one hand and PERSON and PERSON on the other had been broken .", "The applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) with the Minister for ORG against this decision on DATE . He produced his father \u2019s death certificate , his marriage certificate , his contract of employment , several pay slips , various letters received from the neighbour who was looking after PERSON and PERSON , and PERSON and PERSON \u2019s birth certificates . No translation of the neighbour \u2019s letters could be provided as they were written in an almost illegible hand and very poor NORP .", "The applicant \u2019s objection was dismissed on DATE . The Minister considered not only that the family ties between the applicant and the CARDINAL children had been broken , but also that it had not been demonstrated that the intention had been to leave them with their grandparents temporarily rather than permanently . Moreover , it did not appear that the applicant \u2019s financial situation would have prevented him from bringing PERSON and PERSON over at an earlier date than DATE . Finally , given their age and the fact that they were being cared for by their neighbour , it did not appear that their situation would be desperate if they had to remain in LOC . It would , furthermore , be possible for the applicant to support them financially from the GPE .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , which held a hearing on DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , reiterating the grounds on which the Minister for ORG had dismissed the objection . It found in addition that no satisfactory explanation had been given for the applicant \u2019s waiting DATE after bringing over his wife and his CARDINAL younger children before bringing over PERSON and PERSON as well . His financial situation could not explain this lapse of time , since it did not appear that it had improved substantially during that time . It had not been established that the applicant had maintained contact with PERSON and PERSON and had supported them financially . It had not been shown that the neighbour who had taken care of them after their grandmother had left was no longer able or willing to do so , and in view of their age they should be considered increasingly able to take care of themselves , with financial support from the GPE if need be . Insofar as living conditions in LOC were less favourable than in the GPE , this was immaterial ; in this the situation of PERSON and PERSON did not differ from that of many of their compatriots who were likewise denied residence in the GPE . While ORG accepted that \u201c family life \u201d in the sense of LAW existed between the applicants and PERSON and PERSON , it did not accept that there had been an \u201c interference \u201d with it , since the effect of the decision appealed against was not to break up the family by removing PERSON and PERSON from the GPE ; nor were the applicant \u2019s arguments sufficient to find that the GPE were under a positive obligation to grant PERSON and NORP provisional residence visas ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
