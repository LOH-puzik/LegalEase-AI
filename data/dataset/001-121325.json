She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , ORG , ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE police were informed that a man had been stabbed with a knife . At the scene , the applicant told the police officers that the victim was her partner and that she herself had inflicted the wounds . The officers found a trail of blood leading to her home , where they discovered other traces of blood and a blood - stained kitchen knife .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested DATE at TIME She was interviewed by investigators TIME and TIME as a \u201c suspect \u201d . She was not assisted by a lawyer and \u2013 she alleged DATE was not informed beforehand of her right to remain silent , but her rights as provided in the \u201c FAC \u201d of CARDINAL DATE were read to her prior to the interview . She was thus informed that her statements could be used in evidence , that she was entitled to ask for a verbatim record to be made of any questions put to her , together with her answers , and to request any supplementary investigative act or interview , that she could use any documents in her possession , provided the questioning was not delayed , and that , during or after her interview , she could have documents included in the case file or deposited in the registry . The applicant confessed to being the perpetrator of the stabbing and , in response to the ORG questions , gave a detailed account of the incident , explaining in particular that it had followed an argument , of which she described the context and circumstances .", "CARDINAL . DATE , from TIME to TIME , the applicant was questioned by an investigating judge . She was not assisted by a lawyer and \u2013 she alleged \u2013 was not informed of her right to remain silent . She confirmed the statements she had made to the police . The investigating judge then informed her that she was being charged with attempted murder , with intent , and that she had the \u201c right to choose a lawyer \u201d . He issued a detention order with the following reasoning :", "\u201c ... the offence is punishable by a DATE prison sentence , in respect of a lesser indictable offence , or by an even harsher sentence ; ... the maximum duration of the sentence exceeding a CARDINAL-year term of imprisonment ; ... the documentary evidence in the file , the findings of the reporting officers , the witness statements , and the statement and confessions of the person charged , constitute serious indications of guilt ; ... the extreme seriousness of the facts , representing a danger for public safety and entailing bodily harm , requires that a detention order be issued against the person charged ; ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appeared , assisted by her lawyer , on DATE , before ORG ( chambre du conseil ) of ORG , which found the detention order to be lawful and properly served , and remanded her in custody for DATE .", "On DATE , after a further appearance by the applicant , ORG ordered the extension of that measure . It did so once again on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG of ORG against the order of CARDINAL DATE . Referring to the PERSON v. GPE judgment ( [ ORG ] ( no . DATE ) , the GPE v. GPE judgment ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) and the PERSON v. GPE decision ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , her counsel argued that the fact that the applicant had not been assisted by a lawyer during her police interview or her examination by a judge constituted a breach of the right to a fair trial as enshrined in LAW ( c ) of the LAW , and also of LAW , under which any deprivation of liberty had to be \u201c in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law \u201d . Counsel thus submitted that the records of the interview and examination should be removed from the case - file and that the applicant should be released .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions of DATE , ORG at ORG called on ORG to dismiss those arguments . He observed , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c ... in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( P.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.F/CARDINAL ) ... , ORG noted that , having regard to all the statutory safeguards generally afforded to the person charged so as to ensure respect for the defence rights , from the time of the decision to prosecute , it could not be concluded automatically that it was definitely impossible for a person to have a fair trial when the assistance of a lawyer was lacking during the first TIME of deprivation of liberty .", "... on a number of occasions ORG has observed that neither LAW nor LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention ... , as interpreted by the ORG ... , obliges investigating divisions to discharge a detention order with immediate effect on that ground alone ( GPE . DATE , P.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.F/CARDINAL , GPE . DATE , GPE and PERSON . CARDINAL DATE , P.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.F/CARDINAL ) .", "... in a judgment of DATE , confirming its case - law ... ORG further indicated that LAW quinquies and CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , concerning the secrecy of the preliminary and judicial investigations , precluded the presence of a lawyer at that stage ( P.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.F/CARDINAL ) .", "... at no stage of the proceedings did the defendant ask to be assisted by a lawyer ...", "... furthermore , the decision [ ORG v. GPE ] ... sums up the lessons of the PERSON judgment but finds that the application is inadmissible , as the proceedings have to be considered as a whole ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG agreed with ORG on that point , finding that \u201c [ his ] submissions ... fully address[ed ] the arguments for the defence as to the absence of a lawyer during the defendant \u2019s questioning \u201d . It nevertheless ordered the applicant \u2019s release on the ground that public safety no longer required that she be detained .", "CARDINAL . According to the information provided by the parties , the judicial investigation is still pending and the case is not yet ready for trial .", "CARDINAL . In the above - cited PERSON case , where the applicant had complained of being prevented from having contact with his lawyer before his examination by the investigating judge , the ORG found that the refusal to allow contact had been \u201c explained by the applicable law as it [ stood ] , namely section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON of DATE [ on pre - trial detention ] , which [ did ] not provide for assistance by counsel during questioning by the investigating judge or prior thereto \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Sections DATE and CARDINAL of the Law of DATE on pre - trial detention read as follows :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL . NORP In cases of absolute necessity for public safety alone , and if the act is punishable by a DATE prison sentence , in respect of a lesser indictable offence , or by an even harsher sentence , the investigating judge may make a detention order ...", "\u00a7 CARDINAL . Unless the person charged is a fugitive or is evading arrest , the investigating judge shall , before making a detention order , question the person [ on the acts constituting the charges and potentially justifying a detention order ] and hear his or her observations . Failure to question the person charged shall entail his or her release .", "The investigating judge shall also inform the person charged of the possibility of an order being made for his or her detention and shall hear his or her observations on that matter . Failure to satisfy these conditions shall entail the person \u2019s release . ... \u201d", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL . NORP Immediately after the first examination , the person charged may communicate freely with counsel . ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG has , on a number of occasions , been called upon to examine \u2013 both in disputes concerning pre - trial detention and in appeals on points of law against appellate judgments on the merits \u2013 legal argument alleging a violation of LAW ( c ) of the LAW on the ground that the suspect had not received assistance from a lawyer during his or her police custody or while being questioned by the police or investigating judge .", "For a long time that court took the view that , although NORP law did not provide for the presence of a lawyer to assist a suspect when he or she was deprived of liberty , this did not automatically entail a violation of the right to a fair trial . In the court \u2019s opinion , the restriction had to be assessed in the light of all the statutory safeguards generally afforded to the accused so as to ensure respect for his or her defence rights from the time of the decision to prosecute : formalities for the suspect \u2019s examination under LAW ; the brevity of the statutory police custody period ( TIME ) ; the immediate remittance to the person charged , when served with a detention order , of all the documents referred to in sections ORG ) and CARDINAL ) of the PERSON of DATE ; the right of the person charged to communicate immediately with counsel in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of that law ; access to the case file prior to his or her appearance before the investigating judge , as provided for by section ORG ) of that law ; the presence of counsel for the charged person during the recapitulation interview provided for in section GPE ) of that law ; and the rights granted , in particular , by ORG CARDINAL ter , CARDINAL , CARDINAL quinquies , CARDINAL and CARDINAL bis of LAW . The court found that this series of safeguards prevented the absence of counsel during the first TIME of deprivation of liberty from irretrievably compromising the fair handling of the case ( see , for example , the judgments of CARDINAL May and DATE , P.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.F/CARDINAL and P.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.N/CARDINAL ) .", "However , in a judgment of DATE ( ORG ) , ORG quashed , for a violation of LAW , a trial court decision that relied on self - incriminating statements given to the police during police custody without any possibility of assistance by a lawyer . It found , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c ... The right to a fair trial , as enshrined in LAW ... , implies that the person arrested or held at the disposal of the courts should have the effective assistance of a lawyer", "In so far as it allows such access to a lawyer only after the first examination by the investigating judge , section CARDINAL , first paragraph , of the PERSON of DATE on pre - trial detention must be regarded as incompatible with LAW .", "The fairness of a criminal trial should be assessed in the light of the proceedings as a whole , ascertaining whether the defence rights have been upheld , examining whether the person charged has had the possibility of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use , verifying whether the circumstances in which evidence for the prosecution has been obtained cast doubt on its credibility or accuracy , and assessing the influence of any unlawfully obtained evidence on the outcome of the criminal proceedings . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has further found that Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) of the Convention do not oblige investigating divisions to discharge a detention order with immediate effect on the sole ground that prior to his or her examination by the investigating judge the person charged had been interviewed by the police and had given a confession to them without being allowed access to counsel from the very first questioning ( see , for example , the judgments of DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , P.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.F/CARDINAL , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL .
