The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is an engineer . In DATE he was the head of a ORG - owned power distribution company called Moldtranselectro .", "CARDINAL . The background to this case lies in a series of complex contractual arrangements made in DATE concerning importation of electricity from GPE to GPE and involving , in addition to Moldtranselectro , a NORP ORG - owned power distribution company , a NORP private company and a NORP private company called ORG ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .

On DATE Moldtranselectro wrote a letter to ORG asking it to issue a ORG bond with a value of MDL CARDINAL in favour of ORG . The letter was signed by the applicant in his capacity as head of Moldtranselectro .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a ORG bond valued at MDL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL as of CARDINAL DATE ) in favour of ORG , payable by DATE . The ORG bond provided that ORG Plus had to present it to ORG at least DATE before the date of payment . It also provided that Moldtranselectro had to present , by that date , to ORG , documents proving the supply of electricity to state institutions .", "CARDINAL . Oferta Plus presented the ORG bond to ORG DATE before the date of payment . However , the latter refused to pay , on the ground that Moldtranselectro had failed to submit evidence concerning the payment by FAC for the imported electricity .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG Plus initiated civil proceedings against both ORG and Moldtranselectro . ORG defended the action on the grounds set out in paragraph CARDINAL above while Moldtranselectro declined all responsibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found in favour of ORG and confirmed its right to be paid MDL CARDINAL by ORG , in accordance with the ORG bond .

On DATE the Government Agent informed ORG about ORG application to the ORG concerning the non - enforcement of the final judgments in its favour and requested it to \u201c take all the necessary steps in order to avoid a finding of a violation against the ORG by the ORG , with the consequent impairment of the country 's image \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote to ORG , informing it , inter alia , that it considered the judgment in favour of ORG Plus to be unlawful , but that it had complied with it partially so that ORG Plus would not complain to the ORG . ORG had informed it that ORG had already complained to the ORG . The ORG asked ORG for advice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote to ORG as follows :", "\u201c ... during the proceedings [ between ORG Plus , Moldtranselectro and ORG ] ORG and Moldtranselectro presented invoices for ORG CARDINAL , of which by DATE only ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL had been paid .", "No other evidence as to the extent to which ORG had fulfilled its obligations under the agreement [ of DATE ] has been presented . Despite this the courts ruled in its favour .", "In that respect ORG has ordered an audit to verify the supply of electricity and the payments between ORG , Moldtranselectro and state institutions . A final decision will be adopted by ORG after the results of the audit become available to it and ORG will be informed accordingly . \u201d", "An attempt to carry out this audit was made in DATE by a representative of ORG at the request of ORG .

On DATE the ORG communicated the case of ORG Plus to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General quashed the decision of DATE . He submitted , inter alia , that on DATE Moldtranselectro 's debt to the applicant company for the electricity supplied had been MDL MONEY . He argued that while ORG had paid the NORP partner more than MDL CARDINAL for the electricity supplied to Moldtranselectro , it appeared that the energy for which it had paid had not been supplied exclusively to state institutions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was declared a suspect in the criminal proceedings . In particular he was accused of having written the letter of DATE to ORG asking it to issue a ORG bond in favour of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) while knowing that the energy supplied to Moldtranselectro , for which the ORG bond was to be issued , had not been consumed by state institutions as stipulated in the Government 's Decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On the same date PERSON was indicted on similar charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and PERSON were arrested and remanded in custody for DATE on the grounds , inter alia , that they could influence witnesses and hinder the investigation . According to the applicant , before being arrested the investigator made it clear to him that his arrest or release depended on whether he would agree to make the declarations expected of him .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and PERSON appealed against the detention order and argued , inter alia , that there had been no reasonable suspicion that they had committed an offence and that the criminal proceedings against them had been a form of pressure to persuade ORG to abandon its application before the ORG . The applicant argued that he had been arrested because he had refused to make the declarations he had been asked to make by the investigating officer and in order to induce him to make such declarations . He also argued that the criminal proceedings had been pending since DATE and that since that date he had never failed to appear before the investigating authorities when summoned . On DATE the applicant 's appeal was dismissed without any reasons being given for rejecting the arguments relied on by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's detention was subsequently extended and all his habeas corpus requests rejected . It continued until DATE when he was released on bail .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout his detention the applicant was detained in the detention centre of ORG ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) . The room used for meetings between lawyers and detainees had a glass partition to keep them separated . The applicant complained before the domestic courts of the impossibility of holding confidential meetings with his lawyer , but his complaints were dismissed . He did not want the domestic authorities to know about his application to the ORG and therefore his application and the power of attorney had to be signed by his wife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was acquitted by ORG of all the charges brought against him .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law concerning pre - trial detention was set out in the ORG 's judgment in ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the photographs submitted by the Government that in the lawyer - client meeting room of the ORG detention centre , the space for detainees is separated from the rest of the room by a door and a window . The window appears to be made of CARDINAL plates of glass joined together . Both plates have small holes pierced with a drill ; however the holes do not coincide , so that nothing can be passed though the window . Moreover , there is a dense green net made either of thin wire or plastic between the glass plates , covering the pierced area of the window . There appears to be no space for passing documents between the lawyer and his client .", "CARDINAL . DATE ORG held a strike , refusing to attend any proceedings regarding persons detained in the LOC detention centre until the administration had agreed to provide lawyers with rooms for confidential meetings with their clients . The demands of ORG were refused ( see ORG , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG held a meeting at which the President of ORG and another lawyer informed the participants that they had taken part , together with representatives of ORG , in a committee of inspection of the LOC detention centre . During the inspection they had asked that the glass wall be taken down in order to check that there were no listening devices . They had pointed out that it would only be necessary to remove a few screws and proposed that all the expenses linked to the verification be covered by ORG . The ORG administration had rejected the proposal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["18", "34", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
