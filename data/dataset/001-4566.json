POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , a NORP citizen born in DATE , is a carpenter residing in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant , while serving in the army , was injured in a car accident . He was admitted to a military hospital and had an operation . After his discharge , on DATE the applicant fell and his injury was renewed .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the military medical panel declared that the applicant was permanently unfit for military service .", "In DATE the applicant began to receive military disability benefit .", "On DATE he lodged a civil action with ORG in PERSON . He claimed that his second accident occurred during work which he had been carrying out on orders of his military superior . He submitted that in the military hospital he had not received adequate treatment . Before the first - instance court the applicant was represented by ORG , a lawyer officially assigned to the case within the framework of the system of free legal assistance .", "By a decision of DATE ORG assessed his disability as minor ( of third degree ) , preventing him from carrying out any hard work in standing position .", "", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . The ORG found that in DATE , during his military service , the applicant had a car accident and his leg was broken . He had been treated in ORG from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE . An operation had been made and a special device had been put in his leg to join the broken bones . On DATE he was discharged from the hospital and transferred to medical ward in his military unit . Doctors recommended that in DATE he should undergo a hospital check . During his stay in the ward the applicant disregarded medical recommendations , in particular he refused to use crutches , and repeatedly kept leaving the ward . On DATE , having left the ward , he had accompanied another private who had been ordered to mow a lawn at the local school . During the break in the work , the applicant had fallen and felt pain in his leg . On DATE he had been transferred to the FAC hospital where the doctors decided that he should be operated on . A day before the operation the applicant , despite medical recommendations to the contrary , had drank alcohol , which made the operation impossible . His leg had been put in a plaster cast . Subsequently he had again been transferred to the ward in his unit and a recommendation had been made that he should report to a hospital later . He did not do so . The applicant had been discharged from the military service on DATE , retaining for a further DATE the right to use military health services . He had failed to report to any military medical institution . In DATE his disability had been assessed as minor and he was receiving military disability pension .", "The court interviewed the applicant and heard evidence from , inter alia , CARDINAL of the doctors who had treated him , CARDINAL of his military superiors , and CARDINAL other persons . The court had also considered as evidence , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s medical records , the report of a medical expert appointed by the court , the decision of the military medical panel of CARDINAL DATE and the decision of ORG DATE .", "The court considered that , regard being had to the applicant \u2019s persistent failure to comply with the medical recommendations , his treatment could not have been effective . There were no indications of any medical negligence on the part of persons who had been treating him . Moreover , there was no evidence to support his argument that had had his second accident while working as ordered by his superiors . The court concluded that there was nothing to show that there had been any causal link between any orders of the applicant \u2019s military superiors and his second accident , or that there had been any medical negligence on the part of the military health services .", "Subsequently the applicant \u2019s lawyer PERSON requested ORG to designate a lawyer residing in the vicinity of the appellate court , ORG , to represent the applicant in the proceedings before that ORG . ORG complied with his request and designated PERSON to represent the applicant .", "ORG duly informed PERSON of the date of hearing and on DATE he attended the hearing before that court . On DATE , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer PERSON requested a reinstatement in proceedings and requested that the judgment of DATE with written grounds be served on him . He submitted that ORG had failed to inform both him and the applicant about the outcome of the proceedings . He also failed to request that written grounds of the judgment be drafted and served on him which made it impossible for the applicant to lodge a cassation appeal with ORG . PERSON had only requested that the judgment be served on him . The applicant had learned that ORG had found against him when he had come to the court in connection with other proceedings , long after the expiry of the time - limit for the lodging of the cassation appeal . In reply to the applicant \u2019s subsequent query about the outcome of the case , PERSON had informed him that he had lodged a request for the written judgment to be served on him . This information had later proved untrue . Therefore the applicant had been deprived of a possibility of lodging the cassation appeal . The lawyer concluded that the applicant could have legitimately expected that he would be informed of the outcome of the proceedings and consulted about further steps to be taken in order to protect his interests . Thus he should be reinstated in the proceedings in order to be able to lodge an appeal in cassation against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE as he had been deprived of this possibility without any fault on his part .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for the reinstatement in proceedings . ORG also refused to draft the written grounds for the judgment . ORG considered that the acts of a lawyer appointed to represent a party before a civil court within the framework of a legal aid system aid were to be deemed to be the acts of the party . Thus , any failure on the part of the officially appointed lawyer to comply with the procedural requirements entailed negative consequences directly for the party to the proceedings . It fell to the Bar , and in particular to the lawyers appointed by it to represent the parties , to organise their work in a manner which would ensure effective representation of parties before civil courts . Even the fact that the lawyers concerned resided in different towns could not discharge the Bar and themselves from their obligation to do so . Therefore , the court concluded , there were no grounds on which to grant the applicant \u2019s request for the reinstatement in the proceedings .", "Relevant domestic law", "CARDINAL .

Such a declaration shall contain details of the family situation , assets and income of the person concerned . A decision whether the financial situation of the person as set out in the declaration justifies granting exemption is left to the court \u2019s discretion .", "CARDINAL . Cassation appeal", "Following amendments made to LAW by LAW to LAW DATE , a party can lodge a cassation appeal with ORG against a final judicial decision of a second - instance court which has terminated the civil proceedings .", "Pursuant to LAW , a cassation appeal may be lodged on the ground that the courts have committed errors of law in that they have incorrectly interpreted or wrongly applied substantive laws ; or on the ground of such flagrant breach of procedural provisions as could have seriously affected the outcome of the proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
