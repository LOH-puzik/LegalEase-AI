She is also known to the GPE authorities under the names of PERSON , PERSON , ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . As a young child and after the death of her mother , the applicant left GPE with her father to travel . In DATE , the applicant contracted a traditional GPE marriage with PERSON , who was born in GPE in DATE and who was living in the GPE where he had been granted a residence permit in DATE . His nationality , if any , is unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2013 under the name GPE DATE was expelled from the GPE to GPE for unspecified reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON was granted a GPE permanent residence permit ( vestigingsvergunning ) which he holds to date . On DATE , the applicant \u2013 under the name GPE DATE applied for a GPE residence permit for the purposes of stay with her partner PERSON PERSON in the GPE . In DATE , the applicant and PERSON had a son named GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) rejected the applicant 's request for a residence permit , as PERSON did not meet the minimum income requirement under the applicable immigration rules , and as it had not been demonstrated that he was actually cohabiting with the applicant . After a request for reconsideration ( herzieningsverzoek ) filed on DATE was denied suspensive effect as regards the applicant 's removal from the GPE , the applicant left the GPE for an unknown destination on or around DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant returned to the GPE where , on DATE , she married PERSON under GPE civil law . On DATE , submitting a passport in the name of GPE issued on DATE in GPE ) by the authorities of ORG and valid until DATE , the applicant filed a request for a GPE residence permit for the purpose of stay with her spouse in the GPE . However , this application for a residence permit was not considered for DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , the applicant was convicted on CARDINAL occasions of ( aggravated ) theft and/or robbery and sentenced to terms of imprisonment varying from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was heard by the police in connection with the intention to impose an exclusion order on her by declaring her an undesirable alien ( ongewenst vreemdeling ) .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , in which he referred to previous letters sent on DATE and DATE , the applicant 's lawyer complained to the Deputy Minister of ORG about the failure to determine the applicant 's request for a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the Deputy Minister informed the applicant 's lawyer that no letters dated CARDINAL DATE and DATE had been received , that the applicant 's request of CARDINAL DATE had been mislaid due to an internal office removal , that the applicant had been invited on DATE to report to ORG ) to provide fresh information concerning her request for admission to the GPE , and that on DATE she had been heard in connection with the intention to impose an exclusion order . The Deputy Minister admitted that the determination of the applicant 's request for admission had lasted considerably longer than desirable and apologised for this delay . The applicant 's case would now be determined within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister gave a decision rejecting the applicant 's request for a residence permit . The Deputy Minister noted at the outset that the applicant did not hold the required , valid provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) issued by a GPE diplomatic or consular mission in the applicant 's country of origin . Further noting that PERSON sole income consisted of benefits under LAW ( PERSON ) , the Deputy Minister held that PERSON did not comply with the minimum income requirement under the applicable immigration rules whereas he was not dispensed of this requirement . Noting that the applicant had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment on several occasions , the Deputy Minister also found that public - order considerations opposed granting her request for a residence permit . In so far as the applicant had relied on the so - called \u201c DATE policy \u201d ( driejarenbeleid ) , according to which a residence title could be granted if a request for a residence permit had not been determined within DATE for reasons not imputable to the petitioner and provided that there were no contra - indications such as , for instance , a criminal record , the Deputy Minister held that the applicant was not eligible for a residence permit under this policy given her criminal record which comprised various offences committed DATE , i.e. pending the running of DATE . In the same decision , the Deputy Minister declared the applicant an undesirable alien , entailing a DATE exclusion order , on account of her criminal record in the GPE . As regards LAW , the Deputy Minister considered that the applicant 's personal interests in exercising her family life in the GPE were outweighed by those of the GPE authorities in protecting public order and preventing crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision . On DATE , she applied to ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE for a stay of expulsion pending the final outcome of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after a hearing held on DATE , ORG of The GPE sitting in ' s - Hertogenbosch accepted the applicant 's request for a provisional measure and ordered the applicant 's expulsion stayed until DATE after the Deputy Minister had given a decision on the objection . Having noted DATE that had elapsed between the filing of the applicant 's request for a residence permit and the first decision taken on that request , ORG failed to see what interest the Deputy Minister had in not allowing the applicant to await the outcome of her objection in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG of The GPE against the notional dismissal ( fictieve weigering ) of her objection , the Deputy Minister not having given a decision by that date . On DATE ORG accepted the applicant 's appeal and ordered the Deputy Minister to give a decision within DATE or within DATE if there was to be a hearing before an advisory board .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was heard on her objection before ORG ( PERSON voor vreemdelingenzaken ) . She stated , among other things , that her son GPE had been suffering from asthma since his birth , and that since her last conviction in DATE she no longer had had any dealings with the GPE criminal justice authorities . Her lawyer referred to a policy , set out in a letter dated DATE from the Deputy Minister of ORG and which had still been in force in DATE , under which requests for residence permits lodged by GPE for marriage purposes were given favourable consideration .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Deputy Minister gave a decision on DATE . The objection was dismissed on the ground that PERSON ( still ) did not comply with the minimum income requirement under the applicable immigration rules whereas he was not dispensed of this requirement . In addition , when heard on DATE , the applicant had denied that she had had recent dealings with the GPE criminal justice system , whereas in reality she had amassed further convictions of theft since DATE and had been arrested for shoplifting in DATE ; from this it could be concluded that the applicant was a danger to public order . The applicant 's criminal record also rendered her ineligible for a residence permit under DATE policy . The Deputy Minister further rejected the applicant 's argument that \u2013 given the uncertainty about her actual citizenship \u2013 she should be regarded as a stateless person , as well as her arguments under LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision to ORG of The Hague , together with an application for a provisional measure , i.e. a stay of deportation . On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG endorsed the decision of the Deputy Minister and dismissed the appeal . As regards LAW , it held :", "\u201c It is not in dispute that there is ' family life ' between the appellant , her husband and child . There is no question of an interference with this family life within the meaning of the second paragraph of LAW as the impugned decision does not entail the withdrawal of a residence title that enabled her to exercise that family life . The remaining question is whether [ the GPE authorities ] are under a positive obligation under LAW to enable the appellant to exercise her family life in the GPE . In order to determine the existence of such a positive obligation , a balancing exercise must be carried out DATE on the basis of reasonableness \u2013 between the interests of the person concerned and those of society as a whole . ORG accepts the finding of [ the Deputy Minister ] that the appellant 's interests are outweighed by the public interests pursued by [ the GPE authorities ] . In this balancing exercise , ORG puts first that the countless , ever recurring antecedents of both the appellant and her husband weigh very heavily . ORG further considers it of importance that the family 's subsistence needs are met by public funds and that none of the family members holds GPE citizenship . As to the alleged statelessness of the appellant , ORG notes that she stated at the outset of the present proceedings that she was holding NORP citizenship and submitted a NORP passport . It was only later that she declared to be stateless . It appears from the fax message of DATE of the ' s - Hertogenbosch Aliens Police that the appellant presented herself in order to obtain the return of her NORP passport for the purpose of having her son registered in this passport . It is further relevant that the appellant and her son are registered under the above - cited citizenship in ORG ( Gemeentelijke Basisadministratie ) . For the above reasons , ORG is of the opinion that the alleged statelessness of the appellant and her son has not been established and that it has not been demonstrated that the appellant 's son could not follow her to the country of origin .", "According to the data from ORG , the citizenship of the appellant 's husband is unknown . [ Pursuant to the relevant immigration rules ] , where it is registered in respect of an alien that the citizenship can not be determined , or where DATE such as in the instant case \u2013 in the category citizenship the standard value CARDINAL ( ' unknown ' ) is recorded , statelessness has not been established . Noting this as well as the fact that also the alleged statelessness of the appellant has by no means been established , ORG does not find it demonstrated that the appellant 's husband is stateless . As it has neither appeared that he is a recognised refugee , no objective obstacles have appeared for exercising family life in GPE or at least outside of the GPE .", "As an exclusion order has also been imposed on the appellant , the impugned decision does to that extent entail interference with the family life between the appellant , her husband and son . In order to determine whether that interference is justified under the second paragraph of LAW , [ the Deputy Minister ] must strike a reasonable balance between the interests of the individual and of society as a whole . In this , ORG refers to the weighty arguments which it has found decisive in the above balancing of [ competing ] interests . ORG finds that these also justify the interference with the family life [ at issue ] . \u201d", "Also the applicant 's request for a provisional measure was rejected . No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . As of CARDINAL DATE , and as the applicant was apparently no longer living at the address she had given to the GPE authorities who were unaware of her whereabouts , the applicant was registered as having left for an unknown destination . On DATE , the applicant 's son GPE was granted a GPE residence permit for the purpose of stay with his father , valid from DATE until DATE . This residence permit was subsequently prolonged until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her family are reportedly living in very reduced circumstances . PERSON is still unemployed , and receives non - contributory general welfare benefits as a single parent , the applicant 's residence in the GPE not being recognised as legal .", "CARDINAL . The admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated at the material time by LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) . Further rules were set out in LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) , the Regulation on Aliens ( Voorschrift Vreemdelingen ) and LAW ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ; a body of directives drawn up and published by ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , LAW entered into force \u2013 replacing LAW DATE along with a new LAW , a new Regulation on Aliens and new LAW .", "CARDINAL . As a rule , anyone wishing to apply for a residence permit in the GPE must first apply from his or her country of origin to the GPE Minister of ORG for a provisional residence visa . Only once such a visa has been issued abroad may a residence permit for the GPE be granted . An application for a provisional residence visa is assessed on the basis of the same criteria as a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . The Government pursue a restrictive immigration policy owing to the population and employment situation in the GPE . Aliens are eligible for admission only on the basis of obligations arising from international agreements , or if their presence serves an essential national interest , or on compelling humanitarian grounds .", "CARDINAL . The admission policy for family reunion purposes is laid down in LAW of LAW . A spouse is in principle eligible for family reunion , if certain further conditions ( relating to matters such as public policy and means of subsistence ) are met . General welfare benefits are not accepted as constituting ( a part of the ) means of subsistence within the meaning of the immigration rules .", "CARDINAL . According to a letter dated DATE by the Deputy Minister of ORG , the admission to the GPE of foreign marital partners of persons of GPE origin living in the GPE was subject to the same conditions as for other foreign marital partners seeking admission for family formation ( gezinsvorming ) , namely :", "\u201c a. it concerns a marriage on the basis of which residence can be granted . This requirement entails , inter alia , that it should concern a marriage valid under GPE ( international ) private law . Marriages concluded by partners younger than DATE are not recognised in the GPE ;", "b. the partner living in the GPE must hold a valid GPE residence title , have sufficient means of subsistence and suitable housing ;", "c. the foreign marital partner must not represent a danger for public peace , public order or national security . \u201d", "This letter further specifies that admission is refused when CARDINAL or more of these conditions are not met unless special facts or circumstances constitute a compelling reason of a humanitarian nature warranting admission nevertheless .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the LAW , replaced on DATE by LAW , an exclusion order may be imposed on an alien when he or she has been convicted of an offence punishable by a prison sentence of DATE or more .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW ACARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the DATE LAW and LAW of the CARDINAL LAW , an exclusion order shall \u2013 upon a request thereto from the person concerned \u2013 be lifted after a defined number of DATE , depending on the grounds on which basis the decision was taken .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) provides that staying in the GPE while knowing that an exclusion order has been imposed constitutes a criminal offence punishable by DATE imprisonment or a fine of QUANTITY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Under the relevant provisions of LAW , theft attracts a prison sentence of DATE ( Section CARDINAL ) , aggravated theft and depending on the circumstances in which it was committed , a prison sentence of CARDINAL DATE ( Section CARDINAL ) , and robbery a prison sentence of CARDINAL , DATE , depending on the circumstances in which it was committed and whether it had resulted in death ( Section CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
