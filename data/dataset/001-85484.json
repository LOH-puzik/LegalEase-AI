PERSON had previously run away from home on several occasions because of conflicts with her parents .", "On DATE the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Prosecutor initiated an investigation into the allegations of kidnapping against Mr PERSON and PERSON . On DATE the prosecutor issued a warrant authorising the search of their flat and the tapping of their telephone . They were arrested and remanded in custody . In DATE the case was taken over by ORG who discontinued the criminal proceedings against them , finding that the allegations of kidnapping had been groundless . Disciplinary proceedings were brought against both prosecutors who had instituted the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant owns a publishing house named \u201c PERSON \u201d which publishes the DATE magazine \u201c ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant published in \u201c ORG \u201d an interview with Mr PERSON , a lawyer who at the material time represented Mr PERSON and PERSON in the criminal proceedings concerning the alleged kidnapping . The article was entitled : \u201c If it had been quiet \u201d and was in the form of questions put by a journalist and answers given by Mr GPE The article , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c \u2018 A[ngora]\u2019:-I have brought you fresh news from ORG : the arrest warrant against [ PERSON ] has been quashed , the children however have not come back home .", "ORG [ Micha\u0142 Plisecki]:- I do not want to \u2013 publicly \u2013 go into the details concerning the issuing and quashing of the arrest warrant . Allow me not to comment on it because I would have been forced to use very blunt language . I would refer to another issue : if it is true that [ M.K. \u2019s ] parents - after an unsuccessful attempt to place her in a psychiatric clinic \u2013left her alone , under the care of her grandmother somewhere in the countryside , then should I \u2013 as a parent \u2013 be shocked by such behaviour ? There is no other conclusion from the above fact : they simply do not love her . It is not that they do not understand her , because this is proved by their behaviour as a whole , but that the wish to separate [ M.K. ] from the world is in the interests of those people . Mr PERSON \u2019s statement that he suspected that his daughter had been spying on him while she was dating PERSON and in particular the statement by the mother of [ M.K. ] that her daughter had been serving as a mattress for PERSON this is terrifying ! That was probably the reason why the Member of ORG Mr Ko\u0142odziejczyk , who represents the interests of all citizens , decided to apply to the family court to solve the tragic problem of [ M.K. ] and the PERSON family . If I may give my private opinion , I also believe that one should think over how to arrange [ PERSON \u2019s ] future life .", "( ... )", "\u2018 A\u2019:- So , if it was not for journalists , it would have been different ? Maybe quieter ?", "ORG If it had been quieter , then from my point of view , and after Mr PERSON \u2019s having publicised the case in a certain context , I do not exclude the possibility that my client [ Mrs ORG ] would still have been in the detention centre . I do not exclude the possibility that PERSON would have been arrested too . The fact that my clients are free is due to the pressure of public opinion .", "( ... )", "\u2018 A\u2019:- You have said : \u2018 PERSON ran away from home\u2019 . But it has been said that it was an abduction or kidnapping .", "ORG The prosecutor and his deputy know that [ M.K. ] ran away from home . It has been proved by witnesses ( ... ) [ M.K. ] had asked PERSON to accompany her and that is what happened . This is not a crime !", "\u2018 A\u2019:- ORG [ for Human Rights ] , the ORG , the President ...", "GPE ... let me add : ORG . Recently the ORG made an appeal for assistance for PERSON to the Ministers of Justice and of ORG \u2013 in the private matter of PERSON . I believe that since PERSON PERSON has abused power and has caused such unlawfulness and it has been supported by ORG , it means that ORG supports these kinds of methods involving aggressive behaviour .", "\u2018 A\u2019 : -You have said : PERSON has abused power . Is it a question or a statement ?", "M.P .:- He has obviously abused power because as the Speaker of the PERSON he had access to the media and gave false information ; the fact that he is a liar I can prove \u2013 if necessary DATE in court . I authorise you to print this text . If PERSON says that he is not a liar , I will prove the contrary in court !", "\u2018 A\u2019:-What do you think about the fact that the Member of Parliament PERSON GPE applied to ORG ?", "M.P.:- It is for the court to decide , in every family case , with which parent the child should stay . In such cases both the parents and the child often undergo psychological and psychiatric examination \u2013 obviously upon a decision of a court . This is a typical case ; the court is to decide on the family matter of PERSON and PERSON . Therefore , both the parents and [ M.K. ] should undergo the relevant examination . This is usual , routine procedure . That , in turn , proves how diligently Mr PERSON approached this case . [ GPE ] had turned to him for help , placed trust in him . In consequence he contacted , as I know , many people , me included , but I could not dispel his doubts . I then turned ( sic ! ) [ he turned ] to specialists \u2013 psychologists . He was told by them that before they could make any decision they should talk with both the child and the parents . Then , very tactfully , he asked the Speaker [ of the PERSON ] PERSON to pass these suggestions to Mr PERSON . Only after PERSON had refused , did Mr Ko\u0142odziejczyk do what any honest and respectable person would have done : he informed a court that in the PERSON family bad things were happening . It is a lie that PERSON Ko\u0142odziejczyk ordered the examination by specialists . He can not order it ! He only asked for appropriate action to be undertaken . ( ... ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , and in connection with the above interview , disciplinary proceedings were initiated against Mr PERSON by ORG . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) found that Mr PERSON had breached the rules of professional conduct and reprimanded him . The court reiterated that the lawyers between themselves ( Mr GPE , PERSON and his wife were all members of the Bar ) should follow the rules of politeness and friendliness . The court found that PERSON had breached those rules and had failed to express his critics in a restraint manner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , his wife and his daughter PERSON , ( \u201c the plaintiffs \u201d ) lodged against the applicant \u2019s publishing house \u201c Westa - Druk \u201d a civil claim for protection of their personal rights . They maintained that the press had played a major role in the case involving their family as they \u201c presented the facts and judgments tendentiously , causing de facto damage to the plaintiffs . \u201d The plaintiffs further sought an award of ORG CARDINAL in compensation and an order requiring the defendant to publish the following apologies :", "\u201c We apologise to the Deputy Speaker of the PERSON , PERSON , his wife PERSON PERSON and his daughter [ M.K. ] for grossly violating their personal rights by having published the article \u2018 If it had been PERSON , in ORG ( ... ) , in particular , by uncritically quoting the totally irresponsible statements of Mr PERSON in which he :", "- said of PERSON that he \u2018 had obviously abused power\u2019 and \u2018 caused ORG in connection with the investigation conducted by ORG into the alleged kidnapping of his daughter ,", "- said that Mr PERSON had been providing the media with untrue information and called him a liar ,", "- imputed to PERSON and PERSON the wish to place their daughter in a psychiatric clinic , called their parenting skills into question and stated without any reason that the parents and [ PERSON ] should \u2018 undergo psychiatric and psychological examination.\u2019", "We express our regret over the harm done to the injured party \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki ) gave judgment for the plaintiffs . The court ordered the applicant to publish apologies as sought in the statement of claim and awarded the plaintiffs compensation in part , i.e. PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The court stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... One should agree with [ the applicant ] that , being the publisher , he had the right to inform the readers about important circumstances concerning [ PERSON ] who at the material time held CARDINAL of the highest positions in the ORG . Therefore , publishing such information was not illegal despite the fact that it affected the LAW personal rights that are protected by law . The article , however , includes not only information but also statements that damaged their reputation ; i.e. their good name . The statement that PERSON and PERSON had made an unsuccessful attempt to place their daughter in a psychiatric clinic , that they do not understand and love her and that her separation from the world is in her interest , disparaged their parenting skills , and questioned their moral values .", "The information that the family should have been examined by psychologists and psychiatrists had also harmed them in the eyes of others .", "It concerns in particular the parents of Ms [ GPE ] who at that time held important positions and the state of their mental health should not have been an object of public discussion . Finally , calling PERSON a liar and stating that he had abused power , obviously harmed his good name and exposed him to the loss of trust of his voters and of the leaders of the party of which he was a member . Therefore , the [ applicant \u2019s ] actions were ... illegal because they breached the good name and reputation of the plaintiffs .", "The court did not agree with the [ applicant \u2019s ] opinion that [ since ] he was not the author of the quoted statements , he was not obliged to check the truthfulness of the information included in the interview with PERSON ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . He alleged , inter alia , that the court had infringed his freedom of expression in breach of LAW , as it had overstepped the margin afforded to it and violated the principle of proportionality between the legitimate aim pursued and the measures applied . The interference with his right was particularly striking as the case concerned a politician who should have been more tolerant of criticism . The applicant further argued that PERSON himself had made public information concerning his private life by giving statements concerning the alleged kidnapping of his daughter in the television and the press .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , who joined the proceedings as an intervener ( interwenient uboczny ) , also lodged an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the applicant had sullied the good name of the plaintiffs . It amended the judgment in so far as the text of the apology to be published was concerned and increased the sum to be paid by the applicant to all plaintiffs by way of costs and expenses to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . It upheld the remainder of the judgment . The applicant was to publish the following apology :", "\u201c We apologise to PERSON , his wife PERSON and daughter [ PERSON ] . for breaching their personal rights by the publication entitled \u00ab if it had been quiet \u00bb in particular by citing the statements made by the lawyer PERSON in which he referred to the GPE parenting skills and gave his opinion as to their family life , and called the first plaintiff a liar . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appellate court stated :", "\u201c ... ORG based its judgment on the following findings :", "In DATE a strong conflict erupted between [ GPE ] and her parents on the ground of her contacts with PERSON . [ M.K. ] regarded PERSON as a person friendly to her and a moral authority . That influenced the loosening of her relationship with her parents . Finally , in DATE [ M.K. ] left with PERSON . She did not inform her parents of her whereabouts and did not contact them .", "The plaintiff , PERSON , in a television address made an appeal for help in finding his daughter ; he also informed ORG that a crime has been committed under LAW .", "ORG instituted proceedings on charges of kidnapping and false imprisonment of GPE In the course of these proceedings PERSON ORG \u2013G\u0105sior was arrested and the apartment and house of GPE \u2019s family was searched . The defence counsel of PERSON was Mr GPE \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the statement that Mr PERSON had abused power was within the justifiable bounds of criticism since public opinion was particularly sensitive to all aspects of abuse of power , and the opinion about Mr PERSON was given by a professional i.e. a lawyer ; therefore , it did not require verification by the publisher . The allegation of abuse of power was also justified given the extraordinary actions undertaken by PERSON PERSON in a private matter . Following the case - law of ORG relating to LAW , a politician should show more tolerance when exposed to criticism than private persons . Then the court stated as follows :", "\u201c It is a different matter , however , with regard to the allegation that PERSON PERSON was a liar . It is obvious that this description does not have the character of a legal opinion . What is more , the context of the statement does not clarify in relation to what case the plaintiff was alleged to have lied . It was thus a generality suggesting regular untruthfulness on the part of the plaintiff . The explanations for this statement provided by Mr PERSON later in the course of trial can not be of particular importance since the published text , and in the form in which it reached the readers , did not include them . This description should then be considered as an ordinary and unjustified epithet [ epitet ] . In this case the publisher can not be discharged of the responsibility for besmirching the plaintiff \u2019s good name either on the ground that the author of the statement was a lawyer , because he had not spoken as a professional , or because of the fact that publication was in the form of an interview as , unlike radio or television interviews , it was not a live broadcast and the publisher had the means , by acting with due diligence , to prevent the breach of the plaintiff \u2019s personal rights by this statement . Moreover , it can not be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff held a public function , so that he agreed there should be a wider limit of permissible criticism of him , or from the fact that he himself made a public appeal for help in finding his daughter , that he had agreed to publication of all free opinions and comments on this subject , including those breaching his personal rights . Given the above described character of the statement , it should be regarded as an evaluation ( ocenna ) that can not be verified as true or false and in any case can not [ be seen ] as a negative assessment of the plaintiff \u2019s actions within the meaning of LAW . In this case the publisher is not protected by LAW as paragraph CARDINAL of this Article limits the right of freedom of expression when protecting , inter alia , the reputation of others .", "For these reasons ORG considered the appeals of the [ applicant ] and the intervener manifestly ill - founded .", "Both appeals are equally unjustified in what they say about the judgment referring to a breach of the first plaintiff \u2019s personal rights by statements about his family life .", "Neither the fact that the first plaintiff had himself introduced the events of his private life into the public sphere by making the address for help in finding his daughter ( even if one can consider such an appeal as agreement to publication of information from a private sphere within the meaning of LAW ) nor the fact that as a person holding a public function he was a subject of particular interest to the press authorised the publisher to breach his personal rights by putting into question his mental health and parenting skills .", "One can not infer that the plaintiff waived his right to legal protection by the fact that he had subjected himself to public comments on his family matters . It should be underlined that information concerning family life , and even unfavourable comment , does not have to breach personal rights . In this publication the limits of fair criticism and cultural expression had been overstepped . As with the allegation that the first plaintiff was a liar , the publisher is not protected by the fact that he had been quoting the statements of a lawyer who was obliged to exercise strict control over what he said , because matters concerning the family life of the first plaintiff did not have the nature of a legal opinion and the interview itself was not broadcast \u201c live \u201d .", "Moreover , commenting in this manner on the plaintiff \u2019s family life was not covered by a socially justified interest and did not concern the political activity of the plaintiff .", "In addition it should be said that entering into issues concerning the family sphere , in particular the relationship between parents [ and children ] , if only because of the impossibility to verify the assessments made in this respect , is always unlawful , even if the information given is true ( see judgment of ORG , DATE ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the intervener each lodged cassation appeals with ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the cassation appeals and ordered the applicant to pay Mr Kern PLN CARDINAL for costs and expenses . It agreed with the assessment of the lower courts that in the present case the interference with the freedom of press was justified by the need to protect the reputation of the plaintiffs . ORG also dismissed the applicant \u2019s arguments that his intention was to report on a case that had shocked the majority of public opinion . The court was of the opinion that publishing an article in which the lawyer of the other party subjectively analysed very delicate family matters and offered categorical judgments on their causes , was not the right way to protect a justified public interest .", "CARDINAL . It appears that subsequently the judgment was enforced in so far as the payment of compensation was concerned . As regards the publishing of the apologies , the enforcement proceedings are pending .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code contains a non - exhaustive list of the rights known as \u201c personal rights \u201d ( dobra osobiste ) . This provision states :", "\u201c The personal rights of an individual , such as in particular health , liberty , reputation ( cze\u015b\u0107 ) , freedom of conscience , name or pseudonym , image , secrecy of correspondence , inviolability of the home , scientific or artistic work , [ as well as ] inventions and improvements shall be protected by the civil law regardless of the protection laid down in other legal provisions . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
