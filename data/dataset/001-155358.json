The first applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He graduated from ORG ( currently ORG ) , qualifying as a sports instructor .", "CARDINAL . DATE he was employed by the NORP branch of ORG ( the ORG ) . After GPE declared independence in DATE , he found employment as a tax inspector .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities concluded that the first applicant was subject to the restrictions of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As a result , on DATE he was dismissed by the tax authorities .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant brought an administrative action against the security intelligence authorities , claiming that his dismissal under LAW , and the ensuing inability to find employment , were unlawful . The domestic courts dismissed his claims ( see GPE and PERSON v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINALVIII ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant submitted an application to the ORG , alleging that he had lost his job and that his employment prospects had been restricted as a result of the application of LAW , in breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE in the case of GPE and PERSON ( cited above ) , the ORG found a violation of LAW , taken in conjunction with LAW . It concluded that the ban on the first applicant seeking employment in various branches of the private sector , in application of LAW , constituted a disproportionate measure , despite the legitimacy of the aims pursued ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL of the judgment ) . The ORG ordered the ORG to pay the first applicant MONEY ( ORG ) as compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage and costs .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the ORG informed ORG that , as no request had been made under LAW above - mentioned cases to be referred to ORG , the judgment of DATE had become final on CARDINAL October CARDINAL , in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG discussed the question of whether the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of GPE and GPE v. GPE ( cited above ) and PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( nos . CARDINAL and FAC , DATE ) had been executed . As regards individual measures , the Government informed ORG that the sum awarded to the first applicant had been paid to him . As regards general measures , ORG was preparing amendments to LAW , which would be adopted in the near future . Moreover , in order to prevent similar violations of the LAW , the NORP courts and other institutions had been informed about the ORG \u2019s judgment and provided with a translation ( see also paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant started domestic court proceedings against ORG , seeking CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL ) in pecuniary damages , which he counted as DATE of his tax inspector \u2019s salary , and LTL CARDINAL in non - pecuniary damages , which he claimed to have suffered because of the continuing violation of his right to respect for his private life under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . The first applicant noted that since DATE he had been unemployed and registered at ORG ( PERSON darbo bir\u017ea ) , a ORG institution that provides assistance for job seekers . He argued that , even though he had not been in the service of the ORG for DATE , owing to the restrictions imposed by LAW he had been unable to gain employment in certain branches of the private sector as of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant also maintained that GPE had disregarded its obligations under international treaties and the LAW . Without referring to specific judgments of the ORG , he considered that the common principles developed by the ORG required that GPE execute the ORG \u2019s judgment in his case without undue delay . It was his view that the ORG \u2019s judgment in his case obliged GPE to amend LAW . However , ORG had ignored the ORG \u2019s judgment and had been stalling any amendment of LAW , which ORG had found to be incompatible with the Convention . He concluded that since DATE , when the ORG \u2019s judgment in his case had become final , GPE had continued to violate his employment rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at the request of the first applicant , ORG issued him with a document to the effect that he had been registered as a job seeker since DATE , and that DATE and DATE he had been turned down a number of times for jobs proposed to him , \u201c for justified reasons \u201d . As it transpires from other documents presented to the ORG , those justified reasons included : a lack of professional qualification or work experience for the posts of business manager at a factory producing television sets and at other local companies ; another candidate had been chosen for the post of supervisor at a waste management facility ; and a lack of LANGUAGE language skills for a job as a hotel manager .", "Without further explanation , it was also briefly noted in the document of DATE that the first applicant \u201c had not been employed because of applicable restrictions ( he could not take up jobs which required him to manage people , pedagogical jobs or work in the security sector ) ( bedarbis ne\u012fdarbintas d\u0117l taikom\u0173 apribojim\u0173 : negali dirbti vadovaujant\u012f , pedagogin\u012f darb\u0105 , apsaugoje ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s claims as unsubstantiated . It observed that ORG had awarded him compensation for the pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage he had sustained before the ORG had adopted its judgment on DATE . The first - instance court then turned to the first applicant \u2019s claim about the continued discrimination against him after the ORG \u2019s judgment . On this point , it observed that ORG document of CARDINAL DATE stated that he \u201c had not been employed because of applicable restrictions \u201d . Without elaborating any further on the facts , ORG merely observed that that particular document and other materials of the case file did not prove that the first applicant \u2019s right to choose a particular private sector job had been infringed because LAW had not been amended after the ORG \u2019s judgment . Accordingly , his claim for damages for the period after the ORG \u2019s judgment was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . In addition to his previous arguments he further maintained that after the re - establishment of GPE \u2019s independence , he had fully cooperated with the NORP authorities and helped to disclose the identities of former ORG officers before they infiltrated the NORP authorities . However , notwithstanding his loyalty to the independent GPE and the ORG \u2019s judgment in his favour , he had been banned from legal , pedagogical or other jobs because LAW had remained in force . He had been unemployed since DATE and thus could not take care of his family .", "As it appears from his appeal on points of law , the first applicant did not mention any particular instance when he had been refused a job because of his status . Yet he reiterated his point of view that the principles of the ORG required that GPE execute the ORG \u2019s judgments without undue delay and within the shortest time possible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision . It observed that the LAW formed an integral part of the NORP legal system and that individuals could directly rely on its provisions before the national courts . Moreover , in the event of a conflict between the legal norms of the ORG and national laws , the LAW was to be given priority . ORG agreed with the lower court \u2019s reasoning that the first applicant \u2019s request for compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage sustained before DATE ( the date of ORG judgment in his case ) had to be dismissed because an award had already been made by the ORG and the applicant had been paid the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the first applicant \u2019s claim in respect of the damage allegedly suffered since then , on the basis of the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON and ORG v. GPE ( [ ORG ] ORG . FAC and CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALVIII ) , ORG noted that GPE undertook to take general and , if appropriate , individual measures to be adopted in their domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the ORG and to redress so far as possible its effects . The GPE were free to choose how to correct the breach of individual applicants\u2019 Convention rights , provided that the means chosen were compatible with the conclusions set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment . ORG in integrum was an important aspect of remedying the violation .", "CARDINAL . That being so , even though the legislator had an obligation to ensure legal certainty and to reconcile domestic law with the norms of the ORG , legislative amendment was not the only way to implement the ORG \u2019s judgment . The fact that LAW had not been amended had not in itself breached the first applicant \u2019s rights . A person \u2019s rights could also be secured by administrative decisions and domestic court practices . Both LAW and ORG judgment were in force in GPE . For ORG , in the event of a conflict between them , priority was to be given to the ORG \u2019s judgment . Consequently , even though LAW was still in force , a refusal to employ the first applicant in the private sector based on the restrictions contained in the KGB Act would be unlawful . Accordingly , the protection of a person \u2019s rights through the direct application of the ORG \u2019s judgment and before any legislative amendments had been adopted was to be considered proper execution of the ORG \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the facts of the case , ORG noted that the first applicant had attempted to obtain employment in the private sector . It observed that on DATE ORG had issued him with a document certifying that he had been registered as a job seeker since DATE and had not been employed because of the restrictions applied to him ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The appellate court noted that in response to its request to explain the reasons for the first applicant \u2019s unemployment in more detail , on DATE ORG had provided the appellate court with another document stating that on DATE an individual plan for the first applicant \u2019s employment had been prepared with a view to employing him as a lawyer ( in - house lawyer ; juriskonsultas ) , because he had DATE work experience in different companies and institutions in the city of ORG . From DATE to DATE , CARDINAL posts for in - house lawyers had been created in ORG , for which a university degree in law was required and the salary was just higher than minimal salary . The advertisements for those posts had been shown to the first applicant , but he had not been given any of those jobs because the employers considered that he lacked the relevant qualifications . ORG could therefore no longer offer the first applicant other in - house lawyer posts . To increase his chances of finding a job , at DATE the first applicant had attended computer literacy courses and courses for professional training in the field of administrative work . In DATE a new individual plan had been compiled together with the first applicant , so that , because he so wished , he could obtain the job of business manager ( komercijos vadybininkas ) . ORG then named CARDINAL companies which refused the first applicant the job of business manager , administrator and sales manager because other candidates had been chosen or because he lacked knowledge of the LANGUAGE language .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that those CARDINAL documents were contradictory . The court deemed it proper to rely on the report of DATE as it was more recent and , in the court \u2019s opinion , more comprehensive and explanatory . It concluded that the restrictions which LAW imposed on a person \u2019s ability to find employment in certain areas of the private sector had not been applied to the first applicant . The existence of LAW , as such , had not violated his rights and did not entitle him to compensation . ORG determined that there was no proof that , after the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL July CARDINAL , the first applicant had been prevented from obtaining a private sector job because of the restrictions related to LAW . Furthermore , he had not provided any particular information as to who had refused to employ him on the basis of those restrictions and when . It followed that the first applicant had not managed to secure a job because of the local labour - market situation . Moreover , there was no information that he had attempted to find a job in another manner , that is to say not only relying on the assistance of ORG , but had been refused a job because of the legislative restrictions . To give rise to a violation of the LAW , a breach of a person \u2019s rights had to be real , and not hypothetical . Given that there was no proof that after the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE the first applicant could not obtain a job because the KGB Act remained unchanged , and having concluded that his right to work in the private sector could no longer be restricted because of the direct applicability of the LAW , the first applicant \u2019s claim for damages had to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE after ORG final decision in his case , ORG suggested that the first applicant contact CARDINAL specific private companies for a post as a business manager . On DATE the first applicant came back to ORG and stated that he had not taken the business manager \u2019s job in CARDINAL of those companies because he did not like the conditions offered . He planned to take part in the interview for the business manager \u2019s job in the other company .", "DATE the first applicant was refused positions of business manager , insurance consultant and other jobs a number of times because he lacked foreign language skills , qualifications , or the relevant work experience . As it transpires from the documents in the ORG \u2019s possession , he turned other jobs down simply because he deemed that the salary offered was too low or the work place too far away .", "On DATE the first applicant was appointed as a carer for his mother ( paskirtas motinos r\u016bpintoju ) . ORG therefore discontinued its assistance to him .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE , he graduated from ORG as a lawyer . From CARDINAL DATE he worked as a prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities concluded that , from DATE , the second applicant had been an employee of the NORP branch of the ORG and that he was therefore subject to the restrictions provided for by LAW . As a result , on DATE he was dismissed from his job as prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant brought an administrative action against the authorities , claiming that his dismissal under LAW , which made it impossible for him to find employment , was unlawful . The domestic courts dismissed his claims ( see GPE and PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant lodged an application with the ORG . Like the first applicant , he alleged that Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention had been violated .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL July CARDINAL in GPE and GPE v. GPE ( cited above ) , the ORG found a violation of LAW taken in conjunction with LAW and awarded the second applicant ORG CARDINAL in respect of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage and costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant wrote to the Chairman of ORG of ORG , the Prime Minister and the Minister of ORG to enquire whether the ORG intended to amend LAW and , if so , when . At the same time , he acknowledged that the NORP authorities had already paid him a sum of money awarded to him by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government Agent before the ORG informed the second applicant that ORG was working on amendments to LAW .", "On DATE the Chairman of ORG of the LAW informed the second applicant that the Seimas had set up a working group that was also drafting legislative amendments .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , as of CARDINAL DATE the second applicant was registered in the list of trainee lawyers ( advokato pad\u0117j\u0117jas ) , which is a precondition to becoming a lawyer . The Government also noted that the second applicant had submitted his traineeship report on DATE and was going to take the NORP exam .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant sued GPE for non - pecuniary damage . He claimed to have lost LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL as a result of the ORG \u2019s failure , since DATE ( the date of the ORG \u2019s judgment in his case ) , to amend LAW . This in turn had restricted his prospects of finding employment in certain private sector areas . He argued that the common principles governing the execution of the ORG \u2019s judgments required the ORG to execute the judgment without undue delay .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s claim . It noted that the judgment in the NORP and PERSON case did not oblige the ORG to amend LAW within a specific time - frame and that the Seimas was in the process of discussing the relevant legislative amendments . During the court hearing the second applicant submitted that he had contacted an insurance company and a commercial bank in order to check what the reaction of potential employers would be . He maintained that those employers had replied that they would be unable to employ him because to do so would breach LAW . The first - instance court , however , noted that the second applicant had not provided any evidence to prove that he had actually applied for and been refused any particular job in the private sector . Accordingly , the court had no basis on which to hold that the second applicant had in reality addressed those CARDINAL employers and that they had refused to hire him .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed . He pointed out in particular that he had not attempted to obtain employment in the private sector so as not to harm the employers , who would have faced administrative liability if they had employed him . That was the reason why he had no proof of having actually attempted to obtain a job barred to him by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s appeal . Its reasoning was similar to that of its decision of DATE in the first applicant \u2019s case ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . It observed that the second applicant had based his claims for damages on the alleged non - execution of the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL July CARDINAL . However , referring to the cases of PERSON and ORG ( cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and GPE v. GPE ( DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL-C ) , it observed that under LAW were free to choose the appropriate individual and general measures to discharge their legal obligation to execute the ORG \u2019s decisions , albeit monitored by ORG . Moreover , given the abstract nature of the Convention norms , the domestic courts should follow ORG jurisprudence in order better to comprehend their content .", "CARDINAL . As to the facts of the second applicant \u2019s case , ORG observed that , because the ORG \u2019s judgment in GPE and PERSON prevailed over LAW , the restrictions on working in certain private sector areas could no longer be imposed on the second applicant . Thus , even though LAW had not been amended , a refusal to employ him on the basis of the restrictions provided for in LAW would be in violation of the LAW and consequently unlawful . It was also the court \u2019s view that protecting a person \u2019s rights by direct application of the ORG \u2019s judgments rather than by legislative amendments was an appropriate way to execute those judgments . It followed that , because of the direct applicability of the ORG and the ORG \u2019s judgments , the ORG had not failed to act , the latter being a precondition for the ORG \u2019s civil liability .", "CARDINAL . As to the second applicant , he had failed to prove that , after the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL July CARDINAL , he had attempted to obtain employment in the private sector and had been refused owing to the restrictions of LAW . ORG stressed that \u201c the mere existence of contradictions and ambiguities in the legal system did not in itself provide grounds for a violation of a person \u2019s rights and did not harm that person \u201d . Similarly , a mere hypothetical violation and a person \u2019s idea that his rights had been breached , without any tangible facts , were not sufficient . ORG therefore dismissed the second applicant \u2019s claim in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant , Mr ORG , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . DATE he was an employee of the NORP branch of the ORG . Thereafter he found employment as a lawyer in a private telecommunications company , Omnitel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed GPE that the third applicant had been a ORG officer and was therefore subject to the restrictions provided for by LAW . As a result , on DATE Omnitel dismissed the third applicant from his job .", "CARDINAL . After unsuccessful litigation before the NORP courts for reinstatement in his job and for unpaid salary ( see ORG , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) , the third applicant lodged an application with the ORG , alleging that he had lost his job and that his employment prospects had been restricted as a result of the application to him of LAW , in breach of LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment in the case of ORG ( cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) the ORG held that the third applicant \u2019s inability to pursue his former profession as a lawyer in a private telecommunications company , and his continuing inability to find private - sector employment because of his \u201c former permanent ORG employee \u201d status under LAW , constituted a disproportionate and thus discriminatory measure , despite the legitimacy of the aims pursued . ORG concluded that there had been a violation of Article CARDINAL taken in conjunction with Article CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the ORG informed ORG that , as no request had been made under LAW above - mentioned cases to be referred to ORG , the judgment of DATE had become final on DATE , in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant requested that ORG reopen the proceedings in his earlier case for unlawful actions and reinstatement in his job at Omnitel , on the basis of LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG noted that the proceedings in the domestic courts related to the dismissal of the third applicant from his position as a lawyer with a telecommunications company . It observed that the ORG \u2019s judgment gave reason to doubt the lawfulness of those domestic decisions . It therefore decided to reopen the proceedings which the third applicant had previously instituted against ORG and his previous employer , the private telecommunications company , GPE .", "For reasons of jurisdiction , the case was subsequently remitted to ORG , a court of general jurisdiction , for a fresh examination .", "DATE . On DATE ORG acknowledged that the third applicant had been dismissed from his previous job at GPE unlawfully . As to the question of his reinstatement , the court relied on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and noted that DATE had elapsed since the telecommunications company had dismissed the third applicant from his job . During that time the third applicant had worked in companies specialising in other fields , such as railways and television . Moreover , the activities of the telecommunications company had also evolved . In the court \u2019s view , because he lacked appropriate qualifications and foreign language skills , after such a long time the third applicant would no longer be competent to work as a lawyer in that company . The court also noted that at that time the third applicant was working in another company , without specifying what that company was , and therefore had a source of income . ORG also noted the continuing conflict between the third applicant and the company , which could be another reason not to reinstate him to his former job at GPE . Lastly , the court observed that LAW was still in force . In the court \u2019s view , should the third applicant be reinstated , the question of his dismissal could arise de novo , or his employer would face the risk of administrative penalties . In the light of those circumstances , the court dismissed the third applicant \u2019s claim for reinstatement .", "CARDINAL . The court then turned to the issue of compensation for lost earnings for the period of DATE , indicated by the third applicant , for which he requested the sum of LTL CARDINAL . However , it was to be noted that the ORG had already awarded him more than LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL for both past and future pecuniary loss . Moreover , after his dismissal from GPE , the third applicant had worked in different jobs and had received more than LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL in salary . Under NORP law , an employee could be awarded CARDINAL years\u2019 unpaid salary . In the third applicant \u2019s case the salary in GPE would amount to ORG ( ORG DATE for DATE ) . Accordingly , the CARDINAL sums he had already received ( LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL and LTL CARDINAL ) amounted to more than the award requested . Lastly , the third applicant had acknowledged that since his dismissal from GPE , he had continued to receive a pension from another ORG for his work in the ORG , ranging from ORG CARDINAL a month . It followed that the claim for pecuniary damage had to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Both the third applicant and GPE appealed . At the hearing , the third applicant asked to be paid LTL CARDINAL for lost earnings as compensation for the fact that he had still not been reinstated with Omnitel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected both appeals . It upheld the lower court \u2019s conclusion that the third applicant had been dismissed from his previous job unlawfully . Moreover , the circumstances mentioned in LAW existed . Accordingly , the third applicant could not be reinstated in his former job with Omnitel . The court added that \u201c the laws that provide for the prohibition on former [ GPE ] ORG employees from working in the telecommunications sector are still in force , so that if the [ third ] applicant were reinstated in his previous job , certain problems might arise \u201d . Additionally , the applicant was working in another company and receiving a pension for his previous work with the ORG . He therefore had a source of income . ORG also endorsed the lower court \u2019s view that the third applicant had been compensated by ORG for the pecuniary damage he had suffered as a consequence of his unlawful dismissal . The sum he now asked for \u2013 LTL DATE was lower than the awards of LTL CARDINAL and CARDINAL he had already received .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , reiterating his claim for reinstatement and for compensation for lost earnings . He argued that LAW was an imperative legal norm and meant that once the court found that an employee had been dismissed unlawfully , that employee was to be reinstated in his or her previous job . It followed that the argument of ORG that \u201c if the [ third ] applicant were reinstated to his previous job certain problems might arise \u201d was arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . DATE Omnitel argued that in DATE it had dismissed the third applicant from his job merely following the letter of LAW . LAW provided that an employer could be fined ORG CARDINAL should he not comply with LAW . This was all the more likely to happen since ORG had recognised LAW as constitutional in its ruling of DATE , that is before the third applicant was dismissed . Even though the ORG had found a violation in the third applicant \u2019s case , LAW was still in force , and therefore the third applicant \u2019s reinstatement was barred . Furthermore , in the judgment of DATE the ORG had not ordered GPE to amend LAW . Nor had the ORG ordered the NORP courts to have the third applicant reinstated in his previous job . In his written reply to this last argument , the third applicant observed that GPE , by not appealing against the ORG \u2019s judgment to ORG , had shown its agreement with the interpretation and application of FAC in the Rainys and Gasparavi\u010dius judgment . He therefore insisted that the ORG \u2019s judgment was sufficient legal basis for him to be reinstated in his former job at the private telecommunications company , Omnitel , notwithstanding the fact that LAW had not been amended .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , PERSON maintained that the lower courts had been correct in referring to other circumstances why the third applicant could not be reinstated on the basis of LAW of the Law on ORG , namely , for economic , technological and organisational reasons , and the fact that it could lead to unfavourable conditions for him ( see paragraph DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held :", "\u201c LAW is an international agreement , ratified by the LAW . It is therefore an integral part of the legal system of GPE ... ORG was established to guarantee the observance of the rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed by LAW . In ratifying the Convention , GPE took an undertaking to execute the ORG \u2019s final judgments in every case in which it is a party . The Convention norms must be implemented in reality ( PERSON normos turi b\u016bti realiai \u012fgyvendinamos ) . The ORG itself establishes the manner in which it will ensure implementation of the Convention norms . CARDINAL such method is the reopening of proceedings , provided for in LAW . Namely , a case which had been terminated by a final court decision may be reopened if the ORG finds that the NORP courts\u2019 decisions are in conflict ( prie\u0161tarauja ) with the ORG or its Protocols , to which GPE is a party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the facts of the case , ORG noted that the third applicant had worked as a lawyer at Omnitel and had been dismissed on DATE because of the restrictions provided for in LAW . As ORG had held on DATE , those restrictions were compatible with the LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG nevertheless observed that on DATE the ORG had found that the third applicant had lost his job as a lawyer in the private telecommunications company on the basis of the application of FAC which the ORG had found to be discriminatory , in breach of LAW , taken in conjunction with LAW . ORG had also held that the third applicant \u2019s inability to pursue his former profession and his continuing inability to find private sector employment because of his \u201c former ORG officer \u201d status under LAW constituted a disproportionate and thus discriminatory measure , even having regard to the legitimacy of the aims sought ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s judgment ) . ORG then held :", "\u201c Accordingly , even though LAW , which was the basis for dismissing the third applicant from his job , is in force and even acknowledged as being in conformity with LAW , the dismissal from his job on the basis of that LAW in essence had been recognised as unlawful by the ORG \u2019s judgment , that is to say a violation of LAW , taken in conjunction with LAW , had been found . This circumstance is not to be questioned when resolving the dispute in the domestic court . Despite the fact that there was no fault in the actions of [ ORG or Omnitel ] , which were implementing the obligations stemming from LAW , the undertaking to implement the provisions of the LAW constituted a legal ground for the courts of the first and appellate instances to conclude that the applicant \u2019s dismissal was unlawful . It must be emphasised that the ground for such a decision is not the provisions of the PERSON on the Employment Contract or LAW , which regulate the issue of reinstatement , but the provisions of the LAW and the judgment of ORG . At the same time it must be emphasised that , while LAW , the compatibility of which with LAW had already been verified ( kurio konstitucingumas jau buvo patikrintas ) is still in force , the question of reinstating the third applicant to his job may not be resolved favourably . In the circumstances of this case the recognition of the fact that he had been dismissed from his job unlawfully is sufficient satisfaction for him ( atleidimo i\u0161 darbo pripa\u017einimas neteis\u0117tu \u0161ios bylos aplinkybi\u0173 kontekste ORG ie\u0161kovui pakankama satisfakcija ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the third applicant had been awarded compensation by the ORG for actual and future pecuniary damage . Given that he had been awarded ORG CARDINAL [ approximately LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ] , the third applicant had already been fully compensated for the disproportionate and discriminatory measure DATE dismissal from his job at Omnitel . For the court of cassation , \u201c there was no legal ground for repeatedly awarding compensation for the violation , which the ORG had not found to be of a continuous nature ( pakartotinai priteisti \u017ealos atlygim\u0105 u\u017e pa\u017eeidim\u0105 , kurio t\u0119stinumo PERSON Teisi\u0173 Teismas savo sprendime nekonstatavo , n\u0117ra teisinio pagrindo ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG thus fully upheld the lower court \u2019s decisions .
