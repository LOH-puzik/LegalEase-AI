The applicant \u2019s daughter was monitored during her pregnancy by Dr GPE , a gynaecologist working at ORG . She was examined on a DATE basis and her pregnancy developed normally .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Dr I.M. performed a routine check - up on the applicant \u2019s daughter when she was DATE pregnant . According to the applicant , on that occasion Dr GPE informed her daughter that she needed to be hospitalised for further investigations because an imminent premature birth was suspected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter was admitted to hospital with the diagnosis of imminent premature birth and sub icterus of unknown aetiology .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter was examined and blood samples were collected because it was suspected that she was suffering from viral hepatitis and an internal condition . She was also suffering from pain in the lumbar region and food poisoning was suspected because she had stated that she had eaten mushrooms picked from the forest . She was treated with ORG ( a vasodilator , prescribed for peripheral vascular disease associated with cerebrovascular insufficiency and premature labour ) and other medication . According to the applicant , as a result of this treatment large ecchymoses caused by the rupture of blood vessels appeared on her daughter \u2019s legs and abdomen .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the medical condition of the applicant \u2019s daughter worsened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter was transferred to the intensive care unit and her condition continued to deteriorate .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , after repeated requests from her and her son - in - law , Dr GPE agreed to contact PERSON from ORG located in GPE . PERSON was a university professor . When he received information about the patient \u2019s condition and treatment , PERSON diagnosed the applicant \u2019s daughter with PERSON syndrome ( an exceptionally serious prenatal condition ) and asked PERSON to perform an emergency C - section in order to save the mother \u2019s life .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , PERSON refused to perform the emergency C - section , but eventually agreed that the applicant \u2019s daughter could be transferred to ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s daughter was transferred by ambulance to ORG , QUANTITY away from GPE , unaccompanied by a doctor . Her condition worsened during the transport .", "CARDINAL . She was admitted to ORG in a coma , with the diagnosis of GPE syndrome . An emergency C - section was performed TIME after she arrived at the hospital . She died TIME after the surgery from cardiac arrest , despite resuscitation manoeuvres . The applicant \u2019s granddaughter died on DATE from cardiac arrest , despite resuscitation manoeuvres .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG initiated of its own motion a criminal investigation into the death of the applicant \u2019s daughter . They carried out an examination of the body , took photographic evidence and they interviewed PERSON , who had assisted PERSON during the surgery , as well as the applicant \u2019s son - in - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a post - mortem report was produced in respect of the applicant \u2019s daughter \u2019s and granddaughter \u2019s deaths at ORG request . It concluded that the cause of the applicant \u2019s daughter \u2019s death had been cardio - respiratory and hepatic - renal insufficiency with brain hypoxia . In addition , the applicant \u2019s granddaughter \u2019s death had been caused by lung and brain hypoxia .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG produced a forensic necropsy report . It noted amongst other things that according to the serology examination report no spores of poisonous mushrooms were found . It concluded that the death of the applicant \u2019s daughter was pathological and was caused by hepatic - nephritis and generalised haemorrhagic vasculopathy , with cardio - respiratory and circulatory insufficiency . In addition , the assessment of the medical assistance provided to the victim during pregnancy and upon giving birth had to be made , after medical documents were adduced , by a review commission ( comisia de avizare ) composed of obstetrics and gynaecology experts .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE , ORG , sitting as a review commission , informed ORG that they approved the conclusions of the forensic necropsy report of DATE as scientifically grounded and based on the medical data included in the report . In addition , it found that there had been no omissions in the techno - medical treatment of the victim ( \u00een atitudinea tehnic - medical\u0103 fa\u021b\u0103 de victim\u0103 nu se constat\u0103 omisiuni ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s son - in - law lodged a criminal complaint , with no civil claims , with ORG , requesting an investigation into his wife \u2019s and daughter \u2019s deaths following his wife \u2019s admission to ORG in GPE . His complaint was registered on DATE with ORG under criminal file no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s son - in - law lodged a second criminal complaint , with no civil claims , with ORG attached to ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) against the medical personnel of ORG and ORG in GPE . He relied on LAW , and argued that the medical personnel had been medically negligent . In addition , he contended amongst other things that the criminal investigation lacked the required speediness . The complaint was registered on DATE with ORG under criminal file no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE ORG decided to join the criminal files nos . CARDINAL and DATE and not to open criminal proceedings ( ne\u00eenceperea urm\u0103ririi penale ) in the case . It held , on the basis of the medical evidence , the forensic necropsy report and the approval of the review commission of CARDINAL DATE , that the death of the victim had had natural causes and had not been induced by any medical error . Subsequently , the order was notified to the applicant \u2019s son - in - law and he challenged the order before the superior prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s son - in - law challenged the order before ORG . His complaint was subsequently referred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the superior prosecutor dismissed the applicant \u2019s son - in - law \u2019s challenge to the order of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE , the applicant \u2019s son - in - law lodged a criminal complaint against Dr GPE with ORG for involuntary manslaughter following the deaths of his wife and daughter . The complaint was registered under criminal file no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s son - in - law that the criminal investigation concerning PERSON was pending ; that he would be heard after the medical authorities had submitted the relevant medical and forensic documents ; and that once the investigation had ended he would be notified of the outcome .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s son - in - law was heard in respect of the circumstances of his wife \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG to help them clarify certain aspects of the case and to explain : ( a ) if PERSON had acted correctly by hospitalising the patient and by giving her the treatment he did ; ( b ) if the treatment with ORG was appropriate for the patient \u2019s condition and if the treatment had influenced the deterioration of her condition ; ( c ) what were the possible causes of the patient \u2019s death occurring soon afterwards ; ( d ) what would have been the patient \u2019s chances of survival , given her diagnosis , if the surgery had been performed as soon as her condition had deteriorated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , Dr GPE was heard in respect of the circumstances of his patient \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed ORG that given his patient \u2019s diagnosis Dr GPE had had a duty to carry out haemolysis and other blood tests in order to identify a state of pre - eclampsia , given that the patient had been hospitalised with sub icterus . In addition , the prompt treatment recommended in case of suspicion of GPE syndrome would have been the immediate evacuation of the pregnancy in order to avoid aggravation of the hepatic and vascular lesions . Furthermore , with careful monitoring of the mother and of the foetus as well as prompt treatment , the deaths might have been avoided . The fact that the patient reached ORG in GPE in a serious condition suggested inadequate monitoring . The absence of a diagnosis for DATE aggravated the patient \u2019s condition . Given the doctor \u2019s aforementioned duties , he should have been aware of the evolution of a state of preeclampsia , and he was obliged to exhaust all the available remedies to avoid it and treat it . The extremely low level of thrombocytes in the patient \u2019s blood in GPE was an important aid to a suspicion of this type of complication and an indication that prompt intervention was necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following Dr I.M. \u2019s objections , ORG reiterated before ORG attached to ORG in GPE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) the same questions raised before ORG on DATE , and asked it to help them clarify those aspects of the case and to provide explanations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , ORG asked ORG to provide its conclusions in respect of their request from DATE . It emphasised that the conclusions were necessary to solve the case , and that the victim \u2019s family had complained repeatedly before the domestic authorities about the lack of promptness of the criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained before the superior prosecutor attached to ORG that the criminal investigation lacked promptness and had failed to clarify the circumstances of the GPE deaths . She stated that the last written notification received concerning the case had been the information note of DATE . She also requested to be informed of the outcome of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that ORG had been asked to produce a forensic expert report in the case . The applicant was also informed that as soon as ORG report was available a lawful solution would be issued in respect of the case and that she would be notified about it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG approved the note ( avizul ) produced by ORG on DATE with additional explanations . In particular , it noted amongst other things that while she was in hospital the applicant \u2019s daughter stated that she had eaten forest mushrooms . At the time there was another patient in the hospital suffering from mushroom poisoning . This caused her medical condition to be blamed on the mushrooms , which delayed the Hellp syndrome diagnosis . It also noted that during the applicant \u2019s hospitalisation on the intensive therapy unit the applicant \u2019s daughter condition worsened . PERSON was contacted by phone and he suggested that the pregnancy should be evacuated . Given the patient \u2019s serious condition and the local intensive therapy possibilities ( posibilit\u0103\u021bile locale de terapie intensiv\u0103 ) , in order to solve the case , PERSON was contacted and he accepted that the patient be transferred to ORG . It further noted that according to the post - mortem report the patient had displayed symptoms of hepatic - nephritis and generalised haemorrhagic vasculopathy and subsequent cardio - respiratory insufficiency . It concluded that the actions of ORG staff could be explained from a medical standpoint , in the context of the patient \u2019s anamnesis and given that according to the information available and on the basis of the patient \u2019s symptoms they could have also concluded that the patient \u2019s condition had been caused by mushroom poisoning , and not by PERSON syndrome as turned out to be the case . There were similarities in the symptoms of the CARDINAL medical conditions .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG decided not to open criminal proceedings against PERSON for involuntary manslaughter , on the ground that such an unlawful act had not taken place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested information from ORG about the status of the criminal investigation and the measures taken in the case . She also accused the authorities investigating the case of procrastination and of waiting for Dr GPE \u2019s criminal liability to become time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG informed the applicant that the criminal investigation against Dr GPE had been terminated by the order of CARDINAL DATE , and that the aforementioned order had been communicated to her son - in - law . Also , it noted that the same information had been communicated to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant challenged the order of CARDINAL DATE before the superior prosecutor attached to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the superior prosecutor attached to ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s challenge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant challenged the orders of CARDINAL DATE and DATE as well as those of CARDINAL DATE and DATE before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined jurisdiction to examine the case in favour of ORG , on account of the nature of the offence under investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged a request with ORG seeking the transfer of the file to a different district court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s request and ordered the transfer of the file for examination to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the file was registered with ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s and her son - in - law \u2019s challenge against the order of CARDINAL DATE , cancelled the order , and referred the file back to the prosecutor \u2019s office for criminal proceedings to be opened against Dr GPE for involuntary manslaughter . The challenge to the order of DATE rendered by ORG was dismissed as lodged out of time .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the criminal investigation had not been complete , and that additional evidence was needed . It held that the decision not to open criminal proceedings had been based on the CARDINAL forensic expert reports , but forensic expert reports had in fact not been asked for by the investigating authorities and had not been produced in the case . The document produced on DATE was in fact a note of ORG in response to the investigating authorities\u2019 request for clarification of some aspects of the case . The aforementioned documents did not have the content of a forensic expert report produced according to law . The same considerations applied to the document issued by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the court , a forensic expert report was essential evidence in cases of suspected involuntary manslaughter and it was required when medical negligence had supposedly been the cause of death . Also , the content of ORG note of DATE which indicated a possible medical error by PERSON made a forensic expert report even more necessary .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that essential aspects of the case needed to be clarified , namely to establish the cause of death and to examine whether Dr GPE had administered medical treatment in accordance with his professional obligations , and , if such treatment had been inappropriate , whether this had had any causal link with the deaths of the applicant \u2019s daughter and grand - daughter . In addition , the question of whether the applicant \u2019s daughter had eaten forest mushrooms had not been entirely clarified . Dr GPE \u2019s statement that the applicant \u2019s daughter had eaten the aforementioned mushrooms had not been confirmed or rebutted by any other evidence . The information concerning the consumption of mushrooms found in the clinical observation chart was also added there by PERSON Furthermore , the reasons why the applicant \u2019s daughter was not accompanied by a doctor during her transfer by ambulance remained unclear . Consequently , the court ordered a forensic expert report to be produced which would establish whether : ( a ) the doctor had been diligent enough to correctly establish the diagnosis ; ( b ) the actual diagnosis had been established on the basis of the symptoms and the investigations made in the case ; ( c ) the correct diagnosis could have been established on the basis of supplementary tests and examinations which should have been performed ; ( d ) the medical treatment had been appropriate ; ( e ) the medical intervention should have been performed at ORG ; ( f ) the applicant \u2019s daughter \u2019s health had deteriorated during her transfer to the clinic in GPE because she was not assisted by a doctor throughout the transportation ; ( g ) any of the aspects above , or others , had any causal link with the death of the applicant \u2019s daughter and her new born granddaughter . If the expert report established a causal link between the death and the fact that the transfer by ambulance had not been done with a doctor present , the reason why the patient had not been accompanied by a doctor and the identity of those responsible should be established . Consequently , the medical staff responsible for the transfer by ambulance should be heard . The court also ordered that the notes on the clinical observation chart should be checked for accuracy against the doctor \u2019s statements regarding the consumption of forest mushrooms , and accordingly the victim \u2019s mother and husband should be heard .", "CARDINAL . ORG lodged an appeal on points of law ( recurs ) against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed ORG appeal on points of law and upheld the judgment of the district court .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , ORG decided not to open criminal proceedings against Dr GPE , on the ground that his criminal liability had become time - barred .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the order before the superior prosecutor . She argued amongst other things , that the investigating authorities had delayed the investigation of the case , although she had repeatedly asked for a speedy investigation . Also , she had not been notified without undue delay of the outcome of the criminal investigation , although on DATE ORG had informed her that she would be notified about the outcome of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the superior prosecutor attached to ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s challenge and upheld the order of DATE . It held amongst other things that the proceedings had not been abandoned by the authorities , since they had finished the investigation on CARDINAL DATE . The length of proceedings had been affected by the forensic expert reports , the last one being produced on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the order before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG declined jurisdiction in the case in favour of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the file was registered with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG considered that only LOC was competent ratione loci to examine the case . Consequently , it referred the case to ORG to examine and decide on the conflict of competence between the CARDINAL district courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG decided that ORG was competent to examine the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the file was registered once again with ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action as ill - founded and upheld the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s order . It held that according to the relevant criminal law provisions and given the nature of the offence he had been suspected of , Dr GPE \u2019s criminal liability had become time - barred DATE after the unfortunate event . The statute of limitations had not been suspended or interrupted by any act carried out in the case that had to be communicated to the accused ( \u020bnvinuitului ) or to the defendant ( inculpatului ) . Criminal proceedings against PERSON had not been opened and therefore he had not been considered either an accused or a defendant , as the investigation against him had been carried out at the preliminary investigation ( acte premerg\u0103toare ) stage of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the applicant \u2019s argument that an expert medical report could be requested only after a criminal investigation had been opened was not supported by any legal provision . Also , it could not be accepted that the running of the statutory limit had been stopped or suspended , either by the request for a medical expert report to be produced or by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The judgment of a court quashing an order of the prosecutor \u2019s office to discontinue a criminal investigation was not one of the lawfully permissible reasons to suspend the running of the statutory limit .", "CARDINAL . The court also held that ORG had been competent to investigate the case . The fact that ORG had transferred the case for examination to a different district court would not have justified an investigation of the case by a different prosecutor \u2019s office from the CARDINAL which had initially investigated the case , once the examining court had referred the case back to the prosecutor . Furthermore , the prosecutor was legally bound to open criminal proceedings only if , after the evidence indicated by the court was adduced to the file , it did not appear that there were circumstances that would impede it . Also , even if the prosecutor \u2019s office had taken into account the applicant \u2019s granddaughter \u2019s death and had requalified PERSON acts from involuntary manslaughter to aggravated involuntary manslaughter and the maximum penalty had been increased by DATE , the offence would still have been time - barred .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed as inadmissible the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , on the ground that the domestic legislation did not allow a second level of jurisdiction in respect of court proceedings initiated against the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s orders or decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following Dr GPE \u2019s request , ORG attached to ORG ( Comisia de Jursidic\u0163ie Profesional\u0103 a PERSON Suceava ) established that there were no elements to suggest medical error or other deficiencies in the medical treatment and investigations provided to the applicant \u2019s daughter at ORG . Her illness had been identified promptly once she was hospitalised , and she had been transferred to intensive care and afterwards to Ia\u015fi . However , the seriousness of her illness led to her death . In addition , there had been no other case before ORG in which PERSON had been accused of medical error or breaches of the code of medical ethics .", "CARDINAL .
