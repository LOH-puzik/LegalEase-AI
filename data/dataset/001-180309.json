HUNGARY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for private life)", "JUDGES": "Egidijus K\u016bris;Ganna Yudkivska;Iulia Motoc;Marko Bo\u0161njak;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Georges Ravarani", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . She is the widow of a well - known NORP poet , PERSON . They married in DATE , and their relationship , partly due to a significant difference in age , as well as their life and work , were constantly the subject of widespread media coverage . They often appeared in the tabloids .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s husband died in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE an article was published in a DATE newspaper , GPE , based on an interview with the applicant , revealing that she wanted to have a child who would be a blood relative of both her and her late husband and have the same intellect and attitude as him . The applicant explained that she envisaged her own sister and her late husband \u2019s grandson being the parents of that child .", "CARDINAL . Following some talks with the applicant , on DATE PERSON , at the material time the biggest DATE journal , republished the same story , adding that the late poet \u2019s grandson had dismissed the idea of having a child with the applicant \u2019s sister . The front page of the newspaper contained a photograph of the applicant with her late husband and the headline \u201c Trampling on the memory of PERSON . The widow does everything for the limelight \u201d . Despite a previous request by the applicant , the article made no mention of a book to be published on the applicant \u2019s late husband .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in reaction to a complaint by the applicant , the newspaper published an additional article on the book under publication ; however , it did not appear on the front page as the applicant \u2019s had presumably wished . The applicant asked for a further article to be published but the newspaper declined .", "CARDINAL . Dissatisfied , the applicant lodged a civil action against the publisher of the DATE newspaper under article CARDINAL of the ( old ) Civil Code , alleging a violation of her personality rights , in particular her right to reputation . She maintained that the headline published on DATE had negatively affected her public image . She sought an injunction against any further infringement of her right to reputation , an apology from the publisher and compensation for non - pecuniary damage in the amount of CARDINAL NORP forints ( ORG \u2013 CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the witnesses who gave evidence before the first - instance court , the applicant had been truly saddened by the way the article had presented her family plans , especially that her statements had been hurtful to the memory of her late husband . She had also received a lot of criticism from her acquaintances . In a judgment of DATE ORG granted an injunction against any further infringement , ordered a public apology and obliged the publisher to pay the applicant ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) in respect of non - pecuniary damage . The remainder of the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation was dismissed . The court established the following :", "\u201c .. the private life of the plaintiff and her late spouse was previously at the centre of media attention ... PERSON and the plaintiff have already shocked public opinion with the declaration of their love . It turned out that she seduced the poet from a man ... The poet - prince ( k\u00f6lt\u0151fejedelem ) happily introduced to the world his then yet unknown lover , who became his muse and who was DATE younger than him . The Kossuth Prize winner and internationally recognised poet had a tendency to push the boundaries , openly admitted his homosexual adventures and love affairs , and held that taboos were to be dismantled . Therefore , when the country just began to digest and accept his relationship with PERSON , the poet accepted an offer from ORG magazine , which has since closed down , agreeing to be presented in the magazine in high - quality erotic pictures with his lover ... [ The plaintiff ] had even been subject of numerous hurtful and degrading remarks and attacks during PERSON life . The media echoed that opinion , doubting her true feelings towards her husband , and some of the publications stressed that theirs was a marriage of convenience ... They planned to adopt a child during the poet \u2019s lifetime , but since that plan failed , PERSON came up with the idea of having a child through his son , but since his son was terminally ill , that plan could not go ahead either .", "...", "... the plaintiff \u2019s idea can be said to be bizarre and eccentric , nonetheless , how she has spoken about childbearing does not , following the rules of formal logic , mean that she has trampled on her husband \u2019s memory .", "Based on the witness statements and the role the plaintiff \u2019s late husband played in public life , the court concluded that the applicant \u2019s idea about childbearing was not contrary to the thinking of PERSON ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG added that both the applicant and her late husband had unusual , provocative personalities and ways of thinking , and the statement according to which she had infringed her late husband \u2019s memory did not correspond to reality and was unjustifiably hurtful . According to the court , statements in a front page headline constituted journalistic opinion , and were protected by the right to freedom of expression , as long as they were not devoid of any factual basis and did not amount to a blatantly humiliating or offensive value judgment . The court concluded that the statement that the applicant did everything for the limelight had not infringed her personality rights , whereas the statement that she had trampled on her husband \u2019s memory had infringed her right to reputation and dignity ( CARDINAL . ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reversed the previous judgment finding an infringement of the applicant \u2019s reputation and dismissed her action in its entirety . The court reiterated ORG case - law on the different fundamental rights at stake , pointing out that even shocking , disturbing or inaccurate opinions were protected by the right to freedom of expression and were not susceptible of proof . It also stressed that statements should be assessed in context and with regard to their background . The court explained in detail that the applicant and her husband had triggered controversial reactions and \u201c everyday people with an average mindset \u201d would have had an opinion on their relationship and marriage . It held that the headline was not a statement of fact but a value judgment expressed in connection with the applicant \u2019s own \u201c peculiar \u201d statements . According to the court , the main issue at stake was whether , in the light of the applicant \u2019s own conduct \u201c diverging from the widelyaccepted social and ethical norms \u201d , the statement could be regarded as unreasonably hurtful and humiliating .", "The court also found that the headline could not have infringed the applicant \u2019s reputation since her own statements were irrational and undignified , putting PERSON grandson in an embarrassing situation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a petition for review with the LOC . In a judgment of DATE , the GPE endorsed the finding of the second - instance court that the headline did not constitute a statement of fact but a value judgment concerning the unusual manner in which the applicant intended to start a family . Since it was not devoid of factual basis , it could not be considered humiliating , hurtful or offensive and as such had not infringed the applicant \u2019s dignity . The court nonetheless stated that it was irrelevant whether the applicant \u2019s previous unconventional conduct justified the value judgment ( PERSON .
