The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the editor - in - chief of a regional newspaper \u201c LOC FAC \u201d . On DATE the newspaper published an editorial under the heading \u201c ORG stealthily approaches PERSON .

The article was signed with the pseudonym of ORG . Mr PERSON was the governor of the PERSON region and the applicant 's competitor in the election to that office in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The article lamented the decision by a majority of members of the PERSON town legislative body to change the procedure of appointment of the town 's mayor : the mayor would no longer be elected by the town 's residents , but appointed by the town legislature . The publication alleged that the decision had been taken under pressure from Mr PERSON :", "\u201c [ Members of the legislature ] were requested [ to make the decision ] by the governor himself , who attended the session , accompanied by many of his advisors , to try to persuade those in attendance ...", "From that moment on , each member of the legislature has been caught in a web of sale - and - purchase transactions . We can only speculate what wonders they will be promised by ORG 's representatives . CARDINAL thing is sure , nobody will offer the legislators more than the governor himself ...", "Each member of the legislature will get his share and consume it on the sly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article concluded with a critical appraisal of the governor as politician and manager :", "\u201c Having miraculously escaped defeat in the governor 's DATE only because the regional elites failed to reach an agreement and nominate a passable candidate DATE and having avoided , for the same reason , the formation of a powerful opposition in the regional legislature , our loud and ambitious , but completely incapable governor is about to lay his hands on [ the town of GPE ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor 's office of GPE granted the request of Governor PERSON and initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant for dissemination of defamatory statements in the mass - media ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator ordered a linguistic examination of the publication . The examination was performed on DATE by Mr B. , a professional journalist with degrees in language studies and law , teaching at ORG and ORG of ORG . The expert came to the following conclusion :", "\u201c General conclusion : The text of the article submitted for examination ... conveys in a rather harsh and emotional form the author 's opinion and his judgments on the role of LOC governor , PERSON , in the forthcoming election of the PERSON town mayor . The text does not contain any words or expressions that are insulting for the governor , with the exception of the controversial description ' incapable ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The expert admitted that certain sentences conveyed a negative attitude towards the managerial abilities of the governor ; however , he asserted , the publication did not contain any allegations about violations of laws , including electoral laws , by the governor or any statements damaging his professional reputation . The expert also pointed out , referring to an academic article by the FAC town prosecutor , that ideas , opinions and value - judgments were not subject to a court - ordered refutation for being untrue , and the aggrieved person should instead exercise his right to a reply in the same medium .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant was charged with criminal defamation involving an allegation about the commission of a serious crime ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) and with publicly insulting a ORG official in connection with the performance of his duties ( LAW ) . The case was referred to a court .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before the court the applicant pleaded not guilty . He maintained that the publication in question had not contained any statements of fact , which could be declared untrue .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON asserted that the statements in the publication to the effect that he had obtained a decision from the town legislature through bribes and that he had had a narrow escape at the DATE election , as well as a reference to him as being \u201c completely incapable \u201d , were libellous and damaging to his honour , dignity and professional reputation .", "CARDINAL . The court heard evidence from CARDINAL members of the PERSON town legislature , who denied that they had been offered any goods or benefits by the governor in exchange for their consent to the mayor 's appointment . The governor 's advisors testified in the same vein .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Stavropol delivered a judgment in the applicant 's case . In the judgment the court rejected the conclusions of the linguistic examination of DATE on the ground that the report was a \u201c subjective appraisal \u201d by PERSON of the publication and , in addition , that it had not been shown that ORG or PERSON had had a licence to carry out linguistic examinations . The court substituted its own assessment of the article 's contents :", "\u201c The court considers that the article contains not judgments and assumptions , as asserted by the defence , but precisely statements of fact ... because the article specifies when , where and under what circumstances the decision on amendments to the PERSON town charter was made and what the result of the voting was . The use of the future tense and infinitives in the text of the article is the author 's way of writing and it does not indicate that the discourse is about hypothetical future events ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court further held that it was not possible to establish who had been the author of the article . The prosecution had not proven that it had been written by the applicant . However , he was responsible for its publication in the newspaper of which he was the editor .", "CARDINAL . The court found as follows :", "\u201c The disseminated defamatory statements damage the honour and dignity of LOC governor PERSON , undermine his professional reputation , and accuse him of a serious crime . The repeated statements that ' each member of the legislature has been caught in a web of sale - and - purchase transactions ' , that ' they will be promised wonders by ORG 's representatives ' , that ' nobody will offer the legislators more than the governor himself ' , and that each member of the legislature ' will get his share and consume it on the sly ' accuse the governor PERSON of bribing the members of the legislature for adoption of a desired decision . The statements that each member of the legislature has been caught in ' a web of sale - and - purchase transactions ' and each member of the legislature ' will get his share ' accuse Mr PERSON of bribing each member of the legislature who took part in the adoption of the decision , that is of a serious criminal offence under LAW , repeatedly committed [ emphasis in the original ] .", "[ The applicant 's ] statements that Mr Chernogorov ' has miraculously escaped defeat in the governor 's election only because the regional elites failed to reach an agreement ' and ' nominate a passable candidate ' are also untrue , and [ the applicant ] knew that they were untrue . Being himself a candidate in the DATE elections of ORG governor , [ the applicant ] could not be ignorant of the election results , in which Mr ORG polled MONEY more votes than the other candidates ... This result does not permit concluding that Mr PERSON has ' miraculously ' won the elections . [ The applicant ] disseminated untrue statements that Mr Chernogorov 's election as LOC governor had not been the product of an informed choice of a majority of the Region residents but had been brought about accidentally because of lack of consent between certain ' regional elites ' . Those statements damage the reputation of the legitimately elected governor among the Region residents , denigrate and belittle his person .", "The court considers that [ the applicant 's ] statement that ' our loud and ambitious , but completely incapable governor is about to lay his hands on [ the town of PERSON ] ' was also an untrue statement damaging Mr ORG 's honour and dignity and undermining his reputation . No one has ever established that Mr Chernogorov was incapable in the legal sense of this term . Moreover , as the Region residents re - elected Mr PERSON as LOC governor for a second term , it can not be concluded that Mr ORG is a ' completely incapable governor ' in the sense of incapability to act . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court found the applicant guilty of defamation . However , the applicant was acquitted of publicly insulting a ORG official because , in the court 's opinion , the publication did not contain cynical or obscene language in respect of the governor .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was given a suspended sentence of DATE imprisonment , conditional on DATE probation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his lawyer appealed against the conviction to ORG . Their grounds of appeal invoked , in particular , LAW and referred to the special place of journalistic freedom in a democratic society and wider limits of criticism in respect of a public figure , which LOC governor undeniably was . The applicant 's lawyer also complained about the first - instance court 's refusal to accept the linguistic examination report on the pretext that the expert did not have the required licence , whilst domestic law did not provide for such a requirement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG upheld the judgment of DATE . ORG did not address the applicability of LAW or the first - instance court 's decision not to admit the linguistic examination report in evidence .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW of the Russian Federation guarantees freedom of ideas and expression , as well as freedom of the mass - media .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of GPE defines defamation as dissemination of information known to be untrue that damages the honour and dignity of another person or undermines the person 's reputation .
