On DATE the ORG of ORG quashed the judgments of DATE and CARDINAL DATE by way of supervisory review and remitted the claim for fresh consideration . The ORG 's decision was set aside by ORG of GPE on DATE . However , on DATE ORG Presidium re - examined the supervisory - review application , quashed the earlier judgments and ordered a new examination of the applicant 's claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted a small portion of the applicant 's claims to the amount of MONEY and rejected the remainder . On DATE ORG adopted a supplementary judgment , by which it declared the deposit agreement , in relation to the right of ORG to change unilaterally the interest rate , invalid . On DATE ORG rejected an appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a claim against ORG , seeking compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages incurred through the inappropriate administration of justice , and notably the excessive length of proceedings in respect of his claim against ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant 's claim . Referring to ORG Ruling of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG noted that ORG had not yet adopted a law determining jurisdiction over claims concerning ORG liability for the damage caused by a court 's or judge 's failure to adjudicate a case within a reasonable time , and dismissed the claim in the following terms :", "\u201c According to LAW , the rules of civil procedure in federal courts of general jurisdiction are determined by LAW , LAW , LAW and other federal laws .", "The law has not determined the territorial and subject - matter jurisdiction over civil claims for compensation of damages incurred in civil proceedings in cases where a dispute has not been heard on the merits as a consequence of unlawful acts ( or failures to act ) of a court ( a judge ) , including the breach of a reasonable - time guarantee .", "The court must dismiss the statement of claim if there are grounds listed in LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , that is if the claim may not be examined in civil proceedings and if the court is not competent to examine the claim . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision to dismiss the applicant 's claim , finding as follows :", "\u201c In dismissing the claim , the judge correctly stated that the law had not determined the territorial and subject - matter jurisdiction over civil claims for compensation of damages incurred in civil proceedings in cases where a dispute had not been heard on the merits as a consequence of unlawful acts ( or failures to act ) of a court ( a judge ) , including the breach of a reasonable - time guarantee .", "Under these circumstances , the [ ORG ] finds no grounds for quashing that decision . Since the judge reached the conclusion that the claim may not be examined in civil proceedings , the reference to LAW must be deleted [ as being superfluous ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG of GPE , respectively , refused the applicant 's requests for the institution of supervisory - review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code contains general provisions on liability for the infliction of damage . It establishes that damage inflicted on the person or property of an individual shall be reimbursed in full by the person who inflicted the damage ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code determines liability for the damage caused by unlawful actions of law - enforcement authorities or courts . In particular , it is established that the federal or regional treasury shall be liable for the damage sustained by an individual in the framework of the administration of justice provided that the judge 's guilt has been established in a final criminal conviction ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . By Ruling no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG found that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW was compatible with LAW in so far as it provided for special conditions on State liability for the damage caused in the framework of administration of justice . It clarified , nevertheless , that the term \u201c administration of justice \u201d did not cover the judicial proceedings in their entirety , but only extended to judicial acts touching upon the merits of a case . Other judicial acts \u2013 mainly of a procedural nature DATE fell outside the scope of the notion \u201c administration of justice \u201d . State liability for the damage caused by such procedural acts or failures to act , such as a breach of the reasonable length of court proceedings , could arise even in the absence of a final criminal conviction of a judge if the fault of the judge has been established in civil proceedings . ORG emphasised , moreover , that the constitutional right to compensation by the ORG for the damage should not be tied in with the personal fault of a judge . An individual should be able to obtain compensation for any damage incurred through a violation by a court of his or her right to a fair trial within the meaning of LAW . ORG held that ORG should legislate on the grounds and procedure for compensation by the ORG for the damage caused by unlawful acts or failures to act of a court or a judge and determine territorial and subject - matter jurisdiction over such claims .", "CARDINAL . The RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure ( in force at the material time ) established that a civil claim should be dismissed , by a single judge , in particular , if it was not amenable to examination in civil proceedings ( Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) or if the court was not competent to examine it ( Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
