It is still generally accepted DATE and this court has consistently held ... DATE that the accused must be assisted by counsel ... The purpose of the defence in criminal proceedings is not merely to assist the accused but also to serve the interests of justice ... LAW implies that an accused can not defend himself in person ; that assertion has already been upheld by ORG and ORG ... Even where the accused has had appropriate legal training , statute law requires him to be assisted by counsel , who will be required to retain his composure , since it may be assumed that the accused would display a certain degree of agitation which would be harmful to his case and to the proper administration of justice ... It follows that , where purely technical steps need to be taken by the defence , counsel can not be replaced by the accused , even if the latter is a lawyer .

Administrative fines may not in any circumstances be replaced by a custodial sentence . They may only give rise to enforcement proceedings ( LAW ) . Lastly , Legislative Decree no .
