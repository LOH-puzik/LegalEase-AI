The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was convicted , among other offences , of numerous counts of joint burglary committed in companies and shops and was imprisoned from DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG convicted the applicant of trafficking in drugs ( hashish and cocaine ) and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The applicant was in pre - trial detention and served his sentence from DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was arrested and placed in pre - trial detention on suspicion of drug trafficking ; he has remained in prison since then .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment dated CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant of unauthorised importing of drugs and of drug trafficking committed in DATE and involving QUANTITY of hashish . It sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It decided not to order the applicant \u2019s preventive detention under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) as it was not convinced that the applicant was dangerous to the public owing to a disposition to commit serious offences . In this assessment , the court took into consideration that the applicant had not attempted to avert his punishment by lodging numerous procedural motions and had agreed to the forfeiture of money stemming from drug trafficking . The applicant claimed that he had struck a deal with ORG on the latter \u2019s proposal that the court would impose a sentence of DATE and would not order his preventive detention if he ceased to contest the court \u2019s finding of fact . The Government submitted that there was no indication in the case - file that such an agreement had been made .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment dated DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant on points of law . It allowed an appeal by the prosecution regarding ORG decision not to order the applicant \u2019s preventive detention and quashed the judgment in this respect as ORG had not given valid reasons for considering the applicant not to be dangerous to the public .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment dated DATE a different chamber of ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s ( first ) indefinite preventive detention pursuant to LAW . Having consulted a psychiatric expert and having regard to the applicant \u2019s personality and his previous convictions , the court considered that the applicant had a disposition to commit serious offences , was likely to commit further serious drug offences and was thus dangerous to the public .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision dated DATE ORG dismissed as ill - founded an appeal by the applicant on points of law , in which the latter had complained that provisions of substantive law had not been complied with ( allgemeine Sachr\u00fcge ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , without being represented by counsel , lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against the CARDINAL judgments of ORG and the judgment and the decision of ORG . He complained , in particular , that preventive detention was incompatible with his right to liberty under LAW , which did not cover such a preventive measure . It further violated the prohibition of retrospective punishment under LAW because it was incompatible with the principle of legal certainty and because his preventive detention had been ordered without a maximum duration of DATE , which had been the maximum penalty at the time he committed his offences . Furthermore , his right to a fair trial had been breached in that the domestic courts had not subsequently respected the deal struck with ORG that he would not further contest the court \u2019s finding of facts in exchange for the court not ordering his preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG found that in so far as the applicant complained about the judgment of ORG of DATE and that of ORG of DATE , he had lodged his constitutional complaint out of time . In so far as the applicant complained that ORG order for his preventive detention in its judgment of DATE lacked a valid legal basis and was arbitrary , his complaint was inadmissible for non - exhaustion of domestic remedies . The court found that the applicant had failed to submit his statement of the grounds of his appeal on points of law nor had he claimed before it that he had complained about the unconstitutionality of the amended provisions on preventive detention and about their application by ORG to him before ORG , at least by complaining that provisions of substantive law had not been complied with .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG , acting as the court dealing with the execution of sentences , having heard the applicant in person , ordered the applicant \u2019s placement in preventive detention as of CARDINAL DATE ( Article LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , that is , as from DATE on which the applicant would have served his full prison sentence . The court fully agreed with the findings of a psychiatric and psychotherapeutic expert it had consulted on the applicant \u2019s dangerousness . In his report dated DATE the expert , having examined the applicant , had considered that , if released , the applicant was very likely to commit further serious offences similar to those he had previously committed . He was still dangerous to the public as he had to date failed to reflect sufficiently on his numerous offences . Even assuming that the security measures taken against him by the prison authorities had not been justified , this did not alter the fact that there had not been a consistent treatment limiting the risk that he would reoffend after his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected an objection ( NORP ) by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and ORG decision of DATE . By submissions dated DATE he extended his complaint to ORG decision of DATE . He claimed , in particular , that the order to place him in preventive detention disproportionately interfered with his right to liberty . He argued that the expert report on which the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had relied had not been drawn up in due form , that the courts had failed to give convincing reasons , in view of his mostly less serious previous convictions , why he was likely to commit further serious offences if released and that he had been refused relaxations in the conditions of his detention without convincing reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It found , in particular , that the decisions of the courts dealing with the execution of sentences to order the applicant \u2019s placement in preventive detention had not violated the applicant \u2019s right to liberty . ORG found that ORG assessment that the applicant had repeatedly committed serious offences was not arbitrary as the latter had been sentenced to CARDINAL term of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and DATE . The expert report , which was of DATE , was sufficiently substantiated . In so far as the applicant had been refused relaxations in the conditions of his detention , ORG noted that the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had not based their decision to order preventive detention globally on the fact that the applicant had failed to prove that he was no longer dangerous in the course of such relaxations . If the prison authorities refused to grant the applicant relaxations in the conditions of his detention in the future , the applicant had to raise this issue with the competent lower courts first . In view of the ORG assessment that the applicant was likely to commit further serious offences if released , their finding that the interest in public safety prevailed over the applicant \u2019s right to liberty had been proportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , acting as the court dealing with the execution of sentences , refused to suspend the execution of the preventive detention order against the applicant on probation . That decision was confirmed on appeal .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) . The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows :", "CARDINAL . The sentencing court may , at the time of the offender \u2019s conviction , order his preventive detention , a socalled measure of correction and prevention , under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence , a penalty , if the offender has been shown to be dangerous to the public ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied . Firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public ( see LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that if a term of imprisonment is executed prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention , the court responsible for the execution of sentences ( that is , a special ORG composed of CARDINAL professional judges , see sections ORG and CARDINAL ) of LAW ) must review , before completion of the prison term , whether the person \u2019s preventive detention is still necessary in view of its objective . If that is not the case , it suspends on probation the execution of the preventive detention order ; supervision of the person \u2019s conduct commences with suspension .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in its version in force prior to DATE , the first placement in preventive detention may not exceed DATE . If the maximum duration has expired , the detainee shall be released ( Article QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW was amended by the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other LAW of DATE , which entered into force on DATE . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , in its amended version , provided that if a person has spent DATE in preventive detention , the court shall declare the measure terminated ( only ) if there is no danger that the detainee will , owing to his criminal tendencies , commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims . Termination shall automatically entail supervision of the conduct of the offender . The former maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention was abolished . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to LAW , the amended version of Article CARDINAL of LAW was to be applied without any restriction ratione temporis .", "CARDINAL . Under the well - established case - law of ORG , a complainant is obliged to submit to that court , within the onemonth time - limit running from the notification of the impugned court decision , either a copy of the impugned decisions and of all documents necessary for their understanding or at least to set out their content in a manner allowing for a control of their constitutionality ( see , inter alia , the decisions of ORG of DATE , file no . DATE , Collection of the decisions of ORG ) , vol . CARDINAL ( DATE ) , pp . CARDINAL ss . , CARDINAL ; of DATE , file CARDINAL . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , CARDINAL , Collection of the decisions of ORG , vol . DATE ) , pp . CARDINAL ss . , FAC ; confirmed , for instance , by a decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . No distinction was made in these decisions between complainants who were and those who were not represented by counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the ORG preventive detention beyond the former DATE maximum period ( compare the provisions in paragraphs QUANTITY - CARDINAL above ) and about the retrospective order of the ORG preventive detention respectively ( file nos . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG held that all provisions on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective order of such detention were incompatible with LAW as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law , read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all provisions of LAW on the imposition and duration of preventive detention at issue were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of the persons in preventive detention because those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment ( PERSON ) . These provisions included , in particular , LAW in its version in force since DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with LAW remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until DATE at the most . In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged or ordered retrospectively , the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned , owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct , were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if , additionally , they suffered from a mental disorder . As regards the notion of mental disorder , ORG explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of \u201c persons of unsound mind \u201d in LAW sub - paragraph ( e ) of the LAW made in this ORG \u2019s case - law . If the above pre - conditions were not met , those detainees had to be released no later than DATE . The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be further applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality ; as a general rule , proportionality was only respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , ORG stressed that the fact that the LAW stood above the LAW in the domestic hierarchy of norms was not an obstacle to an international and NORP dialogue between the courts , but was , on the contrary , its normative basis in view of the fact that the LAW was to be interpreted in a manner that was open to public international law ( v\u00f6lkerrechtsfreundliche GPE ) . In its reasoning , ORG relied on the interpretation of LAW made by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
