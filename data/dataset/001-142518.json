The applicants were each targeted in undercover operations conducted by the police in the form of a test purchase of drugs under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Operational - Search Activities Act of CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL-FZ ) . Those operations led to their criminal conviction for drug dealing .", "CARDINAL . The facts of each individual criminal case , as submitted by the parties , are summarised below . The applicants disagreed with the Government on the underlying causes and the circumstances leading to the test purchases , and where this is so both versions are given . As regards the factual details of the covert operations , it is common ground that the applicants knowingly procured drugs in the course of the test purchases .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are brothers . At the time of arrest they were vendors working in a video- and audio - rental kiosk . At the time of lodging their applications they were serving prison sentences in correctional GPE following their criminal conviction in respect of which they lodged these applications .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG ( GPE , the drugs police ) received information from an undisclosed source that the applicants were involved in drug dealing . On that basis the police decided that an undercover policeman , X , would infiltrate the group and carry out test purchases of cannabis from the applicants .", "CARDINAL . It is undisputed by the parties that X approached PERSON through an acquaintance and asked him whether he could supply him with cannabis . The parties differ as to whether PERSON agreed to do so . According to the Government , which relied on X \u2019s testimony , PERSON had readily agreed to supply him with cannabis . According to the applicants , he had replied that he did not have any but could ask his dealer who occasionally passed by his kiosk .", "CARDINAL . The applicants contended that after that conversation X had called PERSON repeatedly to ask if he had cannabis . PERSON thought that X was a drug user , and being a cannabis smoker himself he decided to help him . When the dealer eventually came to the kiosk PERSON asked him to supply cannabis for X as well , and when the dealer agreed the applicant called X back to tell him . He bought the cannabis for X with money borrowed from the kiosk cash till which he refunded after X had paid him back . On that occasion it was PERSON who had passed the parcel to X at his brother \u2019s request . After that , X had continued to call PERSON regularly . In total PERSON had bought cannabis for X on CARDINAL occasions , all of which had been test purchases .", "CARDINAL . The official records of the CARDINAL test purchases contain the following account . On DATE undercover policeman PERSON was assigned to carry out the first test purchase of cannabis from the applicants . He was given MONEY ( RUB ) in banknotes that had been photocopied . He met the applicants at the kiosk , they went inside and he purchased QUANTITY of cannabis . PERSON took the money and PERSON handed him a paper bag with the drug inside . He asked the applicants if he could come back for more in future , and they confirmed that he could . Afterwards , he handed the cannabis to the police . The second test purchase took place on DATE , allegedly following a phone call from PERSON telling X that he had obtained the cannabis . After being given RUB CARDINAL that had been photocopied X called PERSON to arrange a meeting , picked him up in town and drove to the kiosk where he purchased QUANTITY of cannabis wrapped in paper . Afterwards , he handed the packet of cannabis to the police . The third test purchase took place on DATE , this time for RUB CARDINAL . X pre - arranged it by telephone , then left the money at the kiosk with another vendor and came back later to get the drugs from PERSON , who gave him QUANTITY of cannabis which X then handed over to the police .", "CARDINAL . NORP The telephone communications between X and the applicants were not recorded or intercepted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police searched the kiosk and seized QUANTITY of cannabis wrapped in newspaper and a cut - off plastic bottle with paper foil inside , which was allegedly a device for smoking cannabis . The applicants were arrested and charged with procuring large quantities of narcotic drugs , acting in conspiracy , and illegally possessing drugs .", "CARDINAL . The case was examined at first instance by ORG of Stavropol . The applicants pleaded guilty in part , but claimed that they had committed the crime as a result of police entrapment . They pointed out that there had been no evidence of their prior involvement in drug dealing . They maintained that PERSON had only exceptionally agreed to assist X in acquiring the drugs because he believed that he was a cannabis smoker like himself . As regards PERSON , he had not been directly involved in the transactions with X , although he knew that his brother had occasionally smoked cannabis .", "CARDINAL . The court cross - examined X , whose identity had been disclosed , and the witnesses , who gave a detailed account of the test purchases . The court also examined the video recordings of the first CARDINAL test purchases .", "CARDINAL . X testified that he had infiltrated the group in order to verify operational information received by the drugs police concerning the supplying of cannabis . He had approached the applicant at a party asking if it was possible to obtain any , and the applicant had agreed to help . Defence counsel asked whether X had been aware that the law prohibited incitement to commit criminal offences , but the judge rejected the question as irrelevant .", "CARDINAL . The court also cross - examined S , an operations officer who had been in charge of the undercover operation . He testified that the police had received information from an undisclosed source that the applicants were selling drugs . He testified that the information had not come from X , but refused to provide any details on the grounds that it was classified information . He testified that X had been instructed to infiltrate the group but had not been obliged to disclose his methods of undercover work and had not reported back to his superior about the manner of his communications with the applicants prior to , and between , the test purchases . In particular , he did not know and was not interested in how X had come to an agreement with the applicants about supplying the drugs . He did not know whether the transaction had been initiated by CARDINAL one of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Stavropol convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced PERSON to DATE and PERSON to DATE imprisonment . The applicants appealed , pleading , in particular , police entrapment and alleging that the results of the test purchases had to be excluded from the body of evidence as unlawfully obtained . They contested the allegation that the police had had information indicating that they had previously sold drugs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , without expressly addressing the allegation of entrapment , and upheld the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor of the Stavropol Region lodged a request for supervisory review of the case on the grounds that the operational - search activity against the applicants had ceased to be lawful after the first test purchase , which had yielded sufficient proof of their criminal activity . The Deputy Prosecutor considered that the police should have instituted criminal proceedings immediately after the episode of DATE and that therefore the second and third episodes constituted entrapment contrary to ORG . Those episodes should therefore be excluded from the grounds of their conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG dismissed the prosecutor \u2019s request and refused to reopen the criminal proceedings in the ORG case , having dismissed the arguments concerning entrapment .", "CARDINAL . On an unidentified date the Deputy Prosecutor General of GPE lodged a request for supervisory review of the case on essentially the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidium of ORG granted the request . It found that the first test purchase had been carried out on the basis of operational information that QUANTITY persons , PERSON and PERSON , had been selling cannabis . During the test purchase that information had been confirmed and at the same time the criminal offence had been committed , which was sufficient to bring charges . There had been no need for any further test purchases as these had not been aimed at investigating the chain of supply of drugs . The second and third episodes were therefore to be considered as intentional incitement to commit the drug offences . The evidence relating to those CARDINAL episodes was declared inadmissible and excluded from the grounds of the applicants\u2019 conviction . PERSON sentence was commuted to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , and PERSON sentence remained unchanged .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is a drug user . He claims to have become a heroin addict in prison where he was serving his first sentence . At the time of his arrest he was unemployed . At the time of lodging his application he was serving his third prison sentence in a correctional colony following his criminal conviction in respect of which he lodged this application .", "CARDINAL . According to the official version , the drugs police received operational information that the applicant was selling drugs . The Government claimed that the drugs police had been keeping a file on the applicant \u2019s involvement in drug dealing for DATE prior to the test purchase . On DATE the interception of his mobile phone was authorised by a court . On the basis of that preliminary information , on DATE the police decided to carry out a test purchase of heroin from the applicant .

When the dealer brought the drug the applicant paid him with \u201c PERSON \u2019s \u201d cash . He then reimbursed \u201c PERSON \u201d RUB CARDINAL and they consumed part of the heroin together . \u201c PERSON \u201d took the remaining heroin away with him .", "CARDINAL . After the test purchase a search was carried out at the applicant \u2019s flat . No money was found , but the police seized an empty sachet with traces of heroin , a piece of cotton wool soaked in heroin and an empty syringe , also with traces of heroin . The applicant was charged with drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . The Moskovskiy District Court of Cheboksary examined the case at first instance . The applicant denied having been involved in drug dealing . He pleaded guilty to having acquired heroin on behalf of \u201c PERSON \u201d but explained that he had only done so because of the arrangement to consume it together , as he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms . He alleged that he had committed the offence as a result of entrapment .", "CARDINAL . \u201c PERSON \u201d was called as a witness and examined during the trial , although his identity was kept secret . He testified that he had called the applicant asking him to supply him with heroin and that he had purchased CARDINAL sachets of the drug at the applicant \u2019s flat . When cross - examined , \u201c PERSON \u201d refused to answer the following questions : whether he knew the applicant ; whether he knew the applicant \u2019s heroin dealer ; whether he knew that the dealer was coming after he had left the money with the applicant ; whether it was his initiative to conduct a test purchase from the applicant ; whether he had previously bought drugs from the applicant ; and whether he had previously been arrested by the drugs police .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the first - instance court found the applicant guilty of selling drugs and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , having found him to be a serial offender . In its judgment the court relied , among other evidence , on the transcripts of the applicant \u2019s intercepted telephone calls which had taken place between him and \u201c PERSON \u201d during the transaction on DATE . It noted that the audio recording had confirmed receipt of the money and that the applicant had given drugs to the informant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on the grounds , inter alia , that he had been convicted of an offence committed as a result of police entrapment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , upholding , in substance , the first - instance judgment . At the same time it reclassified the offence as attempted sale , having reduced the sentence to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidium of ORG examined a request by the applicant for supervisory review and decided that the applicant was not a serial offender . It reduced the applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment and upheld the remainder of the earlier judicial decisions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a drug user . At the time of her arrest she was unemployed .

On TIME the drugs police conducted CARDINAL test purchases whereby the applicant first procured QUANTITY of cannabis for police informant \u201c LOC and CARDINAL a half hours later procured QUANTITY of cannabis for an undercover police officer , \u201c PERSON \u201d . The parties differ as to the reasons for ordering the test purchases and as to the circumstances in which the applicant had agreed to procure the drugs . According to the Government , the drugs police had been in possession of operational information from an undisclosed but reliable source that the applicant was trafficking in cannabis . According to the applicant , the police had had no preliminary information about her alleged criminal activity and had ordered the test purchase without a valid reason . She claimed that she had procured drugs for the undercover agents as a result of entrapment .", "CARDINAL .

A forensic report also confirmed that at the time of arrest the applicant had been under the influence of opiates .", "CARDINAL . The court asked the prosecutor if the investigating authorities had had any classified information incriminating the applicant . The prosecutor replied that all confidential material relating to the conduct of the test purchase had been disclosed . However , when the court subsequently examined the police officers they testified that , prior to the test purchase , the police had received operational information that the applicant was selling cannabis at RUB CARDINAL per box , but they could not name the source or expand on that information at the hearing because the information remained confidential .", "CARDINAL . \u201c LOC and \u201c PERSON \u201d were called as witnesses and were examined during the trial , although their identity was kept secret .", "CARDINAL .

He had met the applicant in DATE and she had asked him if he was taking drugs . He stated that the applicant had offered to buy him drugs but could not remember in what circumstances . He had then reported on her to the drugs police , who had decided to carry out a test purchase in which he would act as a buyer . The transaction had taken place inside the entrance to a block of flats , and the applicant had handed him CARDINAL sachets of cannabis . When cross - examined , he denied having consumed drugs with the applicant during the test purchase .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that she was a cannabis smoker but had never been involved in drug dealing . She pleaded guilty to having acquired cannabis on behalf of \u201c NORP \u201d but explained that she had only done so exceptionally and as result of entrapment . She testified that she had met \u201c PERSON when she was renting a room in his flat . She knew that he was a drug user and they had once smoked cannabis together . On CARDINAL occasion he had told her that he wanted to overcome his addiction to strong drugs and needed some \u201c weed \u201d to ease the withdrawal pains .
