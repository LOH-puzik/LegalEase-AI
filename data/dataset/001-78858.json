{"ITEMID": "001-78858", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "VAN DER VELDEN v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "On DATE the ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) found the applicant guilty of having committed CARDINAL bank robberies and of having stolen CARDINAL cars . It convicted him of extortion and theft by means of breaking and entering , and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . It further ordered his confinement in a custodial clinic ( terbeschikkingstelling met bevel tot verpleging van overheidswege ) . In its decision to issue this order , ORG had regard to CARDINAL reports drawn up by a neuropsychologist and a psychiatrist , according to whom the risk of the applicant reoffending was high .", "In view of the applicant \u2019s extortion conviction , and pursuant to section CARDINAL in conjunction with section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the DNA Testing ( Convicted Persons ) Act ( Wet DNA - onderzoek bij veroordeelden ; \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , the public prosecutor , on DATE , ordered that cellular material be taken from the applicant \u2013 who was at that time detained in a penitentiary institution in GPE \u2013 in order for his DNA profile to be determined . A mouth swab was taken from the applicant on DATE .", "The applicant lodged an objection ( verweerschrift ) against the decision to have his DNA profile determined and processed , that is , entered into the national DNA database . He submitted that his DNA profile had never played any role in the investigation of the offences of which he had been convicted . Although it was true that he had threatened to use violence , he had never actually done so . He was therefore of the opinion that his DNA profile could not serve any useful purpose in the prevention , detection , prosecution and trial of criminal offences he might have committed . According to the applicant , the determination and storage of his DNA profile amounted to the imposition of an additional penalty after he had already been convicted , and moreover on the basis of a law which was not in force at the time of his conviction . He alleged a breach of LAW . He further relied on the right to respect for his private life as guaranteed by LAW , arguing that , even having regard to the interests of public order and of the prevention of crime , there was no strict necessity in his case for the authorities to have his DNA profile at their disposal . Finally , there was no single good reason why the applicant had to be distinguished from other persons in the GPE who were not required to have their DNA profile entered into the national database . To this extent there was thus discrimination as prohibited by LAW .", "Having heard the public prosecutor and counsel for the applicant , ORG dismissed the objection on DATE . It considered that the exception contained in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of the LAW ( see below ) did not apply : the applicant had a lengthy criminal record and CARDINAL confinement orders imposed on him were still in place . It did not follow from the fact that no DNA profile of the applicant had been drawn up in previous investigations that his DNA could not serve any investigatory interests at the present time . Moreover , it could not be maintained that the risk of the applicant reoffending was so negligible that on that basis the compilation and processing of a DNA profile could not possibly serve any useful purpose .", "ORG , noting that at the hearing counsel for the applicant had conceded that the obligation to provide cellular material did not constitute a punishment , considered that the applicant could not successfully rely on the principle of nulla poena sine lege . It further held in this connection that the impugned measure did not place the applicant in a more disadvantageous position than that to which he had exposed himself when he committed a criminal offence , since the seriousness of the intervention ( the manner in which cellular material was taken ) was not sufficiently burdensome . Although the entry of a DNA profile in a DNA database might lead to a more speedy prosecution of the applicant in respect of criminal offences ( to be ) committed by him , this did not justify protecting him against a retroactive application of the Act .", "ORG was further of the opinion that the impugned order was not in breach of LAW . The order had been given in accordance with the law and , bearing in mind that the aim of the LAW was to be able to solve more crimes and to prevent recidivism as much as possible , it was necessary in the interests of public safety , the prevention of criminal offences and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others .", "Finally , ORG found that there was no question of a violation of the principle of equality , since the LAW provided that a DNA profile would be compiled of every convicted person who satisfied the criteria laid down in the LAW . The applicant was no worse off than a person whose DNA profile was not included in the database , given that the fact that perpetrators of criminal offences could be traced sooner if their DNA profile was contained in the database did not constitute an interest worthy of legal protection , and since neither category were allowed to commit criminal offences .", "No appeal lay against this decision .", "The statutory maximum prison sentence is DATE for the offence of extortion , and DATE for theft by means of breaking and entering ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "The Criminal Code provides for the following principal penalties ( hoofdstraffen ) : imprisonment , detention , and fine ; and for the following additional penalties ( bijkomende straffen ) : deprivation of certain rights , forfeiture , and publication of the court judgment . Furthermore , the following measures ( maatregelen ) may be imposed pursuant to LAW : withdrawal from circulation of seized goods , confiscation of illegally obtained advantage , order to pay compensation , committal to a psychiatric hospital , a ORG order ( terbeschikkingstelling ; see Brand v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) , and placement in an institution for persistent offenders .", "The DNA Testing ( Convicted Persons ) Act came into force on DATE .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW requires the public prosecutor at ORG that has given judgment at first instance to order a sample of cellular material to be taken from a person who has been convicted of an offence carrying a statutory maximum prison sentence of DATE . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) stipulates that the Act applies to persons on whom a custodial sentence or measure had been imposed at the time when the LAW came into force , unless the validity of this sentence or measure had already expired at that time .", "According to the explanatory memorandum to LAW ( Memorie van Toelichting ; ORG of ORG , no . CARDINAL , DATE session , no . CARDINAL ) , the seriousness of the offence(s ) involved justified determining and processing a DNA profile of the convicted person in order to contribute to the detection , prosecution and trial of criminal offences committed by him or her and , if possible , to prevent him or her from committing criminal offences again .", "Section CARDINAL ) sets out an exception : no order for sample collection will be made if , in view of the nature of the offence or the special circumstances under which it was committed , it may reasonably be assumed that the determination and processing of the DNA profile will not be of significance for the prevention , detection , prosecution and trial of criminal offences committed by the person in question . It appears from the explanatory memorandum to this provision that the first exception of subsection ( CARDINAL ) , relating to the nature of the offence , may apply when a person has been convicted of a crime for the resolution of which DNA investigations can play no meaningful role ; perjury or forgery , for instance . The second exception , relating to the special circumstances under which the offence was committed , may apply to a convicted person who is highly unlikely to have previously committed an offence in respect of which DNA investigation might be of use and who will not be able to do so in future , for example due to serious physical injury . It may also apply to the case of a woman who has never had any dealings with the law and who , after having been ill - treated by her husband for DATE , finally inflicts grievous bodily harm on him or kills him .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act stipulates that DNA profiles are only to be processed for the purpose of the prevention , detection , prosecution and trial of criminal offences . It further states that rules as to the processing of DNA profiles and cellular material are to be laid down by ORG ( algemene maatregel van bestuur ) , after ORG ( College Bescherming Persoonsgegevens ) has been heard . The rules in question are set out in the DNA ( Criminal Cases ) Tests Decree ( Besluit DNA - onderzoek in strafzaken ) . It regulates how and by whom samples are to be taken ; how they are to be kept , sealed and identified ; how and by whom the DNA profile is to be drawn up ; and which authorities are allowed to make use of the data stored in the DNA database . The Decree further lays down rules on the duration of the retention of a DNA profile and cellular material . This depends on the offence of which the individual concerned has been convicted . The data of persons convicted of an offence carrying a statutory sentence of DATE or more is retained for DATE . For less serious offences carrying sentences of DATE , cellular material and DNA profiles may be retained for a maximum period of DATE .", "If execution of the order for the taking of cellular material so requires , the public prosecutor may issue a warrant for the arrest of the individual concerned ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . Clothing worn , and objects carried , by the arrested person may be examined if this is necessary for the establishment of his or her identity . For the same purpose , the prosecutor may also order the detention of the arrested person for CARDINAL periods of TIME each ( outside TIME and TIME ) . Once the identity of the arrested convicted person has been established , he or she may be detained for a maximum of TIME in order for the cellular material to be taken ( section MONEY ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "The individual concerned may lodge an objection against the determination and processing of his or her DNA profile with ORG within DATE after the sample has been taken or after he or she has been served with the notification , required by section PERSON ) of the LAW , that sufficient cellular material has been collected for a DNA profile to be determined and processed ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
