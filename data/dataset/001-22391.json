SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE and requested asylum . According to a memorandum written by the police authority in GPE DATE , the applicant stated that he had served DATE in the military at the frontline in the war between GPE and GPE but had deserted DATE before his arrival in GPE . Furthermore , he was a NORP supporter and had distributed , inter alia , leaflets for this organisation . The authorities were not aware of his activities , however . A more comprehensive interview was held by the police authority in PERSON on DATE . On that occasion , the applicant stated that he had been doing his military service in GPE as from DATE but had deserted in DATE after having been informed that he would be sent to the frontline . The applicant stated also that , although not formally a member of the Mujahedin , he had supported the organisation and taken part in its activities , inter alia by distributing leaflets and publications . He had started his activities in DATE / October DATE while he was in military service . Allegedly , the NORP authorities had eventually learned about the activities DATE revolutionary guards had found leaflets at his family \u2019s home DATE and were therefore going to send him to the frontline . He decided to flee and so , after having been in hiding in GPE for some time , he left the country . His brother had been arrested by the revolutionary guards when they searched the family \u2019s home and had not been released . However , the applicant had never been detained himself . The applicant alleged that , if returned to GPE , he would be executed as he had deserted from his military service and had been active for the GPE .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) granted the applicant a permanent residence permit in GPE . He was also provided with a NORP alien \u2019s passport . The ORG did not find the applicant to be a refugee but nevertheless considered that , due to the prevailing political situation in GPE , there were compelling reasons not to return him to that country .", "Allegedly , the applicant continued his political activities for the Mujahedin in GPE by , inter alia , organising and participating in demonstrations .", "In DATE the applicant was arrested and charged with drug trafficking involving QUANTITY of heroin . ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE obtained an opinion of ORG , dated DATE , in which ORG stated that , although NORP authorities treated drug offences severely , the applicant would not risk being prosecuted again in GPE for the crimes that he had committed in GPE . ORG thus concluded that there were no impediments to expel him to GPE .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of the charges brought against him and convicted him of an aggravated drug offence and of an attempted aggravated drug offence . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . Also , his expulsion from GPE was ordered with a permanent prohibition on his return . With respect to the expulsion , the ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s sister was living in GPE but that he had no other connection to the country . It had regard also to the severity of the crimes of which he had been convicted .", "The applicant and the public prosecutor appealed against the judgment to ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) . The applicant maintained his innocence and submitted in addition that an expulsion to GPE would expose him to a risk of persecution and ill - treatment by the NORP authorities on account of his activities within the NORP organisation in GPE and GPE . He claimed also that he risked long imprisonment due to his desertion from the NORP army .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and increased the sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . Furthermore , agreeing with the reasoning of ORG , the appellate court upheld the expulsion order .", "On DATE the applicant applied for leave to appeal to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) . He maintained what he had submitted to ORG relating to the risks facing him upon return to GPE and added that he could be prosecuted again in GPE for the drug offences in question and that he could be punished also for having taken part in the trafficking of asylum seekers from GPE to GPE . He claimed that he would risk the death penalty if he were to be returned .", "Leave to appeal was refused by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE , shortly before the applicant \u2019s release on probation , the police authority in GPE contacted the applicant concerning his expulsion from GPE . The applicant stated that he wished to return to GPE and that he would contact ORG in GPE in order to obtain a passport . He would thus not oppose his expulsion . DATE , the applicant not having been in contact with the embassy , the police authority called the embassy and was informed that they wished to meet the applicant in person . The applicant was escorted by policemen to the meeting which took place on DATE . According to a police memorandum of DATE , the meeting went well . At a later contact , however , the embassy required that the applicant write a \u201c life resum\u00e9 \u201d in order to get a laissez - passer . The applicant refused to do this and stated that he would no longer return to GPE voluntarily .", "On DATE the applicant was released on probation . He was immediately detained with a view to his deportation to GPE .", "On DATE the applicant requested the GPE police authority to refrain from deporting him and to inform ORG ( Migrationsverket ; previously ORG ) that there were impediments to his deportation . The applicant referred to LAW and to the same circumstances as submitted to the courts during his trial . He stated that it had become apparent during the expulsion proceedings that ORG was aware of his asylum application . He referred also to the embassy \u2019s requirement that he submit a statement giving details about his life , which he had not dared to do .", "Having been informed by the police authority that they would not stay the deportation or refer the matter to ORG , the applicant petitioned the ORG under chapter LAW , CARDINAL ) . This provision empowers the Government to revoke an expulsion order that has been imposed as a consequence of a criminal conviction , if it finds that the order can not be enforced or there are other special reasons against upholding the order .", "On DATE the Government stayed the enforcement of the expulsion order until further notice following the ORG \u2019s indication of CARDINAL DATE , under Rule QUANTITY of ORG , that it was desirable in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG not to expel the applicant to GPE .", "On DATE the applicant obtained an opinion from Mr S. Mahmoudi , professor in international law at ORG , which has subsequently been forwarded to the Government . In addition to giving an account of relevant NORP legislation , Professor LANGUAGE made , inter alia , the following observations in regard to the applicant \u2019s situation . As the NORP authorities could be expected to know about the applicant \u2019s asylum application and the reasons for his expulsion from GPE , it is likely that he would be thoroughly questioned upon return to GPE . It is possible for the NORP authorities to prosecute the applicant for the drug offences , although he has already been convicted and has served his sentence in GPE . Previously , many people were sentenced to death and executed for drug offences , but DATE the usual practice is to impose long prison sentences . The death penalty is used only in a few cases involving repeated and organised large - scale drug trafficking . The applicant could also be sentenced to pay fines for having left GPE illegally and for having taken part in the trafficking of asylum seekers from GPE and he would risk a prison sentence for his desertion from the army . His involvement in GPE activities is more difficult to assess ; generally , however , the efforts of the NORP authorities are mainly directed towards those who are more active members and have used arms against Government troops . Professor PERSON maintained , however , that any prediction as to the outcome of a criminal case in GPE is difficult due to the courts\u2019 arbitrary application of the laws . He thus concluded that it could not be excluded that the applicant would be sentenced to death . In any event , there is an apparent risk that he would be sentenced to imprisonment for life or for a very long period of time or to corporal punishment for the drug offences committed in GPE and other crimes allegedly committed in GPE .", "On DATE , at the request of the Government , ORG gave its opinion on the applicant \u2019s petition for the expulsion order to be revoked . ORG stated that , according to consistent NORP case - law , the NORP courts do not consider a criminal case when the person involved has already been convicted and served his or her prison sentence abroad . ORG therefore maintained the assessment made to ORG on DATE that there were no impediments to the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s petition for a revocation of the expulsion order is still pending before the Government .", "On DATE the Government decided that the applicant be released from detention . Instead , an obligation to report to the police CARDINAL times per week was imposed on the applicant in accordance with chapter QUANTITY CARDINAL of LAW . By a decision of DATE this obligation was changed to CARDINAL occasions per week . A decision of DATE did away with the reporting obligation but ordered the applicant to hand in his passport to the local police authority if that had not already been done ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
