He explained that he had been unable to attend the hearing owing to a vehicle malfunction , and that he had tried to contact the court and the defendant \u2019s representative , with a view to informing them of the reason for his absence .

The applicant argued that , if that was true , the court \u2019s decision to suspend the proceedings had had no legal basis . He explained that suspending proceedings was an instrument for maintaining procedural discipline , the effect of which was to delay proceedings and thereby penalise the parties for their inaction . Yet , in his case , he and his client had been penalised by a delay even though it was through no fault of his own that he had failed to attend the hearing .
