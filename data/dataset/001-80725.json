Later , several other persons were detained and charged in connection with the same investigation conducted by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged his detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until DATE . It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question and the gravity of the charges . It also had regard to the number of suspects and the need to obtain further evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant 's detention until DATE . It found that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant might go into hiding or obstruct the proceedings . It also relied on the severity of the anticipated penalty . Lastly , it noted that further prolongation of the investigation was not attributable to the prosecuting authorities , but resulted from the fact that further suspects had been identified and arrested . Furthermore , the prolongation was due to a delay in the preparation of some expert reports and the need to request legal assistance from the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . It found that there was a reasonable risk that the suspects might intimidate witnesses , given the nature of the charges against them . It further observed that the investigation could not be terminated on account of the prolonged preparation of an expert report and the need to hear a witness , PERSON , who was serving his prison sentence in GPE .", "CARDINAL .

It further considered that the applicant had been charged with the commission of the crimes for which he was liable to a sentence of imprisonment exceeding CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant and his CARDINAL co - defendants be kept in custody until DATE . It relied on the fact that witnesses had informed the trial court about having been threatened by the defendants . It also had regard to the severity of the anticipated penalty and the presumption established by LAW . Furthermore , ORG considered that the prolongation of the detention beyond the statutory time - limit of DATE was justified by the complexity of the case and the volume of evidence to be heard . In that respect , it also observed that in DATE the trial court had been prevented from hearing evidence on account of the absence of CARDINAL defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . It noted that the trial was being efficiently conducted and that it had not been terminated for reasons which were attributable to the defendants and their counsel .

On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of armed robbery , kidnapping , extortion and inflicting bodily harm and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and a fine .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG prolonged his detention until DATE . It noted that continuation of that measure was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings , given the severity of the anticipated penalty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ordered that the applicant and CARDINAL of his co - defendants be kept in custody until DATE . It found that the applicant 's continued detention was necessary in order to prevent the applicant from interfering with witnesses . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against that prolongation . Referring to LAW , it observed that the applicant ' crimes , and thus his continued detention was justified on public interest grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . It held that following ORG instructions most of the witnesses who had given evidence at the original trial had to be heard again . In that case there was a reasonable risk that the defendants might interfere with witnesses . In addition , the court held that given the gravity of the charges and the likelihood that severe penalties would be imposed on them , the defendants might obstruct the proceedings by going into hiding . On DATE the ORG upheld that decision . It considered , inter alia , that ORG had attempted to examine the case within a reasonable time , but there had been significant delays in the trial which were attributable to the defendants or their counsel . In this respect , it pointed out to the obstructive conduct of all the defendants on DATE which had prevented ORG from holding a hearing on DATE . On the other hand , ORG instructed ORG to assess the length of detention of each defendant separately . It pointed out that the further prolongation of the detention of those defendants who were not simultaneously serving prison sentences could not be accepted in the long term .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention on DATE ( until DATE ) and DATE ( until DATE ) . It invoked the same grounds as in its previous decisions . The applicant appealed against the latter decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG altered ORG decision and ordered that the applicant be released . It underlined that the applicant 's detention on remand had been exceptionally long and thus lost its provisional nature . Having regard to the current progress of the trial , the court observed that it was not possible to predict when the proceedings would be terminated . Furthermore , it noted that CARDINAL out of CARDINAL co - defendants were serving long - term prison sentences .", "CARDINAL . Prior to his release , the applicant filed numerous but unsuccessful applications for release and appealed , likewise unsuccessfully , against the decisions prolonging his detention . He maintained that the length of his detention was excessive .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the criminal proceedings against the applicant are still pending .", "CARDINAL .
