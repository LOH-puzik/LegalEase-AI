During additional investigation the LOC police received information from the fire and rescue services and questioned the applicant \u2019s neighbours , including GPE , who had been identified by the applicant as a witness , and a doctor from the hospital . Another medico - legal examination was also ordered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert examined the applicant and his administrative detention report and drew up report no . CARDINAL in addition to report no . CARDINAL . The background to the report was described as follows :", "\u201c On DATE police officers [ allegedly ] inflicted bodily injuries on the applicant at the police station . On DATE an expert examined the applicant \u2019s medical records ( report no . CARDINAL ) . The applicant ... alleged that he had suffered additional injuries to different parts of his body ( eyebrow , lower body ) , [ which were ] not documented in the medical records \u201d .", "The expert concluded that the applicant had the following injuries : \u201c a scar on his left eyebrow that could be due to a cicatrised wound that had been stitched \u201d and \u201c scars on the back of the applicant \u2019s torso and on the buttock area that could have appeared after bruises had healed \u201d .

On DATE the Liep\u0101ja police again refused to institute criminal proceedings ( \u201c the second decision \u201d ) . In addition to the grounds of the first decision , the second decision was based on the grounds that the fire and rescue services did not hold information about incoming calls concerning alcohol intoxication . Such calls were transferred to the municipal police .", "According to the second decision , an acquaintance of the applicant , ORG , stated that he had seen him sitting on a bench and consuming beer at TIME , and then the municipal police had arrived . Other statements were taken from neighbours , but they only indicated that the applicant often sat on the bench by the apartment building consuming alcohol . CARDINAL neighbour , GPE , stated that the applicant had a \u201c difficult \u201d personality and that \u201c he often started fights \u201d . Further , it was noted that \u201c it was not possible to identify direct witnesses who could provide objective information about [ the applicant \u2019s ] arrest \u201d . The ambulance record indicated that the applicant had been taken from the municipal police station to the hospital with injuries to his left hip and head , bruises on his face and in a state of alcohol intoxication . Finally , the doctor \u2019s statement indicated that he had examined the applicant at TIME , when he had sobered up ; the doctor had inquired about the circumstances of the injury and the applicant had replied that he had fallen down somewhere on the street . A note was made that the conclusions drawn following the internal inquiry were confirmed by other case - file materials and that the statements made by the applicant and PERSON should be evaluated with caution . On the basis of the case - file materials in their entirety , it was concluded that the applicant \u201c could have sustained \u201d the injuries by falling on the stairs in the apartment building . There were no grounds for finding that the applicant \u2019s injuries had been wilfully inflicted in the sobering - up room , or that excessive physical force had been used on him . There were no indications that the officers had exceeded their authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supervising prosecutor examined the case - file materials and dismissed a complaint by the applicant about the second decision . She noted that the Liep\u0101ja police , even after her instructions , could not find any witness to his detention . It appears that she herself questioned PERSON for a second time . He clarified that he had only seen the applicant sitting on the bench ; when the municipal police had arrived , he could not see the bench any more , as the van blocked the scene from his view . He testified that the police had been there for TIME . In response to the applicant \u2019s allegations as to the location , nature and probable cause of his injuries in the circumstances , the prosecutor stated that the expert \u2019s observation that they could have been sustained as a result of being hit with blunt objects or bumping into such objects was only a probability and not an assertion . Moreover , she considered that there were no grounds to disregard the hospital doctor \u2019s remark that the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s injuries had been taken down in his own words . The prosecutor noted that his injuries , as detected upon his admission to the police station ( bruises on the face and left eyebrow ) , were confirmed by the statement of ORG ; his alcohol intoxication was confirmed by the ambulance and hospital medical records and the statements of the police officers , the watch officer ( GPE ) , and the medical orderly ( A.B. ) . She concluded that her previous instructions ( issued on DATE ) had been complied with and that on the basis of the case - file materials in their entirety \u201c it [ could ] not be precluded \u201d that the applicant sustained the injuries before his detention as he had been admitted to the station in an intoxicated state with visible injuries on his face .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL higher - ranking prosecutors dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaints against the second decision . The first prosecutor considered that the review of the applicant \u2019s complaints had been comprehensive and objective ; no evidence had been found that the officers had exceeded their authority . Referring to the medico - legal examination report , the prosecutor considered that the applicant \u201c could have sustained \u201d injuries by falling from his own height , as he had indicated to the hospital doctor , whose testimony was to be given more weight as he was not an interested party . The second prosecutor also found the second decision justified . He referred to the administrative detention \u201c documentation \u201d and the ORG statements to demonstrate that the applicant had been lying on the stairs in the apartment building and not sitting on the bench next to it ; ORG statements did not corroborate these facts . The officers had taken the applicant to the sobering - up room because he had been unable to move by himself because of either his intoxicated state or his injuries . He concluded :", "\u201c It follows from the foregoing that [ the applicant ] must have sustained the injuries before the arrival of the municipal police officers . [ The applicant \u2019s ] blood alcohol level after TIME of detention only further demonstrates that prior to detention [ the applicant ] was intoxicated with alcohol . This does not exclude the possibility that [ the applicant ] sustained injuries by falling from [ his own ] height . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor at ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . She examined the case - file materials and found that there were no grounds to quash the second decision . Among other things , she noted that section CARDINAL of LAW provided for administrative liability for the use of alcoholic beverages or other intoxicating substances in public places or for appearing in public places in an intoxicated state , which was an affront to human dignity . For that reason , notwithstanding the discrepancy between the submissions of the officers , who had stated that the applicant had been lying inside the apartment building , and the applicant , who had stated that he had been sitting on a bench outside the building , the officers had had grounds to take him to the municipal police station to sober up and to draw up an administrative offence report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , in a complaint to a higher - ranking prosecutor , specified that his complaints did not relate to unjustified placement ( nepamatota nog\u0101d\u0101\u0161ana ) in the sobering - up room or to being taken there by force . Rather , they related to the failure to institute criminal proceedings in connection with bodily injuries inflicted on him while there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the higher - ranking prosecutor at ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It appears that he obtained additional statements from officers GPE and GPE , and the watch officer GPE The prosecutor found that the applicant \u2019s allegation that the injury on his left eyebrow had been inflicted by officers pushing him against the wall in the police station were not corroborated by the ORG statements and the medical orderly \u2019s indication that the applicant had been admitted with the injury . Nor was the applicant \u2019s allegation that his left hip had been broken by the officers dragging him down the stairs at the police station confirmed . The officers had explained that they had carried him into the station as he had not been able to walk by himself . The prosecutor concluded that the applicant had sustained the injuries before his administrative detention .", "CARDINAL . A final decision , negative in respect of the applicant , was adopted by ORG on DATE . He found that the applicant \u2019s allegations concerning contradictions and discrepancies in the case - file materials were unfounded . He noted , among other things , that the applicant \u2019s detention record and the medical record drawn up upon his admission to the police station confirmed that he already had injuries on his face and left eyebrow , thus his allegations about sustaining the injuries in the station were not confirmed . The applicant had been carried into the station because he had not been able to walk by himself and he had complained about pain in his hip only after sobering up , after which the medical orderly had called an ambulance .", "CARDINAL .
