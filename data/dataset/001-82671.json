GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a limited liability company possessing legal personality under NORP law . It was represented before the ORG by PERSON and colleagues , lawyers practising in GPE .", "The applicant company sells construction materials , but is also engaged in e - commerce . It held CARDINAL internet domain names which had been registered by the competent registration authority ( DENIC e . PERSON ) after payment of the respective fees ( currently ORG CARDINAL per domain registration and ORG DATE for the connectivity and administration of the domain by DENIC e . PERSON ) . In particular , in DATE and DATE the applicant successfully applied for the registration of the domains \u201c freundin-online.de \u201d , \u201c ad-acta.de \u201d , \u201c Eltern - online.de \u201d and \u201c duck.de \u201d .", "The domain contracts concluded with DENIC e . PERSON granted the applicant the exclusive right to use or dispose of the domains registered . According to terms of the contract , DENIC e . PERSON did not examine whether the registration and use of the domain infringed the rights of others , which was a matter for the domain holder to verify . The contracts were open - ended and could be terminated by the domain holder without notice and by DENIC e . PERSON for good cause ( such as the final finding of a court that the registration of the domain in question violated the rights of others or the contracting party \u2019s failure to pay the domain fees ) .", "Subsequently , several sets of proceedings were brought against the applicant by other companies and private individuals claiming that the registration and use by the applicant of certain domains breached their trademark rights and / or their rights to a ( business ) name .", "On DATE the Freundin Verlag GmbH , publisher of the women \u2019s magazine \u201c freundin \u201d ( \u201c ( girl)friend \u201d ) and licensed holder of the trademark \u201c freundin \u201d , brought an action in ORG for a court order prohibiting the applicant to use or dispose of the internet domain \u201c freundin-online.de \u201d and obliging the applicant to apply for a cancellation of this domain with the registration authority . It argued that the applicant breached its right to a business denomination and its trademark rights .", "By decision of DATE ORG separated CARDINAL counterclaims brought by the applicant from the plaintiff \u2019s claim . It argued that , contrary to the plaintiff \u2019s action , the counterclaims , which had only been served in the hearing on DATE , were not yet ready for a decision .", "In its judgment delivered on DATE the GPE ORG , relying on section CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Trademark Act ( Markengesetz ; see Relevant domestic law below ) , allowed the plaintiff \u2019s action .", "ORG found that the magazine title \u201c freundin \u201d was a well - known business denomination as the women \u2019s magazine , which addressed the general public with the issues it covered , had been sold in all newspaper stands for DATE . Moreover , the plaintiff published the contents and services of its magazine on the website \u201c freundin.de \u201d . The applicant was unfairly taking advantage of the distinctiveness of the plaintiff \u2019s business denomination for its internet platform without justification . As the applicant had failed to explain why it did not use its domain \u201c freundin-online.de \u201d , the respective website being \u201c under construction \u201d for DATE , the court concluded that the company had only \u201c grabbed \u201d this domain in order to sell it to the plaintiff which could then use the domain . As the applicant also had not set out what future use exactly it intended for the website at issue \u2013 the company had only announced that an internet portal should be created on which everyone having a connection with the domain name could present himself free of charge DATE , there was a risk that it would use the site in CARDINAL of numerous possible manners which infringed the plaintiff \u2019s rights . Therefore , the scope of the orders against the applicant could not be less broad .", "By decision of DATE ORG , having considered the parties\u2019 written submissions , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that the case did not raise a legal issue of fundamental importance , that its judgment was not necessary for the development of the law or for securing the uniform application of the law and that , for the reasons given by ORG , the appeal was ill - founded .", "ORG further argued that the separation of the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL counterclaims from the plaintiff \u2019s claim had complied with the applicable legal provisions and had neither been arbitrary nor breached the applicant \u2019s right to be heard . The counterclaim against both the plaintiff and a third party company , by which the applicant pursued a partial cancellation of the word mark \u201c freundin \u201d , was irrelevant to the present proceedings as the scope of that word mark had not been relied upon by ORG or by itself , the decision having been based on the protection of the plaintiff \u2019s business denomination . The applicant \u2019s counterclaim against the plaintiff alone for a declaration that the use by the applicant of the domain in order to sell computer discs did not breach the plaintiff \u2019s rights was no more than a contestation of the plaintiff \u2019s claim and had as such been taken into consideration in ORG judgment . The applicant had , however , failed to demonstrate that it could use the domain in question in a way which did not breach the plaintiff \u2019s rights .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . It submitted that the decisions taken by the civil courts had breached its right to be heard and to a fair trial due to the separation of its counterclaims from the plaintiff \u2019s claims and by dismissing its appeal by way of a decision . Moreover , its right to property had been violated in that it was prohibited to use its domain \u201c freundin-online.de \u201d and obliged to apply for its cancellation .", "On DATE ORG , referring to the provisions allowing for that procedure , declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint without giving reasons for its decision ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "In DATE the ad - acta ORG , a company dealing with the destruction of files and data media , brought an action for a court order prohibiting the applicant to use the domain name \u201c ad-acta.de \u201d and obliging it to apply with the registration authority for a cancellation of that domain . It argued that the applicant breached its right to a business name and its trademark rights .", "On DATE ORG , relying on the right to protection of one \u2019s name under section CARDINAL of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) , allowed the plaintiff \u2019s action .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that the plaintiff had a claim under section QUANTITY of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) for the applicant to refrain from using the domain name \u201c ad-acta.de \u201d . The term \u201c ad - acta \u201d was part of the plaintiff \u2019s business name . The use of the internet address \u201c ad-acta.de \u201d by the applicant company , which intended to offer definitions and advertisements concerning the storing and destruction of files on its website , was likely to lead to confusion with the plaintiff \u2019s company and infringed the plaintiff \u2019s right to a name . In order to have the interference with its rights removed , the plaintiff could also request the applicant to agree to the cancellation of its domain name with the registration authority .", "On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant leave to appeal on points of law , finding that the appeal had no prospects of success .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . It complained , in particular , that its right to property had been breached and that the civil courts had failed to consider its arguments relating to the violation of this right .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It found that the complaint had no prospects of success because the impugned decisions did not violate the applicant \u2019s property rights .", "Its contract with the registration authority provided that the applicant had a right to use the domain in question , which constituted \u201c property \u201d under LAW . However , the application to the present case of the relevant provisions of LAW was a limitation on the applicant \u2019s property rights which was compatible with LAW . In particular , the applicant \u2019s duty to apply for a cancellation of its domain with the registration authority did not disproportionately limit its property rights . There were no measures which would be less restrictive while fully satisfying the legitimate interests of the company holding the trademark rights to stop the interference with its rights . The danger of confusion could not sufficiently be averted , for example , by indications given on a website operated by the applicant under the domain name in question .", "The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG , which has published the magazine \u201c NORP \u201d ( \u201c parents \u201d ) DATE since DATE and has run the website \u201c Eltern.de \u201d since DATE , brought an action against the applicant company in ORG . It applied for an order prohibiting the applicant from using or to authorising others to use the domain name \u201c eltern-online.de \u201d and obliging the applicant to apply with the registration authority for a cancellation of that domain . It argued that the applicant breached its trademark rights .", "On DATE ORG , relying on section QUANTITY of LAW , allowed the plaintiff \u2019s action .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It argued that there was a danger of confusion between the domain name \u201c eltern-online.de \u201d registered by the applicant and the business denomination \u201c NORP \u201d of the plaintiff \u2019s magazine within the meaning of section QUANTITY \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . In order to have the interference with its rights removed , the plaintiff could also request the applicant to agree to the cancellation of its domain name with the registration authority .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint about ORG refusal to grant it leave to appeal on points of law .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG in which it complained , in particular , that its property rights had been breached by the decisions of the civil courts and that the civil courts had failed to consider its arguments concerning the violation of these rights .", "On DATE ORG , without giving reasons , declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "In DATE Mr PERSON , an architect who had been working under the business name \u201c Architekturb\u00fcro Duck \u201d ( \u201c architecture office Duck \u201d ) since DATE , brought an action in ORG for a court order prohibiting the applicant to use or dispose of the domain name \u201c duck.de \u201d and obliging the applicant to apply with the registration authority for the cancellation of that domain . He argued that the applicant breached his right to a name and his trademark rights .", "On DATE the GPE ORG allowed the plaintiff \u2019s action .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The domain name contained the plaintiff \u2019s family name and the applicant had failed to give sound reasons outweighing the plaintiff \u2019s interests why it made use of the name . In particular , if the applicant company , as it had claimed , wanted to create a website concerning the duck as an animal or aliment , it was free to use the NORP expression for duck or a different denomination which was not likely to lead to confusion with the plaintiff \u2019s name . As the applicant had spent MONEY in domain fees and had not posted any contents on the internet under the domain name in question , its possession did not warrant protection .", "ORG subsequently refused to grant the applicant leave to appeal on points of law .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG .
