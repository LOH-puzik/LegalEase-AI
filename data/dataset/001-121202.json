NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant suffered for DATE from , inter alia , pain in his back and legs and numbness in his right arm . He was granted a full disability pension in DATE , after the diagnosis of lumbago , sciatica and myositis .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he applied for life annuity and alleged that his physical problems had been caused by his former employment as a driver ( DATE ) , as a dairy worker ( DATE ) and as a food science technician ( DATE to CARDINAL ) . ORG ( F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan , hereinafter \u201c the Office \u201d ) appointed an in - house specialist in orthopaedic surgery who , in a written statement , concluded that there was not a high degree of probability ( h\u00f6g grad av sannolikhet ) that any harmful element in the applicant \u2019s former employment had caused his problems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , the ORG rejected the application . Referring to , inter alia , the specialist statement by the insurance doctor , the ORG held that the applicant had not been subject to any harmful influences which , with a high degree of probability , could have caused or worsened his problems .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . On DATE the court , after having held an oral hearing , upheld the ORG \u2019s decision in full .", "CARDINAL . Upon further appeal to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , the applicant submitted , inter alia , a medical statement ( epikris ) issued in DATE by ORG , division of labour and environmental medicine ( ORG for folkh\u00e4lsa , Arbets- och milj\u00f6medicin ) . According to the medical statement , there were reasons to believe that the applicant \u2019s work had caused his problems . The applicant requested that an oral hearing be held by ORG before it decided whether to grant leave to appeal as well as before it decided on the merits of the case . He also requested expert witnesses to be heard before the court .", "CARDINAL . In a written statement to the appellate court , the ORG questioned the conclusions in the medical statement and , furthermore , referred to medical records from DATE , in which the applicant was held to be fully able - bodied and in which it was noted that no somatic evidence had been found in support of the applicant \u2019s symptoms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to hold an oral hearing prior to deciding on the question of leave to appeal . It referred to the circumstances of the case and the fact that ORG had held an oral hearing .

Subsequently , on DATE it decided not to hold an oral hearing before deciding on the merits of the case . It referred to the nature of the case and to the fact that an oral hearing had been held before ORG . The applicant was given the opportunity to submit further observations . It is again unclear whether he took advantage of this opportunity .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment on DATE , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment in full , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c The medical and other evidence in the case does not support that the applicant has been exposed to any such harmful influences in his work which could , with a high degree of probability , have caused his problems . His problems can thus \u2013 as has been found also by ORG \u2013 not be defined as a work - related injury . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG ( H\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) . He complained about the lack of reasoning in ORG judgment and argued that that court \u2019s refusal to hold an oral hearing had infringed his right to a fair trial within the meaning of LAW . If ORG were to grant leave to appeal , he requested an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL of LAW ( Skadest\u00e5ndslagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) deals with the civil liability of the State . According to section CARDINAL of that chapter , acts or omissions by a public authority may give rise to an entitlement to compensation in the event of fault or negligence .", "CARDINAL . An individual who wants to claim compensation from the ORG may proceed in either of CARDINAL ways : he or she may petition the Chancellor of Justice ( NORP ) in accordance with LAW on ORG against the State ( F\u00f6rordningen om handl\u00e4ggning av skadest\u00e5ndsanspr\u00e5k mot staten , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , or bring a civil action against the ORG before a district court , with the possibility to appeal to a court of appeal and later to ORG . No appeal lies against a decision of the Chancellor of ORG . However , if the claim is rejected , the claimant still has the possibility to institute civil proceedings before the courts . In such proceedings , the ORG is represented by the Chancellor of ORG ( LAW [ GPE med instruktion f\u00f6r NORP , DATE ] ) .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG , CARDINAL ) , the period of limitation in respect of claims against the ORG is DATE from the point in time when the claim arose , unless the period has been interrupted beforehand .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) ORG dealt with a claim for damages brought by an individual against the NORP State , inter alia , on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW . The case concerned the excessive length of criminal proceedings and ORG held that the plaintiff \u2019s right under LAW to have the criminal charges against him determined within a reasonable time had been violated . Based on this finding and with reference , inter alia , to ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention and the ORG \u2019s case - law under these provisions , in particular the case of GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-XI ) , ORG concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation under NORP law for both pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage . With respect to the level of compensation for non - pecuniary damage , ORG took note of the criteria established in the ORG \u2019s case - law stating that the ORG \u2019s practice constituted a natural point of departure in this regard .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the principle concerning a right to damages established in the abovementioned case of DATE also applied with regard to the rights contained in LAW . ORG stated that the plaintiff \u2019s right to damages on account of a violation of Article CARDINAL should be assessed in the first place under LAW and LAW and Other Coercive Measures ( NORP om ers\u00e4ttning vid frihetsber\u00f6vanden och andra tv\u00e5ngs\u00e5tg\u00e4rder , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . To the extent necessary , the relevant provisions of domestic law should be interpreted in accordance with the LAW . If GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW could not be met by such an interpretation , the domestic courts should award compensation without the support of specific legal provisions . As concerned the determination of the level of compensation , ORG repeated that the ORG \u2019s case - law was a natural point of departure but also noted that account must be taken of the fact that different national conditions may lead to variations from CARDINAL country to another in what should be regarded as a reasonable level of compensation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to respect for their private life under LAW had been violated on the basis that a police decision on a medical examination of some of them had not been \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d . Having found that compensation for the violation could not be awarded directly on the basis of LAW , ORG held that there was no reason to limit the scope of application of the principle established in the above - mentioned cases of DATE and CARDINAL DATE to violations of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW . In view of this and with reference to , inter alia , LAW and the ORG \u2019s case - law under these ORG , ORG concluded that the plaintiffs should be awarded non - pecuniary damages for the violation of LAW . With regard to the levels of compensation , ORG concluded that they should not be too far removed from the levels which applied when awarding damages under LAW . Generally speaking these levels should , however , be compatible with the case - law of the Court . In the same case , ORG had also concluded , in a judgment dated DATE , that there had been a violation of Article CARDINAL and that an award for non - pecuniary damage should be made on the basis of the principle established in the case of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Another Supreme Court judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) concerned a claim for damages against the NORP State on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW relating to the suicide of the LAW father while in detention . ORG concluded that the case revealed no violation of LAW . However , in its reasoning leading to this conclusion , ORG noted , inter alia , that according to the ORG \u2019s case - law there was a right to an effective remedy under LAW connected to the ORG \u2019s duty under the ORG to take measures to protect the lives of individuals in custody or who were otherwise deprived of their liberty which should , in principle , include a possibility of obtaining compensation for damage . ORG referred in particular to the judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-III ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( NJA DATE N CARDINAL ) , ORG confirmed its previous case - law in a case concerning claims for damages against the NORP State on account of excessive length of tax proceedings . The court affirmed that it is now a general principle of law that , to the extent that GPE has a duty to provide redress to victims of Convention violations through a right to compensation for damages , and that this duty can not be fulfilled even by interpreting national tort law in accordance with the LAW f\u00f6rdagskonform tolkning ) , compensation for damages may be ordered without direct support in law .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , on DATE ( NJA DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG ordered compensation for non - pecuniary damage to be paid to an applicant for proceedings which had complied neither with the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement in LAW nor with the right to an effective remedy in LAW . The proceedings in question had concerned a claim for damages against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL judgments of DATE ( T CARDINAL and T CARDINAL ) , ORG ordered compensation to be paid to an applicant for civil proceedings ( first case ) and administrative proceedings ( second case ) which had not complied with the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement in LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ( B CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , ORG reduced the sentence to be served by the defendant in a case where criminal proceedings had not complied with the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , in a judgment on DATE ( T DATE ) , ORG ordered compensation for non - pecuniary damage to be paid to an applicant for criminal proceedings which had not complied with the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement in LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government decided to set up a working group on tort liability and the Convention to study the current legal situation . In DATE the working group submitted its report ( PERSON , ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) to the Government . In the report it is proposed that LAW be amended in order to allow natural and legal persons to obtain damages from the ORG or a municipality for violations of the LAW . Such an action against public authorities would be examined by a general court which would need first to establish that a right provided by the ORG has been violated . The aim of the proposal is to provide a legal basis for granting non - pecuniary damages arising from disregard of the LAW and to fulfil , together with the other already existing legal remedies , GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its comments of DATE on the above report , ORG stated that , since the autumn of DATE following ORG case - law developments ( as set out above ) , it had dealt with a large number of requests from individuals for compensation on the basis of violations of the Convention . It estimated that it had dealt with CARDINAL cases over DATE . During this time the Chancellor of ORG had also represented the NORP State in a number of cases before the civil courts concerning alleged violations of the Convention . A majority of the cases that the ORG had dealt with had concerned non - pecuniary damages for excessive length of proceedings under LAW . Since DATE , it had received CARDINAL such complaints and in CARDINAL of them , the Chancellor of ORG had found a violation and granted compensation . The level of compensation for non - pecuniary damage had been determined with reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law and varied CARDINAL and SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and LAW ) . Furthermore , the Chancellor of Justice had dealt with a substantial number of cases ( CARDINAL ) concerning the registration of individuals in the Security Police register . These cases had concerned one or more of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . There continue to be other individual cases relating to alleged violations of ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , among others . For example , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( dnr CARDINAL ) , the Chancellor of Justice held that the reasoning in a ORG judgment failed to fulfil the requirements set by LAW . Referring to the case - law of ORG , the Chancellor of ORG stated that the applicant therefore could be awarded compensation for the damage caused by the violation of the LAW . However , due to the particular circumstances of that case , the applicant was not granted compensation . Furthermore , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( dnr PERCENT ) , the Chancellor of ORG found that ORG , in dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal against a decision by ORG ) , had violated his right to access to court ( the Chancellor referred to the case of ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . Consequently , the applicant was awarded damages ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
