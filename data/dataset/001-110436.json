On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of several counts of fraud and incitement to murder committed in an organised criminal group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remanded him in custody , relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question . It attached importance to the serious nature of those offences and the likelihood of a severe prison sentence being imposed on the applicant . In this connection the court noted that the applicant had admitted to having committed some of the offences of which he had been suspected , including incitement to murder . It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings , given the risk that he might go into hiding . As regards the latter , the court relied on the fact that he did not have a permanent place of residence in GPE and that he had already been hiding from the police . Finally , the court underlined that the applicant was a member of an organised criminal group and that some other members of that group were still at large which increased the risk that a detainee , if released , might obstruct the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the detention order , likewise his further appeals against decisions extending his detention and all his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him , were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL .

In the course of the investigation , the applicant \u2019s detention was extended on several occasions , namely on DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) , DATE ( to DATE ) and on an unspecified subsequent date . In their detention decisions the courts repeatedly relied on the original grounds given for the applicant \u2019s detention underlining the complexity of the case and the substantial volume of evidence to be examined . They also found no grounds warranting the applicant \u2019s release from detention as provided for by LAW . In particular , the courts observed that it resulted from medical reports that the applicant could be treated within a penitentiary facility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged a bill of indictment with ORG . The applicant was charged with an incitement to murder as well as several counts of thefts and extortions committed while acting as a leader of an organised criminal group . The bill of indictment comprised numerous charges brought against several defendants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL .
