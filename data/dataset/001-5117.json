The applicant \u2019s account of the relevant events", "On DATE , at TIME , the applicant was working in the yard of his house , when he saw Mr. NORP approach , running on the street . CARDINAL police officers wearing uniforms and holding guns were chasing Mr. NORP The applicant asked CARDINAL of the policemen why they were chasing Mr. PERSON In response the policemen ordered the applicant to drop the wooden bar he was holding in his hand . He complied with the order . Thereupon he was ordered to lie down on the ground . He , being afraid , attempted to run away , during the course of which the other policeman present hit him in the face . He nevertheless managed to break free and escape to the neighbouring gardens . Realising that CARDINAL further police officers had meanwhile arrived on the LOC , he eventually went out on the street again and lay down on the ground . Subsequently he was handcuffed and brought to the GPE police station . He alleges that during the drive to the police station Police Officer PERSON hit him once in the stomach .", "At the police station his hands were handcuffed behind his back and , subsequently , Police Officer PERSON and the police officer who had previously taken the action against him in front of his house systematically beat him up . During the beating he fell on the floor , where he was kicked several times and his head was banged against the floor , which resulted in a bleeding bruise on his forehead . A person wearing plain clothes stepped on his dislocated foot . Thereupon he was instructed to wash himself , go outside and tell his relatives waiting there that he had not been hurt and that they should leave . He did not comply with this instruction .", "b. The Government \u2019s account of the events", "On DATE Police Officers NORP and PERSON were on duty in GPE . They halted a car for an identity check of the driver and his passenger . This latter person , however , did not comply with the police ORG instruction but jumped out of the car and started to run away . While chasing him , the police officers reached the street where the applicant lives . Here the applicant appeared , holding a wooden bar in his hands .", "According to the police officers and a civil guard present , the applicant yelled at them , blocked their way and hit with the wooden bar in the direction of Police Officer R. \u2019s head . Thereupon Police Officer PERSON took out his service gun and ordered the applicant to drop the wooden bar . He dropped the wooden bar and ran away . Police Officer PERSON ran after him , caught him and attempted to stop him grasping him by his left shoulder . The applicant turned around and , with his right fist , he hit Police Officer NORP on the left cheek . Thereupon the police officer tried to push the applicant down on the ground , but the latter hit him again on the left cheek twice , managed to break free and ran away . In TIME the applicant \u2019s relatives and neighbours showed up in the street ; the preceding events had consequently not been eye - witnessed by anyone other than the police officers and the civil guard . Police Officer R. went on trying to subdue and hand - cuff the applicant in order to prevent further violence but he could not overcome his resistance .", "Eventually , the applicant broke free and ran into the spectators\u2019 crowd where he disappeared . Police Officer PERSON followed the applicant into the crowd and saw him fall on the ground accidentally . By the time he got near the applicant lying on the ground in order to handcuff him , several women - some relatives and acquaintances of the applicant - leant over the applicant , covering him with their bodies and preventing his handcuffing . While the police officers were trying to pull these women away , the applicant broke free again and ran away . Jumping over several fences , he soon reappeared in another direction in the street .", "In this moment CARDINAL further policemen arrived on the LOC upon the acting police ORG call for back - up . Presumably owing to exhaustion , the applicant meanwhile lay down on the stony earth road further down the street , where the above - mentioned women leant over him again , covering him with their bodies . The proceeding police officers finally managed to handcuff the applicant , whom they brought to the GPE police station .", "According to the testimonies given in the course of the ensuing investigations by the police officers involved and the civil guard present , the applicant had injuries on his face when handcuffed ; in turn , he was not ill - treated at the police station .", "c. Subsequent events on DATE", "Later that day Dr. PERSON was called to the GPE police station , who , at TIME , examined the applicant and prepared a medical report on his injuries . Subsequently he left to fetch his instruments in order to suture the applicant \u2019s wound on the forehead . The applicant alleges that thereupon a police officer handcuffed him again and went on hitting and kicking him .", "After Dr. PERSON had returned and sutured the applicant \u2019s wound over the eye , the latter was brought to GPE Prison in GPE .", "d. Medical reports and opinions evaluating the applicant \u2019s injuries", "In his report of DATE , Dr. PERSON stated that the applicant had the following injuries : abrasions , bruises and suffusions of the face , the forehead , the neck , the shoulders , the right upper arm , the chest and the back , a swollen reddish discoloration and suffusion in the upper stomach region , as well as a ruptured wound over the right eye . In Dr. PERSON \u2019s opinion , these injuries were to heal within DATE .", "On DATE Dr. PERSON examined the applicant in the PERSON prison . In his report Dr. ORG described altogether CARDINAL counts of contusions and abrasions scattered on the applicant \u2019s head , arms , chest , back , trunk and legs .", "On DATE the B\u00e1cs - Kiskun County Police Department appointed a medical expert to give his opinion on the previous medical reports concerning the applicant \u2019s injuries . The expert found that the applicant \u2019s injuries , as described by Dr. PERSON on DATE and by Dr. PERSON on DATE , could be due to the struggle between the applicant and the police officers and the applicant \u2019s falling down on harsh ground in the context of his arrest . In turn , the expert found no reference in the reports to any injury , which could be attributed to any brutality other than the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s arrest .", "On DATE Professor NORP , a forensic pathologist appointed by ORG of ORG ( \u201c the Branch Office \u201d ) , issued an opinion as to the nature of the applicant \u2019s injuries . He found that the contusions and abrasions on the applicant \u2019s body , as described in the medical reports of DATE and CARDINAL May , could be due to punches or to falling down on harsh ground . The swollen lesion in the gastric area had been likely to derive from a punch on the applicant \u2019s stomach . The injuries altogether could be the consequences of the applicant \u2019s forcible immobilisation and handcuffing . From a forensic medical aspect it could not be proven if the injuries had been suffered in the context of the applicant \u2019s arrest or of any potential subsequent ill - treatment .", "On DATE ORG of the ORG issued a forensic medical opinion in the case . According to this opinion , the applicant \u2019s injuries must have been due to CARDINAL counts of forcible impact and it could not be excluded that these impacts had been punches . However , in ORG view , the medical report prepared by Dr. PERSON on DATE was not precise enough to underlie a forensic opinion as to the cause of the applicant \u2019s injuries .", "e. Proceedings in pursuit of the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively , the applicant laid charges of ill - treatment and of light bodily assault against the police officers involved . The ensuing proceedings took place before ORG .", "On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation upon the charges laid by the applicant . ORG , relying on forensic medical expertise and witness evidence - given by the police officers and the civil guard present at the incident - , found that the applicant \u2019s injuries could be due to the fight between the police officers and the applicant upon the occasion of the latter \u2019s arrest , when hindering the lawfully proceeding police officers in arresting Mr. R. ORG held that it could not be proven beyond doubt that the applicant \u2019s injuries had been caused by ill - treatment rather than in the course of his lawful arrest .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . He criticised the fact that ORG had held no hearing in the case . Moreover , he submitted the forensic medical opinion prepared by ORG of the ORG on DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . ORG pointed out that it had not been possible to prove beyond doubt that his injuries had been caused as alleged and that the investigation had been , therefore , lawfully discontinued .

His charge of ill - treatment was to be pursued in public prosecution proceedings but the relevant investigation had been discontinued and no indictment had been brought against the police officers on this account . In the instant private prosecution proceedings , however , the unlawful origins of the injuries inflicted in the context of the police action against him could not be established . A decision on this question having been a pre - requisite of examining the merits of the charge of light bodily assault , the proceedings were without an object .", "f. Criminal proceedings against the applicant", "Shortly after the events of DATE the Head of the ORG instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant , charging him with having violently hindered the arrest of Mr. NORP Subsequently the Branch Office prosecuted the applicant on account of the offence of violence against persons acting in official capacity .", "On DATE an investigator of ORG heard the applicant as defendant concerning the circumstances of his arrest DATE .
