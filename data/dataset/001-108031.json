In the report on the DATE visit ( cf . paragraphs CARDINAL of ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) , the ORG stressed the importance for prisoners to be able to maintain good contact with the outside world .

The deleterious effects of such a restricted regime were exacerbated by the lengthy periods of time for which persons could be held in remand prisons . ...", "The ORG calls upon the NORP authorities to take steps , as a matter of priority , to devise and implement a comprehensive regime of out - of - cell activities ( including group association activities ) for remand prisoners .
