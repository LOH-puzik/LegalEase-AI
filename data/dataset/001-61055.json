Rigor mortis had started to develop . With the exception of the findings stated above , there were no other pathological diagnoses or signs of injuries caused by sharp , pointed instruments , firearms or otherwise .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of these findings the doctors observed that the cyanosis covering the head could be consistent with a heart attack or with another incident occurring either before or after death . The findings of the external examination , none of which were by themselves capable of causing death , did not allow the exact cause of death to be established . For this reason it was decided to perform a full autopsy . The expert medical witnesses estimated that death had occurred TIME previously .", "CARDINAL . On the subsequent internal examination of the head , the thorax and the abdomen no abnormalities were observed . The urethra was found to be positioned normally and no pathological finding was made in this respect .

PERSON was a registered medical practitioner , Senior Lecturer in ORG at ORG , GPE , and Consultant Pathologist to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the report of the post - mortem examination and autopsy and the report of ORG PERSON concluded that no natural disease had been found to contribute to or account for death . The body had shown injuries to the arms and foot which were in keeping with blows to those areas . The extensive bruising of the left forearm could have been due to the deceased having used his arms to try and ward off blows . The injuries in these areas were referred to as defence injuries which typically involved the forearm and hands . They might also involve the feet if the feet were used to shield blows . The cut to the right arm suggested that it had been inflicted with a sharp implement such as a knife .", "CARDINAL . The injuries appeared to have been inflicted whilst the deceased was in custody . The scar described as being DATE could have been inflicted during custody . Given that dating of scars was not accurate this injury could have been more recent .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the absence of any natural disease process to cause death and with the presence of obvious injuries which were not self - inflicted , the possibility that the deceased was a victim of an unnatural disease process had to be seriously considered . Poisoning as a cause of death could be excluded from the toxicological examination performed . However , there were a number of possible mechanisms to account for the appearances . The first of these was traumatic or crush asphyxia . In this type of death the chest was pinioned in such a way as to prevent breathing . Crucifixion caused death in a similar manner , as did so - called NORP hanging where the hands were tied behind the back and the body was suspended from the tied arms which would cause respiratory failure if the position was held for a sufficient length of time . The second possible mechanism was the placing of a plastic bag over the face or head , which was well recognised to lead to death . This would not leave any specific external signs . Finally , in a choke hold or carotid sleeper an arm was held across the neck . In choke holding it was held across the front of the neck , frequently damaging the structures in the neck , particularly the laryngeal cartilages . With carotid sleeper a similar hold was placed , but with the neck being held in the crook of the arm so that the carotid arteries were occluded . Application of either hold could prove fatal .", "CARDINAL . PERSON did not accept that PERSON had died as a result of a heart attack . In every death the heart would stop , but this was a mode of death and not a cause of death . Moreover , neither in the autopsy nor in the microscopic ( histopathological ) examination had any heart disease been found . In the absence of natural disease and with clear injuries present on the deceased , death as a result of torture must be a very strong possibility in this case .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the autopsy PERSON remarked that it was not clear to what extent the physicians performing it had had training and experience in forensic pathology . The autopsy report did not appear to contain a detailed description of the internal appearance of the neck . This was a major omission in detailing a death in custody , especially in view of the description of cyanosis of the head and neck . Moreover , injuries in persons having died whilst in custody should be documented and photographed and unlawful methods of killing had to be considered . It was not clear that such a thorough investigation had been conducted in this case . The inability of the doctors performing the autopsy to conduct a microscopic examination , which was an integral part of any post - mortem examination , suggested that they may have lacked the necessary experience to have conducted this examination .", "CARDINAL . The photographs show the naked body of a man laid down on what is , presumably , a mortuary slab . The colour reproduction in particular is of poor quality , tingeing everything with a green hue . The first photograph shows part of the chest as well as the left side of the face . A mark is visible on the forehead , between the left eyebrow and the hairline . ORG in the shape of a mask can not be observed but the left ear appears bluish .", "CARDINAL . In the second photograph , the body lies on its left side and the back of the body is portrayed . It is not possible to see the whole of the right shoulder blade . TIME shaped scar is visible . The third and fourth photographs show the body lying on its back . For the third photograph , the photographer would have stood near the feet of the body ; the feet are not visible and of the head only the tip of the nose and the bearded chin can be observed . There appears to be a reddish area of discoloration on the left forearm . For the fourth photograph , the photographer would have stood to the right of the body near the knees . The right side of the face , part of the neck and chest , the right arm , a small part of the left forearm , and the rest of the body down to almost the top of the knees can be seen . No cyanosis is visible . On the outside of the right arm there appears to be a welt - like reddish mark stretching down from the middle of the shoulder to halfway to the elbow . The reddish area of discoloration on the left forearm can also be observed in this photograph .", "CARDINAL . The evidence of the CARDINAL witnesses heard by ORG may be summarised as follows :", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that he had been born in DATE and was a lawyer by profession . Apart from PERSON , he had CARDINAL other brothers and sisters . He was the second youngest .", "CARDINAL . The last time he had seen his brother PERSON had been DATE prior to the latter being taken into custody . PERSON had seemed to be in good health and had in fact never had an illness . He had not heard of an illness called urethritis .", "CARDINAL . He had been in ORG , where he was studying , when his elder brother had informed him of the fact that PERSON had been taken into custody . He had immediately returned to PERSON and had arrived home on DATE as PERSON had been apprehended .", "CARDINAL . PERSON had been a tradesman and a delegate of ORG ( PERSON , \u201c DYP \u201d ) . He had never been arrested before .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had not seen PERSON in detention . During interrogation a detainee was not allowed any visitors for DATE . The family had gone to GPE to try and see PERSON many times but had not been allowed to do so . He had gone to the public prosecutor 's office in GPE but this had not resulted in permission being granted to the family to see PERSON and neither had any information of the charges brought against PERSON been forthcoming . Members of the ORG had tried to intercede , but to no avail . At the PERSON gendarmerie station the family had been told not to worry as PERSON would be released .", "CARDINAL . DATE after PERSON 's arrest , his uncle PERSON had been contacted by the PERSON gendarmerie station with the news that PERSON 's body could be collected from GPE . The family had brought the body home on DATE and this was where he had seen the body . He had noticed that certain parts had been removed for the autopsy , including parts of the brain . Apart from the scars caused by that , he had seen the mark of an injury on PERSON 's forehead . In his opinion this injury had been caused by a blow , as it did not have the appearance of a boil or of an injury that might have come about as a result of scratching , for example . There had also been marks on the hands , under the soles of the feet and on the elbows .", "CARDINAL . DATE he had gone to the public prosecutor in PERSON stating that PERSON 's was no normal death . Although at that time he was not familiar with the content of the health report drawn up by PERSON ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) , he knew that every person taken into custody would first be taken to the health centre for an examination . He did not know what kind of tests this examination entailed . When PERSON 's body had been released to his uncle PERSON , officials had said that PERSON had died of a heart attack . The family had not believed this and he had therefore requested another autopsy . Asked why he had not told the prosecutor of the wounds he had seen on PERSON 's body , he said that this must have been because he had been in shock but also because the prosecutor had not asked him about it . Nevertheless , he had clearly stated that PERSON 's death had been brought about by torture . He had read and signed the record of his statement to the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . Yakup 's body had remained at the house for TIME and the burial had taken place DATE . He conceded that the text of his statement to the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , which he had drawn up himself , was somewhat ambiguous . His family had not been prevented from burying PERSON but pressure had been brought to bear on them to hold the funeral on DATE the body was delivered to the family , that is to say CARDINAL DATE . This had been because the authorities feared trouble . However , the family and the district chairman of the ORG had pleaded with the chief superintendent of police to be allowed to hold the funeral DATE so that the body could be kept at home for TIME in accordance with local custom . There had been security forces all over PERSON until the body had been buried . Neither a delegation of the ORG nor the press had been allowed to attend the funeral .", "CARDINAL . Major PERSON , who had been appointed investigator by LOC , had summoned his mother , his brother PERSON and himself to PERSON police station on DATE to take statements from them . Although as an investigator Major PERSON was supposed to put questions objectively , the interview had not been conducted in such a manner at all . He felt that Major PERSON 's questions had been designed to protect Major PERSON 's own personnel and to cover up the incident . He felt that psychological pressure had been brought to bear on him . For instance , Major PERSON had asked questions like , \u201c Why are you making a complaint ? Why do you not believe that your brother died of a heart attack ? Why do you not believe that the cause of death is not torture ? \u201d Major PERSON had further commented : \u201c There is no need for you to complain . We would not do such a thing \u201d ; and also : \u201c It is wrong for you to think like that about security forces personnel . The allegations of torture are wrong . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Major PERSON had not asked him whether he had seen PERSON 's body or what its condition was , but both his mother , his brother PERSON and himself had told Major PERSON that PERSON 's death was a result of torture . It had been his brother PERSON who had told Major PERSON that PERSON had had a small pustule on his penis for which he had received medical treatment , as the applicant had not been aware of this previously . When the record of his statement to PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) was put to him , he denied having said to Major PERSON : \u201c If death has occurred because of natural causes , it is God 's will \u201d . PERSON had been a very healthy man who would not have died of natural causes within DATE and it was therefore not possible that he would have described PERSON 's death as God 's will . Moreover , why would he have said such a thing when DATE prior to that he had complained to the public prosecutor of torture ? Therefore , the record of his statement to Major PERSON was not completely accurate . He had been told to sign the record and had not read it .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG had decided that no prosecution was to be instituted . That decision had been overturned by ORG which had referred the case to ORG . Although according to the law that court had jurisdiction ratione materiae as well as ratione loci , it had declined to exercise it , for the sole purpose of delaying the proceedings . Following a decision by ORG that it had no jurisdiction either , ORG had decided that it was ORG which was the competent court to deal with the case . However , in the meantime DATE had passed .", "CARDINAL . He had been an intervening party in the criminal proceedings and had attended many hearings . He characterised the trial as disorganised and said that the case had not been actively prosecuted . It was his opinion that the CARDINAL accused ought to have been in custody while the trial was proceeding but the public prosecutor had told the court that it was not necessary to arrest the CARDINAL men . In fact , the accused had not attended court even once to give evidence and on some occasions their counsel had also failed to attend . Most of the witnesses had moved to different places and their testimonies had not been obtained . In spite of all the available evidence the CARDINAL accused had been acquitted .", "CARDINAL . It was put to him that , despite his objections voiced to the PERSON public prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE , he had told ORG on DATE that he had nothing to say about the autopsy report or the report of ORG . He explained that although the report of ORG had not satisfied him , as he had also pointed out to ORG , according to the law there was no organisation above ORG . Furthermore , by that time DATE had passed and his family had not wanted another autopsy carried out .", "CARDINAL . As reported by ORG , several times during his testimony this witness became very emotional and cried .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON said that he had been born in DATE . He was an elder brother of the applicant and PERSON . At the relevant time , PERSON had been married and had a DATE baby . PERSON 's widow and child continued to live with him . Following the death of their father in DATE PERSON and himself had become the heads of the family , looking after the younger brothers and sisters who were still at school . They had lived in the same house . He had been very close to PERSON . They had both been traders and DATE they used to go together to the marketplace , where they both had business LOC . They had both enjoyed the sport of wrestling and would frequently wrestle together of TIME . Although he was older than PERSON , PERSON had been the stronger .", "CARDINAL . He had last seen PERSON alive on TIME after his arrest . PERSON had been held TIME at the PERSON gendarmerie . He had gone there and had found PERSON sitting in the canteen . He had observed PERSON to be in good condition . He had brought PERSON breakfast but because PERSON had been handcuffed he had only given him a glass of milk . PERSON did not know why he had been arrested . He had asked PERSON whether the gendarmes had done anything to him , which PERSON had denied . Then a gendarme had taken PERSON out of the canteen and TIME he had observed PERSON being put in a vehicle and driven away .", "CARDINAL . Like PERSON , he was also a delegate of the DYP . He had gone to see the district chairman of the ORG who had found out from the gendarmerie that PERSON had been taken to GPE . Although the family had attempted to gain access to PERSON this had been refused .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE although he said CARDINAL DATE , ORG considered that this was a mistake since DATE was a DATE Mr PERSON had gone to the GPE Governor 's office in GPE , thinking that would be a likely day for detainees to be brought before the court and hoping that he would be able to see PERSON if that happened . Around TIME he had been approached by an acquaintance from PERSON who had told him that PERSON had died and his body taken to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . He had subsequently learned that at TIME the gendarmes had come looking for him . As they had not found him at home , they had gone to his uncle PERSON who had been taken to ORG . At the entrance to the hospital his uncle had been met by the captain of the gendarmerie who had asked what relation PERSON was to PERSON . When PERSON said that PERSON was his elder brother 's son , the captain had extended his hand and had said , \u201c Please accept my condolences . PERSON died DATE TIME . \u201d Upon this , his uncle had made telephone calls to PERSON and all the relatives and many acquaintances had immediately rushed to PERSON : CARDINAL the population of PERSON had gone there , including fellow shopkeepers who had closed their shops . In view of the large number of cars , the security forces had brought the body back to PERSON under military escort .", "CARDINAL . When PERSON 's body had arrived home the chief superintendent of police had demanded that it be buried immediately . Since he had not yet returned from PERSON , his brother had refused . Upon his return in the evening they had pleaded with the chief superintendent , saying that there was not enough light left to arrange a funeral that night .", "CARDINAL . PERSON 's body had been laid out in the house . He and the imam had washed the body . PERSON 's forehead , above the left eye , had sunk in and appeared as if it had been hit with a piece of metal . The shoulders were bruised and had turned purple and black . On the right hand side of the lower back there had been a mark in the shape of a DATE new moon . There had been red and black bruising on the arms and on the back of the legs , from the calves down to the lower legs . There had been blood coming from the tip of a toe . The left hand side of PERSON 's face was all bruised .", "CARDINAL . He had not accompanied his younger brother to the public prosecutor but another brother had done so . He had stayed behind to receive the people coming to express their condolences .", "CARDINAL . There had been no problem with PERSON 's health or strength . On DATE of his arrest , PERSON had been cutting firewood .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the witness had been summoned to the police station , together with his mother and brother PERSON . There , PERSON had not asked about the injuries he had seen on PERSON 's body but only if PERSON had had an illness . The witness had replied that he had not and had in fact been stronger than he was . Major PERSON had said that PERSON had visited the health centre in relation to a urinary problem . He had said to Major PERSON that this might have been the case . He had also told PERSON \u015eeker that PERSON had been murdered by torture and that he wanted the perpetrators prosecuted . The witness said to the Delegates that even if PERSON had gone to the doctor 's with a urinary problem this had not been around the time of his arrest .", "CARDINAL . He denied having said to Major PERSON that if PERSON 's death was the result of natural causes this would have been God 's will . He had not dared or considered reading the record of his statement when PERSON had given it to him to sign .", "CARDINAL . Public Prosecutor PERSON stated that he was born in DATE . In DATE he had been working as public prosecutor in GPE . He had left GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . He remembered having attended the post - mortem examination and autopsy that had been performed on PERSON body on DATE , although he had no clear recollection of the details . He had been telephoned at home by the gendarmerie and been informed that a person had become ill while in custody and had died on the way to hospital .", "CARDINAL . In view of the importance of the incident he had contacted the chief public prosecutor who had instructed him to have a second public prosecutor attend the autopsy also . The seriousness of the incident , referred to in the beginning of the report of the post - mortem examination and autopsy ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , had lain in the fact that a person had died while in the custody of the security forces and also in the fact that this kind of incident could cause speculation . He illustrated this by relating how previously there had been speculation that terrorists who had surrendered to the authorities had been killed by the security forces when they had in fact been killed by other terrorists . Moreover , there had been allegations to the effect that when an autopsy report was drawn up by a public prosecutor , only some of the findings would be listed and certain matters would be omitted altogether . If CARDINAL prosecutors attended , they could act as witnesses for each other if the need arose .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL photographs submitted by the Government ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) were shown to him and he was reasonably certain that the body depicted in the photographs was that of the man on which he had performed the post - mortem examination on DATE . They had been taken by the photographer of the LOC provincial gendarmerie . The negatives would usually be kept at the offices of the photographer 's employer .", "CARDINAL . In a post - mortem examination it was the public prosecutor who would dictate the findings , drawing on the expertise of the doctor present . However , an autopsy would be performed by a doctor . In the present case , it had not been possible to determine the exact cause of death from the post - mortem examination , although the doctors had suggested at the end of the examination that the death could have resulted from a heart attack . For this reason it had been decided that a full autopsy should be performed . As the exact cause of death had not appeared from the autopsy either , a joint decision had been taken to send tissue samples from the body to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP Although they had been able to observe in the process of the autopsy that the heart had been of normal appearance , he did not know whether this meant that cardiac failure had been ruled out . He did not agree with the suggestion that by the end of the autopsy the doctors and he himself would have had good grounds for suspecting that death had been caused by beating . On the contrary , the doctors had determined during the post - mortem examination that the injuries observed on the body could not have constituted the cause of death .", "CARDINAL . He was not aware that the form of torture known as \u201c NORP hanging \u201d could lead to death by asphyxiation . As he had never heard of this form of torture , he did not know whether PERSON injuries were consistent with somebody having been subjected to such treatment .", "CARDINAL . ORG If , in the course of the post - mortem examination , any opinion , provisional or otherwise , had been expressed as to the possible cause of the blunt traumata with which some of the observed areas of ecchymosis were consistent , this would have been recorded in the report . Given that such traumata could have many different causes he did not think it likely that the doctors would have been able to determine their exact cause from a post - mortem examination . Forensic experts might be able to establish the exact cause , and this might also be determined in a subsequent judicial investigation . Asked whether it had not occurred to him to enquire of the doctors whether the marks on the body were consistent with ill - treatment while in custody , he said that they had probably assumed that this would be determined by the subsequent investigation .", "CARDINAL . NORP When asked whether it would not have been extremely important to find out immediately whether or not there had been any instrument or object present in the place of detention capable of having produced the injuries found on the body , he said that the cause of those injuries had not yet been established . In reply to the subsequent question whether a search for an object capable of producing such injuries was not precisely how the cause of the injuries might be established , he conceded that this was probably the case . Given that he had had no jurisdiction in the matter , however , he had not given an instruction for the interrogation rooms at GPE provincial gendarmerie headquarters to be inspected . In any event , it had been established that these injuries were not the cause of death .", "CARDINAL . He had attended the post - mortem examination and the autopsy in his capacity of public prosecutor because time had been of the essence . However , pursuant to LAW no . CARDINAL establishing a state of emergency regional governorate it was not him but ORG which was the competent authority to investigate the incident . He was familiar with the fact that one of PERSON brothers had lodged a complaint with ORG . The complaint had been transferred to him because ORG had no jurisdiction in the matter . However , the incident would have been investigated regardless of whether or not a complaint had been brought .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he had issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction in which he confirmed that ORG had no jurisdiction . He had transferred the file to ORG . In his opinion , the most important part of the investigation had already been carried out by that stage , namely the examinations to establish the exact cause of death . After that , the only thing left to do was to take statements from witnesses and suspects .", "CARDINAL . In its investigation , the provincial administrative council had the same powers as a public prosecutor . He did not know at what stage ORG had been alerted to the incident \u2013 it might have been informed at the same time as he . In proceedings before the provincial administrative council an investigator would be appointed who was responsible for the collection of evidence . He thought that in a case like the present the investigator would not be a member of the gendarmerie in view of the fact that the case involved the gendarmerie .", "CARDINAL . He had only found out that a criminal prosecution had been instituted when he had been asked to testify by a rogatory letter at his new post in Buldan . ORG had requested ORG to take his statement in order to check the accuracy of the autopsy report and to confirm his signature .", "CARDINAL . Professor PERSON had been an expert in forensic medicine since DATE . He was not a pathologist . He had become a professor in DATE . From DATE until DATE he had worked at the morgue specialist department of ORG , performing autopsies in an expert capacity . DATE , and therefore at the time relevant to the present case , he had been the administrator of the morgue specialist department . DATE until DATE he was President of ORG ( \u201c the Institute \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The witness was asked to explain certain parts of the report issued by ORG DATE which bore his signature . He confirmed that the findings of the post - mortem examination and autopsy performed in GPE had been set out at the beginning of that report .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the findings of the post - mortem examination he explained that a \u201c mauve coloured cyanosis \u201d was a dark blue discoloration of the skin . \u201c Thorax \u201d meant chest . An ecchymotic area referred to bruising , ecchymoses constituting the proof of a blunt trauma . The axis of the body was the vertical line that passed through the centre of the body . The humerus was the bone of the upper arm .", "CARDINAL . The hyperaemia , observed in the macroscopic examination of the tissue samples of the internal organs , referred to the appearance of the organs which contained more than the normal amount of blood . This in itself could have many causes , such as illness or poisoning .", "CARDINAL . After the macroscopic examination the samples had been prepared for microscopic examination and sent to a pathologist . The changes to the heart , liver , kidneys and brain that had occurred after death had been observed in this histopathological examination . It had further revealed hyperaemia in the lungs as well as acute swelling , meaning expansion , of the alveoli in particular . In the alveolar septa , that is the walls separating the alveoli , the capillary walls had been enlarged and had contained great quantities of red blood cells . In some places the alveolar septa had been ruptured , causing the alveolar cavities to enlarge . These were not changes that would occur after death . The rupturing of alveolar septa could occur in patients suffering from emphysema or chronically obstructed lungs , but also in persons who had met with a violent death or , as it was known in forensic medicine , a forcibly induced death such as strangulation , hanging or pressure exerted on abdomen or chest . However , in the case of a forcibly induced death one would expect to see red blood cells in the alveolar cavities in addition to tears in the septa , and this had not been observed .", "CARDINAL . The report did not admit of a conclusion as to whether the swelling of the lungs had been due to a disease or had occurred after death . Given that it was limited to the breakdown at cell level it could have been caused by cells decomposing . The fact that the lungs were of a hard and solid consistency had pointed to pneumonia but the histopathological examination had not revealed any infected cells which would have supported such a finding . Despite the fact that the heart at QUANTITY had been observed to have been abnormally enlarged , the death had not been attributed to a disease .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor at GPE had requested that the exact cause of death be established . As the findings of the examinations had not revealed very specific information it had not been possible to determine the exact cause . Even in the most advanced centres of forensic medicine PERCENT of autopsies were inconclusive . DATE they would have referred the question of the cause of death to ORG of the ORG if they themselves had been unable to establish the cause of death . However , the policy had been changed and they had been advised that as long as the public prosecutor did not request it , they should not send their reports to this ORG but rather evaluate their own findings and send them to the office of the public prosecutor . If the public prosecutor had only asked for the cause of death , as opposed to the exact cause , the ORG would have provided him with possible causes . In view of the breakdown in the heart and the septa , the witness suggested that death had possibly , but without certainty , been due to heart failure .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the ORG could only work on the basis of the information with which it was provided . In the present case , they had been told that PERSON had suddenly fallen ill while in detention and had died in hospital . If death had occurred at the place of detention its cause might have been tied to mechanical asphyxia . Mechanical asphyxia was death caused by prevention of breathing by mechanical pressure . Typical examples would be hanging , strangulation by hand or rope , and death caused by pressure on the abdomen / chest . In the latter form of asphyxiation cyanosis of the face , resembling a mask , could appear .", "CARDINAL . When it was pointed out to the witness that according to the report of the post - mortem examination and autopsy PERSON had died on the way to hospital ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) rather than at the hospital as mentioned in his report , he explained that he must have relied on the information contained in the official summary of the incident compiled by the public prosecutor which would have been attached to the autopsy report when it was sent to the Institute .", "CARDINAL . The marks observed on the body were not from the kind of violent trauma that could cause death . The signs of trauma described in the report were superficial : a skin abrasion on the forehead , ecchymoses on the arms . In the case of severe trauma the ecchymoses would not have been on the surface and there would have been broken bones and internal haemorrhaging .", "CARDINAL . NORP Asked whether the extensive bruising on the left forearm and the hands were consistent with PERSON having used his arms to try and prevent blows from striking the rest of his body , the witness said if the bruising had been caused by numerous blows he would have expected there to be spaces between the ecchymoses . He explained that blows delivered by a cane or a stick would result in ecchymoses in the shape of lines , and in the shape of railroad tracks if delivered by a truncheon .", "CARDINAL . The cut described in the report of the post - mortem examination would have been inflicted by an implement with cutting properties . In his estimation , the cut must have been inflicted CARDINAL or DATE previously , since it should have healed within DATE .", "CARDINAL . When the report was drawn up he had not had access to the photographs taken in GPE ; otherwise they would have been mentioned . On being shown the photographs , the witness remarked that the cyanosis described in the report of the post - mortem examination was not visible . In addition , in deaths caused by heart or lung failure the cyanosis might not be as large as a mask but would be visible on the ears and lips . On the body in the photographs the lips were pale . Also , some of the ecchymoses described in the post - examination report were visible , but not all .", "CARDINAL . Since there was no visible deformation of the head the skull did not appear crushed as alleged by the applicant in his statement to the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Nevertheless , it would have been possible for the applicant to think that the skull had been fractured if he had seen the body after the autopsy , during which the bony part of the skull had been removed .", "CARDINAL . He confirmed that in every forensic autopsy the neck should be examined internally .", "CARDINAL . Dr H\u00fcseyin Sar\u0131 stated that he had been born in DATE . At DATE he had been working as an expert of forensic medicine at the morgue specialist department of ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the morgue specialist department CARDINAL types of work were carried out : autopsies , and examination of internal organ samples sent to the department from elsewhere . In the course of autopsies performed by the department photographs would be taken . No general guidelines existed as to how such photographs should be taken ; whether , for example , maximum contrast should be shown to delimit areas of discoloration . Those photographs that were considered necessary as evidence later on would be taken . However , it was rare for internal organ samples to be accompanied by photographs .", "CARDINAL . He confirmed that in the present case the LOC public prosecutor had requested the exact cause of death to be established . However , it was not the case that a public prosecutor would ever ask for a possible or probable cause of death . Therefore , he would have to be certain of the cause of death before offering his opinion . According to international medical literature PERCENT of autopsies were inconclusive . He estimated that the percentage of inconclusive autopsies at the ORG would lie somewhere between those CARDINAL figures .", "CARDINAL . He described cyanosis as a lesion related to an increased amount of carbon dioxide in the blood . It could only be observed visually and could not be detected by examining samples of skin tissue . ORG did not only occur after death , but in cases where it had occurred before death it had to be clinically verified since the changes of gases which took place after death could result in erroneous positive findings . Therefore , a post - mortem evaluation alone did not always give the correct result and could give rise to the suspicion that the deceased had been suffering from a disease or that death had been caused by asphyxiation .", "CARDINAL . Asked if there was a disease which could cause the lungs to be of a hard and solid consistency and of a multicoloured appearance , as described in the ORG 's report , he said that these findings had been made in the macroscopic examination and pointed to lung oedema or pneumonia . A histopathological examination was required to distinguish oedema from pneumonia . In the present case , the histopathological examination had not revealed anything to support those findings . In any event , the fixative used to prevent the disintegration of the internal organs would lead to a hardening of those organs .", "CARDINAL . Although there had thus been no findings made of a disease this did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the cause of death had been unnatural . For example , the heart , liver , kidneys and brain had undergone post - mortem changes and had not been evaluated . Post - mortem changes occurred for CARDINAL reasons : CARDINAL being the time that had elapsed between the death and the autopsy and the other a mishap in the course of transportation of the tissue samples . If the proper fixative was used and proper transportation procedures followed , such a sample would not undergo any change .", "CARDINAL . The marks of the traumata described in the report of the post - mortem examination had been rather small and simple , and most of them had been located on the arms and legs . In his opinion , the cause of death could not be determined from those traumata alone .", "CARDINAL . In all autopsies an internal examination of the neck would be carried out .", "CARDINAL . Dr G\u00fcne\u015f Pay said that he had been born in DATE . He had graduated from medical school in DATE . As part of his medical training he had had CARDINAL or DATE training in forensic medicine . Only those students wanting to specialise in forensic medicine would be given extensive training . In DATE he had been working as a general practitioner at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The witness confirmed that he had participated in the post - mortem examination and autopsy on the body of PERSON and that he had signed the report dated CARDINAL DATE . PERSON , with whom he had performed the autopsy , was a surgeon . Since the autopsy had been performed DATE previously he had no clear recollection of the events and based his replies mainly on the content of his report . Moreover , at the present time he was specialising in neurology , not forensic medicine , and it had been DATE since he had last performed an autopsy .", "CARDINAL . Although he could not remember exactly , he assumed that he must have participated in other autopsies before the CARDINAL which he performed on the body of PERSON . This would be part of a general practitioner 's duty if there was no expert in forensic medicine at the place where the general practitioner was performing his obligatory service . While working in GPE for DATE he had performed many autopsies .", "CARDINAL . He was referred to the phrase in the report reading : \u201c With the exception of the findings stated above , there were no other pathological diagnoses or signs of injuries caused by sharp , pointed instruments , firearms or otherwise . \u201d He explained that this did not mean that in those \u201c findings stated above \u201d he had found marks of such instruments .", "CARDINAL . The fact that rigor mortis had begun to set in was CARDINAL of the reasons why death had been estimated to have occurred TIME . However , the purple colour of the corpse had also served as an indication of that . He confirmed that if a person died in hospital , and if it was a properly run hospital , the time of death would be recorded and it would not be necessary to give an estimate of this time in the subsequent examination .", "CARDINAL . He could not remember whether or not an internal examination of the neck had been carried out but he noted that nothing was mentioned about it in the report . He thought that if such an examination had been performed it would have been recorded , but it was also possible that if nothing unusual had been found in the course of that examination it had been omitted from the report altogether . He knew that in theory an internal examination of the neck area would be conducted in cases of death by hanging or by strangulation by hand or by rope . He did not think , however , that he had performed an autopsy on the body of a person having met with such a death .", "CARDINAL . As the autopsy had taken place such a long time ago he was unable to confirm that the photographs shown to him were of the person on whom he had performed the autopsy . The cyanosis described in the report was not visible in the photographs . Nevertheless , he was certain that there had been cyanosis as CARDINAL doctors had come to that conclusion and had recorded it in the report . All but CARDINAL of the marks visible on the body in the photographs corresponded with those recorded in the report . The cut , QUANTITY in length , was not visible in the photographs and neither was the lesion above the scapula . Perhaps this was due to the quality of the photographs .", "CARDINAL . He had not formed any provisional view as to a likely or possible cause of death in the light of the marks he had seen .", "CARDINAL .
