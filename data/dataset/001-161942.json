De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG Implementing Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( ORG ) to award compensation for a property owned by his ancestors and taken over by ORG . On DATE the Commission issued a decision proposing payment of compensation in the amount of ROL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL at the time ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision , according to the law , had to be validated by a central commission within DATE . As ORG did not issue any decision , the applicant brought a court action aimed at obliging ORG to act in accordance with the law . The applicant also asked for the amounts granted by ORG to be adjusted for inflation when payment was made .", "The applicant \u2019s action was dismissed on DATE by ORG , which held that the DATE deadline was not compulsory , but rather advisory . The court also held that the adjustment of the amounts granted was indeed prescribed by LAW of the law , but any adjustment was to be made at the time payment was actually made , once ORG had ratified or otherwise the ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim , and ordered that the ORG issue a decision ratifying or otherwise the proposal made by ORG on DATE . The court held that the claim concerning the adjustment of the amounts granted as compensation was to be dealt with during the enforcement stage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ratified the ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The compensation , representing at that time approximately ORG CARDINAL , was paid to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Dissatisfied with the decision of ORG , on DATE the applicant lodged a court action aimed at obtaining an adjustment of the initial amount to take into account inflation from the date on which it was established by ORG to the date of actual payment .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG ruled in the applicant \u2019s favour . ORG established that in accordance with LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the amounts set by ORG had to be adjusted for inflation if they were not paid in DATE they were awarded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reversed the decision , and ruled that the applicant was not entitled to an adjustment for inflation .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court concluded that ORG had interpreted the applicable law incorrectly , as the entitlement to adjustment for inflation had to be determined on the basis of DATE when ORG had ratified the decision of ORG . As the payment had been made uno ictu , and not in instalments , during DATE as ORG took its decision , the applicant was not entitled to an adjustment for inflation .", "CARDINAL . It also concluded that the failure of ORG to ratify the decision of ORG within DATE could not represent a legal basis for the adjustment of the amount in question ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
