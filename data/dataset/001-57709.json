S. is a mason and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a protest movement broke out in the town of GPE ( GPE of GPE ) directed against the sale of nuclear power stations to a NORP country then under a military regime . It continued in DATE in the form of demonstrations against the holding of an international arms fair , and writing graffiti and occupying buildings as a protest against the housing shortage . In DATE and DATE there was a series of cases of arson and attacks using explosives , causing damage to several public and private buildings including the house of PERSON , who was then a ORG Minister ( Bundesrat ) and head of ORG and Police .", "On DATE the GPE police set up a special unit with the task of co - ordinating the hunt for those responsible for these crimes . It shadowed the members , tapped the telephones and regularly emptied the dustbins of a commune which was thought to be sheltering the criminals .", "On DATE , the police arrested CARDINAL persons and seized numerous documents at the same time . CARDINAL of these persons were released again on DATE . The others were detained in solitary confinement , without being able to correspond freely with their lawyers , and each was the subject of a separate procedure .", "CARDINAL . S. was suspected of being involved in the above - mentioned crimes . He was arrested at his home in GPE on DATE but succeeded in escaping . He was arrested again on DATE and charged with the use of explosives in connection with the attack on PERSON house .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesanwalt ) sent the GPE authorities various documents implicating the applicant . On DATE he was questioned by members of ORG on the accusations against him , but exercised his right to silence .", "CARDINAL . The investigation became the responsibility of the GPE ORG ( PERSON ) on CARDINAL DATE , and PERSON was taken to GPE prison .", "After questioning him on DATE the District Attorney ( GPE ) accused him of having caused an explosion at Mr PERSON \u2019s house and started a fire at a civil defence centre . He again remanded him in custody on the grounds of the risk of flight and of collusion with his co - accused . On DATE he further accused him of arson at CARDINAL rifle ranges , flooding business LOC and criminal damage to property by means of graffiti . According to S. \u2019s lawyer all these charges were based on graphological reports which had been drawn up on the basis of documents seized by the police on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE authorities sent the GPE ORG the results of their investigations .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant had asked his mother to ask PERSON , the lawyer representing CARDINAL of the other accused , PERSON , to take on his defence too . Mr PERSON declined to do this and on CARDINAL DATE S. instructed PERSON . On DATE the President of ORG ( Anklagekammer ) of ORG ( ORG ) designated him as court - appointed defence counsel with retrospective effect from DATE", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while still in custody in GPE , the applicant had been able to confer freely with PERSON for TIME . From CARDINAL May , on the other hand , visits took place under the supervision of a police official . CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s letters to his lawyer , dated CARDINAL , DATE and DATE May , were intercepted and were later used for the purpose of graphological reports .", "After being transferred to GPE prison PERSON continued to be subject to surveillance of his correspondence and his lawyer \u2019s visits . He was , however , able on DATE to have a meeting with no witness present with PERSON , a lawyer who had been approached by his mother to undertake his defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant spoke with PERSON in the presence of a policeman who took notes and stopped the interview after TIME , on the grounds that they were no longer speaking about the case and he had other business to see to .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the GPE District Attorney informed ORG ( Staatsanwalt ) that he considered these measures necessary in view of the risk that the applicant \u2019s lawyer might collude with other lawyers or other co - accused . He relied on the second paragraph of LAW ( Strafprozessordnung ) , according to which :", "\" An accused who is held in custody shall be permitted written and oral contact with defence counsel , in so far as the purpose of the investigation is not jeopardised .", "Once his detention has exceeded DATE , an accused must not be refused permission to consult defence counsel freely and without supervision , unless there are special reasons , in particular a danger of collusion . After the close of the investigation , an accused shall have this right without restriction .", "( ... ) . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG of ORG gave PERSON \u2019s lawyer permission on DATE to examine CARDINAL police reports and several transcripts of statements by the co - accused at the registry of the Court , but not to take copies of them . From that date until DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) Mr Garbade did not have access to any other documents in the case - file .", "CARDINAL . There were numerous disputes between the lawyer and those carrying out the surveillance , notably on DATE when the lawyer wanted to give his client several decisions and letters from the District Attorney and a copy of the memorial for the public - law appeal of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The latter document was seized by the officer and sent to the District Attorney .", "CARDINAL . On application by the GPE ORG the President of ORG of ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention on remand until DATE , in order to prevent him colluding with his co - accused , who had meanwhile been released , and tampering with evidence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON saw some extracts from the final police report of CARDINAL DATE , but he did not have access to the case - file until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG of ORG , complaining of the surveillance of the interview of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and supplemented the appeal on DATE following other visits on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s appeal on DATE . It pointed out that he was suspected of having committed the crimes in question and said that in view of the complexity and extent of the authorities\u2019 investigation there was a serious risk of collusion ; because the accused had refused to make a statement , it would have been easy for him to tamper with the evidence , as his co - accused had been released , apart from W. He had also kept in close contact with them , and was accused of serious offences which had constituted attacks on public and social order . There was also a risk of unintentional collusion on the part of PERSON in view of his contacts with the lawyers representing the other accused , especially counsel for PERSON As for the conduct of the policeman responsible for surveillance of the interview of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , this could be justified .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision to ORG of ORG ; on DATE that court upheld the decision . The court found that a danger that the applicant would collude with his co - accused followed from his refusal to make a statement , and it could be supposed that he would use every effort to make their respective statements agree with each other ( abstimmen ) . PERSON had indeed been able to confer freely with him , but ORG did not find credible Mr PERSON \u2019s assertions that his contacts with the lawyers representing the other accused were no closer than PERSON ; further , counsel for PERSON had advised LOC Office that the lawyers had all agreed to co - ordinate their strategy .", "The court added :", "\" Acting in such a way is not inadmissible , but it must , however , be compatible with the duty to ascertain the material truth ( ORG der materiellen GPE ) . As the accused represented by PERSON and Mr PERSON are exercising their right to refuse to make any statements , one can not ignore the risk that defence counsel will not only co - ordinate their tactical and legal way of proceeding but may also , intentionally or not , adversely affect the ascertainment of the material truth . In these circumstances , precisely in the case of offences of this type which must be regarded as attacks on public and social order , there are sufficient indications pointing to a danger of collusion in the person of defence counsel . \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had also challenged a decision by the President of ORG extending his detention on remand . He complained that he had not been able to examine all the documents in the case - file , and that the proceedings had been entirely written . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and confirmed the further remand until DATE , on the grounds that there was still a danger of collusion and flight .", "CARDINAL . S. then brought CARDINAL public - law appeals before ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the first appeal , which was directed against the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , he relied on Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( b ) in conjunction with LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-b , article DATE ) of the Convention . He alleged that the surveillance of the interviews made his right to take proceedings within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) illusory , and that his right to a fair hearing was deprived of substance as regards the review of the lawfulness of his detention on remand ; in particular , the aforesaid surveillance prevented any confidential conversation with his lawyer aimed at refuting the evidence collected during the investigation . Further , he did not have access to the case - file and his lawyer was unable to take a copy of it .", "The second appeal challenged the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) and put forward essentially the same complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It found inter alia that PERSON , whose task it was to draw up the application for release from detention , had had access to the case file , so that the applicant \u2019s rights in the proceedings on the extention of his pre - trial detention had not been infringed . The court added that counsel would , at the preparation for trial at the latest , have the right to a copy of the case - file for his client if he asked for this .", "CARDINAL . The appeal of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) suffered the same fate on DATE . ORG held that only LAW CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) ( article DATE ) of the Convention ( as interpreted by ORG ) were relevant , and not Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( b ) ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-b ) , as the surveillance had not prejudiced preparation for the trial .", "The authorities had not been arbitrary in describing the offences in question as systematic attacks on public and social order . The accused appeared to be extremely dangerous and it was reasonable to suppose that they would have resorted to illegal methods even during the judicial proceedings . Consequently , regardless of Mr Garbade \u2019s personal qualities , surveillance of his contacts with his client was in accordance with the LAW and LAW .", "In the event of irregular actions on the part of a lawyer , it was in the first place up to the disciplinary authorities to impose penalties on him . A lawyer could intentionally or unintentionally become the accomplice of an accused . This was the case in particular with PERSON , who was in close contact with Mr PERSON , whose client PERSON had been allowed to communicate freely with him . However , the applicant could not claim to be the victim of discrimination , as PERSON had been in custody for much longer and was accused of additional offences .", "CARDINAL . The surveillance had not been relaxed in the meantime . The police officer in charge of it had drawn up reports on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ; these were subsequently added to the case - file . It was apparent from the first report that PERSON had had to show him the documents he was studying with his client .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the GPE ORG had informed ORG that the surveillance was aimed at eliminating all risk of collusion ; he considered , however , that it was unlikely that a conversation listened to could be used in evidence against S. in any way .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE District Attorney notified PERSON that he would end the surveillance as soon as he had heard the applicant \u2019s statement on the accusations brought against him . Mr PERSON replied that PERSON would refuse to make any statement as long as the surveillance continued .", "CARDINAL . The surveillance of visits and correspondence was ended on DATE following an interrogation lasting DATE . On that occasion the District Attorney asked the applicant to make a statement , but he exercised his right to silence . After this he was able to confer with his counsel in the prison library with no glass screen or any other restriction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had brought an appeal inter alia against the surveillance of visits and the fact that he was not allowed to consult the case - file .", "On DATE ORG of ORG had adjourned a decision on the first point , on the grounds that LOC ORG was about to discontinue the surveillance . On the second point the court had found that PERSON was still suspected of the offences in question and the length of the investigation was caused by his insistence on remaining silent .", "On DATE the court found that the complaint on which it had adjourned a decision on DATE was no longer a live issue now that the surveillance measures had ended ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In order to decide whether the applicant was liable for costs or was entitled to damages , it assessed what chances of success the appeal would have had if the surveillance had continued . It noted that the circumstances referred to in ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had not changed by DATE , the date of the appeal , and the restrictions on free communication between the applicant and his lawyer thus remained justified ; it therefore did not award him any pecuniary compensation .", "CARDINAL . S. appealed against this decision to ORG of ORG , which upheld the decision on DATE , again on the grounds that the appeal of DATE would probably have failed .", "CARDINAL . S. finally brought a public - law appeal on CARDINAL DATE . ORG dismissed it on CARDINAL DATE . Restricting itself to examining whether the refusal to award compensation was tainted by arbitrariness , it found that there had been a danger of collusion and in essence approved the findings of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In a report drawn up for the GPE ORG on CARDINAL DATE , the GPE police had expressed the opinion that some of the anonymous letters which had been sent shortly after the offences in question undoubtedly came from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The final interrogation took place on DATE . According to the record , PERSON refused to answer the accusations brought against him , and his lawyer attributed those accusations to the fact that his client was thought to have anarchist opinions .", "CARDINAL . The GPE ORG \u2019s final report ( ORG ) of CARDINAL DATE , comprising CARDINAL pages , accused the applicant of CARDINAL offences and attempted offences of arson , participation in CARDINAL attacks with explosives , various thefts and offences of criminal damage , including damage to a railway line ; the damage amounted to MONEY . The report was forwarded to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant made unsuccessful requests to ORG to reopen the investigation . He applied again on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with paragraph CARDINAL ( c ) of LAW a of FAC he left it to ORG to decide which court would try him . The ORG decided to commit him for trial by ORG rather than ORG ( Geschworenengericht ) , as it considered that his interests would be better protected in that way , especially with regard to his youth .", "CARDINAL . The trial was due to start on DATE but the applicant did not appear . ORG therefore adjourned the hearing .", "A fresh hearing took place on DATE , in the absence , for which no reason had been given , of S. who had been provisionally released on DATE . ORG found him guilty inter alia of manufacturing explosives , arson , theft and criminal damage and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment - DATE spent in custody on remand being deducted - and to payment of costs and expenses .", "The applicant appealed . A new trial took place on DATE , again in his absence . After hearing his counsel and the representative of ORG , ORG upheld its judgment of DATE . He appealed to ORG of the GPE of GPE , and enforcement of the judgment was suspended by the appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
