The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a journalist and member of a political party . At the time of the impugned events , he was also the editor of the local DATE newspaper , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant published an article about a certain historian , PERSON , entitled \u2018 The Floor is Given to the Fascist\u2019 ( \u2018 GPE i m a fa\u0161ista\u2019 ) . In his article the applicant wrote :", "\u201c PERSON , a historian , who during DATE ... used to write kilometres of various insults and defamation concerning the opponents of PERSON and his ... regime , has again come to the centre of public attention thanks to ... the journalist of ORG ... , who had invited him as a guest on the show \u2018 ORG . And PERSON would not have been himself ( an idiot ) , if he had not used another opportunity to express his fascist - oriented points of view . This is how he , on a national TV channel ... , stated that PERSON was under NORP occupation and that NORP , NORP and above all NORP in GPE were PERSON ... According to [ J. ] P. , there are no NORP in GPE ... , whereas the NORP are mainly NORP ... because they have \u2018 such nice NORP faces\u2019 ...", "In DATE following the show , many NGOs and individuals , as well as a few political parties , uttered their opinions .... [ They ] requested ORG , relying on point CARDINAL of its recommendation which provides ... that \u2018 all broadcasters were under the obligation to respect ... the provisions restraining hate PERSON , to take appropriate measures against the [ national ] TV ...", "The Minister of Culture and ORG and other officials also reacted ...", "The latest news indicates that ORG has been collecting relevant information about the show ... Meanwhile , ORG must be gloating because he has managed once again to launch his twisted attitudes into the public domain . Following the changes of DATE , this professional \u2018 long spitter\u2019 was ... appointed head of ORG ... until recently , when the Government discharged him . He was then granted the opportunity in some tabloids ... to [ criticise ] the existing Government and the \u201c non - existent nations \u201d . \u2018 PERSON was just the last episode of this activist ... who will undoubtedly ... contaminate our environment for a long time to come . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON instituted private criminal proceedings for insult against the applicant in ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held on DATE , the applicant stated that \u201c he did not wish to settle the matter with the private prosecutor [ PERSON ] because he was a member of the fascist movement in GPE \u201d . On account of this statement , on DATE PERSON instituted new private criminal proceedings for defamation against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Territorial jurisdiction in the matter was subsequently transferred to ORG , which decided to join the CARDINAL cases .", "CARDINAL . The court scheduled a hearing for DATE , the summons for which was served on the applicant along with ORG \u2019s second criminal bill of indictment on DATE . The applicant did not attend the hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court scheduled the next hearing for DATE , for which the applicant received the summons on DATE . He again failed to appear in court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submits that none of those court summons were served on him properly , since they had been sent to the address of the newspaper , where he was no longer employed . However , he appears to have personally signed acknowledgments of receipt forms for both summons .", "CARDINAL . At the next main hearing on DATE , the applicant was escorted to court by the police . His lawyer met him in the court building and made a request to the judge for a postponement of the hearing with a view to acquainting himself with the charges at issue .", "CARDINAL . The presiding judge granted the applicant and his lawyer TIME to prepare the applicant \u2019s defence . After TIME the applicant \u2019s lawyer stated that they were ready for the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The court held the main hearing and gave judgment that DATE , finding the applicant guilty of insult for the published article and of defamation for the statement given at the court hearing of CARDINAL DATE . The court fined the applicant MONEY ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) , and ordered him to pay ORG another RSD CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in respect of the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment ORG held , inter alia , that describing someone as a \u201c fascist \u201d was offensive , given the historical connotations of that expression \u201c representing tragedy and evil \u201d . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that he was merely expressing his own political views , since forming fascist political parties or movements was illegal under domestic law . The applicant had consequently failed to respect the human dignity of PERSON If he had felt personally offended by any of PERSON \u2019s statements made on the television programme or elsewhere , the applicant should have sought appropriate judicial relief .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the applicant , on DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment . The court concluded that ORG \u2019s statements were a product of his expert findings as a historian . Since the word \u201c fascism \u201d meant the extinction of people based on their nationality and/or religion , this had clearly not been the object of ORG \u2019s statements . The applicant \u2019s article had thus the sole aim of insulting PERSON by using this term and additionally calling him \u201c an idiot \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The second - instance court further found the applicant \u2019s allegations of improper summoning and an inability to prepare his defence ill - founded , establishing that he had been duly summoned twice but had failed to appear in court . Moreover , at the hearing on DATE the applicant and his lawyer had been given the opportunity to consult and prepare his defence , and they had stated after TIME that they were ready for the hearing .", "CARDINAL . It appears that ORG instituted another set of proceedings against the applicant \u2013 a civil claim for compensation for non - pecuniary damage DATE and that the domestic courts ordered the applicant to pay him compensation in the sum of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .
