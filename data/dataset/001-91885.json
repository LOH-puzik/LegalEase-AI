The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE he lived in an apartment rented from the ORG in a nationalised building . On DATE , under PERSON no . LANGUAGE on the legal status of certain residential property , the applicant bought that apartment from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed an action ( ac\u0163iunea \u00een revendicare ) brought by the former owner against the ORG for recovery of possession of the building where the applicant \u2019s apartment was situated .", "CARDINAL . Based on that decision , the former owner lodged several actions for recovery of possession against the persons who had bought apartments in the building in similar conditions , including the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the applicant to surrender possession of the apartment to the plaintiff . The court found that the former owner \u2019s property title deed , as it had been confirmed by the final decision of DATE , prevailed over the applicant \u2019s purchase contract . It also considered that the applicant \u2019s bona fides in concluding the CARDINAL DATE contract was relevant only in the event that the applicant lodged an action for compensation against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the same ORG did take into account the LOC good faith in dismissing actions lodged by the former owner against other persons who had bought apartments in the same building . Thus , on DATE ORG dismissed the action against ORG , who had bought their apartment on DATE ; on DATE it dismissed the action against ORG and GPE and on DATE it dismissed the action against GPE , who had bought his apartment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and ORG , acting on an application by the Procurator General ( recurs PERSON anulare ) , quashed the final decision of DATE and sent the case back to the firstinstance court . According to the information available to the ORG , the proceedings are still pending with the domestic courts .", "On DATE ORG allowed a similar application by the Procurator General and set aside the DATE decision , thereby allowing the former owner \u2019s action against GPE", "A similar action by the Procurator General , lodged against the CARDINAL DATE decision mentioned above , was allowed by ORG on DATE . The case was sent back to ORG for re - examination of the appeal . The proceedings are still pending with that court .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant , eviction proceedings lodged by the former owner against him are currently pending with the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . Under NORP law , an action for recovery of possession is one of the principal remedies for the protection of a right of property . Such action is not governed by statute per se but has emerged from case - law . An action for recovery of possession can be defined as the bringing of proceedings to enforce a right in rem in which a dispossessed owner claims back his or her property from the person currently in possession of it . When both the plaintiff and the defendant have a title deed , the court must compare the CARDINAL deeds and decide which one is preferred . The main outcome of such an action , if successful , is the acknowledgment by the court of the claimant \u2019s title to the property , with retrospective effect , thus obliging the defendant to return the property . If physical restitution is no longer possible , that obligation is replaced by an obligation to pay compensation on the basis of an equivalent sum ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . MONEY , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ) .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL of the Civil Code institute the seller \u2019s responsibility for eviction . They provide for the evicted buyer to claim reimbursement of the price and also the payment of costs and damages , regardless of the seller \u2019s good or bad faith . The buyer can either join the seller to the proceedings instituted against him by the third party or lodge a new action against the seller after having been evicted . In the latter case , if the seller proves that he could have won the case against the third party had he been joined to the proceedings , he will be exempted from compensating the buyer ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "A bona fide buyer continues to enjoy the benefits of the property until he is no longer considered bona fide , that is at the latest when the action for eviction is lodged against him , at which time enjoyment of the property reverts to the rightful owner . However , the buyer may still claim compensation for his loss from the seller .", "CARDINAL . At the date of the facts of the present case , LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the rules governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the ORG DATE and DATE , as amended by ORG Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL of DATE ( \u201c PERSON no . CARDINAL \u201d ) , prescribed that an action for recovery of the purchase price , indexed to take account of inflation , brought against the ORG by a buyer whose contract had been declared null and void , was not subject to court fees . It also provided that the indexed price was to be paid by ORG from a special fund .", "CARDINAL . At the ORG \u2019s request , the Government submitted case - law on the different actions for compensation when property is lost in conditions similar to those of the case at hand .", "CARDINAL . Of the CARDINAL relevant decisions adopted DATE by courts all over the country , CARDINAL concerned actions lodged against the ORG authorities by persons who lost their property in actions for recovery of possession . The courts applied LAW and awarded them the indexed purchase price and , in most of the cases , damages and the costs reasonably incurred for the upkeep of the house . Most of the courts considered that PERSON no . MONEY was not applicable to actions for recovery of possession when the sale contract was not declared null and void in such proceedings .", "CARDINAL . When such contracts are cancelled , however , the decisions submitted to the ORG indicate that the courts consistently apply PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and award the buyer the indexed purchase price .", "CARDINAL . In a decision no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG found in favour of the buyer in an action for recovery of possession lodged by the former owner of a nationalised apartment against the person who in good faith had bought the apartment from the ORG in DATE . The court decided that the restitution of the apartment to the former owner was no longer possible and , based on the ORG \u2019s case - law on LAW CARDINAL ( in particular : PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON CARDINAL ; ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE and ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXII ( extracts ) ) , it compelled the ORG to pay the market value of the apartment in compensation to the former owner . In the court\u2019the monetary award was the only solution to the action for recovery of possession .", "CARDINAL . In a similar decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG found in favour of the buyer in an action for recovery of possession lodged by the former owner . ORG took account of the fact that the buyer \u2019s title had been confirmed by the courts in an action in nullity of the sale contract lodged against him by the former owner whereas the former owner \u2019s title had not been upheld by a court . It further considered that dispossessing the buyer regardless of the circumstances , in order to surrender the property to the former owner , would create disproportionate new wrongs in the attempt to attenuate old injuries . It also considered , in a general statement , that the reimbursement of the indexed purchase price under PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL could not compensate the buyer as it did not reflect the property \u2019s market value .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG declared LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL unconstitutional in so far as it breached the buyer \u2019s property title . Under the provision concerned , persons whose actions based on LAW had been dismissed before the entry into force of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL could use this PERSON in order once again to seek the restitution of their property . ORG considered that persons whose title to property had been confirmed by a court decision could not be compelled to surrender that property where there was no serious justification for such a measure , based on public order , under LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
