On DATE the court ordered another local assessment and an examination of the parents and the child by the RODK experts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a psychologist submitted his opinion to the court . The expert stated that the weakening of the emotional bond between the applicant and ORG had been caused by a series of events .

At a hearing held on DATE , the applicant informed the court that DATE , when he had arrived to see his daughter , she had not wanted to go with him .

On DATE the RODK submitted its opinion to the court . Firstly , the experts observed that both parents loved ORG and were able to attend to her needs . The father was determined to have a place in her life and play an important role . The mother had not been right to cut off contact between PERSON and her father . While she claimed that she had not obstructed the contact arrangements , she was not aware that her passive approach and clear animosity towards her ex - husband had impeded father - daughter contact . The experts stressed that ORG had a strong emotional bond with the mother and remained under her influence . She did not feel loved by her father and was afraid of having contact with him . The experts concluded that ORG was not able to cope with the emotional consequences of the conflict between her parents and that family therapy was indispensable . Furthermore , despite her negative reaction to the applicant , she should have contact with him . However , contact visits should not take place in the mother \u2019s presence as that would increase ORG \u2019s negative attitude towards her father and prevent her from re - establishing a bond with him . Contact meetings should take place on neutral ground in the presence of a neutral person .", "DATE . On DATE ORG issued a contact order . According to that decision , the applicant could meet PERSON second DATE TIME and TIME , with the exception of DATE and the period DATE and DATE .
