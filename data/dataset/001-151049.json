The Government of GPE , having been informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings ( LAW ) , did not indicate that they wished to exercise that right .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a former staff member of ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d or the \u201c Organisation \u201d ) . She joined ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) in GPE in DATE . She was promoted several times and , in DATE , moved to ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , ORG , in GPE , GPE . ORG is represented worldwide through the offices of the ORG . The applicant served as a senior manager with ORG and resided in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE the applicant \u2019s professional performance had consistently been rated by consecutive supervisors in her DATE appraisal reports as exceeding or fully satisfying the requirements of her respective job . However , in DATE , as well as in DATE , a new supervisor found that she had not met the performance expectations .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence of the negative appraisal reports the applicant was included in the DATE ORG reassignment exercise with a view to her redeployment . By a letter of DATE , she was informed by the ORG human resources department that she had not been selected for any post within the scope of the reassignment exercise and was given a time - limit of DATE to search herself for an alternative placement in the ORG or elsewhere in the Organisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a rebuttal for an internal administrative review of the negative appraisal reports for DATE with a rebuttal panel ( the \u201c Rebuttal Panel \u201d ) composed of ORG staff members jointly selected by the staff council and management .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG management decided that the applicant should be placed on DATE leave during the period from DATE . As the applicant was unable to find a post within the ORG and following fruitless attempts by ORG to agree on possible conditions for a termination of the applicant \u2019s employment contract , she was given formal notice of termination by a letter dated DATE ; her dismissal was to be effective as of CARDINAL DATE . The termination was reasoned with intended staff reduction and suppression of posts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested an administrative review of the decision to dismiss her with the ORG Secretary - General ( the \u201c Secretary - General \u201d ) and asked to suspend her dismissal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary - General , following the recommendation by ORG ( the \u201c JAB \u201d ) of CARDINAL DATE , granted the applicant \u2019s request for a suspension of her dismissal pending completion of the rebuttal process in relation to her appraisal reports , which had commenced on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued its report and concluded that the applicant \u2019s performance ratings be maintained for DATE but found that it was not in a position to reach a final conclusion with respect to the rating for DATE due to management \u2019s failure to provide the relevant documentation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary - General , contrary to a recommendation by the ORG dated DATE , decided not to accept a further request by the applicant to suspend her dismissal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s employment ended on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , had lodged an appeal with the JAB challenging the decision to terminate her permanent appointment as well as the decision to place her on DATE leave during the period from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its report on the merits of the applicant \u2019s appeal dated DATE , the ORG found that following the applicant \u2019s dismissal ORG management had immediately hired a staff member under a temporary assistance contract to perform the applicant \u2019s functions and that her post had thus in reality not been suppressed but in fact had been reclassified to a higher grade . The ORG noted that it had not been established that ORG management had taken action to assist the applicant to improve her work performance from DATE onward . It further held that while the applicant had been placed in the reassignment exercise for DATE , ORG management had failed to make sufficient efforts to actively assist her in finding alternative employment within the ORG . As regards the decision to place the applicant on DATE leave from DATE to DATE , the ORG noted that even though the applicant \u2019s rebuttal process regarding her appraisal reports had been pending since DATE , the case had not yet been assigned to a Rebuttal Panel at the time she was placed on DATE leave in DATE . It had been only on DATE and only after the applicant had applied for suspension of her dismissal , that the ORG acknowledged that the rebuttal process had been delayed and started the rebuttal proceedings . In the ORG \u2019s opinion it had therefore not been in accordance with the applicable staff rules to penalise the applicant by having to use her DATE leave balance in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recommended that the applicant be granted monetary compensation equivalent to CARDINAL months\u2019 net base salary for the delay in the rebuttal process as well as for the failure on the part of ORG to make a reasonable effort to find a suitable alternative post for her . It also recommended that DATE leave wrongfully charged for the period of DATE be credited to her leave balance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed of the Secretary - General \u2019s decision to credit her with her DATE leave for the period from DATE and to grant her compensation in an amount of CARDINAL months\u2019 net base salary instead of DATE recommended by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) against the Secretary - General of the ORG , requesting the tribunal to find , inter alia , that she be reinstated and awarded full compensation for losses incurred since termination of her employment on DATE , such as social security and other benefits , as well as punitive damages .", "CARDINAL . By a letter to the ORG of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant further asked to be granted access to certain documents submitted by ORG in the proceedings before ORG and referred to by the latter in its report of DATE but which she had allegedly never had an opportunity to examine .", "CARDINAL . The ORG rendered its judgment on DATE ( No . CARDINAL ) following a written procedure . It pointed out that while the applicant \u2019s rebuttal had been filed on DATE , the internal rebuttal proceedings had only commenced on DATE following the applicant \u2019s request of DATE to suspend her dismissal and had ended on DATE . The proceedings had thus taken DATE , a delay that , as acknowledged by the ORG , was unacceptable . The ORG further endorsed the ORG \u2019s finding that the ORG administration had failed to make every bona fide effort to secure a new post for the applicant . It ordered the ORG to pay the applicant further compensation in the amount of CARDINAL months\u2019 net base salary in addition to the compensation she had already received and rejected the remainder of the applicant \u2019s pleas . The applicant \u2019s request for access to the aforementioned specific documents was not granted by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG were founded in DATE and currently have CARDINAL Member GPE .

In addition , it contains in its LAW and LAW ( a ) provisions similar to sections DATE ( a ) of the General Convention respectively .", "CARDINAL . Under the ORG internal appeals system in force at the time of the dispute at issue , ORG staff members who considered that a decision by the ORG administration had violated the terms of their employment could seek an administrative review of such decision by the ORG Secretary - General . If the Secretary - General did not reply within the allotted time - limit as stipulated in the relevant regulations or if his reply was unfavourable , the staff member could submit an appeal to ORG ( the \u201c JAB \u201d ) . The ORG , composed of CARDINAL staff members , following an examination of the case , made a non - binding recommendation to the Secretary - General who took the final decision on the appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary - General \u2019s final decisions could then be challenged before ORG ( the \u201c LAW ) . The ORG was established in DATE by ORG , for the purpose of resolving employment - related disputes between ORG staff and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The judges of the ORG , who had to possess judicial experience in the field of administrative law , were appointed by ORG for DATE and could be reappointed once . No member of the ORG could be dismissed by ORG unless the other members were of the unanimous opinion that he or she was unsuited for further service ( LAW ORG \u2019s Statute , adopted by ORG by LAW ) on DATE and as applicable at the time of the dispute at issue ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the proceedings before the ORG , each written statement and additional document submitted to the ORG at the request of its president was to be communicated to the other parties , unless at the request of CARDINAL of the parties and with the consent of the other parties , the ORG decided otherwise ( see LAW adopted by the Tribunal on DATE , as amended and applicable at the time of the dispute at issue ) . An applicant could present his case before the ORG in person , in either the written or oral proceedings . He could also designate a staff member of ORG to represent him , or could be represented by counsel authorized to practice in any country a member of the organization concerned ( LAW ORG ) . Oral proceedings were to be held if the presiding member so decided or if either party so requested and the presiding member agreed ( see LAW ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . If the ORG found that an application was well - founded , it had to order the rescinding of the decision contested . At the same time , it had to fix the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant for the injury sustained should the Secretary - General decide , in the interests of the ORG , that the applicant should be compensated without further action being taken in his or her case . Such compensation should , as a rule , not exceed the equivalent of CARDINAL years\u2019 net base salary of the applicant ( see LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG Secretary - General established ORG on the ORG system of administration of justice ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) in reply to a request by ORG expressed in its resolution CARDINAL/CARDINAL to establish a panel of external , independent experts to review and possibly redesign the system of administration of justice at ORG . ORG issued its report on DATE . The relevant parts of the report read as follows :", "\u201c Summary", "... ORG found that the ORG internal justice system is outmoded , dysfunctional and ineffective and that it lacks independence ...", "II . Overview", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the administration of justice in ORG is neither professional nor independent . The system of administration of justice as it currently stands is extremely slow , underresourced , inefficient and , thus , ultimately ineffective . It fails to meet many basic standards of due process established in international human rights instruments ...", "CARDINAL . NORP ... establishing a professional system of internal justice is essential if ORG is to avoid the double standard \u2013 which currently exists \u2013 where the standards of justice that are now generally recognized internationally and that the ORG pursues in its programmatic activities are not met within the ORG or the funds and programmes themselves . These international standards include the right to a competent , independent and impartial tribunal in the determination of a person \u2019s rights , the right to appeal and the right to legal representation .", "CARDINAL . ... Hearings , too , are a clear requirement in international standards whenever there are disputed issues of fact . ...", "ORG The Formal system", "CARDINAL . A number of the difficulties within the formal justice system stem from the ORG and the jurisprudence of ORG . By LAW of its Statute , ORG may order specific performance . However , it is required at the same time to fix compensation ( normally limited to DATE net base salary ) , which the Secretary- General may decide to pay as an alternative if that is considered to be in the interests of the ORG . The power of the Secretary - General to choose between specific performance and the payment of limited compensation can , and sometimes does , result in inadequate compensation , particularly in cases of wrongful termination or non - renewal of contract . A system that can not guarantee adequate compensation or other appropriate remedy is fundamentally flawed . More significantly , a system that does not have authority to finally determine rights and appropriate remedies is inconsistent with the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . The decisions of ORG are not always consistent , and its jurisprudence is not well developed . In particular , it does not have a coherent jurisprudence as to the duties of an international organization to its staff . Thus , there is a widespread view , which is largely correct , that the formal justice system affords little , if any , protection of individual rights , such as the right to a safe and secure workplace or the right to be treated fairly and without discrimination .", "VI . Legal representation", "CARDINAL . The Panel of Counsel , which was formally established in DATE and which has the responsibility to provide legal assistance and representation to ORG staff members in proceedings within the internal justice system , is extremely underresourced and is not professionalized . ...", "CARDINAL . ORG notes that legal assistance to the management of the ORG is undertaken not by volunteers without legal training , but by a cadre of professional lawyers in ORG and ORG . This disparity in legal resources available to the management and staff members has created an egregious inequality of arms in the internal justice system . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE , based on the recommendations of ORG and acting on a proposal by the Secretary - General , ORG decided to introduce a new system for handling internal disputes and disciplinary matters in ORG . The new CARDINAL - tier judicial system with ORG and ORG became operational on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG has jurisdiction to deal with constitutional complaints which concern acts of a \u201c public authority \u201d ( see LAW no . CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW ) . Under ORG well - established case - law , this comprises not only acts of NORP public authorities , but also acts of supranational organisations which concern the beneficiaries of fundamental rights in GPE ( see , for instance , ORG , file no . CARDINAL , DATE , judgment of DATE , Collection of the decisions of ORG ) , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ss . , CARDINAL s. ( GPE judgment ) ; file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ( of the internet version ) ) .", "CARDINAL . However , ORG only exercises its jurisdiction over supranational acts of international organisations under the condition that the complainant sufficiently substantiated that the level of protection of fundamental rights by the international organisation was generally and manifestly below the level required by LAW ( see , for instance , ORG , file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE , BVerfGE , vol . DATE , pp . CARDINAL ss . , CARDINAL ( PERSON ) ; file no . CARDINAL BvL CARDINAL , decision of DATE , BVerfGE , vol .

CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision of DATE ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerned the decision of ORG not to admit the applicant as a representative before that ORG as he had not passed the ability test .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . It found that the complaint was directed against an act of a \u201c public authority \u201d as the decision at issue had a direct effect on a beneficiary of fundamental rights in the NORP legal order .", "CARDINAL . However , the level of protection of fundamental rights guaranteed by LAW satisfied the requirements which had to be met under LAW in case of a transfer of sovereign powers . The applicant had failed to substantiate sufficiently that the level of human rights protection under LAW in respect of admissions as a representative was generally and manifestly below the level required by LAW . The same applied if a duty of protection on the part of the ORG was assumed as the applicant would also have been obliged to demonstrate that there was a structural lack of legal protection which ORG should have addressed . ORG therefore did not exercise its jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision of DATE ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u2013 the impugned decision in the case of PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL ) concerned ORG decision not to recruit the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against ORG decision . It found that the complaint , in which the applicant had argued , in particular , that his constitutional right of access to court had been breached , was inadmissible . A constitutional complaint only lay against acts of a \u201c public authority \u201d and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that such an act was at issue in his case .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court confirmed that ORG had immunity from the jurisdiction of the domestic courts within the scope of its official activities under LAW . It further reiterated that acts of a \u201c public authority \u201d were not only acts of NORP ORG authorities . The term also covered acts of supranational authorities , such as ORG and its executive organ , ORG , which had an impact on the beneficiaries of fundamental rights in GPE .", "CARDINAL . However , the decision of the President of ORG here at issue could not be qualified as an act which had an impact on the beneficiaries of fundamental rights in GPE because it did not have any external legal effects within the NORP legal order . Measures relating to the relationship between the international organisation and its staff or candidates for posts , as a rule , only concerned the internal sphere of the organisation . This conclusion was not altered by the fact that the applicant was a NORP national living in GPE who , had he been employed , would have worked in GPE . The court conceded that the applicant \u2019s recruitment would have been an act of a supranational nature which , changing his legal status , would have had a concrete effect within the NORP legal order . The refusal to employ him did not , however , have such an effect . ORG jurisdiction did not extend to such internal measures .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further found that in view of the inadmissibility of the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , it did not have to decide the question whether the level of protection in respect of staff issues within ORG complied with the standards set by LAW , which had to be observed in the event of a transfer of sovereign powers .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision of DATE ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerned the temporary denial of access of the complainants , staff members of ORG , to the internal e - mail system of that organisation .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the complaint as inadmissible as it had not been shown that it concerned an act of a \u201c public authority \u201d . It stressed that such acts included acts of supranational organisations to which GPE had transferred sovereign powers and which had direct legal effects within the NORP legal order , that is , which altered the legal position of individuals within it . However , the impugned measure did not alter the ORG position in the NORP legal order . It further spoke against the existence of an act of a \u201c public authority \u201d that ORG enjoyed immunity from jurisdiction in respect of employment - law disputes .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , as ORG had previously found ( it referred to its decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , there could be a duty of protection incumbent on the State ( PERSON ) where the internal sphere of an international organisation was affected . In that sphere , legal protection could only be granted if the NORP legislature and ORG used means that were suitable for ensuring that any conditions within the intergovernmental organisation which were contrary to fundamental rights were removed . The failure of the NORP ORG authorities to take action in connection with the final decision on the impugned act would then constitute an act of a \u201c public authority \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The complainants had , however , failed to make any submissions in this respect . Just as in the sphere of an organisation \u2019s supranational powers , it was necessary for complainants to claim in a substantiated manner that there was a structural deficiency in legal protection within the organisation . ORG further noted that it had previously confirmed that the system of fundamental rights protection within LAW and in the proceedings before ORG generally complied with the standards of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
