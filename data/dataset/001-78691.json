GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", ", may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , the applicant lived with her NORP husband , a pilot in the NORP army , in GPE , hereafter GPE ) . After a period of tension in their marriage , the husband returned to GPE in DATE . While the applicant stayed in GPE , she had an affair with PERSON , a GPE citizen with whom she temporarily shared a flat . The affair ended in DATE . In DATE , the applicant gave birth to her daughter PERSON , PERSON was registered in ORG \u2019s birth certificate as her legitimate father . The applicant later disputed PERSON \u2019s parenthood , alleging that she was coerced to agree to that registration . This allegation led PERSON to subject himself to a DNA - test . The test confirmed his fatherhood , but was held in secret . According to the applicant , it is however possible that it was not PERSON \u2019s DNA material which had been submitted to the test .", "In DATE , the applicant returned to GPE with ORG because the applicant \u2019s father was seriously ill . They now live together with her husband with whom the applicant reconciled . In the applicant \u2019s submission , her husband could possibly be the father of ORG instead of PERSON The NORP authorities issued a NORP birth certificate for ORG in which the applicant \u2019s husband was registered as the legitimate father .", "Before the applicant left with ORG for GPE in DATE , PERSON had instituted civil proceedings before ORG in order to obtain a declaratory decision that he was PERSON \u2019s father and in order to obtain the right to custody and access to LOC applicant participated in FAC hearing on DATE by means of a telephone conference . However , the applicant did not attend a court - ordered DNA - test in GPE in DATE . She announced that neither she nor her husband would participate in such a test . On DATE , the San Juan District Court issued an interim order , confirming PERSON \u2019s parenthood on account of the GPE birth register and a written acknowledgement signed by the applicant that PERSON was PERSON \u2019s father . Until further orders were made , ORG also provisionally granted PERSON the right to custody ( prim\u00e4res PERSON ) for ORG and excluded the applicant \u2019s visiting rights .", "In DATE , PERSON also instituted proceedings for interim measures in GPE in order to achieve ORG return to GPE . ORG ( PERSON ) asked PERSON for a certificate of wrongness ( PERSON ) pursuant to LAW hereafter : LAW ) , which was issued by ORG on DATE . In that certificate , ORG stated that : \u201c ( ... ) Petitioner , [ PERSON ] , had rights of custody under the law of GPE , including rights to make all decisions concerning the PERSON \u2019s care , custody and control jointly and equally with the respondent . ( ... ) Petitioner was exercising such rights at the time Respondent removed PERSON to GPE . Accordingly , it is the determination of this ORG that respondent violated petitioner \u2019s custody rights by taking the LAW , by keeping her there and by refusing to allow petitioner to see her , and that Respondent \u2019s removal of the LAW was \u2018 wrongful\u2019 LAW . ( ... ) \u201d", "On DATE , ORG refused PERSON \u2019s motion and stated that it could not follow LOC opinion as expressed in the above certificate . It found that , in accordance with LAW in conjunction with LAW , the immediate return of a child only had to be ordered when the right to custody of a parent had been violated through the removal of the child . ORG did not find it decisive whether or not FAC decision of DATE , granting PERSON the provisional right to custody , applied retroactively to DATE of N. \u2019s birth . Nor found the court it decisive whether or not LOC declaratory decision of DATE ( stating that PERSON was the biological father ) applied retroactively to the day of N. \u2019s birth . Even assuming that PERSON had the right to custody on DATE , he nevertheless had not exercised it . ORG came to this conclusion because PERSON had neither lived any longer with the applicant in a shared flat , nor had he been her partner upon ORG \u2019s birth . Moreover , he had seen ORG only on rare occasions , he had not paid alimony and he had constantly been away because of his profession as a pilot . ORG considered a testimony of a third person which PERSON had submitted , according to which he had seen ORG only twice in DATE . Moreover , ORG stated that it had been the applicant who had cared for N. The applicant had also paid alimony and otherwise depended on welfare benefits .", "On DATE , on appeal by PERSON , ORG ordered the applicant to return PERSON to GPE , or , should she fail to do so , to hand her over in order to ensure her immediate return . ORG also ruled that the execution of the order should not take place until PERSON had deposited an irrevocable order to pay MONEY of alimony on a DATE basis to the applicant for DATE . The alimony for DATE should be deposited and handed out to the applicant upon her arrival in GPE . Moreover , ORG ordered PERSON to rent an apartment in GPE for the applicant and PERSON for DATE . In the event that the applicant should refuse to comply with the order to return ORG , ORG authorised the court \u2019s bailiff to return the child to GPE . The bailiff was authorised to use force if necessary in order to overcome any resistance by the applicant , to search her apartment and to ensure the child \u2019s removal .", "ORG considered that the applicant , when returning to GPE , had violated PERSON \u2019s co - existing right to custody . In accordance with ORG , ORG had to be returned to the place where she was before she had unlawfully been removed . ORG had no doubt whatsoever that PERSON was the legitimate father of PERSON , because otherwise the applicant and her husband would have attended the DNA - test in GPE in order to rebut PERSON \u2019s submissions in the proceedings before FAC . In order to determine whether or not the applicant had wrongfully removed PERSON in DATE , ORG found that the legal situation in GPE had been decisive , irrespective of the fact that under NORP law the applicant would have had sole custody . As GPE had issued the certificate of wrongness on LAW CARDINAL DATE , the removal had to be regarded as having violated PERSON \u2019s right to custody . Contrary to ORG ruling , the actual lack of exercising the right to custody was not an obstacle as ORG considered that there was a legal presumption under LAW that the right of custody was exercised . The applicant had failed to rebut that presumption . ORG stated that it was sufficient for the purposes of LAW that PERSON occasionally had had access to LOC in the past in order to exercise his right to custody . The court found that PERSON did have access even though the particular extent of the access was disputed between the parties . ORG decided not to apply LAW ( b ) of LAW , according to which the courts may refrain from the order of removal if there exists a serious danger that the child will suffer from physical and psychological damages . It found that the provision had to be narrowly interpreted , given that ORG \u2019s removal had been unlawful . The danger that ORG suffered physical and psychological damages could in any case be averted if the applicant returned to GPE together with ORG Therefore , ORG had ordered that PERSON had to pay alimony for DATE and the rent for an apartment for the applicant and ORG for DATE while the custody proceedings were pending . As far as the applicant feared that she would be arrested for child abduction upon her arrival in GPE , such fears were as such not sufficient for LAW ( b ) of LAW to apply , unless ORG would be left on her own while the applicant was in prison . Although ORG had initially pointed to that danger in view of PERSON \u2019s attempt to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant , such danger no longer existed . ORG pointed out that several GPE governmental bodies had given assurances that the applicant would not be subjected to criminal proceedings . Moreover , ORG noted that PERSON had meanwhile withdrawn his motion to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant . Lastly , ORG did not see any indications that FAC , when deciding upon the right to custody in the main proceedings , would fail to take into account ORG \u2019s interests .", "On DATE , ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , together with ORG \u2019s constitutional complaint which had been lodged by the curator ad litem . On DATE , ORG dismissed a motion by the applicant \u2019s husband and ordered that ORG should be returned to GPE not DATE .", "\u201c The objects of the present Convention are :", "( a ) to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any ORG ; and", "( b ) to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of CARDINAL ORG are effectively respected in GPE . \u201d", "\u201c Contracting States shall take all appropriate measures to secure within their territories the implementation of the objects of the Convention .
