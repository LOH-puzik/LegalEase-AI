NORP The mussel shells found in the pieces of concrete in the rubble showed that the sea sand and gravel had been used without sifting or sorting , which had been a major factor in diminishing the concrete \u2019s resistance .", "CARDINAL . It was noted that the reinforcing rods inside the concrete had rusted , suggesting that sea sand and gravel had been used unwashed and that the sea salt had corroded the metal .", "CARDINAL .

The stress testing carried out on the samples showed that their stress resistance was CARDINAL what it should have been .", "In conclusion : ... The building was constructed without any kind of technical control ; another storey in addition to the number of storeys mentioned in the blueprint was added at the owner \u2019s request in order to increase the number of housing and commercial units . Furthermore , the fact that the municipality failed to stop the building work raises issues . It is therefore necessary to ascertain whether a permit was issued for the building \u2019s shallow foundations , which were , in fact , incompatible with the blueprint as from the first storey . If such a permit was issued , it is necessary to identify the persons working for the municipality who approved that permit and whether or not an occupancy permit was granted by the \u00c7\u0131narc\u0131k municipality . If so , it is necessary to establish the identities of the signatories of that occupancy permit . It is possible that other blocks have been built without inspection by the \u00c7\u0131narc\u0131k municipality . The photographs taken show buildings with CARDINAL storeys above ground level and others with CARDINAL storeys .
