POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1 with regard to temporal limitation on jurisdiction;No violation of Art. 6-1 with regard to scope of jurisdiction", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON , acting on behalf of his brother PERSON , lodged an application under LAW of DATE on real property in GPE for temporary ownership of CARDINAL plots of land located in GPE Przedmie\u015bcie Street , GPE , to be awarded to PERSON , the former owner . This application remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared that the estate of PERSON had been inherited , pursuant to the relevant provisions of LAW Civil Code , by his wife PERSON for DATE , and by each of his children , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and ORG , for CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant lodged a request with the Governor of GPE for restitution of the CARDINAL plots , indicating that they were listed in ORG under nos . CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the Director of ORG discontinued the administrative proceedings relating to the applicants\u2019 request of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision to discontinue the proceedings . It stated that it had been established during the proceedings that the plots concerned were situated in GPE . By virtue of the Decree on real property in GPE of DATE , all real property situated in GPE had been expropriated . However , under LAW that decree , former owners had a right to lodge an application for temporary ownership of their plots . The authorities competent to deal with these applications could award temporary ownership if it was established that the plots concerned had not been designated for public use and that the award would not be incompatible with such use . In the ORG case , such an application had been lodged in DATE , but it had remained unanswered . The first - instance administrative authority , when dealing with the applicants\u2019 request of DATE , had overlooked that fact . When reconsidering the case , that authority was required , in particular , to examine whether granting the applicants the right to perpetual use of the plot under ORG of DATE , the provisions of which had replaced the procedural rights afforded to former real - property owners by LAW , would conflict with the public use of the plots concerned , as determined in relevant local land - development plans .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of ORG refused to return the plots to the applicants and to grant them the right to their perpetual use . He stated that it had been established during the proceedings that in DATE the applicants\u2019 predecessor in title had submitted an application for temporary ownership of the plots , which had then been listed in ORG under entries nos . CARDINAL and DATE . This application had remained unanswered , but the administrative authority had duly examined it in the course of the current proceedings . It was established that the palace built on the plots had been destroyed at PERCENT during the Second World War , as was pointed out in a letter of the Regional Conservator of Historical Monuments of DATE . The palace had subsequently been rebuilt by ORG . Thus it had been ORG which had borne the costs of rebuilding the palace . Accordingly , restitution of the property concerned would have been unjustified , and the administrative authority found no grounds on which the DATE application and the request lodged by the applicants in DATE should be granted .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal against that decision . They argued that the decision was not in conformity with the applicable laws , in particular as the first - instance authority had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the palace had indeed been destroyed during the Second World War . They also complained that no sound arguments had been advanced in the decision to show that restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with its public use .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG appeal , finding that it had been lodged DATE after the expiration of the DATE time - limit provided for in LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants filed an appeal with ORG . They argued that the appeal had been posted on DATE , that is on DATE of the time - limit , as was shown by a post - office receipt . The fact that the postmark on the envelope was dated DATE was due exclusively to the incomprehensible negligence of the postal services and could not be held against the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision appealed against , considering that it was not established that the applicants had lodged their appeal against the decision of DATE outside the time - limit provided for by LAW , in particular because the applicants had submitted the post - office receipt to the court , showing clearly that their appeal had been posted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , having examined the applicants\u2019 appeal of DATE , upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE . It pointed out that the administrative authority had established that the property of the applicants\u2019 predecessor - in - title had been designated by relevant land - development plans adopted in DATE , DATE and DATE for use by ORG . That designation had not been changed by any subsequent decision , as was certified by a letter of DATE from the Director of ORG of ORG . The Governor further held that the palace built on the plots had been destroyed at PERCENT during the Second World War , as was certified by a letter of the Regional Conservator of Historical Monuments of DATE . The palace had been rebuilt in DATE by ORG . As it had been ORG that had borne the rebuilding costs , it had acquired ownership of the property concerned . Moreover , at the time when PERSON had lodged the application for temporary ownership , the buildings on the plot had not existed , as they had been destroyed . The administrative authority concluded that , in the light of the above considerations , granting the applicants the right to perpetual use would be unjustified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal with ORG against that judgment , complaining that the impugned decision was not in conformity with applicable substantive law . They first submitted that the decision was in breach of LAW in that the administrative authorities had failed to establish with sufficient clarity that the ORG intentions as to the future use of the palace had not been compatible with the local land - development plan . The applicants emphasised that the authorities had disregarded their argument that they did not plan to alter the public nature of the palace . They had only wanted to reserve a small part of it for their exclusive use , whereas the remainder would be used for cultural and leisure purposes and would be accessible to the general public . Therefore , no issue arose , in fact , regarding the designation of the property for public use as its use was to remain unchanged . Moreover , the authorities had failed to indicate why the restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with its continued public use .", "CARDINAL . The applicants further stressed that the authorities had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the buildings on the plots had been destroyed during the Second World War and subsequently rebuilt by the ORG , and that they should therefore be considered the ORG \u2019s property . The findings made in this respect were superficial and based on insufficient evidence . The applicants emphasised in particular that the letter from ORG of Historical Monuments of DATE could not reasonably be regarded as credible , as the conservator operated under the supervision of ORG and thus could not be expected to act against the ministry \u2019s interests . In view of that flaw , the authorities should have requested a report by an expert on construction technology in order to verify the information in the conservator \u2019s letter . In conclusion , the applicants requested that the decision under appeal should be set aside and that the case should be re - examined .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , QUANTITY , QUANTITY , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY of LAW had been breached in the course of the proceedings and that those procedural shortcomings had had a bearing on the outcome of the case .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date a hearing was held before ORG in the appeal proceedings . The applicants\u2019 lawyer submitted that their application of DATE was to be seen both as a reiterated application for temporary ownership , lodged in DATE , and as a new application for restitution of the property concerned and for having a right to perpetual use of the land awarded .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the ORG appeal in so far as it concerned the application for temporary ownership , which had been submitted by PERSON in DATE . In doing so , the court recalled that , pursuant to LAW of DATE , as amended , it was not competent to deal with appeals against administrative decisions given in cases in which proceedings had been instituted before DATE . Accordingly , the court could not review the lawfulness of that part of the contested second - instance administrative decision , given that the relevant proceedings had been instituted in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the decision under appeal concerned the applicants\u2019 application of DATE for restitution of their former property and for the right to perpetual use of the land under the provisions of ORG of DATE , ORG first considered that the authorities had failed to show why restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with public use of the plot and the palace , and had therefore breached LAW of LAW , under which an administrative authority , when issuing a decision , was required to point out the facts on which it had relied , to refer to evidence which had served as a basis for its factual findings , and to indicate the grounds on which other evidence had not been considered credible .", "The court further considered that despite those procedural shortcomings the decision under appeal had , in any event , been lawful . The court noted that the crux of that part of the case was to assess whether the applicants could , under ORG of DATE , claim to have a right to perpetual use of the plots concerned conferred on them by way of compensation for the expropriation carried out under DATE decree .", "The court observed that under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG , a right to perpetual use of land could only be conferred in cases where real property was given back to its former owners . However , that entitlement had been limited to certain categories of real property , namely CARDINAL - family houses or small apartment blocks . The property concerned in the present case did not belong to any of those categories . Moreover , the DATE Act had laid down a time - limit for the submission of such claims , and that limit had expired on DATE . The applicants\u2019 application of CARDINAL DATE to have their former property restored to them and for the right to perpetual use of the property had been lodged outside that time - limit . Accordingly , the restitution could not have been ordered . ORG therefore dismissed the remainder of the ORG appeal .", "CARDINAL . The Decree of DATE on real property in GPE expropriated real property situated in GPE and transferred ownership to the municipality of GPE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section ORG ) of ORG of DATE , ownership of property situated in GPE was assigned to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG of DATE re - established local self - government . Pursuant to section QUANTITY ) , ownership of land which had previously been held by ORG and which had been within the administrative territory of municipalities at the relevant time was transferred to the municipality .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW decree , former owners had the right to lodge an application for temporary ownership of their plots ( w\u0142asno\u015b\u0107 czasowa ) . The authorities competent to deal with such applications first had to examine whether the plots concerned had not been designated for public use . If they considered that granting temporary ownership to former owners would not be incompatible with public use , a decision could be made in favour of the former owner .", "CARDINAL . ORG was enacted in DATE . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that Act , former owners of real property were entitled to apply for restitution of property which had been expropriated and to claim the right to perpetual use of the property . However , that entitlement was limited to certain categories of real property , namely CARDINAL - family houses or small apartment blocks . Moreover , this Act laid down a time - limit for such claims . That limit expired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The right to perpetual use of land owned by municipalities is regulated in Book CARDINAL of LAW ( Property and other rights in rem , LAW Right to perpetual use ) . It follows from the relevant provisions that this right consists in an entitlement to exclusive use , by a natural or legal person , of land owned by a municipality or by the ORG for DATE against DATE payment of certain rates . A person having such a title can construct buildings on the land , of which he will be the owner . An administrative decision by a municipality to confer the right to perpetual use on a given individual is necessary and sufficient for a final contract to this effect to be concluded between the parties . The contract between the municipality and the perpetual user must be in the form of a notarial deed . A right to perpetual use can be sold or bequeathed .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law no special provisions have been enacted whereby redress may be obtained for wrongs relating to expropriations carried out within the framework of the agrarian reforms . There is therefore no specific legal framework to mitigate the effects of certain infringements resulting from the deprivations of property . However , persons whose property was expropriated , or their legal successors , may institute administrative proceedings under LAW , in order to claim that the expropriation decisions should be declared null and void as having been in breach of the laws laying down criteria for expropriation , as applicable at the material time . If it is established that the contested decision was contrary to the legislation applicable at the time of the expropriation , the administrative authority shall declare it null and void . Administrative decisions may ultimately be appealed against in ORG .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , in administrative proceedings the competent authorities take all measures necessary to make detailed findings of fact , having due regard to the public interest and to justified individual interests . According to LAW , they are obliged to conduct proceedings in such a manner as to strengthen the confidence which citizens are entitled to have in the ORG authorities .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code requires the administrative authorities to ensure that the respective parties to the proceedings have an opportunity to participate actively therein , to adopt , before a decision is given , a position concerning the evidence gathered in the case and other material in the case file , and to submit comments on their own claims .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , any lawful material which could serve as a basis for factual findings is admissible as evidence in administrative proceedings . In particular , documents , witnesses\u2019 testimonies , expert reports and inspections may be so admitted . Under LAW , a request to take evidence should be allowed , if the circumstances which are to be established are relevant to the decision to be given .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , as applicable at the material time , provided that an appeal on points of law against an administrative decision could be lodged with ORG . LAW stated that the court should set the decision aside wholly or in part if it established that the decision was in breach of substantive law or that the proceedings leading to the decision had contained a flaw which made the decision null and void , or that procedural shortcomings in the proceedings were such as to justify the re - opening of the latter ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
