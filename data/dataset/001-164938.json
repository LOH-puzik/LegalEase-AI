The findings of the CDDH do not alter the conclusion that the \u2018 attestation de perte des pi\u00e8ces d\u2019identit\u00e9\u2019 is a forgery . The court reaches this conclusion after having studying the documents underlying the person - specific official report , in particular the additional statement of DATE [ containing a detailed explanation as to why it was clear that this document was a forgery ] . It appears therefrom that the document concerned \u2013 irrespective of the correctness of the street name indicated \u2013 contains deletions as a result of which it can no longer be regarded as authentic .

CARDINAL of the key problems was the fact that official country reports do not provide an overview of the available facts but rather a conclusion concerning certain facts .
