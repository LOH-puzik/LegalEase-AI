Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON on the Structure of Courts of Law ( Prawo o ustroju s\u0105d\u00f3w powszechnych ) provides that the Minister of ORG may second a judge to carry out his or her duties in another court .

ORG has examined in a number of judgments the procedural arrangements for the secondment of a judge to sit on the bench of another court .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of DATE ( I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) it examined a situation where CARDINAL judges of a district court were promoted to a regional court during proceedings pending before the district court . They continued to participate in the proceedings until the first - instance judgment was given . It held that it had been in breach of section CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Structure of Courts of Law and the prohibition that only one judge seconded from another court could sit on a bench ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . A district - court bench comprising CARDINAL judges promoted to a higher court during the proceedings , if formal and individual decisions on their secondment had been given , was not properly composed within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL item CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The court observed that the procedural shortcomings listed in LAW breached the fundamental principles of a fair hearing , setting minimal procedural standards for the rule of law in a democratic ORG . If such shortcomings occurred , they always resulted in the judgment on the merits of the case being quashed , regardless of whether they had any influence on the substantive outcome of the proceedings and even where they had not been raised by the appellant . Certain legal writers were of the view that the legislator had put in operation a presumption that such shortcomings always had an impact on the merits of a case .", "The court observed that CARDINAL of the fundamental principles of the administration of justice was that a judge was to carry out his or her function in a given court determined in the nomination act issued by the President . However , the laws governing judicial organisation allowed for judges to be assigned to another court with a view to carrying out their judicial duties for limited periods of time and with their consent . For a judge to be able to sit on a bench of another court , at either a higher , lower or the same level of jurisdiction , a formal decision on secondment was necessary . Such a decision was not of a merely organisational character ; it conferred a judicial role on a judge sitting on that bench .", "CARDINAL . In a resolution of DATE ( I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG held that a judge could be seconded to sit on a bench of another court either for a period of DATE in DATE , or for DATE , for example , the dates of hearings . It noted that there were discrepancies in the practice . Certain presidents of the courts were of the view that only the first approach was correct , while others maintained that it was also acceptable to second judges for successive hearings in a case examined by another court , held on DATE if their number did not exceed DATE . The court held that it was improper to second a judge without concrete dates indicated in the secondment decision , or merely for the examination of a specified case , if such a secondment did not refer to concrete dates .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( V KK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG examined a situation where a judge had obtained secondment for a specified period to sit on a bench of another court and had continued to do so after that period had ended , in the absence of a new decision on his secondment . It held that only a decision to second a judge to another court made it possible for him or her to sit on a bench of another court . In the absence of such a decision the composition of the court had been incorrect , within the meaning of LAW . This procedural shortcoming amounted to a flagrant breach of the minimum standards of a fair hearing ( \u201c ra\u017c\u0105ca obraza minimalnego standardu prawid\u0142owego post\u0119powania \u201d ) . The court referred to the resolution of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( II KK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG held that the assignment of a judge to another bench did not comply with the applicable legal requirements if the local board of the assembly of judges had given only a blanket agreement for all judges of that court to be seconded to other courts . That agreement had to be given on each and every occasion in respect of an individual judge .", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory decision of DATE ( III KO CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG held that a decision on a judge \u2019s secondment had not been issued correctly if it lacked an indication of the concrete dates of hearings or other measures in which a seconded judge was to participate . It further noted that such a shortcoming did not render the proceedings void within the meaning of LAW . The court reiterated that a judge could not be assigned to a bench of another court for DATE during DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( \u201c the Code \u201d ) , which entered into force on DATE , a party to criminal proceedings can lodge an appeal with ORG against any final decision of an appellate court which had terminated criminal proceedings . The relevant part of LAW provides :", "\u201c A cassation appeal may be lodged only on the grounds referred to in LAW [ these include a number of fundamental procedural irregularities , such as incorrect composition of the trial court ; lack of legal assistance in cases where such assistance was compulsory ; breach of the rules governing jurisdiction in criminal matters ; trying a person in absentia in cases where his presence was obligatory and thus depriving him of an opportunity to defend himself , etc . ] or on the ground of another flagrant breach of law provided that the judicial decision in question was affected as a result of that breach .
