As regards the applicant \u2019s compensation claim concerning the destruction of her property , the court noted that under LAW of GPE the ORG was liable only for damages caused by its agents\u2019 actions which were unlawful .

GPE of DATE and Governmental Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , both of which had been found to be constitutional by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court further stated that the applicant had submitted no evidence proving a causal link between the GPE actions and the damage sustained by her , since the military actions had been carried out by both parties to the conflict . Therefore the destruction of the applicant \u2019s possessions could not be imputed to the defendants .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that under LAW of GPE damage inflicted by a \u201c source of increased danger \u201d ( \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 ) was to be compensated for by the person or entity using that source , unless it was proven that the damage had been caused by force majeure or through the fault of the affected person . However , in the court \u2019s view , the applicant \u2019s reference to the above Article was unfounded , as weapons and military equipment , in the circumstances of the present case , could not be regarded as a \u201c source of increased danger \u201d , since they had been used strictly for the purposes they were designed for and under the firm control of the relevant personnel . Moreover , the applicant had not adduced any evidence which would enable the court to establish the type and ownership of the weapon which had destroyed the applicant \u2019s housing .", "CARDINAL . The court also noted that the applicant had submitted no documents confirming the value of her lost property . It noted in this respect that witness statements obtained during the hearing only enabled it to establish the existence of the possessions in the applicant \u2019s flat prior to the destruction and the fact that those possessions had been new . The court made no findings regarding the applicant \u2019s property rights in respect of the destroyed flat .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s claims for compensation for non - pecuniary damage could not be granted either , in the absence of any fault or unlawful actions on the part of the defendants . In view of the above , the court concluded that there were no grounds for granting the first applicant \u2019s compensation claim for the destroyed property .", "CARDINAL . It does not appear that the applicant ever sought the first - instance court \u2019s assistance in obtaining evidence relating to the weapon that had destroyed her housing . In her appeal against the judgment of DATE the applicant did not complain of her inability to obtain the evidence in question .", "CARDINAL .
