NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Access to court);Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Erik M\u00f8se;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant submitted a patent application for a particular method of propulsion of aircrafts and sea vessels to ORG ( Patentstyrets f\u00f8rste avdeling DATE hereinafter referred to as \u201c NIPO \u201d ) . Ranging under ORG , ORG is a government authority , responsible for processing and deciding on applications for patent protection in GPE . The application was allotted no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG presented a preliminary opinion stating that the application in its present form was not patentable because it did not reveal a concrete solution to achieve the desired effect . It also questioned whether the invention had any effect at all . Therefore , under former LAW ( currently section CARDINAL ) of the Regulation ( forskrift ) to LAW ( patentloven ) , NIPO required the first applicant to perform a test ( \u201c praktiske fors\u00f8k \u201d ) at an independent research institute and to submit the necessary test documentation . The first applicant replied on DATE that he disputed the need for a test and referred to the high costs for such tests . However , he informed NIPO that prototypes were under construction and could be tested in the presence of representatives from NIPO .", "CARDINAL . In the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , there was correspondence between the first applicant and NIPO as to the existence of any need to protect the confidentiality of the application . In DATE ORG asked ORG whether the application should be kept secret on national security grounds , which the latter answered in the negative in DATE . The first applicant was informed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant provided NIPO with further information on the subject - matter of the application . On DATE , ORG reiterated its request of CARDINAL DATE that the first applicant provide evidence from tests showing the technical effect and concrete features of the invention . In his reply of CARDINAL DATE the first applicant submitted theoretical views on the subject - matter of the application with reference to a research report of DATE which , according to him , described tests and results that proved the technical effect of his invention . The required tests were therefore superfluous , in his view .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant on DATE complained about the delays in the processing of his application . The ORG \u2019s Director General on DATE apologised for the delay and said the matter would be given priority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE NIPO maintained its earlier requirement of independent tests , to which a series of exchanges ensued between the applicant and NIPO on the need for tests , including a protest by the applicant questioning NIPO \u2019s technical competence and the submission by him of statements by CARDINAL academics , dated DATE and DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . Whilst apologising for the delay , ORG maintained its position on the need for testing in a communication to the first applicant of CARDINAL DATE and gave him until DATE to comply .", "CARDINAL . By a registered letter of CARDINAL DATE , received on DATE , the first applicant again characterised NIPO \u2019s processing as late and technically incompetent without making any new arguments concerning the requirements for granting a patent .", "CARDINAL . On the ground of the first applicant \u2019s failure to comply with the time - limit of CARDINAL DATE , ORG decided to discontinue ( henlegge ) its examination of his application under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( according to which , in the event of an omission by a patent seeker to provide a statement or to take measures to rectify a notified deficiency , the application shall be shelved ) . Upon reconsideration of the matter , NIPO informed the first applicant on DATE that , although the application had been received on time , it maintained its decision to shelve the application because he had not met the substantive requirements indicated to him on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant then lodged a petition with ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following an inquiry by ORG , NIPO informed the first applicant on DATE that it had annulled its decision to discontinue the matter and gave him until DATE to respond to its letter of CARDINAL DATE . He replied on DATE but without presenting any new arguments or material .", "CARDINAL . On DATE NIPO refused the application on the ground that the applicant had not made it probable that the subject - matter of the application had the alleged technical effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Parliamentary Ombudsman informed ORG that he found no grounds for continuing the investigation of the petition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant appealed to ORG ( Patentstyrets annen avdeling ) against ORG \u2019s decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following a period of circulation of the case files among the members of ORG , the first meeting on the case was held on DATE . ORG took a different view than NIPO and indicated a new formulation of the patent claims which might lead to a patent , but only for sea vessels . The applicant was informed correspondingly in a letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , there was correspondence between ORG and the first applicant in order to arrange a meeting , which was held on DATE . The subject - matter of the appeal was discussed together with the further process .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , NIPO was informed that PERCENT of the ownership to the application had been transferred to the second applicant PERSON AS . Thereafter , mostly both applicants , occasionally only the first applicant , acted as claimants in the relevant proceedings ( to simplify \u201c applicants \u201d is used in the following ) .", "CARDINAL . In the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , ORG and the applicants exchanged various communications regarding the patentability of the original patent claims .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG concluded that the invention in application no . DATE had a technical effect , but the ORG did not consider whether other patent requirements had been fulfilled . The applicants had received information on how to change the claims into a patentable invention but had been unwilling to do so . Consequently , ORG did not find any grounds to continue processing of the application . Accordingly , ORG \u2019s decision was set aside and the application was referred back to NIPO for further consideration .", "CARDINAL . Following the return of the application to NIPO , it concluded in its letter of CARDINAL DATE that the subject - matter of DATE could not be considered novel .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , represented by Mr. PERSON , filed a new complaint to ORG on DATE concerning the proceedings before ORG . In particular they claimed that the executive officer of ORG had been prejudiced as he was responsible for considerable parts of the previous processing and the refusal of the application prior to the appeal to ORG . ORG replied on DATE and DATE that he could not decide on complaints until the processing of the application had been completed , but assumed that the case would now be examined with due diligence ( \u201c tilb\u00f8rlig hurtighet \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Exchanges of correspondence between ORG and the applicants continued DATE and DATE . NIPO provided guidance and suggested that specific changes be made to the patent claims in order to render the subject - matter of the application patentable . The applicants disagreed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the application was formally refused due to lack of novelty ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG . On DATE , they were informed that ORG , after having examined the case ( on DATE ) had found it clear that the conditions for granting a patent had not been fulfilled in so far as concerned aircrafts . However , the application might succeed in respect of a more limited field of sea vessels . It was proposed that the patent requirements be formulated in a similar manner as proposed in ORG letter of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The communication of CARDINAL DATE further warned the applicants that if the patent requirements were not defined in accordance with the indications given , the ORG \u2019s rejection might be confirmed . In the alternative , the part of the application that related to air transport might be disjoined from that which related to sea transport , in which case it might be expected that the former part would be rejected . As an alternative to delimiting against the requirements to aircrafts , dividing the application into CARDINAL parts , CARDINAL concerning aircrafts , another concerning sea vessels , could be considered , in accordance with LAW . In that case , a rejection of the separate part relating to air crafts ought to be expected .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were given until DATE to comment and were warned that the case might be determined on the basis of the case - file as it stood as at that date .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to ORG of DATE , the applicants submitted their observations to the communication of CARDINAL DATE and altered the definition of patent requirements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed NIPO \u2019s refusal of the patent requested ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , albeit on a different reasoning . Whilst NIPO had been sceptical about whether the patent requested could serve according to its purpose , ORG had no doubt that the results could be achieved with the invention that could be exploited industrially and that the application could not be rejected on this ground . Both ORG and ORG found that the application did not involve any novelty in respect of aviation , though the reasoning differed . Unlike ORG , ORG found that the application could have succeeded in a limited area of sea transport . The applicants had been advised that in order to succeed , the patent requirements would have to be defined so as to exclude aviation but had not been willing to do so . The application as presented did therefore not fulfil the conditions for grant of patent .", "CARDINAL . The applicants have apparently not challenged the ORG decision of DATE before the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , the patent applications they had filed in DATE , made in light of the patent application of CARDINAL DATE ( no . DATE ) , had been granted in GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE and \u201c through the EPO [ ORG ] as well \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that according to PERSON ( a database provided by EPO ) , the applicants had not claimed priority with respect to no . DATE in any of the above mentioned countries or in EPO . The granted EPO patent had claimed priority in relation to another and separate application by the applicants , namely no . CARDINAL , which had been based on knowledge from no . DATE . When comparing the EPO patent claims with no . DATE , one would observe that the former had been based on additional features that had made the invention patentable .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( patentloven ) , provides :", "\u201c Within any technical field , any person who has made an invention which is susceptible of industrial application , or his successor in title , shall , in accordance with this LAW , have the right on application to be granted a patent for the invention and thereby obtain the exclusive right to exploit the invention commercially or operationally . \u201d", "The expression \u201c industrial application \u201d requires that the innovation has \u201c technical effect \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL , patents shall be granted only for inventions which are new in relation to what was known before the filing date of the patent application , and which also differ essentially therefrom .", "CARDINAL . LAW provides :", "\u201c If the applicant has not complied with the prescribed requirements with respect to the application , or if NIPO finds other obstacles to the acceptance of the application , the applicant shall be notified to that effect and be invited to submit observations or to correct the application within a specified time limit . However , ORG may make such amendments in the abstract as found necessary without consulting the applicant .", "If the applicant fails , within the time limit , to submit observations or to take steps to correct a defect which has been pointed out , the application shall be shelved . Information to that effect shall be given in the notification from NIPO referred to in the first paragraph . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) of LAW reads :", "\u201c An appeal must be received by ORG within DATE from the date on which notification of the decision was sent to the party concerned . ... If these provisions are not complied with , the appeal shall not be submitted for consideration .", "Even if the opponent withdraws his appeal , it may be examined if special circumstances make it desirable .", "A decision by ORG refusing a patent application , revoking a patent , or maintaining a decision by NIPO to revoke a patent may not be brought before the courts of law DATE from the date on which the applicant or patent holder was notified of the decision . Information with respect to the time limit for instituting proceedings shall be given in the notification . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of LAW , a granted patent may be maintained for DATE from the date of filing of the patent application . It is undisputed in this case that , had a patent been granted in GPE , this would have meant that the patent protection would have expired on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
