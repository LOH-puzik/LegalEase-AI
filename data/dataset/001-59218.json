POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . H.K. , the applicant \u2019s brother , had been a member of the NORP resistance troops of the underground ORG ( ORG ) , commonly referred to as the \u201c NSZ \u201d . The ORG had been founded in DATE and , originally , formed partisan forces fighting the NORP during the Second World War . At DATE the ORG \u2019s command , considering that the defeat of the NORP was inevitable , decided that the main enemy was the communist GPE and ordered that , from that time on , the ORG should direct its attacks against ORG and the NORP communist partisan forces . After the liberation of GPE , some of the ORG members took refuge in the LOC , while others , after being ordered not to attack ORG directly , established an underground resistance movement against the communist government . On DATE PERSON was convicted by ORG ( PERSON ) in connection with , inter alia , his membership of the ORG , which was considered an \u201c illegal organisation established with the aim of subverting the political and legal system of the ORG \u201d . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and then served his sentence . He was released on an unspecified date . On DATE he was shot dead by a militia officer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application under section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON of DATE on annulment of convictions whereby persons were persecuted for their activities aimed at achieving independence for GPE ( Ustawa o uznaniu za niewa\u017cne orzecze\u0144 wydanych wobec os\u00f3b represjonowanych za dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 na rzecz niepodleg\u0142ego bytu PERSON ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) with ORG ( S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki ) , seeking to have his late brother \u2019s conviction of DATE declared null and void . Shortly afterwards , the court decided that the applicant \u2019s request would be examined together with a similar application , which had been lodged by the widow of a co - defendant of his brother on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked the court to set a date for a hearing as soon as possible , submitting that his client was an elderly person suffering from various ailments and that the court should therefore give priority to his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer again asked ORG to fix a date for a hearing , maintaining that his previous application for the proceedings to be accelerated had been to no avail and that the period of total inactivity on the part of that court had , in the meantime , exceeded DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Chief Judge of ORG of ORG informed the applicant that CARDINAL similar applications had been lodged with that court during DATE . This had created inevitable organisational problems because the judges of ORG were doubly overburdened : by the number of criminal cases which they had to deal with as their normal work and by the extra work arising from the significant number of cases concerning applications for wrongful convictions to be declared null and void . Moreover , as far as possible , the court was giving priority to applications lodged by living victims of repression and , therefore , it had to postpone the examination of those lodged on behalf of deceased victims . However , and in any event , there was no possibility of clearing the existing backlog within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG listed a hearing in the applicant \u2019s case for DATE . On that date the court annulled the conviction of CARDINAL DATE insofar as it concerned the charges relating to activities regarded as having been aimed at achieving independence for GPE . Since no party to the proceedings appealed within the statutory time - limit of DATE , the first - instance decision became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON of DATE on annulment of convictions whereby persons were persecuted for their activities aimed at achieving independence for GPE sets out rules concerning the conditions under which certain politically - motivated convictions rendered from DATE to CARDINAL DATE can be declared null and void , and provides for the ORG \u2019s civil liability for such convictions .", "CARDINAL . At the material time the relevant part of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act provided :", "\u201c Convictions or other decisions rendered by the NORP judicial , prosecuting or extra - judicial authorities during the period ... from DATE to CARDINAL DATE shall be declared null and void if the offence with or of which the person concerned was charged or convicted related to activities undertaken by him with the aim of achieving independence for GPE , or if the decision in question was taken on the ground that he had undertaken such activity . The same applies to persons convicted of resisting the collectivisation of farm land and compulsory contributions of foodstuffs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of section CARDINAL , as applicable at the material time , read :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A conviction or decision [ referred to in LAW ) ] shall be declared null and void on an application lodged by [ one of the following persons ] : the ORG , the Minister of ORG , a prosecutor , a victim of repression or any person authorised by law to lodge an appeal on his behalf ; where a victim of repression has since died , or he has left the territory of GPE , or is mentally ill , such an application may be lodged by any of his close relatives : ... siblings or spouse , or by an association of persons persecuted for activities undertaken by them with the aim of achieving independence for GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court shall determine the case at a hearing on the basis of the case - file of the organ which made the original decision . It may , where necessary , obtain additional evidence .", "CARDINAL . A party entitled to file an application under paragraph CARDINAL shall be entitled to appeal against a decision on whether or not the original decision should be declared null and void .", "CARDINAL . Unless otherwise provided , the provisions of LAW shall apply by analogy to the proceedings [ relating to applications under paragraph CARDINAL ] ; however , a prosecutor must participate in the hearing . A victim of repression [ and other persons entitled under paragraph CARDINAL to lodge an application ] or , with the court \u2019s leave , other persons may participate in the hearing . The hearing shall be recorded in TIME . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL LAW was amended to the effect that its provisions from that date on became applicable to persons who had been persecuted or convicted for political reasons by the Stalinist NORP authorities by virtue of an agreement concluded on DATE between ORG ( PERSON ) and the government of the GPE . Under that amendment , only ORG was competent to deal with applications lodged by this group of repressed or wrongly convicted persons . Later , on DATE , the DATE Act was again amended ; this time to the effect that all regional courts could deal with applications lodged by such persons . The second amendment took effect on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
