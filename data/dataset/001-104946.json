The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s GPE relationship ended in DATE . The applicant \u2019s mother was granted parental authority .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG ( PERSON ) investigated the applicant \u2019s situation because he had been displaying severe behavioural difficulties , had dropped out of school , had committed a number of offences and appeared disinclined to respect authority in any shape or form .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the Juvenile Judge of ORG ( kinderrechter bij de rechtbank ) placed the applicant under the supervision ( ondertoezichtstelling ) of ORG ( PERSON \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for DATE and also issued an authorisation to the ORG for the applicant \u2019s custodial placement in a confined institution for treatment ( gesloten uithuisplaatsing ) for DATE . On DATE the applicant was admitted to \u201c Het Poortje \u201d Juvenile Institution , a confined institution for treatment , in order to be observed and psychologically examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE the Juvenile Judge extended the authorisation for the applicant \u2019s custodial placement in a confined institution . The last such extension was set to expire on DATE after the first decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Juvenile Judge of ORG received the ORG \u2019s request ( dated DATE ) for a prolongation of the authorisation for the applicant \u2019s custodial placement for the duration of the supervision order . Reference was made to a report containing the results of an examination of the applicant \u2019s personality by a remedial educationalist / psychologist that had been issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing was held before the Juvenile Judge . The applicant stated that he did not want to be placed in a confined institution for treatment and that his behaviour had improved . On behalf of the ORG it was submitted that the applicant had recently been placed at ORG , a confined orthopsychiatric institution for persons with severe behavioural difficulties , that the intended treatment would take CARDINAL to one and a half years , and that it was out of the question that the applicant would be able to live with his father or his grandmother as he had indicated he wished to do . The Juvenile Judge stated that the report on the applicant \u2019s personality was clear and that a relapse , which was considered to be a real possibility , had to be prevented at all costs . Treatment was necessary , also in view of his age , and he had already been admitted to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Juvenile Judge decided to extend the period of supervision for DATE , with effect from DATE , and to prolong the authorisation issued to the ORG for the applicant \u2019s custodial placement in a confined institution for treatment for the duration of the supervision order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , in so far as it concerned the custodial placement .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held on DATE . At the hearing the applicant \u2019s counsel , emphasising that the case was not a particularly complicated CARDINAL , requested the applicant \u2019s immediate release as the case at issue had not been dealt with speedily within the meaning of LAW . After having deliberated on this matter , ORG considered that there appeared to be insufficient grounds to release the applicant immediately ; nevertheless , a decision would be rendered as soon as possible and at the latest on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and extended until DATE , that is to say for DATE rather than DATE , the authorisation issued to the ORG for the applicant \u2019s custodial placement in a confined institution for treatment . In this connection the court ruled as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Having regard to the far - reaching character of [ the ] measure \u2013 involving as it does a deprivation of liberty DATE , it should not last longer than strictly necessary . On DATE [ the applicant ] was placed in a confined institution for observation and diagnosis and on DATE he was placed there for treatment . Having regard , inter alia , to the ... positive development in [ the applicant \u2019s ] behaviour and to the individual treatment meeting which will take place in DATE , the court perceives cause to extend the authorisation for [ the applicant \u2019s ] custodial placement in a confined setting for treatment until DATE . \u201d", "As regards LAW of ORG held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In answering the question whether the case was decided sufficiently speedily , the court is of the opinion that the nature of the custodial measure at issue , the duration of that measure and the relationship between the duration of the measure and the ( total ) time that has elapsed between the moment the appeal was lodged and the date on which the appeal was decided upon should also be taken into consideration .", "CARDINAL . In the present case a measure involving deprivation of liberty was imposed in the framework of a child protection measure .", "CARDINAL . The imposed ... measure consists of extending the authorisation for [ the applicant \u2019s ] custodial placement in a confined setting for a duration of DATE , with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . [ The applicant ] lodged an appeal against that decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the court invited the ORG and [ the applicant \u2019s ] father and mother to file their submissions by DATE at the latest . It is to be noted , also in view of the custodial character of the measure , that these interested parties have been granted a shorter period of time within which to lodge observations than is customary in family - law cases . After all , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW for petition - based proceedings in family - law cases ( Uniform Reglement voor rekestprocedures in familiezaken ) the usual period within which observations are to be lodged is DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , by letters of CARDINAL DATE , the parties were summoned to appear at the court \u2019s hearing of DATE and the decision has been scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above - mentioned elements and the way they are related to each other , the court concludes that in the present case the decision can still be said to have been taken speedily within the meaning of LAW , and that this provision has therefore not been breached . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( beroep in cassatie ) with ORG ( PERSON ) . He complained explicitly of a breach of LAW in that ORG had been wrong to have had regard only to the period DATE , the date on which the appeal had been lodged , and DATE , the date of the decision . He argued that the court should have included the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE during which time he had also been deprived of his liberty , as well as the fact that ( at that time ) he had been a minor below the age of DATE . He further claimed that the considerations of the Court of Appeal relating to the shorter time than usual for the submission of observations could not warrant the conclusion that the decision had been taken speedily , nor were they relevant in that context . The statement of points of appeal was lodged by a member of ORG bar , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an Advocate - General ( advocaat - generaal ) to ORG , acting as deputy to the Procurator General ( procureurgeneraal ) , submitted an advisory opinion . She considered that as the period for which the authorisation had been granted had in the meantime lapsed , the applicant no longer had an interest in the appeal and it therefore ought to be declared inadmissible in accordance with the established case - law of ORG . Nevertheless , with a view to developing the law , ORG addressed the merits of the appeal . Reference was made to the ORG \u2019s judgments and decision in the following cases : PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) ; PERSON GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINALA ) ; PERSON the GPE ( ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXV ) ; PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINALB ) ; and LAW ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . ORG noted that the period DATE , the date on which the appeal to ORG had been lodged , and the hearing before that court on DATE had already lasted DATE , and that a further DATE had elapsed until the decision of DATE . However , the entire procedure \u2013 from the first request for extension of the authorisation until the decision taken on appeal DATE had lasted from DATE to DATE , that is a period of DATE . As to other circumstances that had to be taken into consideration , such as the complexity of the case and the applicant \u2019s behaviour , the Advocate - General pointed out that the extension at issue was based on reports that had been issued before the start of the proceedings in question and that the only delay that could be attributed to the applicant concerned the time that had elapsed between the decision of the Juvenile Judge of DATE and the lodging of the appeal on DATE . ORG concluded that , in her opinion , the decision of ORG had not been taken speedily within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , through counsel , submitted a written response to ORG advisory opinion on DATE . He argued that the lawfulness of the detention orders following on from the original order depended on the lawfulness of the original order . Furthermore , domestic law provided for an appeal to ORG in cases such as the present ; such an appeal could only be effective if ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal admissible and ruled on its merits .", "CARDINAL . By a final decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal inadmissible for lack of interest , since the authorisation at issue had already lapsed in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , shortly before DATE on which ORG order of DATE was due to expire ( CARDINAL DATE ) , the Juvenile Judge of ORG extended its validity for DATE . It was extended for a further DATE on DATE . The intention was to transfer the applicant to an open setting during this time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to an open ( non - custodial ) unit within the PERSON institution . It appears that the applicant absconded from this unit CARDINAL times DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Juvenile Judge of ORG made a new supervision order and authorised the applicant to be placed in a custodial institution for a period of DATE , backdated to CARDINAL September CARDINAL . The applicant and his mother appealed on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , ruling on both appeals , shortened the placement order to DATE instead of CARDINAL on formal grounds . It dismissed an argument based on LAW , holding that the proceedings had been sufficiently speedy , and that in any event a finding of a violation of the requirement of \u201c speediness \u201d would not ipso jure have entitled the applicant to immediate release since that might well have gone against his own best interests .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant remained in a secure institution until the time he reached his majority , which was in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( Burgerlijk Wetboek ) , the Juvenile Judge may , on the application of , inter alia , ORG , order a minor child \u2019s placement under the supervision of a family supervision agency ( gezinsvoogdij - instelling ) within the meaning of section CARDINAL of ORG ( Wet op de Jeugdhulpverlening ) , if the child is growing up under such conditions that he or she is threatened with moral or physical ruin ( zedelijke of lichamelijke ondergang ) . Such an order may be given for a maximum period of DATE , but can be extended by a maximum of DATE at a time ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . If it is deemed necessary in the interest of the child \u2019s care and upbringing or for the purposes of an examination of the child \u2019s mental or physical health , the Juvenile Judge may further authorise a custodial placement of the child ( LAW ) . Authorisation for custodial placement in a confined institution can be extended only if this is required on account of severe behavioural difficulties of the minor concerned ( LAW ) . Such authorisation may only be given for a maximum period of DATE , with the possibility of subsequent extension for a maximum of DATE at a time ( Article CARDINAL:CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . An appeal against decisions taken in petition - based proceedings , including those of the Juvenile Judge , lies to ORG ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering ) ) . The time - limit for bringing such an appeal is DATE from the date of the decision ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , those who have participated in the proceedings at first instance or at the appellate stage may lodge an appeal on points of law with ORG within DATE from the date of the decision . Such an appeal is introduced by way of a petition signed by a member of ORG bar ( Article CARDINALa ) . ORG takes its decision after the Procurator General has submitted a written advisory opinion , within a time - limit set by ORG itself ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , ORG bar was composed of all legal practitioners who were members of the bar of GPE , excluding any others ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( GPE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . It is constant case - law of ORG to declare appeals on points of law contesting the lawfulness of detention inadmissible if the detention has ended , for whatever reason , by the time the court comes to consider the question . This is what it decided , for example , in its judgment of DATE ( see PERSON ( ORG , \u201c GPE \u201d ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed this position in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , in which it declared inadmissible an appeal on points of law lodged by a person committed to detention for DATE for failing to give evidence as a witness in court but who had been released DATE . Even so , ORG saw fit to address the merits of the case obiter , considering that had the appeal been admissible , it would have failed nonetheless ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
