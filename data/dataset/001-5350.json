MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE . He is represented before the Court by Dr PERSON and Dr PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE , GPE .", "A.", "The applicant applied to contest the local council elections in ORG which were to be held on DATE . The applicant stood as an independent candidate .", "Following an objection by ORG disqualified him from standing in the election . On DATE ORG set aside this decision . The applicant went on to be elected Mayor of NORP .", "The applicant was subsequently charged before ORG of , inter alia , failing to send to the NORP Commissioner within DATE of the election results a signed statement of his election expenses as required by LAW XV of DATE on ORG . Another independent candidate was charged with the same offence . None of the other CARDINAL candidates , all of whom represented the governing or opposition party , was charged although they had failed to submit the required statement .", "The applicant appealed to ORG . He stated he was the victim of discrimination since the police had not instituted proceedings against the other CARDINAL non - independent candidates even though they all failed to file declarations on their election expenses . On DATE the First Hall of the Civil Court rejected the applicant 's application for a constitutional remedy on the grounds that he and the only other independent candidate had committed additional electoral offences . On that account the court ruled that the applicant could not be considered to have been discriminated against with reference either to LAW or to LAW taken in conjunction with LAW No . CARDINAL thereto .", "The applicant appealed to ORG . On DATE ORG rejected his appeal . ORG ruled that the applicant was not in an analogous situation to the other CARDINAL candidates as , unlike the latter , he had committed further serious offences linked to the conduct of the local election . There was accordingly a justification for the difference in treatment . The ORG stated in this connection :", "\u201c This ORG can not agree that it is irrelevant that [ the applicant and the other independent candidate ] were charged with other crimes . These crimes , and the applicant is not contesting his prosecution for them , are crimes relating to [ the applicant 's and the other independent candidates ' ] behaviour during the electoral campaign involving either violation of the electoral law provisions or serious offences consequential on such violation . The Commissioner of Police was thus faced in [ the applicant 's and the other independent candidate 's cases ] , with a situation of violation of a different and much more serious law than the law applicable to the CARDINAL other candidates . The Commissioner could not , rightly so , consider the applicant and these other candidates in pari conditione nor were they in a situation of like and like . '", "... The ORG is satisfied that in the present case the determining factor for differential treatment ... was not a quality of the person accused or his political convictions , but the nature and seriousness of the crimes he - and not the other candidates - was charged with . \u201d", "By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant 's lawyer informed the ORG that the criminal proceedings instituted against him had not yet been terminated .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Local councils in GPE operate within a framework defined by legislation enacted by ORG and derive their regulatory powers from parent legislation . They may make bye laws within their area of competence in exercise of the powers delegated to them by ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
