On DATE customs officers stopped and checked the applicant company \u2019s lorry , in which they found packages of unknown content . A preliminary test of the content revealed that the packages contained heroin . The customs officers informed the police accordingly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police inspected the lorry and its trailer and found QUANTITY of heroin . The driver , a NORP citizen , was arrested and detained . The lorry was seized and the trailer and its goods became the object of a customs procedure . On an unspecified date the applicant company received documents enabling the goods contained in the trailer to be delivered to their destination . The trailer was returned to the applicant company . Subsequently , the police filed a criminal complaint against the driver with the Ptuj ORG .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant company asked ORG to provide it with the case - file concerning the charges against the driver . It also enquired when it would be able to retake possession of the seized lorry . On DATE the court informed the applicant company of the charges against the driver . It further informed the applicant company that the lorry had been seized in accordance with LAW read in conjunction with Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW and that no decision could be made on the return or confiscation of the lorry until a decision on the merits had been issued . On DATE the applicant company informed the court that it opposed ORG request for confiscation of the lorry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the driver guilty of drug trafficking and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It ordered that the lorry be returned to the applicant company . It held that confiscation was possible only if one of the conditions set out in the second paragraph of LAW of LAW were met , namely the existence of reasons of general security or morality . ORG considered that that condition had not been met , taking into account the fact that there was no indication that the applicant company knew about the transportation of the illegal material .", "CARDINAL . Both the driver and ORG appealed . On DATE ORG modified the first - instance judgment and , relying on Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW , ordered the confiscation of the lorry . It held that the legislative framework provided for mandatory confiscation in cases of drug - related criminal offences since the nature of their commission , their magnitude and the dangerous consequences thereof called for the extension of coercive measures to persons who were not the perpetrators of the criminal offence , irrespective of whether or not the owners of the vehicle knew what the perpetrator had been transporting . ORG explained that in accordance with LAW , objects used in the commission of a criminal offence could be confiscated even when they did not belong to the perpetrator , in so far as the third party \u2019s right to claim damages from the perpetrator was not thereby affected . Moreover , Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provided for the possibility of mandatory confiscation in cases provided for by the statute . Thus , Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW implemented those CARDINAL provisions by providing mandatory confiscation of the means of transport used for transportation and storage of illegal substances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a constitutional complaint against the aforementioned decision and an initiative for review of the constitutionality of Section CARDINAL ) of LAW , alleging a violation of its property rights . It complained in particular that it had not known that the lorry was being used for illegal purposes , adding that the first - instance court had explicitly established its non - involvement in the commission of the criminal offence at issue . Claiming that it had not had an effective possibility to prevent the abuse of its property for criminal purposes , the applicant company stressed that the lorry had been subject to regular controls concerning possible vehicle modifications and hidden compartments . Thus , according to the applicant company , the measure complained of constituted a punishment and an unjustified and disproportionate interference with its property and that it had not had the opportunity to participate in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed both the constitutional complaint and the initiative . In reviewing the contested legislation , ORG confirmed the Higher Court \u2019s view that LAW provided for mandatory confiscation of vehicles used for the transportation and storage of drugs or illegal substances in sport , regardless of their ownership . According to ORG , drug - related criminal offences sanctioned under LAW represented a great evil and an extremely high degree of threat not only from the perspective of the individual , but also from the perspective of society as a whole ; the purpose of the impugned measure was to prevent the commission of such criminal offences in the future and thus to protect important legal values in society , such as health and life \u2013 especially of young people . ORG stressed that the nature of the criminal offences in question , the manner in which they were committed and their consequences justified the interference with the ownership rights of all owners of the means of transport used for drug - trafficking , regardless of their potential involvement in the criminal activities at issue , adding that a different regulation governing the confiscation of goods would diminish considerably the possibilities for effectively preventing the criminal offences in question .", "CARDINAL . Balancing the general interests in question with the property rights of the applicant company , ORG held that the measure complained of did not amount to an excessive interference despite the fact that the applicant company had had no effective possibility for preventing the misuse of its property for criminal purposes and had not participated in the commission of the criminal offence . In this connection , ORG pointed out that legal certainty required that every instance of legally recognised damage be adequately protected . Thus , by virtue of LAW of LAW , the confiscation did not affect the right of third parties to claim compensation from the offender . Under the general rules of tort law , the injured owner had the possibility and the right to exact compensation from the person responsible for the damage . ORG added that it was for the regular courts to establish in each individual case whether all the elements required for recognition of the alleged damage and thus for payment of compensation were fulfilled .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the ORG informed the applicant company that the lorry was to be sold at a public auction and that it could submit written comments in this respect . On DATE the applicant company replied that it was willing to buy the confiscated lorry . On DATE the court ordered the sale of the lorry and informed the applicant company thereof . On DATE the lorry was sold at public auction for MONEY ( \u201c EUR \u201d ) . According to the Government the lorry was sold to the applicant company . In this regard , they submitted a document stating that the lorry had been sold to \u201c B.K.M. LOJISTIK , TAS.VE TIC.LTD.STI \u201d , a company from GPE . However , the applicant company contested that statement , alleging that it was another company that had purchased the lorry .
