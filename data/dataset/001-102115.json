SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant submitted an occupational injury report ( arbetsskadeanm\u00e4lan ) to ORG ( PERSON \u201c the ORG \u201d ) of GPE in which he requested that his lower back and hip joint problems be considered work - related , thereby making him eligible for occupational injury compensation ( arbetsskadeers\u00e4ttning ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG noted that the applicant had carried out heavy work as a slaughterhouse worker until DATE when he had moved to the GPE and worked on renovating walls . In DATE the applicant had informed the ORG that he could no longer carry out his work because of his hip joint problems . Thus , in DATE , he had been granted early retirement pension on the ground that he suffered from lumbar spondylosis and coxarthritis ( a degenerative joint disease of his lower back and right hip ) . On the basis of the above , the ORG considered that it was possible that the applicant \u2019s work in the GPE had harmed him and , since it could only consider injuries which had occurred while working in GPE , it could not examine the request .", "CARDINAL . Upon request by the applicant , the ORG , on DATE , reconsidered its previous decision but decided not to change it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , claiming that his injuries had been caused by his work in GPE . He stated that he had created a company in the GPE to import NORP fibreglass fabric but that , in order to get his business going , he had had to include measuring , installing and painting . However , since he already had pain in his hip joint and lower back , he had not been able to carry out the work and had sold the company . He further added that he had worked in slaughterhouses DATE , which had involved very heavy work in difficult conditions . In support , he submitted a medical certificate from PERSON , who had been working as a company doctor for DATE in the food industry and had been the applicant \u2019s company doctor DATE . According to Dr S.R. , the applicant \u2019s injuries were work - related , noting that he had carried animal carcasses and heavy pieces of meat up and down stairs , causing extreme strain on the back , hips , knees and ankles . Moreover , the work had been carried out in humid , draughty LOC and with slippery floors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG repealed the ORG \u2019s decision and sent the case back for renewed examination . It found that the applicant \u2019s injuries could well have been caused by his work in GPE and that the ORG had the duty to evaluate whether this was the case .", "CARDINAL . To prepare the case , the ORG requested the opinion of CARDINAL of its own medical doctors ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsl\u00e4kare ) , PERSON , as to whether the applicant \u2019s injuries were work - related . The doctor , who was a specialist in orthopaedics , gave his opinion on DATE . It was based on the information in the ORG \u2019s case - file and stated essentially the following .", "CARDINAL . It appeared from other medical certificates that the applicant had been healthy until his hip joint problems began in DATE . In DATE his right hip and lower back had been x - rayed , which showed that the hip joint had degenerative alterations , whereas the lower back was not remarked on , having regard to the applicant \u2019s age . In DATE the applicant had undergone a hip joint operation . In Dr ORG \u2019s opinion , the applicant suffered from moderate arthritis in his hip joint , which had developed slowly from DATE and thus was age - related , not work - related . In this respect , he claimed that there was no general support in scientific literature for the proposition that elements in the working environment could cause arthritis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG decided that the applicant could not be granted occupational injury compensation as it considered that his injuries were not related to his work in GPE . In reaching its decision , it had put much emphasis on the opinion of Dr S.H. , since he was a specialist in orthopaedics .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , maintaining that he was entitled to occupational injury compensation due to his injuries , which were clearly work - related . In support of his appeal , he submitted a medical certificate by PERSON , specialist in orthopaedic surgery , who had treated the applicant . According to PERSON , the applicant had suffered from serious joint arthritis of the right hip when he first met him during DATE , which had led to the operation in DATE . As the illness did not run in the applicant \u2019s family and it had developed at an earlier age in the applicant than was normal , PERSON considered that it was probable that the injury had been caused by the applicant \u2019s heavy work in the slaughterhouse . Moreover , in his view , the applicant \u2019s work in the GPE had in no way affected the development of the arthritis .", "CARDINAL . The Office disputed the appeal and submitted that PERSON opinion did not clearly show that the applicant \u2019s work at the slaughterhouse had caused his injuries .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant contacted ORG and requested that an oral hearing be held in his case so that he could describe his working situation . However , by decision of CARDINAL DATE , the court rejected the request as it found that it was unnecessary with regard to the nature of the subject matter . The applicant was given DATE in which to finalise his submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when asked by ORG , the applicant renewed his request for an oral hearing but sent on DATE a fax to the court explaining that he did not request an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It did not question that his work had been of a very heavy nature . However , it noted that it had to be relatively widely accepted that certain factors in the working environment , with a high level of probability , could cause the relevant injuries . In the present case , the court found that the applicant had failed to show that there was a high level of probability that his work at the slaughterhouse had caused his hip joint arthritis .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made a further appeal to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , maintaining his claims and adding that he wanted an oral hearing to be held so that he could prove his case , inter alia , by describing his working conditions in the slaughterhouse and developing the medical investigation . In this respect , he referred to LAW and noted that he would later specify whom he wanted to call as expert witnesses .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the applicant submitted another medical certificate which supported his claim that his injuries were work - related . It was written by PERSON , specialist in orthopaedics , who had examined the applicant . In the certificate , PERSON stated that studies existed which indicated a connection between heavy physical work and the development of hip joint arthritis . There were also studies which showed that the risk of developing hip joint arthritis increased with the number of tons that a person lifted during his working life . Having regard to the applicant \u2019s background , his work at the slaughterhouse and the relatively young age at which he had developed the arthritis , PERSON concluded that there were much stronger reasons in support of a connection between the applicant \u2019s injuries and his work than against it .", "CARDINAL . The Office disputed the applicant \u2019s appeal and the new medical certificate , submitting that the appeal should be rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing as it considered that , with regard to the nature of the subject mater , it was unnecessary to hold a hearing . The court granted the applicant DATE to finalise his submissions in the case .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , ORG rejected the appeal . Having regard to the medical investigation in the case , in particular the opinion of PERSON , as well as the time aspect ( the applicant had stopped working in DATE at the slaughterhouse but only been operated on in DATE ) , the court found that it had not been shown , with a high level of probability , that the work had caused the applicant \u2019s injuries .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) and requested that an oral hearing be held . He stressed that the lower courts had failed to hold a hearing , despite his express request and in violation of LAW . Moreover , he submitted that a hearing was necessary in order for him to describe his working conditions at the slaughterhouse and to be able to question specialists to clarify his injuries and their causes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing as it considered that there was no need for a hearing before it decided on whether or not to grant leave to appeal . It gave the applicant DATE to submit any additional comments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , section CARDINAL , of the DATE LAW , the term \u201c work injury \u201d mainly refers to injuries resulting from accidents or other harmful factors at a person \u2019s place of work . Under the LAW , all gainfully employed persons working in GPE are insured against work injuries . The insurance scheme is administered by the social insurance offices ( as from DATE ORG ) and includes , among other things , compensation for loss of earnings . A work injury must be immediately reported to the employer who is required to notify the social insurance office . The office must obtain a medical opinion concerning the injury . A medical doctor is attached to the office to assist it in medical matters . The assessment of whether an injury qualifies as a work injury , as well as the degree of reduction of a person \u2019s ability to engage in gainful employment , shall be made on the basis of the available medical opinions , the medical doctor \u2019s assessment of these opinions and any other relevant information .", "CARDINAL . For an injury to qualify as a work injury , a causal link must be established between the accident or harmful effect in the workplace and the insured person \u2019s health problems . What is meant by \u201c harmful effect \u201d is the influence of a factor that is very likely to cause an injury or illness such as that incurred by the insured person ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW in its wording from DATE until DATE ) . At the relevant time , the question of whether a particular injury or illness incurred by the insured person was to be regarded as a work injury was subject to the following special rule of evidence . If the insured person had suffered an accident or had been subjected to some other harmful effect at work , his or her medical problems were presumed to have been caused by the accident or the harmful effect if there were substantial grounds in support of such a conclusion ( LAW , LAW , of LAW in its wording from DATE and until DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The amendments entering into force on DATE , and which applied to work injury reports that were submitted after DATE , the requirements in LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of the DATE Act were tightened up . This meant , inter alia , that it had to be \u201c highly probable \u201d , and not merely \u201c probable \u201d that a certain factor in the working environment could cause a person \u2019s injuries and , thereby , be considered as having harmful effects . The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires ( see the Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) state that this implies that the responsible authorities have to consider more extensively than previously whether the exposure to a harmful factor at work has been of such an extent , intensity and duration that from this it can be concluded that the existence of harmfulness is highly probable . Furthermore , the collected knowledge must indicate with a considerable degree of probability that a factor in the environment is harmful . The view that a certain factor is very likely to cause an injury has to be relatively generally accepted . This is the case where substantial knowledge exists , within medical or other science , that a certain factor has such harmful effects . If there is a lack of such support , such as when , for example , there are profound differences in expert opinions , this requirement can not be considered as fulfilled . Thus , the opinion of a specific researcher or medical doctor should not constitute a sufficient basis for a positive decision on the issue of harmful effects .", "CARDINAL . The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires also state that the tightened requirement of harmfulness in many cases presupposes more careful investigations at workplaces regarding the harmful factors invoked and that the question of the causes of certain diseases has to be discussed more thoroughly . This , in turn , will result in the social insurance offices and the courts basing their decisions more extensively on different assessments of harmfulness within medical science .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Administrative Court Procedure Act ( f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen , Act no . CARDINAL:CARDINAL , as in force at the relevant time ) was worded as follows :", "\u201c The procedure shall be in writing .", "Where it may be assumed to be advantageous for the investigation or promote the expeditious determination of the case , the processing may include an oral hearing regarding certain issues .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to ORG emphasise that an oral procedure can be advantageous for the investigation of a case in CARDINAL respects in particular . Firstly , such a hearing may be needed in order to examine a witness , expert or party or in cases where a party has difficulty expounding his or her claim in writing . Secondly , an oral hearing may be needed to clarify the positions taken by the parties in the case and perhaps eliminate unnecessary or meaningless points of dispute . In the latter case , the procedure is typically of a preparatory nature . Moreover , the oral form of procedure envisaged in the DATE Act is not to be seen as an alternative to the written form , but rather as a complement to that form ( see the Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The possibility of holding an oral hearing in order to promote an expeditious determination of the case , which was first introduced in DATE , was a clarification of a practice that already applied ( see the Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , ORG on Justice JuU CARDINAL , Parliamentary Communication CARDINAL , SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . The purpose of the legislative amendment was to make it clearer that an oral hearing can and should be used for preparatory purposes in certain cases , to make for speedier and more effective proceedings . The amendment was primarily intended for tax cases associated with tax offence cases before courts of general jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to the DATE Act underlined , in connection with the provision in section QUANTITY concerning the right of a party to an oral hearing in certain cases , that while serious consideration should be given to the wishes of a party for such a hearing , the party could hardly be allowed to have a decisive influence in the matter . The question of whether a hearing is necessary should primarily be assessed in the light of the existing investigation of the case , but it should also be possible to accord significance to other factors , for example , if the case is very important for the party and a hearing would give him a better understanding of the import of the decision to be given in the case . CARDINAL particular reason not to arrange an oral hearing could be that the case is of a trivial nature or that the costs of the hearing are high compared to the value of the object of dispute ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG has set aside a number of decisions on appeal and referred the case back to the administrative courts of appeal because of the lack of an oral hearing in the lower courts ( see , for example , ORG CARDINAL ref . CARDINAL , BA DATE note DATE , ORG note CARDINAL and ORG DATE note CARDINAL ; as more specifically regards work injuries , see ORG note CARDINAL and RA CARDINAL note CARDINAL ) . In the last mentioned case , an administrative court of appeal had changed the lower court \u2019s judgment to the applicant \u2019s disadvantage without holding an oral hearing . Furthermore , the applicant had requested that a medical doctor be heard as a witness ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
