On DATE and DATE ( see Appendix ) the applicants were detained by the police and officers of the ORG at a clothing factory in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ( see Appendix ) ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) examined the ORG administrative files , found them guilty of administrative offences ( breach of immigration rules and working without a permit ) and ordered them to pay fines of CARDINAL Russian roubles ( RUB ) and their expulsion to GPE , in line with the procedure under LAW . The applicants all stated in court that they feared for their lives if returned to GPE and referred to information about the ongoing and widespread conflict there . The court found these statements to be general in nature and unsupported by any relevant evidence . The applicants also referred to the absence of work in GPE and the fact that in GPE they had been able to work illegally . ORG then focused on the economic motives of their arrival and illegal stay . Pending expulsion the court ordered their detention at the detention centre .", "CARDINAL . NORP The lawyer representing the applicants before the ORG lodged appeals for all CARDINAL of them , describing in detail the general situation in GPE and the danger of returning there , and citing and attaching the relevant country reports produced by the ORG and ORG . She also cited a circular letter issued by ORG on DATE to its regional branches , according to which no entry was possible into NORP territory in view of the hostilities and problems that would arise with the execution of court judgments ordering expulsion there . The lawyer argued , in detail , that the decisions to expel the applicants could not be implemented ; in such circumstances their detention lost any purpose and became indefinite . The lawyer further cited an ORG circular letter of DATE entitled \u201c On the situation in GPE and the work with persons originating from GPE \u201d , which stated that \u201c in the current difficult political situation , when the NORP authorities are unable to provide effective protection of their citizens from the illegal actions of the armed opposition ... most of the applicants ... have fled the country as a result of the armed conflict . ... Individuals who can not not safely return [ to GPE ] and have a well - founded fear of ill - treatment , including torture , should be given temporary asylum \u201d . The statements of appeal further referred to the fact that the applicants had sought asylum in GPE ; their expulsion would therefore be contrary to the relevant legislation . ORG in GPE produced a letter to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in respect of GPE , reiterating its position in respect of returns to GPE and arguing that any decision relating to expulsion there while his asylum request was pending would be in breach of domestic and international legislation . Similar letters were produced in respect of the CARDINAL other applicants . The applicants also referred to a decision of ORG taken earlier in DATE relating to a NORP national in a similar situation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected all CARDINAL appeals on DATE , following which the expulsion orders entered into force . It stressed the applicants\u2019 illegal stay in GPE and their reference to economic difficulties as their reason for departure from their home country . It found that the alleged danger to the applicants\u2019 lives as a result of the ongoing conflict did not in itself constitute sufficient grounds to exclude expulsion in respect of those guilty of administrative offences in the sphere of immigration .", "CARDINAL . In respect of GPE , in a separate decision of DATE , ORG refused to amend the expulsion order . The court noted that he had not applied for asylum in GPE until DATE , a fact which \u201c did not affect the lawfulness of the decision taken by ORG concerning the applicant \u2019s administrative offence and expulsion \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG to stay execution in respect of PERSON , pointing out that ORG had applied Rule CARDINAL and therefore the expulsion could not be carried out at that time . On DATE ORG found that LAW did not provide for stays of expulsion as opposed to the payment of fines and dismissed the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a similar decision in respect of GPE , pursuant to a request by ORG on DATE . None of the parties were present at the hearing , including GPE", "CARDINAL . It appears from the letter of DATE sent by ORG to the applicants\u2019 lawyer that it was unaware at that date of ORG decisions . From the same letter it appears that a similar request had been made for a stay of execution in respect of PERSON", "CARDINAL . Since DATE and DATE the applicants have been detained at the detention centre .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government \u2019s observations received in DATE , PERSON escaped on DATE .

NORP In reply to the ORG \u2019s further questions in this regard , in their observations of DATE the Government explained that no administrative or criminal proceedings had been initiated , as an escape from a detention centre for foreign nationals pending deportation was not an offence under any legislation . While the police continued to search for the detainees , their whereabouts , including those of PERSON , remained unknown .", "CARDINAL . The Government further submitted that since their observations had been based on the replies of the competent ORG authorities prepared on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , no information about PERSON \u2019s escape had been provided at that stage . They also submitted that the detention centre had been under no obligation to inform GPE representatives of the escape , hence why it had not done so in PERSON \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 representative confirmed that she had not been aware of PERSON \u2019s escape prior to the meeting with the CARDINAL other applicants on DATE and submitted that she had no knowledge of PERSON \u2019s current whereabouts .", "CARDINAL . From the documents submitted by the Government in DATE , it appears that PERSON sought refugee status in GPE on DATE by applying to the GPE Region FMS . On DATE this request was accepted for consideration on the merits and the applicant was questioned and issued with an appropriate document .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON \u2019s application for refugee status was dismissed . The decision of the ORG stated that he had submitted no information to support his claims of persecution in GPE . His family remained in that country and he could have used the \u201c internal flight alternative \u201d to another part of GPE , or claimed asylum in a transit country . He reasoned his request to remain in GPE by his wish to work there and did not therefore fall under the definition of refugee .", "CARDINAL .

He had also lost contact with the members of his family who had remained in GPE . All applicants stressed that they were afraid to go back because of the hostilities which had caused their departure , and said that they feared being forcibly drafted into the armed forces .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP FMS decided that their applications for refugee status should be considered on the merits and issued appropriate certificates to them .", "CARDINAL . In parallel proceedings , also in DATE , the CARDINAL applicants were questioned by the ORG in order to obtain temporary asylum in GPE .", "CARDINAL .

No documents were submitted in this regard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP FMS decided to refuse ORG request for refugee status . It considered that he faced no threat of persecution on the grounds set out in FAC . On DATE the Kaluga FMS , for the same reasons , refused him temporary asylum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reviewed ORG appeal against the decision not to grant him temporary asylum . He was not taken to the trial even though the decision stated that he had been notified , and he did not have a representative . A representative of the ORG appeared before the court , which briefly restated the reasons for the ORG decision to refuse the applicant both refugee and temporary asylum status and confirmed that there were no reasons to regard him as in need of protection . Neither the general situation in GPE nor the applicant \u2019s submissions about the situation in GPE had been raised or discussed . This decision was sent to GPE on DATE . It is unclear if he appealed against it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE and PERSON submitted new written requests for refugee status , which were accepted for consideration by the NORP FMS on DATE .

The papers stated that they had been translated and written by Z.A.", "CARDINAL . The Government , in their observations of DATE , explained that the contradictory position taken by PERSON prevented the ORG from considering his new application on the merits .

As a result , despite numerous attempts and complaints , GPE and GPE only had CARDINAL meeting with them on DATE . M.A. had CARDINAL meeting with his brother and PERSON on DATE , which lasted TIME .

NORP The applicants submitted copies of their exchange with various officials in the NORP FMS and prosecutor \u2019s office regarding their detention and access to representatives .

Visits outside of TIME had to be agreed in advance with the detention centre administration , to ensure the proper functioning of the centre .

On DATE PERSON \u2019s lawyer wrote to the NORP regional prosecutor \u2019s office .

Detainees were kept in their rooms for most of DATE ; they had no means of communication with anybody and could not contact each other or their representatives .
