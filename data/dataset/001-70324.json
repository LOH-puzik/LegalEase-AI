SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE . He is presently serving a prison sentence in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by Ms I. Kalmerborn , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE a prisoner was killed at GPE prison where the applicant was serving a prison sentence . Suspicions quickly centred on CARDINAL persons , the applicant and QUANTITY other prisoners .", "On DATE , while the applicant was being interviewed by the police , he was informed , in accordance with chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) , that he was suspected of murder . Having been informed also of his right to be assisted by defence counsel , the applicant stated that he wanted CARDINAL of CARDINAL named lawyers to be appointed for him ; otherwise , he would not answer any questions . However , no counsel was appointed . Later the applicant contacted a lawyer with regard to the confiscation of certain objects from his cell and , at further police questioning on DATE , he stated that he wished to be represented by that lawyer . Still , he claimed that he would not make any statement before a possible court hearing in the case . No questions about the murder were put to the applicant during the CARDINAL police interviews .", "Assisted by the lawyer , the applicant sent written requests for counsel to be appointed , to the police on DATE and to the public prosecutor in charge of the preliminary investigation , at ORG in GPE , on DATE . The prosecutor did not report the matter to the court , however . Contacted by the lawyer by telephone in DATE , the prosecutor stated that the issue of appointing defence counsel did not arise , as the applicant refused to answer questions posed by the police . The prosecutor was reminded of the matter by a letter from the lawyer on DATE . DATE , no measures having been taken in this regard , the applicant , via the lawyer , made a request to ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE to have counsel appointed for him . In an opinion to the court , the prosecutor endorsed the request . On DATE the court appointed the lawyer , who had assisted the applicant , as his defence counsel .", "On DATE the public prosecutor made a request to ORG for the taking of evidence outside a main hearing ( bevisupptagning utom huvudf\u00f6rhandling ) . The court immediately summoned defence counsel for the applicant and the CARDINAL other suspects by telephone for a hearing DATE . No documents were submitted and the CARDINAL suspects themselves were not summoned . At the hearing , the public prosecutor informed counsel for the defence that a witness , who allegedly had been present when the murder was committed , had expressed to the police DATE that he was willing to testify , but only before a court . Furthermore , fearing reprisals , he would only testify anonymously . The taking of evidence was urgent as the witness would be expelled from GPE to a distant country DATE . Defence counsel for CARDINAL of the other suspects was unable to attend the hearing and the court therefore , at the prosecutor \u2019s request , appointed another lawyer to represent that suspect during the hearing although the counsel in question , contacted by his colleagues by telephone , disagreed with this measure .", "Counsel for the defence objected to the procedure , complaining that they had not received the records of previous police interviews with the witness and had not been given adequate time to prepare for the hearing or confer with their clients . They were also opposed to the witness remaining anonymous . The public prosecutor stated that she did not have any records of previous police interviews at her disposal .", "ORG , sitting with its president , decided to allow the taking of evidence under LAW , section CARDINAL of the Code of Judicial Procedure with the procedure requested by the prosecutor . The court referred to a parliamentary committee report ( SOU CARDINAL:CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) in which it had been noted that the use of anonymous testimony , in certain circumstances , was allowed according to the case - law of ORG . The court had further regard to the special circumstances described by the prosecutor and considered that the fact that the suspects themselves had not been summoned to the hearing did not constitute an impediment for the hearing to go ahead . It also observed that the circumstances surrounding the hearing would have to be taken into account at a future evaluation of the evidence in question .", "After having identified himself to the court in the absence of counsel for the defence , the witness was placed behind a screen , making him visible to the court and the prosecutor but not to counsel . During the questioning , counsel were able to cross - examine the witness .", "Immediately after the taking of evidence the applicant was arrested and placed in custody . The public prosecutor applied for a detention order , referring to the evidence obtained from the anonymous witness .", "On DATE ORG , sitting with a different judge , held a detention hearing in the presence of the applicant and his counsel . The prosecutor explained that there was other evidence against the suspects in the case which she could not present at that time as she needed more time to put together the material . Following the hearing , ORG ordered the detention of the applicant . By other decisions taken on DATE , the court also ordered the detention of the other CARDINAL suspects .", "The applicant appealed and , on DATE , ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) quashed ORG detention order . The appellate court noted :", "\u201c The examination by ORG of an anonymous witness has not been permitted under NORP law . The fact that [ ORG ] , in certain circumstances , has found such examinations to be in conformity with [ the Convention ] is therefore of no relevance to the question whether such examinations are allowed in GPE .", "The evidence presented by the public prosecutor is , in ORG opinion , not such that [ the applicant ] can be considered as suspected of murder on probable cause . ... \u201d", "On DATE , at TIME , that is CARDINAL after ORG decision , the public prosecutor again decided to have the applicant as well as the other suspects arrested . The applicant was arrested at TIME His counsel was not notified . It appears from the arrest order that the reason for his arrest was the risk that he would impede the inquiry of the murder ( kollusionsfara ) . Following an interview with the police , which began at TIME and at which the applicant gave no statement , the applicant called the law offices of his counsel at TIME and informed another lawyer of the arrest . That lawyer immediately requested ORG in GPE to review the arrest . On DATE , at TIME , the assistant chief prosecutor , having considered the evidence as a whole , decided to quash the CARDINAL arrest orders . She noted that she had contacted the public prosecutor who had then stated , as reasons for the arrests , that new information had surfaced .", "The applicant was arrested anew on DATE and was later detained by ORG .", "The applicant was given access to the report of the preliminary investigation on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant was indicted for murder . A copy of the report of the preliminary investigation , including a transcript of the testimony given by the anonymous witness , was submitted to ORG . The public prosecutor sought to have an audiotape recording of that testimony played back at the court \u2019s main hearing . She also requested that CARDINAL person be heard about what had happened at the taking of evidence with that witness and that CARDINAL policemen be heard about what had come out of police interviews with QUANTITY inmates at GPE prison .", "Counsel for the CARDINAL suspects in the case objected to the above evidence . They pointed out that anonymous testimony was not allowed under NORP law ; the fact that the name of the witness had been disclosed since the taking of evidence made no difference . As that evidence should be refused , the testimony of the person supposed to give evidence in that regard was irrelevant . Furthermore , the inmates in question should be heard in person at the main hearing or could have been heard in person previously outside the main hearing .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG disallowed the above evidence . It basically agreed with the arguments presented by counsel for the defence and referred to ORG decision of DATE on the anonymous testimony . It further stated that , although hearsay evidence was not as such prohibited under NORP law or the Convention , it deprived the defendants of the possibility to cross - examine and noted that the public prosecutor had adduced no reasons as to why the CARDINAL inmates had not been summoned to give evidence at the main hearing or at a taking of evidence outside the main hearing .", "ORG held an oral hearing in the case on DATE and inspected the prison training facilities where the murder had taken place .", "In a partial judgment of DATE ORG found CARDINAL of the CARDINAL other defendants guilty of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment .", "By another partial judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant of murder . He was sentenced to DATE in prison .", "The main piece of evidence was an alleged eye - witness account of an inmate , PERSON According to a police memorandum included in the report of the preliminary investigation , PERSON , who was to be expelled after having served his prison sentence on DATE , had expressed his willingness to testify on the condition that he would be allowed to remain in GPE . However , it had been explained to him that only the Government could revoke an expulsion order . He had been questioned several times by the police in DATE and DATE following his release from prison , while he was awaiting expulsion . No further information was given on what had preceded the hearing of PERSON before the court .", "In his testimony , PERSON claimed that he \u2013 and the person who had given evidence anonymously \u2013 had been present in the small weight - training room where the murder had been committed . He stated that he had seen the CARDINAL suspects stabbing the victim with knives of the same type which he believed had been sharpened . Another inmate had told him that the defendants had proceeded to the sauna where they had placed CARDINAL knives in a hole and had then gone to the shower .", "PERSON further stated that , when interviewed by the police immediately after the stabbing , he had claimed , in order to protect himself , that he did not know anything about the event . However , he had later suffered from nightmares and a bad conscience and felt that it was not right to keep silent about what he had seen . When contacted by the police on DATE , he had agreed to testify .", "During cross - examination , PERSON stated that the police had helped him to make a petition to the Government for the expulsion order to be revoked . Having been given a residence permit in DATE on humanitarian grounds , he claimed that the petition had referred to political grounds and his diabetes and not to his giving testimony before the court . He had signed the petition himself but he did not know whether the police had attached any enclosures . The police had sent the petition in DATE and , by a Government decision of DATE , he had been granted a temporary residence permit until DATE . After he had been released from detention , where he had been awaiting his expulsion since having served his prison sentence on DATE , the police had found a flat for him with a secret address and had also helped him to buy a television set and had seen to it that he was generally comfortable . However , the police had not tried to influence his testimony .", "In evaluating PERSON \u2019s testimony , ORG took into account that he had given his first statement about the event in DATE , at which time the police had helped him to apply for a revocation of his expulsion order . The court noted that the application signed by PERSON stated , as reason for granting the request , that he had important information to give about the case . In an attachment dated DATE , the public prosecutor and the police stated that it was important that PERSON be allowed to remain in GPE during the police investigation and the court proceedings . The court considered , in general , that , in view of the risks involved in talking to the police , a prisoner \u2019s late submission of information did not necessarily diminish the credibility of the testimony . Noting furthermore that PERSON had been very anxious to stay in GPE , the court considered that there were CARDINAL possible ways to interpret his decision to testify : either he had perceived a chance to be granted a residence permit if he gave testimony and had , to this end , made up a story which corresponded with the police \u2019s view of the case , or he had actually seen everything he now stated but had not dared to mention it until he was promised help with the above - mentioned application and concluded that the benefits of testifying outweighed the risks involved . Without giving any reasons for its conclusion , the court opted for the second interpretation .", "ORG then assessed the credibility of PERSON \u2019s statements by comparing them with testimony given by other prisoners and the technical and other evidence in the case . The court could not infer from any of these pieces of evidence that the applicant had been involved in the murder , nor did any evidence exclude his involvement . It considered , however , that PERSON \u2019s statements were supported by the technical evidence and were supported , or not contradicted , by the other evidence . It therefore considered that the murder had been committed as described by the public prosecutor .", "In sentencing the applicant , ORG took into account that , on DATE , he had been sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for an attempted murder in DATE and that , on DATE , he had been sentenced to DATE in prison for , inter alia , a murder committed in DATE . The court noted that , as the applicant had been below DATE when the murder of the prisoner had been committed , he could not be sentenced to life imprisonment .", "The applicant appealed against the judgment . The public prosecutor requested that she be allowed to use the evidence that had been disallowed by ORG .", "By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the evidence relating to the anonymous testimony but allowed CARDINAL policemen to be heard about the statements given at the police interviews of CARDINAL inmates at GPE prison . At the subsequent hearing , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL policemen gave evidence . The prosecutor withdrew the other policeman \u2019s testimony .", "Joining the applicant \u2019s appeal and the appeal of the co - defendant who had been convicted by ORG partial judgment of DATE , the appellate court held an oral hearing and also inspected the prison training facilities . At the hearing , PERSON stated , inter alia , that the police had not only found a flat for him but also a job . Furthermore , the police had given him financial aid , MONEY in cash on CARDINAL occasions . They had also helped him to apply for a prolongation of his residence permit , which had been granted until DATE . He pointed out , however , that he had given the police a detailed statement of the course of events before the ORG \u2019s decision to grant him a residence permit in DATE .", "During the proceedings in ORG in DATE , the public prosecutor submitted a document in which the police stated that the risk assessment they had made had led to the provision of witness protection to GPE The details of this protection were secret . It was stated , however , that the measures taken , including the financial aid , had been purely of a humanitarian nature and directly linked to the witness protection programme and that no money had been given to PERSON to bribe him to give evidence .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgments . It noted that the testimony given by PERSON constituted the central evidence in the case and that it was of decisive importance whether his statements could be considered reliable enough to convict the co - defendants . According to the appellate court , the other evidence relied on by the public prosecutor had by and large no independent significance but in effect only served the purpose of showing that PERSON \u2019s description of the course of events could be correct . In evaluating PERSON \u2019s statements , the court considered that , although the circumstances surrounding the delivery of those statements had to be given careful consideration , his connection with the police was of no relevance to the assessment of the reliability of his statements . Instead , in assessing their credibility and reliability , it had to be determined whether they gave the impression that the events had been experienced by PERSON himself and what weight should be given to the supporting evidence . In these respects , the court found that PERSON had given a calm and confident impression , that he had given essentially identical information on all the occasions he had been heard and that there was no indication that PERSON had any reason falsely to blame the suspects . It also considered that another prisoner , heard on appeal but not at first instance , had given information which supported PERSON \u2019s account . The latter was further supported by the location of the blood stains found in the prison training facilities . Moreover , the shape of the handles of the knives found in the sauna and the traces of blood discovered on the knives pointed towards the applicant \u2019s involvement in the crime . In conclusion , the appellate court found that PERSON \u2019s statements in all essential details were supported by the other evidence in the case and that they were in no essential details contradicted by any piece of evidence . The court considered that the supporting evidence was of considerable weight . However , no part of the appellate court \u2019s reasoning was based on the evidence given by the policeman whose testimony had been allowed by the decision of DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( H\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused leave to appeal against the appellate court \u2019s judgment .", "The third suspect of the murder in question was apprehended and convicted in DATE . In this case , ORG allowed the public prosecutor to invoke as evidence the reading of a transcript of the statement given by the anonymous witness in DATE .", "By a decision of DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , upon the applicant \u2019s complaints , criticised the preliminary investigation in the applicant \u2019s case in several respects . He made the following concluding remarks :", "\u201c In [ the present case ] , which concerns a preliminary investigation of a murder , several issues of great importance for the protection of the suspect \u2019s legal rights [ r\u00e4ttss\u00e4kerhet ] during a preliminary investigation have arisen . These issues concern , inter alia , the suspect \u2019s right to defence counsel , the procedure for hearing witnesses before a court during the preliminary investigation , the public prosecutor \u2019s presentation of the investigation material at the detention hearing and the possibility for the prosecutor to arrest a suspect anew following a court \u2019s quashing of a detention order concerning that suspect .", "The inquiry shows that the public prosecutor in charge of the preliminary investigation failed to forward to the court the suspect \u2019s wish that defence counsel be appointed for him . A person who is suspected of a crime in respect of which is stipulated a sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment has , under LAW , an unconditional right to have appointed defence counsel upon request . If defence counsel is to be appointed for the suspect , the person in charge of the preliminary investigation is under a duty to notify the court thereof . The right to defence counsel is of fundamental importance for the protection of the suspect \u2019s legal rights and , accordingly , there are reasons to severely criticise the responsible public prosecutor on account of her failure in this respect .", "An issue of great principal interest in the case concerns the possibility to hear before a court a witness whose identity is not known to CARDINAL of the parties . At the public prosecutor \u2019s request , during the preliminary investigation a hearing for the taking of evidence was held before a court at which a witness relied on by the prosecutor was examined without his identity and appearance being disclosed to the defence counsel present . It appears , furthermore , that the suspects had not been summoned to the hearing .", "As has been set out in greater detail in the present decision , the use of anonymous testimony before a court is not allowed under NORP law , whether or not the witness is heard at or outside the main hearing in the case . The idea of allowing anonymous testimony in criminal cases has been rejected on several occasions by ORG authorities as well as by various committees , referring to the protection of the legal rights of the defendant . The fact that ORG has stated that the use of anonymous testimony is not in all situations contradictory to the LAW is therefore of no relevance in this connection . Moreover , it is not possible under the law to refrain from summoning a suspect to a taking of evidence of the kind at issue . Accordingly , there are reasons to criticise the public prosecutor as well as the judge on account of the procedure applied in regard to the taking of evidence .", "Furthermore , the facts of the case have occasioned me to stress the importance of the public prosecutor familiarising him- or herself with the investigation material before a detention hearing in a way which enables him or her to present all the circumstances that may be of importance for the court \u2019s decision on the detention issue .", "Finally , it may be questioned whether , following ORG decision to quash the detention order , there were really such new circumstances which could justify the public prosecutor \u2019s action of immediately taking a new decision to arrest .", "Thus , to sum up , it has been established that the handling of the preliminary investigation has been deficient in several respects of central importance to the protection of the individual \u2019s legal rights . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
