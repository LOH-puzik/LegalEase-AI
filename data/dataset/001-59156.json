The applicants are gypsies by birth . As children , the applicants lived and travelled with their respective families in and around the area known as GPE in GPE . From DATE , the LOC was a designated area pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicants married . When the second applicant became pregnant , the applicants decided to search for a permanent site on which to site their caravan . There remained few stopping places upon which they could lawfully park their caravan whilst travelling in the area and they faced the threat of continual eviction . The applicants wished for their children to be brought up in a stable environment which would facilitate the continuity of their education . The applicants now have CARDINAL children , PERSON born in DATE , PERSON in DATE , Jessica in DATE and PERSON in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants stated that they were refused a place on any local authorised site . They camped outside one official site for DATE hoping to be offered a plot . No place was offered and court proceedings were brought against them by the LOC to secure their eviction from the land . The Government stated that the LOC has no knowledge or record of any request by the applicants for a pitch in DATE .", "CARDINAL . With the imminent birth of their first child , the applicants moved into the caravan occupied by the first applicant \u2019s mother on a permitted gypsy site and sold their own caravan . The caravan was however small and conditions became intolerable . Having nowhere else to go , the applicants in or DATE reluctantly applied for permanent accommodation and accepted the offer of a council flat . They commenced a tenancy in a fourth floor flat on DATE . Though they were moved to a first floor flat after DATE , they found the flats totally unsuitable and alien to their traditional gypsy lifestyle . On DATE , they requested a transfer to a house on the grounds of the second applicant \u2019s health but were informed that there was a waiting list and that a move would be conditional on payment of outstanding rent . The applicants disputed that they owed any rent and suggested that the GPE has mistaken them for the tenants of a different flat , there being some confusion as to the addresses involved . In DATE , the applicants requested a site on an official caravan site or more suitable accommodation but were told this was not possible . The ORG stated that they did not wish to be placed on the waiting list .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicants purchased land known as ORG in NORP , GPE and moved onto it , living in a caravan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the second applicant made a retrospective planning application for permission to station a caravan on their site . Permission was refused by the GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an enforcement notice was issued requiring discontinuance of the unauthorised use .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicants were convicted for failure to comply with the enforcement notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a public enquiry was held by way of appeal against the refusal of planning permission . The appeal was dismissed . The Inspector accepted that the applicants were gypsies for whom conventional residence in permanent accommodation would lead to illness and problems of adjustment . They had therefore not lost their status as gypsies as a result of their residence in a flat . He found however that the development on a site , well outside built - up areas , was clearly visible and would constitute a significant intrusion into the attractive rural surroundings and seriously harm the character and appearance of the countryside contrary to the aims of the local development plans . The proximity of another established gypsy site a short distance along the same road was a further consideration for rejecting the application , since there would be a cumulative effect . Though there were hedges and trees providing partial screening , these would have less effect in the DATE and the site was still a significant intrusion in the landscape . While he expressed his concern for the serious consequences of a refusal for the applicants and their CARDINAL children , since they had nowhere to live for the foreseeable future apart perhaps from unauthorised camping sites , he concluded :", "\u201c It is all a matter of weighing opposing considerations , and although both national and local policies envisage circumstances where the special needs of gypsies can outweigh the general objective of protecting the countryside , my view is that , because of such factors as the quality of this countryside , they do not prevail here . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants made a further application for planning permission which was refused on DATE , seeking inter alia to argue that they had resited the caravan and provided more screening to minimise any visual impact on the landscape and that their site was less harmful than the CARDINAL poorly screened sites nearby which were authorised by the LOC .", "CARDINAL . A public enquiry was held before a Planning Inspector on DATE . The ORG refused their appeal on DATE and the applicants were penalised in costs on the basis that it was identical to the previous application . The Inspector did not find the granting of permission for caravans for CARDINAL gypsy families CARDINAL metres away along the same road could be regarded as a material difference .", "\u201c On the contrary , in my opinion CARDINAL gypsy caravan sites within QUANTITY of the length of FAC would amount to an overconcentration of caravan sites in these rural surroundings . \u201d", "The Inspector went on :", "\u201c CARDINAL . As to \u2026 alleged intentional homelessness , Counsel for GPE , on instructions , assured the inquiry that the < applicants\u2019 > family would be offered short - term housing . This is the position the family have faced for a long time . < The applicants > conceded that the only action taken since the DATE decision by or on behalf of the family to find another site or accommodation , was a telephone call \u2026 to GPE > in DATE . \u2026", "CARDINAL . I have given sympathetic consideration to all of < the applicants > case . I accept that the family have a pressing local need for a caravan site . The provision of private sites should be encouraged . ORG support the provision of private sites . So does Government policy . There should be a flexible attitude to such planning applications . As was said in a Parliamentary answer in DATE , well - run gypsy sites , once established , seldom give cause for serious complaints . \u2018 Designated\u2019 authorities like GPE may still need to make extra provision in their area if the demand for gypsy accommodation increases . There are still gypsy families parked on unauthorised sites in LOC , including < the applicants > \u2026 No new gypsy sites have been opened in GPE since DATE .", "CARDINAL . In spite of < the applicants > planting and intended further planting , however , I find as a fact that the mobile home would remain intrusively visible from FAC and PERSON lane . The only way in which it could be made virtually invisible , \u2026 , would be to provide physical screening which would in itself be an intrusive feature in the countryside . From the point of view of passers - by , the visual impact of the mobile home is made especially serious because of this being a corner site , with CARDINAL long road frontages through which the site can be seen by the public . Having regard to the quality of the rural landscape , I consider that this development seriously damages the appearance and character of the surroundings . As this land is between the CARDINAL authorised sites , this development results in an incipient loose ribbon of suburban - type development strung out along FAC . This conflicts with generally well - respected policies aimed at protecting the landscape and at limiting residential development mainly to towns and villages .", "CARDINAL . Whilst the position towards the eastern corner is an improvement on the previous siting in the northern corner , the mobile home still causes demonstrable harm to countryside interests of acknowledged importance . There is nowhere within the site at which a mobile home or caravan could be positioned without causing equally serious harm .", "CARDINAL . I have taken into account the extent to which this site could satisfy the site - selection criteria \u2026 Rather than introducing minimum conflict with planning policies , this development is in serious conflict with the Structure Plan policies \u2026 aimed as protecting the character of the open countryside from development not demonstrated to be necessary for agriculture etc . There is also serious conflict with Policy CCARDINAL of the draft ORG , aimed at ensuring that permitted gypsy sites should not be intrusive features in the countryside . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants were convicted for breach of enforcement notices and ordered to pay GBP CARDINAL each as a fine and contribute GBP CARDINAL to the LOC \u2019s costs .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the ORG stated that the applicants made enquiries from the LOC about rehousing but no formal application was made until DATE . On DATE , the applicants were formally informed by the Borough that they were considered as intentionally homeless since they had terminated their council tenancy to move onto land not permitted for residential use contrary to the advice of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicants enquired about alternative accommodation on a private site but were informed that they were excluded due to the size of their family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants stated that they were told that there was a waiting list for places on official sites but that since they were intentionally homeless they could not put their names on it for DATE . According to the Government , in DATE , the applicants applied to the Borough for housing on the grounds of homelessness and that contrary to the policy of refusing registration within DATE after a finding of intentional homelessness the GPE agreed to re - register them as homeless on condition that they paid their arrears of rent for the council tenancy . The applicants did not pay the arrears .", "CARDINAL . The records of the LOC noted that , at a meeting on DATE , its officials repeated offers of temporary accommodation to give the applicants time to find permanent accommodation . The applicants were recorded as stating that they would not accept a place on an official site and that they would only accept temporary accommodation in their own caravan , which the Borough could not provide . The applicants state that they have no recollection of making the former statement .", "CARDINAL . A third prosecution resulted in conviction and sentence was deferred to enable the applicants to move . On DATE , a fine of GBP CARDINAL was imposed on each applicant .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON took the decision to seek an injunction in the High Court restraining the applicants from stationing their caravan on their land and gave notice to the applicants . On DATE , the applicants left their land and travelled to GPE , GPE close to where some of the second applicant \u2019s family had stationed their caravans . On the site there was no sanitation or electricity and there was an infestation of rats . The applicants contacted the GPE \u2019s housing officer in the hope that he could offer more suitable alternative accommodation but he could not . He suggested that they apply for ORG accommodation which they did but were told that nothing would be available for DATE . The applicants heard nothing after that . The ORG stated that the applicants\u2019 names were placed on the waiting list at DATE but they removed their names from that list in DATE . The applicants disputed that they removed their names .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants returned to their land , where the children could resume their education at their previous school .", "CARDINAL . The LOC commenced its proceedings for an injunction by summons dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the second applicant was convicted and fined for a continued breach of the enforcement notices .", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied for judicial review to quash the injunction proceedings on the basis that the decision to pursue the injunction against them was unreasonable . Leave was refused by ORG . On DATE , ORG dismissed the ORG appeal .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants applied to the GPE for accommodation and were again offered temporary accommodation . The applicants stated that this was unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation which would have entailed separating the first applicant from the rest of the family . The applicants were informed , the Government stated , of vacant plots on council and private gypsy sites in the county . The applicants recalled that these vacancies related to areas outside the LOC . CARDINAL site which they visited at ORG was infested with rats and a dangerous place for children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants received notice that the Borough had decided to withdraw the injunction proceedings commenced in DATE and to enter their land and enforce the enforcement notice using its powers under section CARDINAL of ORG DATE . The applicants lodged an application for judicial review of that decision . On or DATE the applicants withdrew their application on the basis that they would be given DATE to vacate their land .", "CARDINAL . The applicants stated that they looked for an alternative private or official site on which to station their caravan but no such site could be found . In DATE , the applicants sold their land . They also sold their caravan at a substantial undervalue . They went to live temporarily in the caravan occupied by the second applicant \u2019s brother , which involved a family of CARDINAL sharing with a family of CARDINAL . This became intolerable . The applicants stated that they were faced with the choice of returning to the road , with the risk of further criminal sanctions or abandoning their traditional way of life by accepting the provision of conventional NORP accommodation . On DATE , the applicants reluctantly decided to take the latter course , moving into conventional housing in the form of rented accommodation supplied by ORG CARDINAL FAC , GPE , GPE . As a result , their CARDINAL younger children had to change schools . The CARDINAL older children gave up school and began working . While the move disrupted the children \u2019s education , it did not appear to have affected their health . The applicants suffered headaches , anxiety , claustrophobia and depression requiring them to seek medical treatment . They were both prescribed medication which did not however resolve their physical sense of confinement . The applicants bought a touring caravan , which they stationed on the land of the second applicant \u2019s brother . They took every opportunity they could to travel in the traditional style during school holidays , attending traditional gypsy fairs to continue horse trading activities and for the first applicant to find work landscaping and tree - felling . They have bought another plot of land in GPE , PERSON , with the intention of resuming their traditional life and intend to apply for planning permission .", "CARDINAL . ORG statistics for gypsy caravan sites for DATE indicated that in the GPE area there were CARDINAL local authority sites comprising CARDINAL pitches . In addition , there were CARDINAL caravans on authorised private sites and CARDINAL caravans on unauthorised sites , CARDINAL of which were tolerated by the local authority . The DATE gypsy count showed that the number of unauthorised encampments had remained at CARDINAL , while the number of public authorised sites had decreased from CARDINAL to CARDINAL and the number of authorised private sites had decreased from CARDINAL . The DATE figures showed that there were CARDINAL unauthorised sites , CARDINAL authorised public sites and CARDINAL authorised private sites .", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE ( as amended by LAW DATE ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) consolidated pre - existing planning law . It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development ( ORG v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and GPE [ DATE ] ORG Law CARDINAL ; PERSON v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority , which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise ( section CARDINALA of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of ORG in the event of a refusal of permission ( section CARDINAL ) . With immaterial exceptions , the Secretary of ORG must , if either the appellant or the authority so desire , give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of ORG . It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence ( see the PERSON the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . There is a further appeal to ORG on the ground that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision was not within the powers conferred by LAW , or that the relevant requirements of LAW were not complied with ( section FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission , the local authority may issue an \u201c enforcement notice \u201d if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of ORG on the grounds , inter alia , that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question ( section CARDINAL ) . As with the appeal against refusal of permission , the Secretary of ORG must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector .", "CARDINAL . Again there is a further right of appeal \u201c on a point of law \u201d to ORG against a decision of the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review . It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . ORG will also grant a remedy if the inspector \u2019s decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact ; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors ; or made for an improper purpose , in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument . However , the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision - making authority .", "CARDINAL . Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice , the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Part II of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to gypsies as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in DATE , in particular the closure of commons carried out by local authorities pursuant to section CARDINAL of GPE and ORG DATE . LAW of LAW defined \u201c gypsies \u201d as :", "\u201c persons of nomadic habit of life , whatever their race or origin , but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen , or of persons engaged in travelling circuses , travelling together as such \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The Secretary of ORG could direct local authorities to provide caravan sites where it appeared to him to be necessary ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Where the Secretary of ORG was satisfied either that a local authority had made adequate provision for the accommodation of GPE , or that it was not necessary or expedient to make such provision , he could \u201c designate \u201d that district or county ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . The effect of designation was to make it an offence for any gypsy to station a caravan within the designated area with the intention of living in it for any period of time on the highway , on any other unoccupied land or on any occupied land without the consent of the occupier ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition , LAW gave to local authorities within designated areas power to apply to a GPE court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By DATE it had become apparent that the rate of site provision under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act was inadequate , and that unauthorised encampments were leading to a number of social problems . In DATE , therefore , the Government asked Sir PERSON to carry out a study into the operation of LAW . He reported in DATE ( Accommodation for Gypsies : A report on the working of GPE DATE , \u201c the Cripps Report \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Sir PERSON estimated that there were CARDINAL NORP living in GPE and GPE .

The report made numerous recommendations for improving this situation .", "CARDINAL . Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL was issued by ORG . Its stated purpose was to provide local authorities with guidance on \u201c statutory procedures , alternative forms of gypsy accommodation and practical points about site provision and management \u201d . It was intended to apply until such time as more final action could be taken on the recommendations of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Among other advice , it encouraged local authorities to enable self - help by gypsies through the adoption of a \u201c sympathetic and flexible approach to [ Gypsies\u2019 ] applications for planning permission and site licences \u201d . Making express reference to cases where gypsies had bought a plot of land and stationed caravans on it only to find that planning permission was not forthcoming , it recommended that in such cases enforcement action not be taken until alternative sites were available in the area .", "CARDINAL . Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which was issued on DATE , stated , inter alia , that \u201c it would be to everyone \u2019s advantage if as many gypsies as possible were enabled to find their own accommodation \u201d , and thus advised local authorities that \u201c the special need to accommodate gypsies ... should be taken into account as a material consideration in reaching planning decisions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In addition , MONEY was spent under a scheme by which MONEY grants were made available to local authorities to cover the costs of creating gypsy sites .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of ORG LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which came into force on DATE , repealed sections CARDINAL of LAW and the grant scheme referred to above .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act gives to a local authority power to direct an unauthorised camper to move . An unauthorised camper is defined as", "\u201c a person for the time being residing in a vehicle on any land forming part of the highway , any other unoccupied land or any occupied land without the owner \u2019s consent \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Failure to comply with such a direction as soon as practicable , or re - entry upon the land within DATE , is a criminal offence . Local authorities are able to apply to a GPE court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of such a direction ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . In the case of NORP v. ORG , ex parte Atkinson ( DATE ) , PERSON referred to the DATE Act as \u201c Draconic \u201d legislation . He commented that :", "\u201c For DATE the commons of GPE provided lawful stopping places for people whose way of life was or had become nomadic . Enough common land had survived DATE of enclosure to make this way of life still sustainable , but by s.CARDINAL of ORG and ORG DATE local authorities were given the power to close the commons to travellers . This they proceeded to do with great energy , but made no use of the concomitant powers given them by s.CARDINAL of the same Act to open caravan sites to compensate for the closure of the commons . By DATE , therefore ORG legislated to make the s.CARDINAL power a duty , resting in rural areas upon county councils rather than district councils \u2026 For DATE there followed a history of non - compliance with the duties imposed by the Act of DATE , marked by a series of decisions of this court holding local authorities to be in breach of their statutory duty , to apparently little practical effect . The default powers vested in central government to which the court was required to defer , were rarely , if ever used .", "The culmination of the tensions underlying the history of non - compliance was the enactment of \u2026 the Act of DATE \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . New guidance on gypsy sites and planning , in the light of LAW , was issued to local authorities by the Government in Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( DATE ) , which cancelled ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see above ) .", "Councils were told that :", "\u201c In order to encourage private site provision , local planning authorities should offer advice and practical help with planning procedures to gypsies who wish to acquire their own land for development . ... The aim should be as far as possible to help gypsies to help themselves , to allow them to secure the kind of sites they require and thus help avoid breaches of planning control . \u201d ( para . CARDINAL )", "However :", "\u201c As with other planning applications , proposals for gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land - use factors . Whilst gypsy sites might be acceptable in some rural locations , the granting of permission must be consistent with agricultural , archaeological , countryside , environmental , and LOC policies ... \u201d ( para . CARDINAL ) .", "It was indicated that as a rule it would not be appropriate to make provision for gypsy sites in areas of open land where development was severely restricted , for example Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty , Sites of Special Scientific Interest . Nor were gypsy sites regarded as being among those uses of land normally appropriate in a Green Belt ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Further guidance issued by the Secretary of ORG dated DATE concerned the unauthorised camping by gypsies and the power to give a direction to leave the land ( LOC above ) . Paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL required local authorities to adopt \u201c a policy of toleration towards unauthorised gypsy encampments \u201d :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Where gypsies are camped unlawfully on council land and are not causing a level of nuisance which can not be effectively controlled , an immediate forced eviction might result in unauthorised camping on a site elsewhere in the area which could give rise to greater nuisance . Accordingly , authorities should consider tolerating PERSON presence on the land for short periods and could examine the ways of minimising the level of nuisance on such tolerated sites , for example by providing basic services for gypsies e.g. toilets , a skip for refuse and a supply of drinking water .", "CARDINAL . Where gypsies are unlawfully camped on Government - owned land , it is for the local authority , with the agreement of the land - owning ORG , to take any necessary steps to ensure that the encampment does not constitute a hazard to public health . It will continue to be the policy of the Secretaries of ORG that Government Departments should act in conformity with the advice that gypsies should not be moved unnecessarily from unauthorised encampments when they are causing no nuisance .", "CARDINAL . The Secretaries of ORG continue to consider that local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly . They should use their powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraphs CARDINAL further require local authorities to consider their obligations under other legislation before taking any decisions under LAW . These obligations include their duties concerning pregnant women and newly - born children , the welfare and education of children and the housing of homeless persons . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( NORP v. ORG , ex parte Atkinson , NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE and NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE , unreported ) , ORG held that it would be an error of law for any local authority to ignore those duties which must be considered from the earliest stages .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG drew to the attention of all local planning authorities in GPE that Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL required local planning authorities to assess the need for gypsy accommodation in their areas and make suitable locational and/or criteria based policies against which to decide planning applications . The Government was concerned that this guidance had not been taken up . ORG research ( see below ) had showed that PERCENT of local authorities ( CARDINAL ) had no policy at all on gypsy sites and that many in the process of reviewing their plans at the time of the survey did not feel it necessary to include policies on gypsy provision . It was emphasised that it was important to include consideration of gypsy needs at an early stage in drawing up structure and development plans and the detailed policies should be provided . Compliance with this guidance was essential in fulfilling the ORG \u2019s objective that gypsies should seek to provide their own accommodation , applying for planning permission like everyone else . It was necessary , therefore , that adequate gypsy site provision be made in development plans to facilitate this process .", "CARDINAL . ORG for ORG and Other Travellers ( ACERT ) , which carried out research sponsored by ORG , noted in this report that since DATE private site provision had increased by CARDINAL caravans per year while the pace of public site provision had declined by CARDINAL caravans , disclosing that the pace of private site provision had not increased sufficiently to counterbalance decreases in public site provision . Noting the increase of gypsies in housing and the increased enforcement powers under LAW , it questioned , if these trends continued , the extent to which the ethnic , cultural and linguistic identity of ORG people would be protected .", "CARDINAL . The research looked , inter alia , at CARDINAL refused private site applications , which showed that PERCENT related to land within the countryside and that PERCENT were refused on grounds relating to the amenity value ( e.g. Green Belt , conservation area locations ) . Of the CARDINAL gypsy site applicants interviewed , for most acquiring permission for their own land was an important factor in improving the quality of life , gaining independence and providing security . For many , the education of their children was another important reason for private site application . All save CARDINAL had applied for permission retrospectively .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report stated that the figures for success rates in CARDINAL planning appeals showed that before DATE the success rate had averaged PERCENT but had decreased since . Having regard however to the way in which data was recorded , the actual success rate was probably PERCENT as given as the figures in DATE and DATE by the gypsy groups and ORG respectively . Notwithstanding the objectives of planning policy that local authorities make provision for gypsies , most local authorities did not identify any areas of land as suitable for potential development by gypsies and reached planning decisions on the basis of land - use criteria in the particular case . It was therefore not surprising that most gypsies made retrospective applications and that they had little success in identifying land on which local authority would permit development . Granting of permission for private sites remained haphazard and unpredictable .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG figures on gypsy caravans disclosed that of CARDINAL caravans counted , CARDINAL were accommodated on local authority pitches , CARDINAL on privately owned sites and CARDINAL on unauthorised sites . Of the latter , CARDINAL gypsy caravans were being tolerated on land owned by non - gypsies ( mainly local authority land ) and CARDINAL gypsy caravans tolerated on land owned by gypsies themselves . On these figures , CARDINAL caravans were therefore on unauthorised and untolerated sites while over PERCENT of caravans were stationed on authorised sites .", "DATE . Local authority duties to the homeless were contained in Part VII of LAW , which came fully into force on DATE . Where the local housing authority was satisfied that an applicant was homeless , eligible for assistance , had a priority need ( e.g. the applicant was a person with whom dependant children resided or was vulnerable due to old age , physical disability , etc . ) , and did not become homeless intentionally , the authority was required , if it did not refer the application to another housing authority , to secure that accommodation was available for occupation by the applicant for a minimum period of DATE .
