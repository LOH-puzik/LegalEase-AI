The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the course of a fight between CARDINAL groups of youths , the applicant \u2019s son ( hereinafter \u201c A \u201d ) , aged DATE , was fatally shot by an off - duty police officer ( hereinafter \u201c B \u201d ) , who had apparently attempted to assist his own brother as one of the participants in the said incident .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date thereafter ORG ( PERSON javno tu\u017eila\u0161tvo ) in GPE charged B with murder , as well as a number of other persons for several related crimes .", "CARDINAL . The decision to institute a formal judicial investigation ( re\u0161enje o sprovo\u0111enju istrage ) was adopted on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , however , the charges against B were dropped , and on CARDINAL DATE the investigating judge ( istra\u017eni sudija ) of ORG ( Okru\u017eni sud ) in GPE decided to terminate the proceedings against him ( obustavi istragu ) .", "CARDINAL . During the said investigation the defendants had all been heard in person , as had several witnesses , including A \u2019s own brother . The investigating judge had further obtained relevant medical and ballistics reports , as well as other expert testimony . The autopsy report had also been produced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an indictment ( optu\u017enica ) against B with ORG , and thus took over the prosecution of the case in the capacity of a \u201c subsidiary prosecutor \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted B , stating that he had acted in self - defence .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE CARDINAL hearings had been held before FAC . The applicant and numerous witnesses , as well as medical and ballistics experts , had all been heard , and a re - construction of the events in question had been carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) quashed the judgment of DATE and ordered that the case be re - examined at first instance . In so doing , it described ORG reasoning as incoherent and noted that its establishment of the facts and its assessment of evidence had been fundamentally flawed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again acquitted B , re - affirming that he had acted in self - defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment . It noted that the said court \u2019s reasoning had almost exclusively taken into account the evidence in favour of B , having ignored or misrepresented the rest . ORG was thus ordered to thoroughly review the case and re - assess the evidence . ORG received ORG decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing before ORG was scheduled for DATE , but was subsequently cancelled by the court itself because it had , apparently , been unable to secure the proper composition of its bench .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adjourned the hearing because of the inability of B \u2019s lawyer to appear in court due to a prior professional commitment .", "CARDINAL . Following an additional adjournment on DATE , a new hearing was set for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again adjourned the hearing , this time because it had been informed that B , still an active police officer , had been sent , as a member of the NORP contingent , to take part in the LOC Nations\u2019 mission in GPE . The decision of ORG ( ORG unutra\u0161njih poslova ) issued in this respect , on CARDINAL DATE , stated that B \u2019s posting would last for DATE , but that it could be extended . ORG scheduled the next hearing for DATE , which was apparently when B was supposed to briefly visit GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , however , the applicant was informed that the next hearing would instead be held \u201c on DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant thereafter went physically to ORG registry and was told that the upcoming hearing was still scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant therefore appeared before ORG , but was informed by the presiding judge that the hearing had been set for DATE . The judge ultimately accepted to schedule a new hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , however , the applicant received the ORG decision of DATE , declaring that the proceedings had been terminated due to the applicant \u2019s failure to appear before the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained about this decision , and on DATE ORG re - instituted the proceedings in question .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE a total of CARDINAL hearings were adjourned by ORG , the reasons for this being : ( i ) B \u2019s failure to appear in court ( on CARDINAL occasions ) ; ( ii ) the presiding judge \u2019s wish to withdraw from the case in view of the applicant \u2019s complaints against him ( once ) ; and ( iii ) the inability of B \u2019s lawyer to appear in court as a result of a traffic accident ( twice ) .", "CARDINAL . By DATE ORG had held another CARDINAL and adjourned another QUANTITY hearings . Specifically , the hearings of DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE had been held , during which B and a number of witnesses had been re - heard , whilst the hearings of DATE and DATE had been adjourned due to B \u2019s failure to appear in court and the presiding judge \u2019s absence , respectively .", "CARDINAL .

In respect of crimes subject to prosecution ex officio , including murder , the authorised prosecutor is the public prosecutor personally . The latter \u2019s authority to decide whether to press charges , however , is bound by the principle of legality which requires that he must act whenever there is a reasonable suspicion that a crime subject to prosecution ex officio has been committed .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that should the public prosecutor decide that there is no basis to prosecute , he must inform the victim of this decision , who shall then have the right to take over the prosecution of the case on his own behalf , in the capacity of a \u201c subsidiary prosecutor \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
