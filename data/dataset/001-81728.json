The applicants are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP Prime Minister made an official visit to GPE and gave a reception on the occasion of GPE \u2019s national day , which commemorates the CARDINAL ORG when the transfer of hitherto NORP GPE to GPE was declared .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Prime Minister decided to attend the reception and made that intention public DATE before the event .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were of the opinion that the NORP Prime Minister should refrain from attending the reception , given ORG negative significance in NORP history . Therefore , they decided to organise a demonstration in front of ORG in GPE where the reception was to be held . They did not inform the police of their intentions .", "CARDINAL . In TIME DATE , CARDINAL people , including the applicants , assembled in front of the hotel . The police were also present . There was a loud noise , whereupon the police decided to disband the assembly , considering that it constituted a risk to the security of the reception . The police forced the demonstrators back to a park next to the hotel where , after a while , they dispersed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sought judicial review of the action of the police and requested ORG to declare it unlawful . They asserted that the demonstration had been totally peaceful and its only aim had been to express their opinion . Moreover , the applicants pointed out that it had obviously been impossible to inform the police about the assembly DATE in advance , as required by PERSON no . III of DATE on the right of assembly ( the \u201c LAW \u201d ) , because the Prime Minister had only announced his intention to attend the reception DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 action . Concerning the circumstances of the event , it noted that the demonstration had been disbanded after a minor detonation was heard .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that the DATE time - limit for informing the police of a planned assembly could not possibly be observed if the demonstration had its roots in an event that had occurred DATE beforehand . In the court \u2019s view , the possible shortcomings of LAW could not be remedied by the courts . Therefore , the duty to inform the police about such meetings applied to every type of demonstration , including spontaneous ones . The court also noted that there might be a need for more precise and sophisticated regulations in respect of such events but said that this was a task for the legislator , not the courts .", "CARDINAL . The court also found that the duty to inform the police in advance about assemblies held in public served to protect the public interest and the rights of others , namely , the free flow of traffic and the right to freedom of movement . It observed that the organisers of the demonstration had not even attempted to notify the police . ORG went on to say :", "\u201c ... under the relevant provisions of the domestic law in force , the fact that an assembly is peaceful is not by itself enough to dispense with the duty to inform the police . ... The court has not dealt with the issue whether or not the assembly was peaceful , since the lack of notification made it illegal per se and , therefore , the defendant dissolved it lawfully , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance decision . It amended part of ORG reasoning , omitting the remarks concerning the possible shortcomings of the relevant domestic law . Moreover , ORG found , referring , inter alia , to the case - law of the ORG and decision no . LAW . ( ORG . CARDINAL . ) of ORG :", "\u201c ... in the application of the relevant domestic law , the approach is obviously authoritative in that there is no exemption from the duty of notification and , therefore , no difference between \u2018 ORG assemblies and \u2018 spontaneous\u2019 ones \u2013 the latter are unlawful owing to the failure to respect the above - mentioned duty of notification . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In sum , ORG found that the restrictions imposed on the applicants were necessary and proportionate .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a petition for review which ORG dismissed on DATE , without examining its merits , since it was incompatible ratione materiae with the relevant provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW guarantees the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and secures its free exercise .", "CARDINAL .
