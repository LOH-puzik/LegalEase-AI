In the course of this questioning , he was informed that , following the statements made by witness PERSON , there was a strong suspicion that in DATE he had kept CARDINAL kg of cocaine for a Mr A.C. , that he had aided and abetted the drug - trafficking offences committed by the latter and that he had sold QUANTITY of cocaine to the witness PERSON The applicant thereupon explained how he had met PERSON and that he had known about his involvement in drug - trafficking . He also made statements on the involvement of third persons in drug - trafficking . He denied the accusations made by the witness Mr K.", "CARDINAL . Still on DATE he was brought before a detention judge ( LOC ) at FAC ( ORG ) who , after hearing the applicant , issued a warrant for his arrest ( Haftbefehl ) .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant was orally informed of the content of the arrest warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s defence counsel applied to ORG ) for access to the criminal files . ORG supplied the defence counsel copies of the applicant \u2019s statements to the police authorities and the detention judge , of the record of the search of the applicant \u2019s LOC , as well as of the arrest warrant . As regards the other documents contained in the files , counsel \u2019s request was dismissed , pursuant to LAW ) , on the ground that such consultation would endanger the purpose of the on - going investigations .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant chose PERSON as his new defence counsel and he repeated the request on DATE . He also applied for a review of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand ( GPE ) . Thereupon , on CARDINAL DATE ORG forwarded a copy of the investigation file concerning detention matters , which at that time comprised a single volume , to FAC .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG considered that ORG statements were particularly detailed and conclusive . Neither the applicant nor his counsel were given access to the record of PERSON \u2019s questioning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal ( Beschwerde ) against that decision .

On DATE ORG ( GPE ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s further appeal ( weitere Beschwerde ) against the decision of DATE . According to ORG , the oral information provided to the applicant on the statements of witness PERSON had been sufficient for him to be in a position effectively to defend himself . In so far as the applicant had invoked LAW and the PERSON judgment of ORG , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s case was different in that access to the files was not wholly excluded , but only to the extent that legitimate public interests in an effective prosecution of offenders required such measures . ORG confirmed the existence of a risk of collusion . ORG based its decision on the contents of a copy of the files which had been prepared by ORG for the purposes of the appeal proceedings and had been sent to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint ( ORG ) with ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) . Furthermore , counsel requested that the incriminating passages of the statements made by witness PERSON should be read out or otherwise be made known to him by ORG . According to a file note of CARDINAL DATE , ORG was not prepared to grant full access to the files as the records on the questioning of witness PERSON contained information on further suspects and other investigation proceedings where arrest or search warrants had not yet been executed .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG informed applicant \u2019s counsel that there were no longer any reasons to refuse full inspection of the files , and ORG was also informed of that fact .

The applicant \u2019s lawyer was granted access to the file on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to entertain the constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of aiding and abetting drug - trafficking in respect of the storage of QUANTITY and QUANTITY of cocaine and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The time he had spent in detention on remand was counted towards the sentence . The judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) concern the arrest and detention of a person on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence . According to LAW a person may be detained on remand if there is a strong suspicion that he or she has committed a criminal offence and if there is a reason for arrest , such as the risk of absconding or the risk of collusion . LAW regulates the suspension of the execution of an arrest warrant .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , remand prisoners can ask any time for judicial review of the arrest warrant . An oral hearing will be held upon the request of the remand prisoner , or if the court so decides on its own motion ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . If the arrest warrant is held to be valid following an oral hearing , the remand prisoner is entitled to a new oral hearing only if the detention has lasted for DATE altogether and if DATE have elapsed since the last oral hearing ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Article ORG provides that an arrest warrant has to be quashed if reasons justifying the detention on remand no longer persist or if the continued detention appears disproportionate . Any prolongation of detention on remand beyond DATE is to be decided by ORG ( Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure concern the defence of a person charged with having committed a criminal offence , in particular the choice of defence counsel or appointment of official defence counsel . According to LAW , defence counsel is entitled to consult the files , which have been presented to the trial court , or which would have to be presented to the trial court in case of an indictment , and to inspect the exhibits . LAW of this provision allows for a refusal of access to part or all of the files or to the exhibits , for as long as the preliminary investigation has not been terminated , if the purpose of the investigation would otherwise be endangered . Pending the preliminary investigation , it is for ORG to decide whether to grant access to the file or not ; thereafter it is for the president of the trial court ( LAW ) . By an LAW amending LAW ( Strafverfahrens\u00e4nderungsgesetz , BGBl . DATE , I , p. CARDINAL ) with effect as from DATE , the latter provision has been amended to the effect , inter alia , that an accused who is in detention is now entitled to ask for judicial review of the decision of ORG denying access to the file .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure regulate the principles of criminal prosecution and the preparation of the indictment . Article CARDINAL provides that any trial has to be initiated by an indictment . According to LAW is to be preferred by ORG which is , unless otherwise provided , bound to investigate any criminal offence of which there exist sufficient grounds for suspicion .", "CARDINAL . Preliminary investigations are to be conducted by ORG according to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure . On the basis of these investigations ORG decides under LAW whether to prefer an indictment or to discontinue the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , every person involved in proceedings before a court is entitled to be heard by that court ( PERSON auf rechtliches PERSON ) .", "According to ORG ( ORG - gericht ) , this rule requires a court decision to be based only on those facts and evidential findings which could be commented upon by the parties . In cases involving arrest and detention on remand , the arrest warrant and all court decisions upholding it must be founded only on those facts and pieces of evidence of which the accused was previously aware and on which he was able to comment ( ORG , decision of DATE ( ORG DATE , ORG ) , with further references ) .", "In the aforementioned decision , ORG held that , following his arrest , an accused had to be informed of the content of the arrest warrant and promptly brought before a judge who , when questioning him , had to inform him of all relevant incriminating evidence as well as of evidence in his favour . Moreover , in the course of ensuing review proceedings , the accused must be heard and , to the extent that the investigation will not be prejudiced , the relevant results of the investigation at that stage must be put to him . In some cases , such oral information may not be sufficient . If the facts and the evidence forming the basis of a decision in detention matters can not or can no longer be communicated orally , other means of informing the accused , such as a right to consult the files ( PERSON ) , are to be used . On the other hand , statutory limitations on an accused \u2019s access to the files pending the preliminary investigation are to be accepted , if the efficient conduct of criminal investigations so requires . However , even pending those investigations , an accused who is detained on remand has a right of access to the files through his lawyer if and to the extent that the information which they contain might affect his position in the review proceedings and that oral information is not sufficient . If in such cases the prosecution refuses access to the relevant parts of the files pursuant to LAW , the reviewing court can not base its decision on those facts and evidence and , if necessary , has to set the arrest warrant aside ( ORG , loc . cit . ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
