He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "On DATE the applicant distributed pamphlets to passers - by near gynaecologist PERSON medical practice . The front page contained inter alia the following text :", "\u201c Stop unlawful abortions in Dr. PERSON \u2019s medical practice \u201d ( PERSON in der Praxis Dr. PERSON \u201c )", "indicating the physician \u2019s full name and address . It further contained the following sentences :", "\u201c Did you know that unlawful abortions are performed in ORG in Dr. PERSON \u2019s practice ? \u201d ( \u201e Wussten Sie schon , dass in H. in der Praxis von Dr. PERSON rechtswidrige Abtreibungen durchgef\u00fchrt werden ? \u201d )", "The verso contained the sentence :", "\u201c Please support our struggle against the unpunished killing of unborn children \u201d ( \u201c PERSON , helfen sie uns i m PERSON gegen die straflose GPE ungeborener PERSON . \u201d )", "PERSON , who performed abortions in accordance with the legal conditions laid down in LAW \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see relevant domestic law , below ) , raised an action for an injunction . He alleged that the applicant \u2019s statement was incorrect , as he performed abortions exclusively within the legal framework . On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) , by way of an interim injunction , ordered the applicant to desist from further asserting or disseminating the allegation that Dr. PERSON performed unlawful abortions ( rechtswidrige ORG ) . This interim injunction was confirmed by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) on DATE .", "The applicant alleged that the impugned statement was correct . Relying on ORG case - law , he pointed out that abortions which were performed under LAW CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL following obligatory counselling , but without medical indication as required by LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL , where unjustified and thus unlawful . He further asserted that his statement was covered by his right to freedom of expression .", "On DATE ORG confirmed the injunction in the main proceedings . Basing its decision on Article CARDINAL in conjunction with Article CARDINAL of LAW , that court considered that the applicant \u2019s statement , seen from the point of view of an unbiased and knowledgeable public , contained the allegation that the abortions were performed outside the legal conditions of LAW CARDINALa of LAW and were thus subject to criminal prosecution . It could not be expected from the average reader to draw the distinction between the act of abortion which was justified under LAW CARDINALa LAW and the act of abortion which was merely exempt from prosecution under LAW CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . Seen from a layman \u2019s point of view , only those acts of abortions were considered \u201c unlawful \u201d which did not comply with either of the prerequisites laid down in LAW CARDINALa of LAW .", "The applicant could not rely on the allegation that the impugned statement was true . Having regard to the fact that the pamphlet was not addressed to lawyers , but to laypersons , it was not decisive whether the statement was true from a strictly judicial point of view .", "ORG did not find it necessary to establish whether the impugned statement had to be regarded as a statement of facts or whether it also contained a value judgment . In any event , the physician \u2019s interest in the protection of his personality rights prevailed over the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression . ORG conceded that the impugned statement could be regarded as a contribution to the debate on questions of public interest which merited special protection under the right to freedom of expression . However , in the present case the infringement on the physician \u2019s personality rights was so severe that it prevailed over the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression . The statement did not only concern his professional , but also his personal reputation . On the other hand , the applicant could have easily clarified that the abortions performed by the physician were not subject to criminal liability . ORG finally noted that the physician , who had not actively participated in the public debate on abortion , had not given him any reason to attack him as a private person .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . That court confirmed ORG finding that the applicant \u2019s statement , seen from the point of view of an \u201c average reader \u201d , contained the accusation that the doctor performed abortions without respecting the legal provisions . Further to ORG findings , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s statements were suited adversely to affect the physician \u2019s professional activities by deterring potential clients .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) refused to allow the applicant \u2019s appeal . That court did not consider it necessary to establish whether the interpretation given to the applicant \u2019s statement by the lower courts had been correct . In any event , the applicant had singled out the physician , who had been performing his professional activities within the legal framework , and had produced a \u201c pillory effect \u201d ( \u201c Prangerwirkung \u201d ) . The entailing violation of the physician \u2019s personality rights was so severe that the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression had to cede .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to accept the applicant \u2019s complaint for adjudication . That court considered that the interpretation attributed to the applicant \u2019s statement by ORG and ORG was not necessarily the only possible one . It noted that ORG had considered in a similar case that the impugned statement did not contain the allegation that the abortions performed were subject to criminal liability . Even accepting the statement \u2019s ambiguity , ORG considered that the interpretation given by the domestic courts was to be taken into account . The relevant passages read as follows :", "\u201c In contrast to the examination of penal or civil law sanctions for a statement which has already been made , when a claim for an injunction to desist from uttering an ambiguous statement in the future is examined , the court has to chose among several possible interpretations the one which violates [ the plaintiff \u2019s ] personality rights or , if this is the case with several interpretations , the one which more seriously violates personality rights . In the present case , this is the interpretation given by the civil courts , and not the interpretation favoured by the complainant with reference to ORG decision , according to which the statement referred to the distinction between criminal justification and exemption from criminal liability of different kinds of abortions under LAW .", "The complainant \u2019s right to freedom of expression is not violated by the request to clarify the content of his statement with regard to further dissemination in order to avoid a conviction to desist from uttering the statement and in the interest of the plaintiff \u2019s personality rights . There are no indications that the applicant could not reasonably be expected to clarify that the abortions performed in PERSON practice are not subject to criminal liability by using unambiguous words also on the pamphlet \u2019s front page . \u201d", "ORG further confirmed the civil court \u2019s finding that the allegation that the physician performed unlawful and thus punishable abortions was untrue , as the physician undisputedly performed abortions within the legal framework . The court further considered that the civil courts had correctly weighed the conflicting interests , that is to say the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression and the physician \u2019s personality rights . With regard to the scope of the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c The impugned decisions can not be understood as preventing the complainant from publicly militating against the exemption from criminal liability and against the performance of abortions and from employing polemic or exaggerated terms . The present case concerned statements which were directed against CARDINAL single person and infringed that person \u2019s personality rights . It follows that that the physician \u2019s interests , insofar as they were in conflict with the right to freedom of expression , had to be taken into account . \u201d", "ORG further considered that there was no objection from a constitutional point of view against taking into account a so - called \u201c pillory effect \u201d derived from singling out CARDINAL person , as long as the courts adequately weighed the conflicting interests . ORG observed that the plaintiff had been identified by his full name and address as a person performing unlawful acts . This constituted a serious violation of his personality rights . Furthermore , the plaintiff had not given the applicant any reason to single him out .", "This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant walked up and down the street in front of Dr. PERSON \u2019s medical practice , carrying a poster with the text \u201c abortion kills unborn children \u201d ( \u201c QUANTITY ungeborene NORP \u201d ) on the front and \u201c You shall not kill . Also applies to doctors \u201d ( \u201c Du sollst nicht t\u00f6ten . Gilt auch f\u00fcr GPE \u201d ) on the back . He also addressed passers - by and the physician \u2019s presumed patients .", "Dr. PERSON lodged a request for an injunction with ORG , alleging that the applicant \u2019s behaviour unsettled and deterred his patients and thus seriously disturbed the proper functioning of his medical practice .", "On DATE ORG , basing its decision on Article CARDINAL in conjunction with Article CARDINAL of LAW , ordered the applicant to desist from addressing patients and passers - by in a specified area in front of Dr. PERSON \u2019s medical practice and from pointing out that Dr. PERSON performed abortions .", "ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s behaviours disturbed the physician in the performance of his professional activities , which were protected as part of his personality rights . Insofar as the applicant relied on his right to freedom of expression , a fair balance had to be struck between the conflicting interests .", "ORG observed that the applicant , by addressing presumed patients in the area of the physician \u2019s practice and by drawing public attention to the latter \u2019s activities , considerably disturbed the very sensitive relationship between the physician and his patients . This could not only lead to economical disadvantages , but also damaged the physician \u2019s reputation .", "ORG further considered that the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression entitled him publicly to criticise physicians performing abortions . However , the means the applicant employed in order to express his criticism in the direct vicinity of this specific physician \u2019s premises exceeded the acceptable limit . The financial losses the physician had to envisage as a result of the applicant \u2019s behaviour were disproportionate .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG confirmed that the applicant \u2019s behaviour was likely to deter the physician \u2019s current and potential future patients . While conceding that the applicant had the right publicly to criticise the performance of abortions , the means employed by him had been disproportionate . ORG further considered that Dr. PERSON , who had not called for any public attention , had been singled out by the applicant in order to exemplify a general problem , thus producing a \u201c pillory effect \u201d . ORG further considered that the applicant had acted with the intention to disturb the physician \u2019s relationship to his patients and to cause financial damage .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant leave to lodge an appeal on points of law .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . That court confirmed ORG finding that , under the circumstances of this particular case , the physician \u2019s personality rights prevailed over the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression . Further to ORG considerations , ORG pointed out that the physician \u2019s activities were lawful and enjoyed protection under the constitutional right to freedom to exercise his profession . In this context , the court emphasised the important role which the legislator had attributed to the gynaecologists both in the protection of the unborn life and in the protection of the health of the women concerned . It was essential that the relationship of trust between the physician and his patients was not disturbed by the intrusion of external parties . The applicant \u2019s actions adversely affected the plaintiff \u2019s activities in an unacceptable way .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication as being ill - founded , as it did not find fault with ORG decision . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "The relevant provisions of the criminal code read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "Abortion", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Whosoever terminates a pregnancy shall be liable to imprisonment of not DATE or a fine . Acts the effects of which occur before the conclusion of the nidation shall not be deemed to be an abortion within the meaning of this law .", "( CARDINAL ) In especially serious cases the penalty shall be imprisonment from DATE . An especially serious case typically occurs if the offender acts against the will of the pregnant woman ; or through gross negligence causes a risk of death or serious injury to the pregnant woman .", "( CARDINAL ) If the act is committed by the pregnant woman the penalty shall be imprisonment of not DATE or a fine .", "( CARDINAL ) The attempt shall be punishable . The pregnant woman shall not be liable for attempt . \u201d", "Section CARDINALa", "Exception to liability for abortion", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The offence under LAW shall not be deemed fulfilled if", "the pregnant woman requests the termination of the pregnancy and demonstrates to the physician by certificate pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) CARDINALnd sentence that she obtained counselling DATE before the operation ; the termination of the pregnancy is performed by a physician ; and not more than DATE have elapsed since conception .", "( CARDINAL ) The termination of pregnancy performed by a physician with the consent of the pregnant woman shall not be unlawful if , considering the present and future living conditions of the pregnant woman , the termination of the pregnancy is medically necessary to avert a danger to the life or the danger of grave injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman and if the danger can not reasonably be averted in another way from her point of view . \u201d", "ORG , in its leading judgment ( BVerfGE CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) , accepted in the end abortions being performed by physicians after the pregnant woman having obtained counsel by a third person , and developed a rather singular approach by qualifying certain acts of abortion as unlawful , but not punishable . Abortions which are performed without the establishment of a medical indication must not be treated as being justified ( not unlawful ) ( ORG , die ohne ORG nach der GPE vorgenommen werden , d\u00fcrfen nicht f\u00fcr gerechtfertigt ( nicht rechtswidrig ) erkl\u00e4rt werden ) .
