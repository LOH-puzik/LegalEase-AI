The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a journalist at the regional DATE PERSON which is published in GPE . In CARDINAL articles published in DATE and DATE she described the allegedly unprofessional behaviour of an unnamed surgeon , \u201c X \u201d , which allegedly had caused the death of a patient in ORG on DATE . The patient 's top rib had been pressing on her artery , thereby hampering the blood flow in her left arm which would occasionally go numb . The surgery had consisted of shortening the top rib by QUANTITY . Complications had arisen after the rib had been shortened and the patient was established to have died from the bursting of her subclavian vein and the blood flow into her pleural cavity .", "CARDINAL . The patient 's widower , PERSON , had filed a criminal complaint against X and another surgeon who had assisted during the operation . ORG ( terveydenhuollon oikeusturvakeskus , r\u00e4ttsskyddscentralen f\u00f6r h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rden ) had not found it possible to establish at what stage of her operation PERSON had suffered the injury leading to her death . Consequently , no causal link could be established between the injury and the conduct of either of the CARDINAL surgeons .", "CARDINAL . ORG had conducted a pre - trial investigation into the death . In DATE ORG had decided not to press charges against X , as there was no evidence that he was guilty either of an offence in office caused by negligence or of involuntary manslaughter . The prosecutor had reasoned , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... From the point of view of criminal law it must be examined whether the subclavian vein burst as a result of conduct of which someone may be held guilty and whether errors were committed during the after - care . ... The [ expert ] opinions have not found that the subclavian vein burst as a result of maltreatment or negligence attributable to [ X ] or the other operating surgeon . ... [ The pre - trial record contains ] a number of statements concerning [ X 's ] possible alcohol consumption . ... In respect of DATE of the operation the information is contradictory . ... Therefore there is insufficient evidence to find that [ X ] was under the influence of alcohol while operating on PERSON and that such influence affected his ability to carry out his duties . ... Nor has it been possible to determine whether [ X 's ] shaking hands impacted in any significant way on the conduct of his surgery . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It contained interviews with the Chief Physician of ORG and a Chief PERSON of ORG and discussed the need for surgeons and pilots to be sober and also otherwise in an appropriate condition in order to perform their tasks . The article made no reference to the previous article , nor did it mention PERSON or PERSON or X", "CARDINAL . A third article by the applicant \u2013 published on DATE was entitled \u201c The case of PERSON did teach us something \u201d ( PERSON tapaus sent\u00e4\u00e4n opetti ) and made reference to her article of DATE . It read , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c [ The article of DATE ] raised the question of patient safety : how was it possible that a relatively young woman in good shape died from routine surgery . The pre - trial records speak , among other things , of the wrong form of collegiality . ... \u201d", "Under the subheadings \u201c We were concerned for our patients \u201d and \u201c Complications arose after the surgeries \u201d the article cited CARDINAL extracts from statements by hospital staff heard during the pre - trial investigation . The extracts read , inter alia as follows :", "\u201c ' Surgeon X has been the specialist doctor on the ward for DATE . Soon after he came to work here alcohol - related problems occurred . Often he had a visible hangover , which showed in his not being neatly dressed , in his reddish and swollen face , in his shaking hands and in his breath which smelled freshly of alcohol . '", "' We were concerned for the patients on whom surgeon PERSON was operating . The DATE TIME were the worst , when [ his ] hands were also shaking the most . We would inform the other doctors on the ward of our observations , mainly Dr Y and PERSON In particular before a more important surgery we would ask another doctor to attend it . On many occasions Dr Y and Dr Z would attend because we had so requested . '", "' The patients operated on by surgeon PERSON have suffered from more post - operative complications .

I even tried to have one of the CARDINAL other doctors stay behind after the round but they had already gone off to the coffee room . '", "... The pre - trial record gives the impression that the memory of either of the CARDINAL [ surgeons ] is failing . Even the ORG Injuries arrive[d ] at the conclusion that no one [ could ] be considered guilty , though , sadly , the patient died . Judging from [ an X - ray ] picture , the piece of bone [ osteophyte ] which remained inside [ Mrs Haapalainen ] after the operation was at any rate so sharp that it could have been fatal in itself even at a later stage . ... \u201d", "The article of DATE then continued with statements by chief physicians and chief surgeons of CARDINAL central university hospitals , essentially reassuring the reader that a surgeon who was drunk , ill or just tired would not be allowed to operate .", "Finally , the article contained a statement by the Chief Physician of the Sein\u00e4joki Hospital \u201c who at the time took a rather humane , even though strict approach \u201d :", "\u201c When more serious problems started occurring in surgeon PERSON 's work , we established another parallel position for a surgeon specialised in the same field , and things started working well .

In the article of CARDINAL DATE she had defamed X \u201c without better knowledge \u201d ( ei vastoin parempaa tietoa , icke emot b\u00e4ttre vetande ) . In the article of DATE she had defamed X \u201c despite better knowledge \u201d ( vastoin parempaa tietoa , emot b\u00e4ttre vetande ) , that is to say by imputing an offence to him whilst knowing that he had not committed CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The editor - in - chief of PERSON , PERSON , was charged with negligent abuse of the freedom of the press ( painovapauden tuottamuksellinen v\u00e4\u00e4rink\u00e4ytt\u00f6 , v\u00e5llande till missbruk av yttrandefriheten ) within the meaning of section DATE of the Freedom of LAW ( painovapauslaki , tryckfrihetslag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The prosecution argued that , regardless of the fact that he had become aware of the possibility that the applicant 's article of DATE might have defamed X and of the fact that the applicant was intending to write a further article , he had failed to supervise the publication of the applicant 's article of CARDINAL DATE by demanding that the article be approved by him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant denied both charges , arguing that X could not have been identified on the basis of her articles and that she had not even been aware of his identity when writing her first article . That article had concentrated on describing PERSON feelings as the surviving widower , whereas the article of DATE had discussed patient safety . She had quoted from official documents and her articles had not forced X to close his private practice , as alleged by him .", "PERSON also denied the charges against him , stating inter alia that after the first article had been published he had offered to publish a response by X. No such response had been forthcoming . The articles had been based on various sources and official documents accessible to the public . Moreover , the press was entitled to deal with the activities of a public hospital and patient security within such institutions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , relying on chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( rikoslaki , strafflag ) as in force at the relevant time , convicted the applicant of defamation committed \u201c despite better knowledge \u201d and by using a printed matter ( painotuotteen kautta vastoin parempaa tietoa tehty herjaus , sm\u00e4delse genom tryckalster emot b\u00e4ttre vetande ) . The conviction was grounded only on her article of DATE , whereas she was acquitted of defamation committed \u201c without better knowledge \u201d by means of her article of CARDINAL DATE . She was sentenced to CARDINAL DATE income - based fines at the rate of MONEY ( ORG ) ( corresponding to CARDINAL ( EUR ) ) , totalling ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

The defendants were ordered to reimburse jointly a witness fee in the amount of ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) as well as the complainant 's legal costs in the amount of FIM CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In examining the charges against the applicant as based on her article of DATE , ORG took note of the banner headline and picture texts as well as of a third statement appearing in the text and which found it strange that nobody had intervened to prevent the surgeon from conducting the operation , even though everyone must have seen in what condition he was . The last - mentioned statement and the picture text had to be understood as having been expressed by PERSON . The article had contained an allegation that the surgeon had been drunk or had been suffering from a hangover while operating on PERSON and that this had led to her death , without specifying in any detail why .", "ORG further found that as the article of DATE had contained a statement to the effect that the surgeon had been prohibited from conducting further operations , it had given the reader the impression that he or she had been punished for some sort of breach of official duties .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the article of CARDINAL DATE , ORG noted that it had contained a reference to the first one and had asked how it was possible that a relatively young woman in good physical condition could die as a result of a routine surgery . The article had then cited statements from the pre - trial record which had discussed the surgeon 's alcohol problem and the attitude of hospitals to that problem generally . Moreover , although ORG had been of the opinion that no one could be considered guilty of PERSON death , the osteophyte which had remained in her body after the operation could have been fatal at any later stage .", "The article of DATE had given the reader the impression that the surgeon had been drunk or had been suffering from a hangover while operating on PERSON . The final statement in that DATE to the effect that \u201c surgeon PERSON was now doing fine \u201d \u2013 strengthened the impression that his or her alcohol problem had been acute at the time of the operation in question . Even though the article 's reference to a sharp osteophyte had been somewhat misleading in light of ORG opinion , this article had not taken any position as to the cause of PERSON death .", "ORG further found that even though X could not have been identified on the basis of the first article , the article of CARDINAL DATE did render him identifiable to his potential clients in the ORG area .", "CARDINAL . Considering the fact that the articles had been published in a DATE with an interval of DATE between them , the applicant 's possible guilt had to be determined in respect of each of the articles . Her first article had been based solely on information provided by PERSON , although already then she had been aware both that a police investigation had been conducted into the suspected maltreatment and that the public prosecutor had decided not to bring charges against the operating surgeon . Subsequently , but before writing her article of DATE , she had obtained from the office of ORG the complete pre - trial investigation record , the opinion of ORG and ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . In elaborating on the applicant 's possible guilt the court reasoned as follows :", "\u201c The court acknowledges the freedom of the press to report critically on hospitals and , among other issues , on any alcohol abuse that might have been established in such an institution . A critical reviewer must nevertheless bear in mind that his or her statements may amount to criminal defamation . The readership has the right to expect that the facts forming the basis of an article have been verified and that any erroneous piece of information has been corrected . The persons dealt with in the articles are entitled to demand that they be based on correct facts and a person who has been criticised must be given the right to respond . These principles are also to be found in the ethical guidelines adopted within the [ journalistic ] profession .", "PERSON conduct does not meet the aforementioned criteria . The surgery performed by [ X ] has been carefully scrutinised without any error [ on his part ] having been established . Regardless of this , PERSON article [ of DATE ] contains a groundless allegation that the surgeon conducted an operation in a drunken state or while suffering from a hangover .", "When writing her article [ of DATE ] PERSON had become aware that it was capable of subjecting the surgeon who had operated PERSON to contempt and of damaging his livelihood .", "The article [ of DATE ] contains many direct quotations from the pre - trial record ... which had been made public \u2013 in particular from the statements of a nurse . The court does not find that this renders PERSON conduct less reprehensible . The large pre - trial investigation material contains elements pro and contra and in the overall assessment , for example in ORG reasons , the statements of the nurse in question have not been given any weight . PERSON selected only those elements that supported her [ own ] opinion without clearly stating that ORG had provided a reasoned opinion and that ORG had made a reasoned decision not to bring charges . In ORG view the statements of the nurse arguably could have been used in an article discussing , at a general level , the alcohol problems existing in hospitals . In the article now in question the nurse 's statements have been reported together with the death of PERSON .", "In ORG precedent no . DATE II CARDINAL the defendants were convicted of defamation for not having checked the veracity of information contained in a circular before dispatching it .", "ORG finds that PERSON had no reasonable cause to believe that the allegations contained in the article [ of DATE ] were true . [ She ] could and should have verified the facts of the story . [ Her ] negligence in this respect is attributable to her as an intentional offence . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tt ) , after a re - hearing , found the applicant guilty of continued defamation \u201c despite better knowledge \u201d and by using a printed matter . Her sentence was increased to CARDINAL DATE fines , totalling FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) . PERSON was likewise found guilty of negligent abuse of the freedom of the press and his sentence was increased to CARDINAL DATE fines , totalling ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court considered that the allegation against ORG which had appeared in the articles had been particularly serious , had defamed his honour fundamentally and had diminished his social status and professional prospects . The articles had been visibly published in a mass medium , where they had been given much print space . In light of the general sentencing practice , the defendants ' conduct as well as the nature and seriousness of the defaming statement , the sentences inflicted by ORG had been too lenient .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court considered that the applicant 's articles had been so linked together , both by their substance and by the local circumstances they had dealt with , that the CARDINAL alleged forms of defamation had to be considered as CARDINAL single act . The court reasoned , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c PERSON and PERSON have argued that the subject of patient safety which had been discussed , in particular , in the article of DATE is such an important issue in society that the press must be entitled to express even strong criticism without being prevented from doing so by the criminal law provisions on defamation . [ They ] have further argued that they had strong and plausible grounds for believing that the information published in the articles had been truthful .", "Public health care is a societal issue of such magnitude as to entitle the press to express criticism . Given his position as a practising surgeon in a public hospital , [ X 's ] activities were of such public - office nature that he had to accept even strong criticism of his behaviour . That criticism nevertheless had to be appropriate and based on facts . A mass medium may not always be able to obtain a confirmation of the absolute veracity of information to be published . The information to be published must at any rate be sufficiently grounded and all negative allegations or allegations directed against a specific person which may be defamatory when published , must be examined critically . Confirmation of the veracity of the allegations should as far as possible be sought from CARDINAL source . The more serious and hurtful the criticism , the stronger the duty to have the truthfulness of information confirmed .", "...", "The information gleaned from the interview with PERSON and the elements selected from the pre - trial investigation record , all of which supported the view that [ X 's ] conduct had been reprehensible , was not such reliable information as to provide PERSON with sufficient grounds for the allegations contained in her article of DATE and for the tone thereof . In addition , PERSON has conceded that at the time of writing that article she had been aware of the conclusion reached by ORG in its opinion as well as of the fact that [ X ] had not been charged . PERSON nonetheless failed to verify in detail the terms of [ the ORG 's ] opinion as well as of the outcome of the pre - trial investigation , even though that could easily have been done . In these circumstances PERSON must be found to have accused , in the articles of DATE and DATE , a person identifiable as [ X ] of an offence as well as of reprehensible conduct , without having verified the allegations and without having had any objectively weighty grounds or likely reasons for considering the defamatory allegations truthful .", "[ X ] was not given the possibility of presenting his views in respect of either article . ...", "... Even though [ X ] was not named in the articles , the information stated therein was so detailed that [ he ] could nevertheless be recognised as the surgeon whom the articles had concerned . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused PERSON and PERSON leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman ( eduskunnan apulaisoikeusasiamies , riksdagens bitr\u00e4dande justitieombudsman ) responded to a petition by PERSON .

He had been prohibited from conducting surgeries until DATE , when he had been found capable of resuming his work as a surgeon .", "As for ORG decision not to press charges against X the Deputy ORG found that a conclusion to the contrary would have been more justified as suspicions concerning gross maltreatment should preferably be examined by a court of law . She stated that this was not tantamount to a finding that ORG had overstepped his margin of discretion in breach of the law or his duties . In any case the legal successors of PERSON had enjoyed an independent right to bring private prosecution proceedings . The case had been investigated as suspected manslaughter , for which any criminal proceedings had been time - barred already by the time of the petition .
