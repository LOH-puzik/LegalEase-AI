The witnesses stated that the second applicant had not been subjected to any threats or pressure .

DATE and DATE CARDINAL orders not to open a criminal investigation into the second applicant 's complaints of harassment were issued , each time being quashed by the supervising prosecutor .

The detention centre in GPE , where the first applicant was detained , received extensive attention from various human - rights institutions , including ORG for ORG ( ORG ) , following allegations of severe ill - treatment of detainees . On DATE the head of the ORG delegation , Mr GPE , issued a statement to the NORP officials at the end of the visit to the NORP region of GPE . The statement said , inter alia , in relation to the visit to PERSON :", "\u201c ... the information gathered by the delegation strongly indicates that many persons detained at GPE were physically ill - treated in the establishment during DATE to DATE . In different locations , the delegation has interviewed individually and in private a considerable number of persons who were held at GPE during that period . A clear pattern of physical ill - treatment of prisoners by custodial staff emerged . The ill - treatment alleged consisted essentially of kicks , punches and truncheon blows to various parts of the body ( excluding the face ) . The ill - treatment was said to have been inflicted principally in the central corridor of the detention facility , usually when prisoners were taken to an investigator 's room for questioning or when they were returned to their cells after such questioning ; apparently , prisoners were also on occasion physically ill - treated in the investigators ' rooms . Investigators were said to have been fully aware of the ill - treatment being inflicted , and some prisoners affirmed that it was inflicted at their instigation . In certain cases , the delegation has gathered medical evidence which is consistent with the allegations of ill - treatment made by the prisoners concerned . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a public statement concerning GPE , under LAW of LAW or Punishment .

Ever since DATE , the ORG has been urging the NORP authorities to carry out a thorough and independent inquiry into events at this detention facility during that period . To date , an inquiry of the kind requested by the ORG has not been carried out and the NORP authorities have now made it clear that they have no intention of organising such an inquiry . A particularly disturbing aspect of the NORP authorities ' current position is their contention that no facilities intended for accommodating detainees were established by public authorities in the area of GPE during the period referred to by the ORG .", "It is an indisputable fact that a detention facility operated at GPE during DATE to DATE , prior to the formal setting up in that village of a pre - trial establishment ( GPE no . CARDINAL ) by a Ministry of Justice Order dated DATE . The ORG 's delegation interviewed many persons who stated that they had been held in a detention facility at GPE during that period . Numerous NORP officials ( prosecutors , investigators , custodial staff ) met by the delegation confirmed that the establishment designated as from DATE as ORG no . CARDINAL had prior to that date been used as a detention facility . The ORG is in possession of a copy of the medical journal of the establishment covering DATE to CARDINAL DATE , in which DATE by day arrival of detainees ( and any injuries they bore ) was recorded ; the staff who completed that journal referred to the establishment first as an ' ORG ' ( temporary detention facility ) and at a later stage as a ' temporary reception and distribution centre ' . The NORP authorities have themselves , in earlier correspondence , provided to the ORG written statements signed by officers attesting to the fact that they worked in the detention facility during DATE to DATE as well as written statements signed by persons who certified that they were held at GPE during that period .", "The NORP authorities ' contention that no detention facilities were established by public authorities at GPE during the period in question ( and that , as a result , an inquiry of the kind requested can serve no purpose ) is clearly untenable and constitutes a failure to cooperate with the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a second public statement in relation to GPE . It was prompted by allegations of continued recourse to torture and other forms of ill - treatment by members of the law - enforcement agencies and federal forces operating in GPE .
