On CARDINAL DATE the municipal police of PERSON ( PERSON ) detained him on the public highway shortly after he had torn down some small ornamental flags erected in connection with a f\u00eate organised by a political party . The police , who had intervened at the request of CARDINAL of the organisers , took him to the police station because he did not have any identity papers with him and , according to their version of events , because he had to be protected against the hostility of the participants . On this occasion he wounded CARDINAL of the police officers .", "On DATE the carabinieri , who had also intervened on DATE , submitted a report on the incident to ORG . On DATE Mr Brozicek sent a letter , in LANGUAGE , to the Police Chief ( questore ) of GPE , which was subsequently transmitted to ORG , who ordered its translation into NORP on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG opened an investigation and on DATE sent to the applicant - by registered letter requiring acknowledgment of receipt and bearing the address of the applicant 's then residence in GPE - a \" judicial notification \" ( comunicazione giudiziaria ; see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . It informed him that proceedings had been instituted against him for the offences of resisting the police and assault and wounding ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . In addition , it invited him to appoint a defence lawyer of his choice and informed him that if he failed to do so PERSON , avvocato , would be appointed by the authorities .", "On DATE Mr Brozicek returned the document to ORG with the following note ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" I return the enclosed document to the sender as I find it difficult to understand . In lodging my detailed complaint of CARDINAL DATE - on which no action has yet been taken even though the facts complained of could have far - reaching consequences - and in all correspondence to date with the NORP authorities , I have always expressly requested that either the mother tongue of the persons concerned or CARDINAL of the international official languages of ORG be used , in order to avoid from the outset any risk of misunderstanding . \"", "ORG received this letter on DATE . It did not send any reply and did not have the letter translated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent to the applicant by registered letter requiring acknowledgment of receipt a second \" judicial notification \" . In addition to the information contained in the first notification , it asked the applicant to provide an address for service in GPE ( Article CARDINAL bis of LAW ) .", "On DATE the NORP postal authorities returned the letter to the sender marked \" unclaimed \" .", "The acknowledgment of receipt bore the name \" Brozicek \" , in a different space to that provided for the addressee 's signature . The Government maintained that it was the applicant 's signature but he has always denied this ; he claimed that he had not received the communication because he had just moved house . The expert opinion ordered by ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) did not resolve this question .", "CARDINAL . By an order ( decreto ) of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated that it had not been possible to notify the applicant and that \" further enquiries at the place of birth and place of last residence \" had not produced any result . He appointed a defence lawyer and directed that all the documents for notification to the accused during the investigation should thereafter be lodged at the secretariat of ORG .", "At the hearing before ORG on CARDINAL DATE , the ORG affirmed that the reference to further enquiries was probably an oversight . They maintained that the provision applied to the applicant was the second part of the second paragraph of LAW ( concerning an accused who has given no address for service , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which does not require such enquiries .", "ORG summonsed PERSON to appear for examination on DATE , but to no avail , and , on DATE , he asked the President of ORG to commit the applicant for trial .", "CARDINAL . The trial was set down for DATE but when the time came the proceedings had to be adjourned because the date of the hearing had not been notified to the accused .", "On DATE the President of ORG decided that any notification would be lodged with the court registry because the accused had not provided an address for service in GPE ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL bis of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He also appointed a lawyer to represent the accused .", "After an adjournment for reasons extraneous to the proceedings , the trial took place on DATE .", "On that date the applicant was convicted in absentia , sentenced to DATE imprisonment and ordered to pay the costs . The sentence was , however , suspended and no reference to the conviction was to be included in criminal - record certificates issued at the request of private individuals .", "CARDINAL . This decision too was notified to the applicant by being lodged at the court registry because , still pursuant to LAW , the president of the court had again noted , on DATE , that ORG had not provided an address for service in GPE .", "As there was no appeal , the judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant received a letter from ORG at ORG ( ORG ) . The letter informed him of his conviction by judgment of the PERSON court of DATE , which had become final on DATE , and that the conviction had been entered in the NORP criminal records ( LAW , Bundeszentralregistergesetz ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE lodged an application with the Commission , stating , inter alia , that \" the possibilities for appealing [ were ] manifestly time - barred under NORP law ... \" . On DATE he also wrote to ORG and ORG .", "In his letter to ORG he requested its assistance in securing , as soon as possible , the rectification or the annulment of the PERSON judgment .", "In his letter to ORG he claimed that he had not received any information in his own language on the trial and had been unable to defend himself because neither the indictment nor the judgment had been notified to him . He asked what possibilities of appealing against the decision were open to him .", "On DATE the NORP Ministry replied that he could lodge an appeal against the judgment outside the normal time - limits ( hereinafter referred to as a \" late appeal \" ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , if the notification to him had not been lawfully made , and seek a retrial .", "The applicant did not avail himself of either of these possibilities .", "CARDINAL . ORG instructed ORG to determine whether there was any possibility of appealing against the judgment of DATE . As the first result of its communications with the PERSON court , the ORG forwarded to the applicant , on DATE , a photocopy of the NORP text of the judgment , which was for the most part handwritten . PERSON acknowledged receipt of this text by a letter dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . A judicial notification is the document by which the judicial authorities inform the person suspected of having committed an offence that an investigation has been opened and invite him to appoint a defence lawyer of his choice and to provide an address for service . It must specify the legal provisions infringed and the date of the alleged offence .", "CARDINAL . The investigating judge , in the event of a \" formal \" investigation , or the public prosecutor , where the investigation is \" summary \" , must send the notification at the very beginning of their investigation ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) .", "The notification must be sent by registered letter requiring acknowledgment of receipt . If the letter is not delivered because the addressee is untraceable ( irreperibile ) , a bailiff must serve the notification in accordance with the normal procedure ( Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , and pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) the ORG gave a brief description of the NORP legislation then in force as regards the notification to a person or an accused who is \" untraceable \" , trial in absentia ( contumacia ) and \" late appeal \" ( appello apparentemente tardivo ) .", "In this regard LAW provides as follows ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" Where there is precise information in the documents in the proceedings as to the place where the accused resides abroad , ORG or trial judge ( pretore ) shall send him by registered letter notification of the proceedings against him with an invitation to declare or otherwise give notice of an address for service in the place where the proceedings are conducted . This formality shall neither suspend nor delay the proceedings .", "Where the accused 's address abroad is unknown or where he has not declared or otherwise given notice of an address for service or if the information provided by him is insufficient or inadequate , the judge or the public prosecutor shall make the order ( decreto ) provided for in LAW .", "The above provisions shall not apply where the issue of an arrest warrant is mandatory . \"", "The second sub - paragraph of Article CARDINAL states that ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" The judge or the public prosecutor ... shall take a decision appointing a defence lawyer to act for the accused where he does not yet have one in the place where the proceedings are conducted and ordering that notification which has proved or proves impossible to carry out be effected by means of lodging the relevant documents at the registry of the judicial organ before which the proceedings are pending . The defence lawyer shall be informed without delay of any such notification . \"", "The possibility of lodging a \" late appeal \" was at the time derived from judicial interpretation of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , according to which ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" In the case of in absentia proceedings , an extract of the decision or judgment shall be notified to the accused who may lodge against it any appeal that would have been open to him in respect of a judgment delivered in adversarial proceedings , subject to the provisions of the third paragraph of Article CARDINAL . \"", "\" ...", "For the decisions or judgments referred to in LAW , the period within which the accused may appeal shall begin to run from the notification of the decision or judgment .", "... \"", "On the basis of these provisions the courts had consistently held that if the notification of an extract of a decision or judgment delivered in absentia was not lawful because it had been wrongly assumed that the accused did not intend to participate in the proceedings , the person concerned could , within DATE , contest such notification and challenge the finality of the decision in question . If he was successful in so doing , he was accorded a new time - limit within which to appeal against the said decision .", "The new Code of Criminal Procedure , which came into force on DATE , now makes express provision for this possibility of \" re - establishing the time - limit \" ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-a"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
