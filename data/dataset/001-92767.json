The applicant was born in DATE and is currently in prison in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sentenced by a ORG to a total of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and CARDINAL offences of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while on bail pending trial , the applicant suffered a brain haemorrhage for which he underwent surgery . On DATE he underwent further surgery . Following his discharge to prison , he required monitoring and was required to go to hospital DATE for a specialist check - up by a neuro - radiologist .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was held in a high - security prison which held Category A ( high - risk ) prisoners as well as Category B prisoners such as himself . As a result , he fell within the provisions of a general order , ORG ( PSO ) CARDINAL , which applied to all prisoners of whatever security category who were being held in a unit which held Category A prisoners ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant wished to correspond confidentially with his external medical specialist to ensure that he would receive the necessary medical treatment and supervision in prison . He expressed his concerns about his medical correspondence with his external medical specialist being read and applied to the prison governor for a direction that such correspondence should be accorded confidentiality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the governor of the prison in which the applicant was being detained agreed to the applicant \u2019s request . It was decided that the applicant \u2019s medical correspondence would not be read provided that certain conditions were met . All outgoing and incoming mail was to be marked \u201c medical in confidence \u201d . Outgoing correspondence would be checked to ensure that it was being sent to a nominated address and incoming mail was to be marked with a distinctive stamp of the relevant health authority .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prison governor subsequently reconsidered his decision after seeking advice from ORG . On DATE the prison governor informed the applicant that he had been advised that it was necessary to examine his medical correspondence for illicit enclosures . All correspondence between the applicant and his external medical specialist would be directed , unopened , to the prison medical officer . The latter would examine the content of the envelope in order to ascertain its medical status and then reseal it . Incoming and outgoing correspondence would then be sent to the applicant and his external medical specialist respectively .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant contested the decision to monitor his medical correspondence . He was concerned that his attempts to confirm that he was receiving adequate treatment in hospital might be regarded by the prison medical officer as criticism and that this might inhibit his relationship with his external medical specialist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for leave to apply for judicial review of the prison governor \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the presiding High Court judge , Mr Justice PERSON , allowed the applicant \u2019s claim for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . ORG had submitted , inter alia , that it would be difficult to make the necessary arrangements to permit medical correspondence to remain confidential . They argued that there were a large number of health bodies with which a prisoner might wish to correspond and that some health bodies might lack franking machines that would enable prisons to identify the authenticity of the sender .", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON concluded that there were exceptional circumstances in the applicant \u2019s case . The exceptional circumstances were said to be the life - threatening nature of the applicant \u2019s condition and his desire to ensure that his treatment in prison did not affect him adversely . The applicant , understandably , wanted to obtain reassurance from the medical specialist who was involved in treating him and from whom he required continual medical care , in the form of DATE specialist observations . Mr ORG also found that the initial decision of the prison governor to enable the applicant to correspond on a confidential basis with his external medical specialist indicated that it was reasonable to permit such confidential correspondence . The evidence of ORG as to the practical problems involved in making arrangements to enable confidential medical correspondence were not directly material in an exceptional case such as the present one .", "CARDINAL . In the circumstances , and emphasising that this was a case which turned on its own exceptional facts , Mr Justice PERSON considered it appropriate to quash the prison governor \u2019s decision of DATE . He granted the applicant a declaration that \u201c the governor of whatever prison the [ applicant ] resides [ in ] should make a decision in accordance with the principles made in light of this judgment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the appeal by the Secretary of ORG and the prison governor . Lord Justice PERSON gave the judgment of the court . It was noted that there was no dispute that the reading of ORG correspondence was governed by law , and that it was directed to the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . The issue to be decided was whether , in the language of LAW , the reading of the applicant \u2019s correspondence was proportionate . While the prison governor \u2019s initial decision to allow confidentiality to the applicant \u2019s medical correspondence with his external medical specialist strongly suggested that its exemption from LAW would be a perfectly reasonable course , the onus still remained on the applicant to establish that anything more invasive would constitute a disproportionate interference with his LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that although the procedure set out in the prison governor \u2019s letter of DATE amounted to an interference with the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his correspondence , the interference was justified and proportionate under LAW . It considered that although it was of course possible to verify the existence , address and qualifications of the applicant \u2019s external medical specialist ( whose bona fides was not in question ) , there was no way of ensuring that the latter would not be intimidated or tricked into transmitting illicit messages . While the same was true of , for example , the secretarial staff of members of parliament ( MPs ) , the importance of unimpeded correspondence with MPs outweighed the risk . By contrast , as regards correspondence with doctors , the prisoner \u2019s health was the concern and the immediate responsibility of ORG . Though it may well be the case that allowing the prison medical officer to read the prisoner \u2019s correspondence with an outside medical practitioner might lead the former to \u201c encounter criticism of his own performance \u201d , it was inherently unlikely that this would carry the same degree of risk that might attend the reading by a discipline officer of a letter of complaint to ORG . Moreover , if it related to the prisoner \u2019s well - being it was probable that the prison medical officer ought in any event to know about it .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the monitoring of the applicant \u2019s medical correspondence was a proportionate interference with his Article CARDINAL rights , although it did not exclude the possibility that in another case it might be disproportionate to refuse confidentiality to medical correspondence in the prison context . ORG based its conclusion on the following factors . Firstly , the monitoring of the applicant \u2019s medical correspondence answered legitimate and pressing policy objectives which were clearly stated in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Secondly , short of withdrawing all scrutiny , it considered that there was no less invasive measure available to the prison service . Thirdly , the reading of the applicant \u2019s medical correspondence which was limited to the prison medical officer was not in its view excessive . Fourthly , the process by which the measure had been decided upon was not found to be arbitrary . In particular , it had not been the result of the rigid application of a policy . The withdrawal of monitoring had not only been considered but had been implemented until , upon reconsideration , monitoring had been resumed . The interference in question had not denied the essence of the applicant \u2019s LAW as it related to CARDINAL correspondent only ( the external medical specialist ) and it confined the interference to a medically qualified reader ( the prison medical officer ) . It was recognised that there was an inescapable risk of abuse , for example , if the applicant \u2019s prison life or treatment was made more difficult because of what he was observed to be writing . However , the risk , having been minimised by virtue of confining surveillance to the prison medical officer , was outweighed by the above - mentioned factors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s petition for leave to appeal was refused by ORG on the ground that the petition did not raise an arguable point of law of general public importance .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since CARDINAL DATE the applicant has been located in a Category B prison in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG is responsible for the management of the prison system in GPE and GPE ( Prison Act DATE , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
