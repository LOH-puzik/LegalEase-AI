He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a member of the ORG d\u2019Etat and ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "DATE clashes occurred between NORP of NORP - Berber origin and others belonging to black NORP ethnic groups . Some servicemen from these ethnic groups , accused of mounting a coup ORG , were taken prisoner . Some of them were subjected to acts of torture or barbarity by their guards , among whom was the applicant , an intelligence officer at the PERSON army headquarters in GPE , holding the rank of lieutenant .", "On DATE an amnesty law was passed in favour of members of the armed forces and the security forces who had committed offences DATE and DATE in connection with the events giving rise to armed conflict and acts of violence . By virtue of that law , no proceedings were brought against the applicant for offences committed against prisoners .", "In DATE the applicant , who was by then captain of the NORP army , arrived in GPE for a training course at ORG .", "On DATE ORG ) and ORG ( ORG ) lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant , together with an application to join the proceedings as civil parties , for acts of torture allegedly committed by him in GPE in DATE and DATE . These criminal proceedings were based on ORG and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( hereinafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) , adopted by ORG of ORG on DATE , which was ratified by GPE and came into force on CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant was arrested on DATE .", "On DATE an investigation was begun and the applicant was charged with committing acts of torture or barbarity . He was placed in pre - trial detention until DATE , before being released on bail . The applicant absconded on an unknown date . A warrant was issued for his arrest in DATE .", "On DATE the investigating judge committed the applicant for trial on charges of committing , and aiding and abetting acts of torture and barbarity . The judge based the indictment on the witness evidence of CARDINAL former servicemen and the widow of a tenth serviceman . CARDINAL of the witnesses , who had taken refuge in GPE , had been confronted with the applicant during the investigation , while the others had provided written statements . The applicant appealed against the committal order .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG of ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal inadmissible on the ground that it had been lodged too late . The applicant appealed on points of law .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment and remitted the case to ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG of ORG upheld the order of the investigating judge and committed the applicant for trial before ORG . It found that the condition provided for in LAW was satisfied , as the acts in question had been carried out in the context of an \u201c ethnic purge \u201d and a massive campaign of repression conducted by the NORP government in power at the time , and that the applicant had acknowledged having acted in an official capacity , within the meaning of the Convention provisions , as an intelligence officer and member of the investigating committee . ORG also considered that the provisions of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW and LAW vested jurisdiction in the NORP courts to try the case , apply LANGUAGE law and override an amnesty law passed by a foreign State where application of that law would result in a breach of GPE \u2019s international obligations and render the principle of universal jurisdiction totally ineffective . As the principle of lawfulness did not preclude an offence from being defined in a treaty or an international agreement , the latter prevailing over the law , it held that while \u201c acts of torture \u201d had , since the new Criminal Code , been classified as a \u201c separate crime \u201d defined and punishable under ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL et seq . of LAW , such acts had previously constituted an aggravating circumstance in respect of certain offences , and particularly the crime of aggravated assault provided for in LAW and CARDINAL of the Criminal Code , now repealed , which was a crime punishable by \u201c CARDINAL to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment \u201d . ORG concluded that the offence with which the applicant was charged DATE which constituted a crime \u2013 was not time - barred and that the only limit in terms of punishment was that only those penalties applicable at the relevant time could be imposed , unless a more lenient criminal law had since been passed .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant , finding that ORG had justified its decision in respect of all the points raised by the applicant .", "As the applicant had absconded , a summons to appear before ORG was served at the public prosecutor \u2019s office on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the trial was held before ORG . Counsel for the accused was heard in the latter \u2019s absence .", "On DATE ORG delivered CARDINAL judgments . In the first one it sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for intentionally subjecting certain persons to acts of torture and barbarity and , in addition , causing such acts to be committed against other detainees by abuse of his official position or by giving instructions to servicemen to commit such acts . ORG referred , inter alia , to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the former Criminal Code , LAW , and to LAW . In the second judgment it awarded damages to the various civil parties .", "\u201c Any criminals , irrespective of the type of offence they have committed , who use torture or commit acts of barbarity in the execution of their crime shall be punished as being guilty of murder .", "Anyone who , in perpetrating their offence , uses torture or commits acts of barbarity shall be punished by CARDINAL to ten years\u2019 imprisonment . \u201d", "\u201c Anyone who has intentionally wounded another or committed violence or assault resulting in sickness or total unfitness for work for DATE shall be liable to between CARDINAL months\u2019 and CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and to a fine of MONEY or to CARDINAL of those penalties alone . ... \u201d", "\u201c Anyone who subjects another to torture or to acts of barbarity shall be liable to DATE imprisonment .", "The first CARDINAL paragraphs of Article CARDINAL relating to the minimum term of imprisonment shall apply to the offence provided for in the present Article . \u201d", "The circular of CARDINAL DATE , which contains commentaries on the new Criminal Code and the provisions of the LAW DATE , specifies as follows :", "\u201c [ t]he expression torture and acts of barbarity shall retain the meaning currently ascribed to it in the case - law where such acts are referred to as an aggravating circumstance . \u201d", "Both the crime instituted by the law and the former aggravating circumstance of torture or acts of barbarity presuppose the establishment of an actus reus , consisting of the commission of CARDINAL or more acts of exceptional seriousness which go beyond mere violence and cause the victim severe pain or suffering , and mens rea , consisting of the intention to deny a person their human dignity ( ORG of ORG , judgment of DATE , commentary in PERSON , DATE , p.

It also indicates that the new definition remedies substantial loopholes in the punishment of the crime by allowing not only the degree of injury suffered by the victim to be taken into account , but also the seriousness of the violent act in question , irrespective of its consequences .

Clearly , the jus cogens nature of the prohibition against torture articulates the notion that the prohibition has now become CARDINAL of the most fundamental standards of the international community . Furthermore , this prohibition is designed to produce a deterrent effect , in that it signals to all members of the international community and the individuals over whom they wield authority that the prohibition of torture is an absolute value from which nobody must deviate .", "CARDINAL . ... It would be senseless to argue , on the one hand , that on account of the jus cogens value of the prohibition against torture , treaties or customary rules providing for torture would be null and void ab initio , and then be unmindful of a ORG say , taking national measures authorising or condoning torture or absolving its perpetrators ...", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , at the individual level , that is , that of criminal liability , it would seem that CARDINAL of the consequences of the jus cogens character bestowed by the international community upon the prohibition of torture is that every ORG is entitled to investigate , prosecute and punish or extradite individuals accused of torture , who are present in a territory under its jurisdiction . ... \u201d", "Similar findings can be found in the judgments Prosecutor v.
