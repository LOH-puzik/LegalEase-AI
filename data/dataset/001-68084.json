At the material time trade unions representing public servants were formed without any specific statutory basis . Associations and trade unions were governed by CARDINAL pieces of legislation : LAW and LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) . Although there are no restrictions in LAW on written statements by trade unions , section CARDINAL refers to LAW and lays down that the provisions of that Act shall apply where LAW is silent .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants produced various judgments that had been delivered by ORG in cases concerning the activities of public - sector trade unions . These included a judgment of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) , from which it emerged that the first CARDINAL applicants had ultimately been acquitted in another case in which they had been charged with an offence under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW after reading out a statement to the press and distributing it to members of the press . In that case , ORG had followed a judgment of ORG ( without giving the reference ) in finding that a statement read out to the press drafted by ORG could not be classified as a \u201c written statement \u201d or \u201c similar publication \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG , sitting as a full court , delivered CARDINAL judgments in which it clarified the issue of whether it was foreseeable that section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW applied to written statements read out to the press by members of an association 's executive board . In its view , those subsections applied to texts which had previously been adopted and prepared for publication and dissemination . However , a statement read out to the press by an association on a particular subject was not a text that was drafted with a view to publication and dissemination , but a series of verbal comments . \u201c Dissemination \u201d , \u201c publication \u201d and similar terms could not possibly cover the situation in which the content of a speech due to be made orally was distributed among members of the press as an aid to understanding . The effect of holding otherwise \u2013 by a broad interpretation of the law , CARDINAL which , in other words , included oral statements within the scope of section DATE would be that members of an association 's executive board would be liable to penalties for any replies or explanations given in response to questions from journalists ; such a state of affairs would introduce an unlawful restriction on freedoms . In addition , the legislature had unambiguously laid down in that section that a text drafted with a view to publication could be published only once the executive board of the association had so resolved and the relevant documents had been filed with the competent authority .", "CARDINAL .
