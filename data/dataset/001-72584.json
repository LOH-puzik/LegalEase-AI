The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG . He is the owner of a property known as \u201c Humanisten CARDINAL \u201d located in the city of PERSON , in the south of GPE . On the property there is a CARDINAL - family house , which was built in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant inherited the property from his father , who died in DATE . The area where the property is located was regulated by a city plan ( stadsplan ) which , in accordance with the provisional regulations under the new FAC of DATE ( Plan- och Bygglagen , - hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) , became valid as a detailed development plan ( detaljplan ) . In order to facilitate the implementation of the detailed development plan , a more specific \u201c property plan \u201d ( fastighetsplan ) was adopted with respect to Humanisten CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s late father had applied on DATE to ORG ( byggnadsn\u00e4mnden ) of PERSON for tentative approval ( f\u00f6rhandsbesked ) of a plan to divide FAC and build a new CARDINAL - family house . The purpose of such an approval , issued LAW , section CARDINAL of GPE , was to give a property owner who was planning a building project for which the grant of a building permit was uncertain the possibility to obtain an advance assessment of whether the planned measures may be permitted at all , thereby avoiding unnecessary project work and costs . In assessing an application for a building permit made within DATE after the grant of tentative approval , ORG was bound by the determinations made in that approval .", "According to the detailed development plan in force , CARDINAL main building was allowed on the existing property plot ( the applicant \u2019s plot corresponded to his property ) . The request for tentative approval was motivated by the father \u2019s wish to build a house suited to his age , as he had difficulties in walking up and down the stairs of his current home .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG decided to postpone its reply to the request until a new detailed development plan for the area had acquired legal force , but only until DATE . Subsequently , on DATE FAC Director ( PERSON ) adopted a new detailed development plan for Humanisten CARDINAL by which a division of the property was prohibited . Accordingly , ORG , on DATE , informed the applicant that he could not expect to be granted a building permit for a new CARDINAL - family house and therefore did not give tentative approval for the project .", "CARDINAL . As the new owner of the property , the applicant appealed against both decisions to ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen , - hereinafter \u201c the Board \u201d ) of GPE , claiming that FAC Director had not been competent to adopt a new detailed development plan since the plan was contentious . He claimed that the refusal to grant tentative approval was also based on false assumptions . On DATE the ORG , which agreed with the applicant , quashed the City Building Director \u2019s decision to adopt the plan and , on DATE , quashed ORG decision and remitted the matter to ORG for a new examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant a tentative approval , referring to his father \u2019s initial application ( of DATE ) for a tentative approval of a plan to divide the plot \u2013 Humanisten DATE and to build a new CARDINAL - family house . The decision moreover referred to ORG decision ( of CARDINAL DATE ) to quash the detailed development plan and the earlier refusal of a tentative approval . Without expressing any conditions or reservations , the decision stated that the applicant could expect a building permit for a new CARDINAL - family house and that this applied provided that an application for a building permit was submitted to ORG within DATE from the date of the decision . Finally , it stated that the tentative approval did not imply a right for the applicant to start the construction .", "ORG referred the matter to the Land Survey ( lantm\u00e4teri ) of PERSON to prepare the question of the division of the plot ( tomtdelning ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for a building permit . After the matter had been considered by the relevant road network and energy authorities , the applicant submitted new plans on DATE . It appears that those proceedings were at a standstill until DATE ( see section CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . At DATE the Land Survey recommended that the property plan for DATE be repealed in order to facilitate a division of the property enabling the applicant to construct a new house on the resulting new plot . The Land Survey observed that ORG had , with binding effect , made the assessment that the addition of a new CARDINAL - family house would be consistent with the detailed development plan . A new property plan would not be required ; repeal of the existing property plan would be sufficient and the division of the property would be consistent with the detailed development plan and be suitable for its purpose .", "Several of the applicant \u2019s neighbours opposed the measure with reference to the special character of the neighbourhood .", "On DATE the ORG followed ORG suggestion and repealed the property plan for DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The owners of CARDINAL neighbouring properties appealed against the decision to ORG , claiming that the neighbourhood was worthy of preservation due to its special character and that new buildings would spoil the area . ORG visited the area before deciding on DATE to reject the appeal .", "CARDINAL . The neighbours appealed to the Government , invoking the same grounds as before ORG . The applicant also submitted his observations . On DATE the Government quashed the ORG \u2019s decision to repeal the property plan with , inter alia , the following reasoning :", "\u201c The Government find that the decision to repeal the property plan for DATE ought to be considered in its context , namely to make possible a division of the property with the intention of constructing CARDINAL more family house .", "The Government observe that the entire block has long been occupied by buildings in accordance with the city plan and plot divisions . The block has CARDINAL plots , the sizes of which vary between CARDINAL GPE and TIME . .... The Government find that the concentration which will be the result if CARDINAL , DATE FAC , were to be divided into CARDINAL properties and a new building were to be constructed , involves a not inconsiderable change to the ORG immediate surroundings . Nor can such a change be considered to comply with the shape that the block has been given through the city plan and the plot divisions . .... The Government thus find that the suitability of the intended change of the property and the development conditions within the block ought to be examined through a new detailed development plan for the area in which the size and situation of the buildings can also be regulated to a sufficient extent . In view of this and everything else which has emerged in the case , the Government find that the decision to repeal the property plan should be quashed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) for judicial review under LAW on ORG ( ORG om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa f\u00f6rvaltningsbeslut - hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) , submitting that , since ORG tentative approval was binding on the examination of an application for a building permit , it effectively precluded an examination on the merits in the present case . Moreover , as ORG had previously considered the suitability of dividing the property when it granted the tentative approval , it was not legally correct of the Government to consider the suitability yet again . The Government \u2019s conclusion that the case should be reviewed through a new detailed development plan therefore lacked a legal basis .", "The applicant further requested that an oral hearing be held in the case . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request on the ground that the case could be examined and decided without holding an oral hearing . The applicant was given DATE to submit additional written observations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , unanimously , found that the ORG \u2019s decision was not unlawful and confirmed it . The court held :", "\u201c According to section CARDINAL of the [ CARDINAL Act ] ORG must examine if the Government\u2019", "According to LAW , section CARDINAL , of the [ CARDINAL Act ] land may only be used for development if it is , from a public interest point of view , suitable for its purpose . The conditions on which an examination of suitability should be carried out through the adoption of a detailed development plan - and not solely in a matter concerning a building permit or a tentative approval - are specified in LAW , section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the [ CARDINAL Act ] . Thus , according to point CARDINAL of the aforementioned provision , a detailed development plan becomes relevant when a new single building is to be constructed , the use of which will have significant influence on its surroundings . The ORG \u2019s assessment that the suitability of the intended change of the property and the development conditions within the block ORG ought to be reviewed through a new detailed development plan for the area , is within the scope of jurisdiction of the authorities in planning matters . Hence , ORG finds that the decision to quash the lower instances\u2019 decisions regarding the property plan does not conflict with any legal rule in the manner claimed by the applicant . Nor does the examination show that the decision , in any other manner , is contrary to any legal rule . It should therefore be upheld . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A request by the applicant for re - opening of the case was refused by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , ORG , in DATE , adopted an amended detailed development plan which effectively prohibited a division of the applicant \u2019s property , and the construction of another building on it . Upon appeal , the ORG quashed the decision on the ground that it should have been decided by ORG ( kommunfullm\u00e4ktige ) of PERSON . After renewed examination by ORG , it adopted the detailed development plan on DATE . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG , which on DATE upheld the ORG \u2019s decision . It found that the public interest in protecting the cultural heritage of the neighbourhood outweighed the applicant \u2019s private interest . The applicant made a further appeal to the ORG , which was rejected on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after ORG had given its opinion and the applicant had commented , ORG decided to reject his request of DATE for a building permit .", "On DATE , the applicant appealed against the above decision to ORG . On DATE , after having granted the applicant several postponements from CARDINAL DATE to DATE , the ORG quashed the ORG \u2019s rejection and referred the matter back for a new consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG served ORG decision of DATE to grant the applicant tentative approval on the applicant \u2019s neighbours , several of whom brought proceedings in DATE to have the measure quashed . They claimed that , although they were affected by the decision , ORG had failed to hear them in the case or inform them about the decision .", "In a decision of DATE , the ORG first found that the neighbours were entitled to appeal against the tentative approval and was satisfied that they had done so within the required time - limit . Although they ought to have been aware of the tentative approval in connection with the property plan issue , the decision had been formally served or notified to them only in DATE . ORG quashed ORG DATE decision on the grounds that the tentative approval was contrary to the existing property plan and detailed development plan and the neighbours should have been given the opportunity to express their views on the matter before it was decided .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appealed against ORG above - mentioned decision of DATE to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . The applicant obtained extensions of time - limits for filing his written submissions in DATE and DATE , and in DATE he asked the court to give priority to the case .", "CARDINAL . Following the Board \u2019s above - mentioned decision of DATE on the tentative approval , the applicant appealed against this decision to ORG . The latter granted him CARDINAL extensions DATE and DATE of the time - limits for specifying his appeal grounds .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined both of the above appeals concurrently and on DATE it delivered CARDINAL judgments , CARDINAL on each appeal .", "In the first judgment ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the ORG \u2019s reasoning .", "In the second judgment it held that , since it had confirmed the ORG \u2019s decision , there no longer existed a tentative approval which was binding on ORG . Consequently , the ORG \u2019s appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE should be granted and the matter referred back to ORG for further consideration .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant appealed against both judgments to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE .", "In the appeal concerning the tentative approval , ORG granted him CARDINAL extensions until DATE for the submission of his appeal grounds . As to his appeal concerning the building permit , the applicant was granted CARDINAL such extensions , also until DATE .", "In CARDINAL separate decisions of DATE , ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal in each case .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicant appealed to ORG .", "The latter granted him numerous extensions until DATE of the time - limits for filing written submissions on the appeal concerning the building permit . On DATE ORG ordered him to complete his submissions .", "Concurrently with the above , he was also granted a number of extensions for the filing of his appeal submissions , until DATE in the case concerning the tentative approval . On that date ORG ordered him to complete his observations .", "In respect of both appeals , reminders were served on him in DATE .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal in both cases .", "CARDINAL . In separate proceedings in DATE , the applicant requested ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON to declare that GPE was liable to pay him compensation for both actual and potential damage caused by the GPE \u2019s refusal to grant his request for a building permit despite having granted him an unconditional tentative approval which was binding . The GPE denied responsibility .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared that the GPE was liable to compensate the applicant for both actual and potential damage caused by its refusal to grant the applicant a building permit . The LOC was further liable to pay his legal costs . ORG took note of the LOC \u2019s argument that the tentative approval was conditional upon an amendment to the property plan , and that the applicant was aware of the need to modify the property plan and ought to have understood that the positive tentative approval did not mean that he would be able to build without an amendment to the property plan . In the view of ORG the fact that a claimant was aware that an amendment to the property plan was needed in order to grant a building permit did not dispense ORG from specifically reviewing and justifying its position as to whether the desired measure was authorised by existing plans . What the applicant may have known about existing plans was therefore of no significance in this context . Since the applicable plans did not allow the grant of a building permit and since an amendment to the plan could not be a condition attached to a tentative approval , such approval should not have been granted . Nor was such knowledge significant for the assessment of his application for a building permit , refused on DATE . On the whole , the refusal was erroneous . ORG found that ORG had disregarded a clear and unambiguous provision in GPE , i.e. LAW DATE , which stated that a tentative approval was binding if an application for a building permit was made within DATE from the date on which the tentative approval was granted . Moreover , ORG found it remarkable that ORG had taken CARDINAL years to reject the request for a building permit since the average time to process such a request was DATE , according to testimony given by the city architect . Thus , the court considered that ORG handling of the case had involved such fault and neglect in its exercise of public authority that the Municipality was liable to pay compensation .", "CARDINAL . The GPE appealed to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) of GPE and PERSON , which on DATE upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment in full . As no further appeal was lodged , ORG judgment acquired legal force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , invoking the above declaratory judgment , instituted civil proceedings against the GPE requesting compensation in an amount of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the damage he had suffered due to the refusal to grant him the building permit . He claimed that this damage corresponded to the market value of the part of his property upon which he would have built the house . GPE contested the request .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG noted that the proceedings relating to the building permit were still pending and that it was improbable that he would be granted such a permit . However , even if he were to be granted a permit , the decision would most likely be quashed on appeal . Thus , it rejected the applicant \u2019s claim on the ground that he had not shown that he had suffered any actual damage as a consequence of the GPE \u2019s fault and neglect . The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment of DATE , sharing the latter \u2019s view that the applicant had failed to show that a building permit granted by the ORG would have stood after the review by higher instances . The LOC could reasonably argue that the question of damage could not therefore be assessed only on the basis of the fact that the LOC was formally obliged to grant the applicant a building permit . It found that the applicant had not been able to demonstrate that the consideration of his application for a tentative approval by GPE , while blameworthy , had led to his being denied a definite right to divide and build a new house on his property . Nor had he demonstrated that the GPE \u2019s handling of his case had caused the damage for which he had claimed compensation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG , which on DATE refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL .
