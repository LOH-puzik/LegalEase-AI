The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant bought his first agricultural property of QUANTITY consisting of CARDINAL plots situated in PERSON , in the municipality of PERSON , between lakes PERSON , GPE and PERSON .

There were no buildings situated on these plots .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an ordinance by ORG created ORG . The applicant \u2019s land was incorporated into the area covered by the park .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that he had not been informed about this incorporation at the time and had not had any means of challenging this measure , either immediately following the action or after DATE , when LAW CARDINAL to the Convention entered into force in respect of GPE .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE a new local land development plan was adopted by the local municipality . Under this plan the applicant \u2019s plots could not be used for construction purposes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of the Park informed the applicant that his property was located in the zone of the Lakes Wigry and PERSON in FAC and that the local development plan prohibited any construction for purposes other than maintaining the water reserves of harbours and beaches .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of the Park responded to a proposal from the applicant to sell his properties in PERSON , comprising a total surface area of QUANTITY , to the Park . The Director asked the applicant to reassess the price , arguing that the proposed price had been based on the assumption that the plots concerned would be suitable for construction purposes , whereas they in fact consisted exclusively of forest and farmland . The applicant was also informed that , since his plots were situated between CARDINAL lakes , they fell within the protection zone which extended QUANTITY out from the shore of each lake and within which no construction was allowed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that from DATE to CARDINAL CARDINAL dwellings had been built on plots in the immediate vicinity of his land . The Government submitted that the Director of ORG had given consent only with regard to the expansion of existing dwellings ( supplementation of the existing farm buildings ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicant divided plot No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on which the farm dwelling ( siedlisko ) was located and sold it to CARDINAL third parties . The new owners requested and were granted permits to develop the buildings which already existed on the acquired property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local land development plan adopted in DATE expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the Mayor of Suwa\u0142ki to inform him of the designation of his property according to the DATE local land development plan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor informed the applicant that his land was situated within the limits of ORG , falling partly within the lake protection zone and that there was no provision for construction thereon . According to the local land development plan , the applicant \u2019s property consisted of forest area and farmland on which further afforestation was recommended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the Mayor of Suwa\u0142ki to pay him compensation amounting to MONEY ( PLN ) for amendments made to the local land development plan which had excluded the possibility of any construction on his property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor replied that the applicant \u2019s request was ill - founded because the plan in question , which had been adopted by resolution of ORG on DATE , had not changed the designation of the applicant \u2019s property . The previous binding development plan did not provide for any construction on the applicant \u2019s land , which was situated on agricultural areas with recommended afforestation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that a preliminary construction permit ( warunki zabudowy i zagospodarowania terenu ) be granted in respect of plots nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor of PERSON refused to grant the permit requested . It was found that the planned development , consisting of the construction of a house and an outbuilding , would have been situated too close to the lake shore , in an area in which no construction was allowed according to local land development plan . Moreover , the Director of ORG had voiced a negative opinion as regards the planned development .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( PERSON ) . He complained , among other things , that he had been treated in a discriminatory manner because owners of the adjacent plots had obtained building permits and had been able to develop their land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the challenged decision . ORG confirmed that the development was inadmissible taking into consideration the provisions of the DATE local land development plan which expressly prohibited construction of any new buildings in the area concerned . As regards the allegedly discriminatory treatment , ORG found that the owners of some plots situated in the neighbourhood had indeed obtained building permits . However , some buildings had previously existed on their property , so the permits relied on by the applicant were not ones that concerned new constructions . ORG did not find any discriminatory treatment because the applicant \u2019s situation had been legally and factually different from that of his neighbours . As regards the CARDINAL building permits granted to the other persons living in the vicinity , the ORG further noted that proceedings had been instituted as a matter of course to declare the respective decisions null and void .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint against this decision with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . The ORG endorsed the reasoning of ORG decision and found no breach of law in the administrative proceedings complained of .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant submitted CARDINAL applications requesting that the municipality issue preliminary construction permits with regard to plots CARDINAL . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor of Suwa\u0142ki ordered the applicant to rectify some shortcomings in his applications . The applicant failed to do so and , consequently , they were not processed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant requested that the municipality issue preliminary construction permits in respect of plots nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL . The applicant sought permission to develop his property by constructing a new residential building , an outbuilding , a septic tank and a well , with access to public road no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The municipality invited the Park Director to state his position with regard to the applicant \u2019s request . The Director declined to give his consent to the applicant \u2019s project .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to the Environment Minister ( Minister PERSON ) , who quashed the decision and ordered that the case be reexamined . It was noted that the contested decision had been based on LAW , while it should have been based on LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director again refused to give his consent to the applicant \u2019s request . The Director emphasised the historical and landscape values of the area in question and was of the opinion that any construction there would have a negative influence on the unique values on the landscape which ORG had to protect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director rectified the basis for his previous decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to the Environment Minister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Environment Minister upheld the challenged decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG ( ORG PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment , quashing both the challenged decision and the preceding decision of DATE , finding that the administrative authorities concerned had relied on the wrong legal basis . The ORG went on to say that the first - instance decision had not been consistent with the second - instance decision . The first refused the applicant permission because the land in question had not been developed and \u201c had never been intended for construction purposes \u201d and the second contained in its reasoning the statement that \u201c there were already other buildings in the vicinity , which did not justify granting further construction permits \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an inspection of the plots CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL took place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of ORG again refused to give his consent to the planned development . He considered that the planned construction failed to fulfil CARDINAL of the requirements laid down in LAW of the DATE Act on Conservation of Nature , namely \u201c it was not consistent with the aims of the Park \u201d ( nie s\u0142u\u017cy celom parku ) , because of its commercial purpose , amongst other things , given that the applicant was intending to run a guesthouse there . The Director admitted that there were buildings in the close vicinity of the applicant \u2019s property and that they had recently been developed . However , the applicant intended to build on previously undeveloped land QUANTITY wide which , in the Director \u2019s view , would negatively affect the landscape and the lakeshore .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to the Environment Minister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new local development plan was adopted , which came into force on DATE . According to the plan , no construction of any buildings on the applicant \u2019s property was allowed .", "CARDINAL . Additionally , on DATE the Environment Minister replied to the parliamentary query ( interpelacja poselska ) made on behalf of the applicant by ORG , a member of ORG . The Minister confirmed , among other things , that the local land development plan for GPE , in force before the DATE , had excluded any new construction on the applicant \u2019s plots nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor of Suwa\u0142ki discontinued the administrative proceedings taking the view that the entry into force of the new local development plan rendered continuation of the proceedings pointless since , even if a decision on the merits were to be given , it would have to be declared ineffectual ( stwierdzenie wyga\u015bni\u0119cia decyzji ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , by resolution of DATE before the local development plan was drawn up \u2013 ORG of GPE adopted framework local planning policy guidelines ( studium kierunk\u00f3w i uwarunkowa\u0144 zagospodarowania przestrzennego gminy ) which provided that the plots belonging to the applicant were to become forest land and that no construction could be carried out on them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the municipality rectify a breach of legal order in so far as the guidelines had reflected ORG Director \u2019s position that a ban on all construction projects should be imposed on his plot . He submitted that this measure amounted to de facto expropriation without any entitlement to compensation and consequently breached the LAW in so far as the latter guarantees the right to the peaceful enjoyment of one \u2019s possessions .", "CARDINAL . As the municipality refused to grant his request , he submitted a complaint to ORG in GPE , contesting the lawfulness of the local planning policy guidelines . He argued that the guidelines directly affected his situation . Not only had they made it impossible for him to pursue any construction projects , they also seriously restricted his ownership rights to such an extent that they became illusory . The guidelines inflicted a serious disadvantage on him in that he was unable to build a shed and had to rent storage space from his neighbours . The restrictions did not correspond to any pressing social need as his farm was not located in virgin territory . There were CARDINAL farms in the vicinity , all of them with dwellings and sheds , the land was being used for agricultural purposes , there was a road and a power supply , and the installation of a sewage system was planned in the future .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed his appeal . The court first addressed the municipality \u2019s argument that the policy guidelines were not an individual administrative measure addressed to a particular individual , and capable of affecting his legal interests , and which therefore could not be challenged before an administrative court . The court found that , despite being essentially a policy instrument addressed primarily to other municipal bodies and guiding them in the implementation of local planning policy , they affected the applicant \u2019s legal situation to a degree sufficient to hold that he had a legal interest in challenging their lawfulness in judicial proceedings . This was so because the adoption of such guidelines would necessarily influence the outcome of future proceedings in which individuals might seek the adoption of measures falling within the scope of the local planning policy .", "CARDINAL . The court further stated that the municipality \u2019s authority to impose on individuals restrictions regarding the exercise of their property rights was determined by the applicable laws , including those regulating environmental protection . This authority was not absolute , however , as the municipality was also obliged to respect the public interest , to weigh it against the relevant private interests in the process of land planning and development , to act rationally and to respect the principle of proportionality .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , the Law on Nature Conservation of DATE provided for an obligation for the municipality \u2013 when adopting the guidelines \u2013 to take due note of the position of the Director of ORG which , in so far as it concerned plots of land situated within the limits of national parks and their nearest neighbourhood ( otulina ) , was binding on the municipality .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the applicant had never had a right to develop his property , meaning that the adoption of the framework local planning policy guidelines had not deprived him of any rights . The plan adopted in DATE did not provide for the applicant \u2019s land to be used for construction purposes . It only provided for the owners to maintain their buildings in good technical condition .", "CARDINAL . In the present case the restrictions imposed on the applicant were in compliance with the applicable laws and did not breach the applicant \u2019s individual rights . In so far as he had referred to construction projects on neighbouring plots , this issue did not fall within the ambit of the present case , in which only the lawfulness of the measures imposed on him could be examined .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation against this judgment with ORG . He essentially argued that the measures complained of were in breach of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that they amounted to an excessive restriction of his ownership rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his cassation appeal . Firstly it held that the lower court \u2019s view that the municipality was obliged to ascertain the Director \u2019s position , and was bound by it , was correct .", "DATE \u2019s rights , had acted in compliance with the applicable laws , was correct . The manner in which the municipality had exercised its powers did not go beyond the limits defined by the constitutional protection of property . This conclusion was reinforced by the fact that the applicant \u2019s plots were in any event not already subject to construction under the plan adopted in DATE .", "The court went on to state :", "\u201c However , the court shared the conclusions of the cassation appeal that solutions adopted in the planning policy guidelines are capable of breaching the applicant \u2019s legal interest , given that he had expressed his wish to change the use to which his plots had hitherto been put by pursuing construction projects on them . The fact that under the previous planning instruments concerning his land the applicant was also prevented from building on it can demonstrate only that his legal situation has not changed , but is not tantamount to saying that his interest as an owner has not been breached , given that he can not bring his projects to fruition . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant argued that the measure complained of was not justified because a number of dwellings had been constructed on neighbouring plots , the court noted that this objection went to the substance of the position formulated by the Director of ORG . It could not be examined in the proceedings as they were concerned only with the lawfulness of the framework guidelines .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the Director of ORG , proposing that the situation be settled by way of the sale to GPE CARDINAL of his plots ( Nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE ) on the Wigry lake shore , for a price to be determined by an expert , in return for the Director \u2019s agreement to change the guidelines .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the Director rejected the applicant \u2019s proposal . He referred to the planning history of his plots and the planning regulation which designated the applicant \u2019s land for afforestation . He reiterated that even on the basis of the DATE plan , which had expired on DATE , no construction had been allowed on plots no . CARDINAL and CARDINAL . The situation did not change after adoption of the new plan . As regards the applicant \u2019s proposal to sell some of his plots to the LOC , the Director submitted that the LOC was generally interested in buying up plots on its territory and did so as long as its financial means allowed . However , he stated that it was not possible to buy the plots in return for amendments to the local development plan ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
