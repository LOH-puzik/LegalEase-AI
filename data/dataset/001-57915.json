In his letter he stated :", "\" Although , in my opinion , the various contributions taken separately do not ( or do not any longer ) contain any ORG secrets , they do - taken together and read in conjunction - amount to information whose confidentiality is necessary in the interests of the ORG or its allies .

CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) were applicable even though neither the applicant association nor any other person had had to answer for their actions in the criminal proceedings .
