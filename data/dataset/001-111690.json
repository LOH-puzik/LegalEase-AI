The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Under the German Federal Hunting Act ( ORG ) , owners of hunting grounds with a surface area of CARDINAL hectares are de jure members of a hunting association ( ORG ) , while owners of larger plots of land manage their own hunting district . The applicant owns CARDINAL landholdings in GPE - Palatinate of QUANTITY each , which he inherited in DATE from his late mother . He is thus a de jure member of a hunting association , in this case the hunting association of the municipality of Langsur .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who is opposed to hunting on ethical grounds , filed a request with the hunting authority seeking to terminate his membership of the hunting association . The authority rejected his request on the grounds that his membership was prescribed by law and that there was no provision for the termination of membership .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought proceedings before ORG . Relying in particular on the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , ORG . ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIII ) , he requested ORG to find it established that he was not a member of the hunting association of the municipality of Langsur .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request . It considered that LAW did not violate the applicant \u2019s rights . With regard to the PERSON judgment , ORG took the view that the situation in GPE differed from that in GPE . It observed , in particular , that NORP owners of hunting grounds were able , by virtue of their membership of the hunting association , to influence the decision - making process as to how the relevant hunting rights should be exercised . Furthermore , they had the right to receive a share of the profits derived from the exercise of those hunting rights . All owners of plots which were too small to allow proper management of hunting rights joined a hunting association . The court further considered that the hunting associations not only served the leisure interests of those who exercised the hunting rights , but also imposed certain specific obligations on them which served the general interest , in particular a duty to manage game stocks with the aim of maintaining varied and healthy game populations and a duty to prevent damage caused by wild game . They were further obliged to comply with specific quotas set by the authorities for the hunting of game . These duties applied in the same way to the owners of hunting grounds of QUANTITY , notwithstanding the fact that these bigger plots were not grouped together in common hunting districts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the Rhineland - Palatinate Administrative Court of Appeal and ORG dismissed the appeals lodged by the applicant , on the same grounds as ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) refused to admit a constitutional complaint by the applicant for adjudication . It noted at the outset that the provisions of LAW did not violate the applicant \u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his property , but defined and limited the exercise of that right in a proportionate manner . The relevant provisions pursued legitimate aims , were necessary and did not impose an excessive burden on landowners .", "CARDINAL . When defining the content and limits of property rights , the legislature had to weigh the landowners\u2019 legitimate interests against the general interest . It had , in particular , to respect the principles of proportionality and equal treatment . The limitations imposed on the exercise of property rights must not infringe the core area of the protected right . The margin of appreciation allowed to the legislature depended on the specific context ; the more important the social considerations , the wider the margin of appreciation .", "CARDINAL . Applying these principles to the instant case , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s compulsory membership of a hunting association did not violate his property rights . The core area of that right had not been infringed . LAW pursued the legitimate aims of preserving game in a manner adapted to the rural and cultural environment and ensuring healthy and varied wildlife , aims encompassed in the notion of \u201c management and protection of game stocks \u201d ( PERSON ) . Under LAW , gamekeeping was a means not only of preventing damage caused by wildlife , but also of avoiding any impediment to the use of the land for agriculture , forestry and fishing . These aims served the general interest .", "CARDINAL . Compulsory membership of a hunting association was an appropriate and necessary means of achieving those aims . Referring to paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON judgment , cited above , ORG considered that ORG had acknowledged that it was undoubtedly in the general interest to avoid unregulated hunting and encourage the rational management of game stocks . Compulsory membership of a hunting association was also a proportionate means . The impact on property rights was not particularly serious and did not outweigh the general interest in the rational management of game stocks . Furthermore , LAW conferred on every member of the hunting association the right to participate in the decisionmaking process within the association and to receive a share of the profits derived from the leasing of the hunting rights .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further considered that there had been no violation of the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of conscience . It noted that in paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON judgment ORG had accepted that the convictions of the applicants in that case attained a certain level of cogency , cohesion and importance and were therefore worthy of respect in a NORP society . ORG left open the question whether this assessment was correct in PERSON PERSON \u2019s case . It agreed , however , to take this assumption as a starting point as it considered that in any case there had been no violation of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It was doubtful whether there had been any interference with the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of conscience . Even assuming that there had been , it was , in any event , not of a serious nature . As the applicant was not forced to participate in hunting himself and did not have to take any decision in that respect , the court considered that he had not been placed in a position of conflict of conscience . It further observed that the right to freedom of conscience did not encompass a right to have the entire legal order made subject to one \u2019s own ethical standards . If the legal order distributed the right to make use of a certain property among several stakeholders , the owner \u2019s conscience did not necessarily outweigh the other CARDINAL constitutional rights . If the applicant \u2019s landholding \u2013 and those of other owners who were opposed to hunting DATE were taken out of the common hunting districts because of the NORP convictions , the whole system of property ownership and management of game stocks would be jeopardised . The right to freedom of conscience did not outweigh the general interest in the instant case .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the applicant \u2019s complaint did not come within the scope of the right to freedom of association because NORP hunting associations were of a public nature . They were vested with administrative , rule - making and disciplinary prerogatives and remained integrated within ORG structures . There was thus no doubt that the association was not characterised as \u201c public \u201d simply in order to remove it from the scope of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further considered that the applicant \u2019s right to equal treatment had not been breached . The administrative courts had put forward relevant reasons for drawing a distinction between the owners of landholdings of QUANTITY and those of QUANTITY ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Contrary to the situation in GPE , which had been examined by ORG in the PERSON judgment , LAW applied to the whole of GPE and was binding on all landowners . The owners of land of QUANTITY had the same duties with regard to gamekeeping as those who belonged to hunting associations .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG observed that the administrative courts had considered the PERSON judgment and had emphasised the differences between NORP and NORP law as applicable at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . Having been invited by the President of ORG to provide the ORG with additional information regarding the actual use of the applicant \u2019s land , the ORG submitted a declaration by the farmer who had taken out a lease on the agricultural land to which the applicant \u2019s plots belonged . The farmer submitted that she regularly used the land to raise cattle destined for slaughter . This was confirmed in a written statement by the mayor of the municipality of Langsur . The applicant submitted that he had visited the plots several times over DATE without ever seeing any cattle . He had never given permission for his land to be used in that way and would take legal action against any possible abuse .", "CARDINAL .
