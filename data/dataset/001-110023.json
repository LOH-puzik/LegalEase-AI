NORP The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a deposit in a savings account with the commercial bank PERSON ( \u201c the bank \u201d ) . After the bank announced that it was changing the interest rate , the applicant requested the closure of his account in DATE , but the bank informed him that it was unable to repay his capital plus interest as its funds were insufficient . The applicant sued the bank , seeking repayment of the capital he had deposited , together with interest , a penalty payment and compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the town of GPE partly upheld the applicant \u2019s claims and ordered the bank to pay him a total of MONEY ( RUB ) ( which included the capital of the deposit , interest accrued , compensation for non - pecuniary damage and penalties ) . That decision was upheld and became final on DATE . In a judgment of ORG of DATE the above - mentioned award was recalculated in line with the inflation rate . The award was thus raised to RUB CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , at the request of ORG and ORG , ORG of GPE declared the bank insolvent . On DATE the insolvency procedure was opened by that court and a liquidator was appointed by the court to oversee the bank \u2019s administration in that connection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG approved the provisional statement of affairs based on the bank \u2019s financial situation at DATE . As a result of the sale of the bank \u2019s assets , RUB CARDINAL had been accumulated on the bank \u2019s account . According to the Government , the bank had incurred debts against CARDINAL first - class creditors , whose claims amounted to RUB CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Under the law which defined the order of distribution of assets of insolvent entities , the applicant belonged to the first class of creditors , whose claims were to be satisfied before others . However , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE the LOC body of the bank created a special group of \u201c privileged \u201d creditors within the first class . That privileged group included disabled persons , war veterans , persons in need and persons who had actively assisted the liquidator within the insolvency proceedings . Those categories of creditors were to receive full satisfaction of their claims before other creditors belonging to the same class ( the first ) . As a result , almost all of the funds collected during the liquidation process were used for repayment to those \u201c privileged \u201d creditors : they were reimbursed by the liquidator at PERCENT of the amounts due to them . On DATE the applicant received the sum of RUB CARDINAL ( i.e. PERCENT of the amount of RUB CARDINAL owed to him by the bank under the DATE judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged , before ORG , the fact that other creditors had received repayment at PERCENT , whereas he had received PERCENT of the amount due to him . Relying on sections DATE of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , he claimed that he belonged to the same class as the \u201c privileged \u201d creditors , and that the bank \u2019s assets should have been distributed evenly . He sought repayment of the remainder of the sum owed to him , in accordance with the principle of proportional distribution of the assets of the bank amongst creditors of the same class .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s action was dismissed at first instance . On DATE ORG of GPE reversed the judgment of the first - instance court and held that , in deciding to repay certain categories of creditors at PERCENT , the creditors\u2019 body had overstepped the limits of its powers under LAW . By enforcing that decision and distributing the assets at PERCENT to the \u201c privileged \u201d creditors , the liquidator had , in turn , disregarded the requirements of sections CARDINAL QUANTITY . Pointing out that section CARDINAL of the Act was not open to broad interpretation , ORG of GPE ordered the liquidator to redress the violations thus observed within DATE and to inform it of the measures taken in that connection .", "CARDINAL . NORP The liquidator appealed on points of law to ORG for the LOC , arguing that he had distributed the assets pursuant to a decision of the LOC body , that the distribution had complied with LAW and that it had not therefore been in breach of the requirements of LAW . On CARDINAL DATE his appeal on points of law was dismissed . Upholding the decision of CARDINAL DATE , the court stated that the liquidator should not have enforced a decision by the LOC body that was in breach of the law .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the enforcement of the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( upheld at last instance on DATE ) and , in particular , the redressing of the applicant \u2019s financial situation , were not possible on account of the bank \u2019s lack of assets .", "CARDINAL . In view of the failure to enforce the decision of CARDINAL DATE , on DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG ( supplemented by him on DATE ) . He requested that the liquidator in person repay him the remainder of his DATE award of RUB CARDINAL , with interest , plus compensation for non - pecuniary damage and loss of time , representing a total of RUB CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request . The complaints in question were examined in the context of the insolvency procedure opened against the bank ; within the same procedure the court examined the bank \u2019s balance sheet , as submitted by the liquidator . A representative of ORG was present at the hearing . ORG found that on DATE and DATE ORG had already awarded the applicant the sum of RUB CARDINAL to cover his deposit , plus penalties and damages , and that it was not possible to rule on the same request for a second time . ORG further established that the applicant appeared in the list of creditors as number CARDINAL and that , in respect of the actual capital originally deposited , the bank owed him a residual amount of RUB CARDINAL . The court pointed out that this sum could be paid to him under the conditions laid down in LAW . The court also rejected the claims for loss of time , as the relevant legislation did not provide for such compensation . Furthermore , the applicant [ had ] \u201c failed to prove that the losses were caused by the liquidator \u2019s actions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , hearing the case on appeal , upheld the decision of DATE . The court of appeal held , firstly , that the applicant \u2019s claims against the liquidator were \u201c stand - alone claims , examined by the court of first instance and ... rightly rejected \u201d . The court of appeal \u2019s reasoning read as follows :", "\u201c The law in force does not envisage satisfaction of claims which did not arise during the period of the bank \u2019s operations but only during the period of the insolvency procedure ... On a bank \u2019s insolvency , its debt obligations are declared due , but the insolvency procedure is initiated with a view to amassing liquidation assets which must be allocated among the debts owed to creditors and arising prior to the insolvency .", "Furthermore , [ the applicant \u2019s ] right to recover [ the original court award ] from the bank already exists ; therefore , satisfaction of his claims [ against the liquidator ] would lead to repeated recovery of the same amount , but this time in the form of damages , which is unfounded .", "[ In the original court award the applicant ] was also awarded a sum for non - pecuniary damage , and in light of the above such damages can not be awarded for a further period .", "The existing provisions of civil legislation make no provision for compensation for loss of time .", "The court of appeal also takes into account the fact that the failure to pay the amounts [ due to the applicant ] is a result of the absence [ of funds ] , since , following the court of appeal \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE ... the assets of the bank in liquidation did not increase ... , as is evident from the report provided by the liquidator on the work of the liquidation committee and the documents appended to the report \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against that judgment . On DATE ORG for the LOC dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law on the following grounds :", "\u201c The decision of the PERSON body and the liquidator \u2019s action ... admittedly breached the principle of proportional payment to creditors at the same level of priority , but did not cause [ the applicant ] the damage he alleged , because the PERCENT satisfaction of all first - level creditors was not possible on account of the lack of assets available for distribution . The sum repaid to [ the applicant ] was thus calculated in proportion to the amount of his claim and to the assets realised in the course of the liquidation . Taking into account the fact that the insolvency procedure was ongoing when the dispute was examined , the courts of first and appellate instance rightly referred to the possibility of [ the applicant \u2019s ] receiving the outstanding debt owed to him under LAW of GPE .", "The claims for non - pecuniary damage and compensation for loss of time were rightly refused by the court as unjustified on the grounds set out in the earlier judicial decisions .", "In view of the above [ the court of cassation ] finds that the refusals by the courts of first and appellate instance to grant [ the applicant \u2019s ] claims were justified . There are no grounds for overruling or modifying the judicial decisions taken . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the statement of affairs as presented by the liquidator and approved by the creditors\u2019 body , and closed the insolvency procedure on grounds of insufficient assets . The applicant did not attempt to bring any new claims against the liquidator .", "CARDINAL . After the Government had been given notice of the application , the President of ORG of GPE lodged , on DATE , an application for supervisory review ( protest ) against the judgments of CARDINAL February , DATE and DATE , on the ground that they had been given in breach of LAW , which determined the jurisdiction of the commercial courts . Among other things , he stated that examination of the applicant \u2019s complaints against the liquidator within the context of the insolvency procedure opened against the bank had been contrary to the DATE LAW such procedures . Since those complaints had concerned a dispute between the applicant and the liquidator , they were not related to the insolvency procedure as such and the applicant should have submitted them to the courts of general jurisdiction . On those grounds the President sought the annulment of the decisions at issue and discontinuance of the proceedings concerning the above - mentioned complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidium of ORG of GPE granted those requests in full , endorsing the arguments raised in the application for supervisory review . The ORG concluded that the commercial courts had not had jurisdiction to hear the case against the liquidator in person , annulled the decision rendered in DATE and closed the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a request for supervisory review of the DATE decision to the same ORG . On DATE his request was dismissed as ill - founded by the Vice - President of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Draft Articles on ORG adopted by ORG ( ILC ) in DATE ( ORG of ORG , DATE , vol . NORP , Part CARDINAL ) , and their commentary , codified principles developed in modern international law in respect of the ORG \u2019s responsibility for internationally wrongful acts . In that commentary the ORG stated , inter alia , as follows ( see paragraph ( CARDINAL ) of the commentary to LAW ) :", "\u201c In determining what constitutes an organ of a ORG for the purposes of responsibility , the internal law and practice of each ORG are of prime importance . The structure of the ORG and the functions of its organs are not , in general , governed by international law . It is a matter for each ORG to decide how its administration is to be structured and which functions are to be assumed by government . But while the ORG remains free to determine its internal structure and functions through its own law and practice , international law has a distinct role . For example , the conduct of certain institutions performing public functions and exercising public powers ( e.g. the police ) is attributed to the ORG even if those institutions are regarded in internal law as autonomous and independent of the executive government . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ILC , in its commentary , described the phenomenon of \u201c parastatal entities \u201d . It noted as follows ( see paragraph ( CARDINAL ) to the commentary to LAW", "\u201c The fact that an entity can be classified as public or private according to the criteria of a given legal system , the existence of a greater or lesser State participation in its capital , or , more generally , in the ownership of its assets , the fact that it is not subject to executive control \u2013 these are not decisive criteria for the purpose of attribution of the entity \u2019s conduct to the ORG . Instead , article CARDINAL [ of the ORG ] refers to the true common feature , namely that these entities are empowered , if only to a limited extent or in a specific context , to exercise specified elements of governmental authority . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As the ORG also recognised :", "\u201c Beyond a certain limit , what is regarded as \u2018 governmental\u2019 depends on the particular society , its history and traditions . Of particular importance will be not just the content of the powers , but the way they are conferred on an entity , the purposes for which they are to be exercised and the extent to which the entity is accountable to government for their exercise \u201d ( see paragraph ( CARDINAL ) of the commentary to LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , after expiry of the period within which creditors must file their claims , the liquidation committee draws up a provisional statement of affairs containing information on the bankrupt company \u2019s estate , the claims filed by the creditors and the results of the examination of those claims . The statement must be approved by the body that has taken the decision to wind up the company . If the company \u2019s monetary assets are insufficient to satisfy the LOC claims , the liquidation committee will sell off the estate by auction . The distribution of assets to the creditors may begin in accordance with the interim statement once it has been approved , except in respect of fifth - level creditors who will be unable to receive any money owed to them for DATE following that approval . Once all the payments have been made , the final statement of affairs is drawn up and approved in the same manner . Should the assets prove insufficient , unsatisfied creditors may request the courts to order the owner of the company to honour their claims out of his own personal funds .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , as in force prior to DATE , made a distinction CARDINAL categories of creditors , providing that payment could be made to a given class only when the creditors at the previous level had been satisfied . According to this classification the applicant belonged to the fifth class of \u201c other creditors \u201d . Article CARDINAL made no mention of a category of creditors who were pensioners , war veterans , persons in need or persons assisting the liquidator in the insolvency proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Under a new provision , inserted into this Article on DATE , when a bank or other lending institution is wound up , private persons having made deposits with it are to be repaid as a first priority .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL further provides that where a company in liquidation has insufficient assets , they must be distributed among creditors at the same level in proportion to their respective claims .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act , insolvency cases fall within the jurisdiction of the commercial courts , which examine them in accordance with the rules laid down in the LAW or , where no such rule exists , in accordance with LAW of GPE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the LAW , insolvency procedures are opened in order to satisfy the LOC claims on a pari passu basis , to declare the bankrupt company released from his obligations and to protect the parties from unlawful actions against each other .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that , after a company has been declared insolvent and an insolvency procedure has been opened against it , any claims against the company \u2019s assets may be submitted only in the context of such procedure .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL lists the various participants in insolvency proceedings as the liquidator , the general meeting of creditors , the PERSON committee , the creditors , etc . The general meeting of creditors may form a creditor \u2019s committee and define its functions ( Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . The ORG will use the term \u201c the LOC body \u201d as referring to either of these bodies , as the case may be .", "CARDINAL . The LOC body nominates a candidate to act as the liquidator before the commercial court for approval ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ) which then appoints the liquidator ( LAW ) . Under section ORG ) the liquidator takes over the administration of the insolvent company , convenes a general meeting of creditors , takes control of the insolvent company \u2019s property , analyses the financial situation , examines the merits of the LOC claims , accepts or rejects them , oversees the liquidation process to realise the assets , sets up and heads the liquidation committee .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , taken together with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , candidates for the office of liquidator must be economists or lawyers , or have experience of company management . They must not have a criminal record . No one holding a position of responsibility in a company that is a debtor or creditor may be appointed . Candidates for the office of liquidator must declare their income and assets .", "CARDINAL . In the situations referred to under the LAW , the commercial court examines the lawfulness of all actions by the participants involved in the insolvency procedure ( LAW ) . Under section ORG ) the liquidator may challenge before the court any decisions of the creditor \u2019s body when those decisions fall outside its remit .", "CARDINAL . Under section ORG ) , after the expiry of a DATE period within which the creditors must submit their claims against the insolvent company , the liquidator will draw up a list of the claims that have been accepted and rejected , indicating the amounts for those that have been accepted and the level of priority for each . The list must be sent to the creditors within DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL establishes the various levels of priority for the distribution of the proceeds of the liquidation . Payment of the sums due to creditors at a given level is made once those at the previous level have been satisfied ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . If insufficient assets are realised to pay in full the creditors at a given level , the money that is available will be paid to them pari passu in proportion to the amounts of their respective claims ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . LAW makes no mention of a category of creditors who are disabled , war veterans , persons in need , or persons assisting the liquidator . LAW provides that any expenses arising from the liquidation , the liquidator \u2019s fees and the expenses of the debtor company \u2019s ongoing operations must take priority over the claims of first - level creditors .", "CARDINAL .
