In DATE ORG published CARDINAL copies of a book entitled The Gypsies of Turkey , written by Associate Professor PERSON .

The preface to the book states as follows :", "\u201c ...", "NORP live in peace on NORP territory DATE , just as they have throughout history , but now they are left entirely to their own devices , without regulation , supervision or attention . Their unregulated way of life , in which they are abandoned entirely to their own fate , is a failing on GPE \u2019s part . The PERSON current unordered way of life , and the fact that it is considered quite unnecessary to venture into their closed world in any way despite the long history we share , is a further shortcoming . Associated with this is the fact that while NORP have indeed lived for many years among us , they have been ostracised by local people and targeted by vilifying remarks which have , for the most part , been unenlightened and prejudiced . The negative response and distressing accusations which they encounter wherever they go have driven NORP , who already have a societal structure which is closed off from the outside world , to live in still narrower confines .", "We felt that there was a need to step into the unknown world of these people who have lived among us for DATE and have now become part of contemporary NORP culture . My aim was thus to get to know them closely using an empirical approach , and to present the NORP of GPE as they are , in all their aspects , on the basis of the principles of scientific objectivity .", "This study comprises an introduction and CARDINAL sections .", "The introduction provides information about the Gypsy as a concept and the origins of the NORP , as well as detailed information about their migration , and considers their history in GPE in the light of various archive documents and scholarly sources . In the first section , the socio - cultural characteristics of NORP are considered in broad terms . This section examines in particular the home life and travels of GPE , their music , dance , language , traditions and customs . The second section deals with the beliefs and practices of the LANGUAGE .", "This study DATE which I present without any pretensions , but merely in a bid to fill a significant gap ( it being the first study of its kind ) , and to provide guidance to others working on the NORP in the future \u2013 was prepared using descriptive , comparative and phenomenological methods , in addition to participant observation and interview techniques .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the introduction , the author went on to state :", "\u201c ...", "Gypsies have spread throughout the world but they have been unable to escape their status as a marginal group which is excluded and despised everywhere . Apart from the differences in their way of life , the characteristic which most obviously distinguishes NORP from others is the colour of their skin , which is darker , swarthier . In typological terms , most NORP are of medium height , of agile build , with large dark black ( occasionally hazel or blue ) eyes and long thick eyelashes ; the men have long moustaches . The mouth is slender and elegant , the teeth white and even , with a round jaw . They have a narrow forehead and temples and a small cranium . Their hair is curly , black , long and thick . Beyond middle age , the women are broad and corpulent . The younger people are slim , with firm and powerful muscles ( see PERSON by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e , Gypsy Stories of our own and from around the world by PERSON and The sieve - making of the Gypsies of GPE by ORG ) .", "...", "This research is intended to present the identity of the NORP , these people who have lived among us for DATE and have become an integral part of contemporary NORP culture , but about whom no comprehensive scientific study has as yet been conducted because their cultural identity has been largely ignored as a result of the difficulties in identifying and defining them . This study will give an account of their socio - cultural characteristics , beliefs , mythologies , festivals and celebrations in all their aspects .", "For the purpose of this study , an initial survey was conducted of information , documentation and materials concerning NORP , from GPE and elsewhere . The information and documents thus identified were then classified on the basis of their scientific reliability , using validity criteria . Next , an empirical study involving observation of the participants was carried out by going among the Gypsy population and living with them . Visits were made to all the areas of GPE with a Gypsy population \u2013 both nomadic and settled DATE and in this way an effort was made to establish the facts about their way of life , traditions , beliefs , forms of worship and practices , not only by gathering data and documentary and other material , but also by the empirical method of living among them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In the book , the author devoted a chapter to the \u201c NORP of Contemporary Turkey \u201d . In this chapter he stated :", "\u201c DATE \u2019s NORP are scattered all over GPE . They are principally located in the LOC , LOC and LOC regions , with a lower concentration in LOC , central GPE and south - east NORP regions . The distribution of NORP in GPE will be dealt with here .", "...", "So far no general population census has included separate records for NORP ; hence , the size of the Gypsy population in GPE is not known with certainty . Rather than using estimated figures , we obtained information from NORP themselves , from local people living nearby and from local administrators . We attempted to clarify this information by making a comparison with the overall district population figures which we received from the district chiefs [ muhtar ] .", "...", "GPE", "...", "NORP living within the provincial borders of GPE generally make their living from music , flower - selling , scrap - metal dealing , rubbish and paper collection , blacksmithing and ironworking , portering , fortune - telling , cleaning , working with a horse and cart , coppersmithing , slug - collecting and door - to - door selling . There are also some , albeit few in number , who make a living from pickpocketing , stealing and selling narcotics .", "Tekirda\u011f", "...", "The Roma ( NORP ) of NORP make their livelihood from playing music , portering and shoe - shining .

Nearly all of the inhabitants of the Yukar\u0131 GPE district of ORG earn their livelihood from music . The rest of them work in various sectors such as labouring in the rice fields , concrete - pouring on construction sites , portering , working with a horse and cart , collecting frogs and slugs , scrap - metal dealing , paper collection , house painting and selling simit [ a type of bread roll ] . Those in ORG live from scrap - metal dealing , tinsmithing and basket - making .", "...", "GPE", "...", "The NORP of the central district of GPE earn their living from stealing , begging , door - to - door selling , fortune - telling , zercilik [ robbing jewellery stores ] and making magical charms . A small number are also involved in tinsmithing , working with leather harnesses , sieve - making and basket - making . There are also many who work as musicians in nightclubs . It is reported that most of those who trade in ironmongery around GPE and GPE are NORP from GPE .", "...", "We attempted to visit every province and district where NORP were located . The figures which we have given for each province were obtained by comparing information , noting the exaggerated figures given by the NORP and then talking to the district chiefs [ muhtar ] , and where necessary the district police . ... \u201d", "Similar remarks to the ones quoted above were made in respect of the GPE population living in other parts of GPE such as GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The closing paragraphs of the conclusion to The NORP of GPE read as follows :", "\u201c The most important links connecting the NORP to each other are their family and social structures as well as their traditions . Despite the fact that they have led a nomadic life for DATE , they have managed to protect their traditional way of living thanks to the practice of marrying within the group . Their attachment to these traditions begins at birth and continues till death . Doubtless , tradition is the most significant factor in the Gypsy way of life . The elderly members of Gypsy society bear the heaviest responsibility for protecting and sustaining the traditions . However , due to ever - changing circumstances and needs , the social structure of the GPE has become difficult to preserve . In particular \u201c GPE \u201d , CARDINAL of these social structures , can no longer be sustained in DATE \u2019s GPE .", "The most striking characteristic of NORP is their way of living . Hence , all branches of socio - cultural activity , consisting of migration and settlement , dance , music , language , eating and drinking , fortune - telling , sorcery and occupations , constitute the true nature of Gypsy life . That is to say , these elements form the visible part of the iceberg . Other persons usually recognise Gypsies through these phenomena . Nevertheless , the way to truly know GPE is to mingle with their society and fully analyse their traditions and beliefs . The secret world of the NORP reveals itself through their beliefs , in particular through their superstitions and taboos .", "NORP , like everyone , feel the need to have faith and to worship . In addition to adopting the religion of the country they live in , they also perpetuate the traditional beliefs specific to their culture . Consequently , it is observed that NORP have genuine feasts and celebrations stemming from their beliefs , which can be partly traced to NORP .", "In our opinion these people , who suffer from humiliation and rejection everywhere , could be transformed into citizens who are an asset to our ORG and our nation once their educational , social , cultural and medical problems are addressed . This simply entails focusing on this issue with patience and determination . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a petition with ORG on behalf of ORG associations .
