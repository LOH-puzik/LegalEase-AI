{"ITEMID": "001-67243", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF HENWORTH v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON was murdered in the flat he had shared with the applicant for DATE . He had been clubbed over the head with what was probably a hammerhead in a sock and possibly another weapon . The applicant was arrested and charged with murder on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was tried for the murder of PERSON , the issue for the jury being whether it was the applicant who was responsible for the murder . He was convicted on DATE and on CARDINAL DATE appealed against the conviction . On DATE , the conviction was quashed by ORG on the basis that the judge had misdirected the jury . A retrial was ordered which took place DATE and CARDINAL DATE , when the jury was unable to reach a verdict and was discharged .", "CARDINAL . The ORG elected to proceed with a second retrial which began on DATE . At the outset counsel had unsuccessfully submitted that it was oppressive and an abuse of process to try the applicant again , after CARDINAL unsuccessful trials . During the trial the applicant dispensed with the services of his counsel and solicitor and proceeded to defend himself , with assistance from a new solicitor . There came a point where he no longer felt able to do so and requested an adjournment . On DATE , the jury was duly discharged , and a further retrial began on DATE . The applicant did not give evidence at that trial . On DATE , he was convicted , by a majority of CARDINAL , and was sentenced to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . At each of the trials the ORG 's case was essentially the same , except that a witness called GPE , to whom the applicant allegedly made a confession whilst they shared a prison cell , was not relied upon after the first trial , the ORG being of the view that they were not able to present him as a witness of truth . In addition , from the CARDINAL prosecution witnesses called to give evidence at the first trial , CARDINAL were later called .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant appealed against the conviction . He argued inter alia that the second retrial ( in DATE ) was an abuse of process , in that it flouted the convention in LANGUAGE law that if the prosecution has failed to secure a conviction on two occasions it does not then seek a further trial . Although the circumstances were different from those usually relied upon ( namely the failure of the jury to reach a verdict on QUANTITY occasions ) , it was argued on the applicant 's behalf that the first conviction was found not to be safe and so could not be relied upon and on the second occasion the jury could not agree . The discharge of the jury in DATE should have been the end of the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG found that there was no reason to conclude that the practice was applicable in the particular circumstances of the applicant 's case . The court noted that there was a practice but not a rule of law for the prosecution not to offer evidence where CARDINAL juries have disagreed and found no general principle existed barring further retrial where the prosecution had failed twice to secure a conviction . It said :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Where a serious crime has been committed and it is shown that there is a case to answer as far as a defendant is concerned , there is a clear public interest in having a jury decide positively CARDINAL way or another , whether that case is established .", "CARDINAL . Having said that , we recognise the possibility that in any given case a time may come when it would be an abuse of process for the prosecution to try again . Whether that situation arises must depend on the facts of the case which include , first , the overall period of delay and the reasons for the delay ; second , the results of previous trials ; thirdly , the seriousness of the offence or offences under consideration ; and fourthly , possibly , the extent to which the case now to be met has changed from that which was considered in previous trials .", "CARDINAL . Here the prosecution case did change in that reliance ceased to be placed on the evidence of a man called GPE , a prisoner who had given evidence in the first trial as to what had allegedly been said by the [ applicant ] . But the changes in the prosecution case can not , in our judgment , have rendered it impossible for the [ applicant ] to have a fair trial . The reality was he no longer had to face evidence which was adduced in the previous trial as to what he himself had said when attempting to deal with the evidence of GPE . ...", "CARDINAL . ... For the reasons we have given we are satisfied that the abuse of process argument was rightly rejected here . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG refused leave to appeal to ORG , but certified CARDINAL questions of law of general public importance , namely ,", "\u201c CARDINAL . Whether a defendant having been tried twice without a safe verdict being returned it is oppressive to try him a third time and hence an abuse of the court 's process .", "CARDINAL . Whether it is oppressive for the ORG to depart from its established practice of not trying a defendant for a third time , absent compelling fresh evidence or conduct by the defendant causing the retrials . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused the petition for leave ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
