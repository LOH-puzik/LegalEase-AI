These CARDINAL are living in GPE while the first applicant is residing in GPE , in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE ) .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant belongs to the GPE ( ethnic NORP of NORP origin ) and he was born and raised in the city of GPE in the eastern part of GPE ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . In DATE he fled to GPE because he was a member of an illegal political party in the ORG . In DATE he travelled to GPE to participate in military training but he returned to GPE at DATE .

When deciding the DATE imprisonment , ORG took into account the detriment caused to the first applicant by the expulsion and reduced the normal prison sentence , which would have been DATE imprisonment .", "Concerning the expulsion , ORG had requested ORG to submit its observations on the matter . ORG observed that the reasons invoked by the first applicant at the time when he was granted a permanent residence permit were not such that , according to the current practice , he would have been granted such a permit on humanitarian grounds . However , the ORG found that it could not be excluded that , due to the situation in the ORG , there might be an impediment to the enforcement of an expulsion order .", "ORG considered that the first applicant had a strong connection to GPE because of his family and the fact that he had resided there for DATE by that time . However , it noted that he had been convicted of lesser offences on CARDINAL previous occasions : unlawful driving in DATE , aggravated unlawful driving in DATE , unlawful driving and aggravated drink - driving in DATE , shop - lifting in DATE and the unlawful use of documents in DATE . Moreover , the present offence was of a very serious nature having regard to the amount of heroin and its dangerousness to individual abusers and society as a whole .

On DATE the Government rejected the request on the grounds that there was neither any impediment against the enforcement of the expulsion nor any other special reason under LAW to revoke the expulsion order .", "In DATE the applicants lodged a new application with the ORG , requesting the revocation of the expulsion order . Primarily , the applicants invoked humanitarian grounds and LAW , claiming that it would be inhuman to separate the family , in particular having regard to the children and their need for their father during their up - bringing . However , the first applicant also alleged that the very unstable situation in the ORG , and the fact that he belonged to a minority which was discriminated against , constituted impediments to his expulsion . With reference to ORG statement that he had visited relatives in LOC during DATE , he stated that he had not visited the ORG since he came to GPE in DATE , but that the visit had been to GPE .", "On DATE , after a request by the Government , ORG ( Migrationsverket ) submitted its observation regarding the matter . It considered that the situation in the ORG had significantly improved after a peace agreement with GPE in DATE and a deal between the ORG and rebel groups in DATE . Thus , ORG found that there was no general impediment to sending persons back to that country . It noted that the ORG shared this view . It further considered that , even with regard to first applicant 's ethnicity , there was no personal impediment to enforcing the expulsion order against him .", "The first applicant objected to ORG conclusions , stating that he had no relatives in GPE and would not be able to support himself if sent there . He invoked a statement , dated DATE , by PERSON , an Information Officer at ORG ( PERSON ) , in which Mr ORG stated that the situation in the ORG was still very unstable and that fundamental human rights were not guaranteed . Moreover , since the first applicant did not have any relatives in GPE and did not speak the local language of the area , he would not be able to survive there and would face grave risks because he was GPE and this group was discriminated against and disliked in most parts of the country .", "On DATE the first applicant was conditionally released from prison but placed in detention awaiting expulsion .", "On DATE the Government rejected the request to have the expulsion order revoked , finding no reason to change their previous decision .", "On DATE , DATE , the first applicant was expelled to the ORG .

He regularly calls his CARDINAL children , and his eldest son transfers money to him DATE .", "Pursuant to LAW , LAW ( ORG ) , a crime may , apart from ordinary sanctions , result in special consequences defined by law . Expulsion on account of a criminal offence constitutes such a special consequence .", "Provisions on expulsion on this ground are laid down in LAW . According to LAW , section CARDINAL of the LAW , an alien may not be expelled from GPE on account of having committed a criminal offence unless certain conditions are satisfied . First , he or she must have been convicted of a crime that is punishable by imprisonment . Secondly , he or she may only be expelled if the sentence is more severe than a fine , and if ( CARDINAL ) it may be assumed , on account of the nature of the crime and other circumstances , that he or she will continue committing crimes in GPE , or ( CARDINAL ) the offence , in view of the damage , danger or violation involved for private or public interests , is so serious that he or she ought not to be allowed to remain in the country .", "Furthermore , under LAW , section CARDINAL of the Act , when considering whether or not an alien should be expelled , the court shall take into account the person 's links to NORP society . As regards aliens who are considered to be refugees and in need of protection in GPE , they may be expelled only if they have committed a particularly serious crime and it would entail a serious danger for public order and safety to allow them to remain in GPE . An alien with refugee status shall be considered as a refugee in need of protection in GPE unless it is evident that he or she is no longer a refugee in such need .", "Moreover , the court must have regard to the general provisions on impediments to the enforcement of an expulsion decision . Thus , pursuant to LAW , LAW , there is an absolute impediment to expelling an alien to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . Further , a risk of persecution generally constitutes an impediment to enforcing an expulsion decision .", "According to LAW , section CARDINAL of the LAW , if the Government finds that a judgment or decision to expel a person on account of having committed a criminal offence can not be executed or if there are otherwise special reasons not to enforce the decision , the ORG may repeal , in part or completely , the judgment or decision of the court . The ORG may also , in accordance with LAW , LAW , of ORG ( Regeringsformen ) , pardon or reduce a penal sanction or other legal effect of a criminal act ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
