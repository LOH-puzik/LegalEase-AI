POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE and living in GPE .", "A.", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s criminal conviction in DATE", "In DATE , during the martial law which was in force in GPE at that time , the applicant was convicted of disseminating anticommunist leaflets .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s claim for restitution of property", "Apparently in DATE , within the framework of agrarian reform , the applicant \u2019s father was awarded a plot of land in S. Later his ownership was listed in the land register run by ORG .", "In DATE the municipal administration gave a decision by which the plots in S. were taken over by the ORG , pursuant to the DATE Decree allowing for expropriation of agricultural lands which were not used by their owners , considering that the land in question had not been farmed by the applicant \u2019s father .", "In DATE an administrative decision was issued by virtue of ORG of DATE to the effect that a certain PERSON had become the owner of this plot .", "The applicant \u2019s father was also awarded other plots in K. In DATE this land was likewise expropriated by an administrative decision .", "", "In reply to the applicant \u2019s enquiry about the possibility of restitution of these plots , in a letter of DATE ORG informed him that the plot in S. had been awarded to PERSON pursuant to ORG of DATE and that he had obtained an administrative decision to the effect that he had become the owner of this plot . The plot located in PERSON had been taken over by the ORG under the Decree allowing for expropriation of agricultural lands , which were not used by their owners . Therefore the applicant \u2019s request for restitution could not be granted .", "On an unspecified later date the applicant lodged a civil action against ORG with ORG , claiming that the nationalisation decisions be declared null and void for being unlawful . He further claimed restitution of the plots in PERSON and PERSON and compensation for damage he had sustained as a result of the allegedly unlawful expropriation decisions . He claimed in particular compensation for lost profits resulting from the fact that the farms could not have been used as a result of their nationalisation .", "On DATE lCARDINAL the Suwa\u0142ki ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s action , considering that civil courts lacked jurisdiction to examine the applicant \u2019s claims for restitution of property .", "The applicant appealed against this decision , claiming that the expropriation decisions were not in conformity with the laws in force at the time when they had been given .", "On DATE ORG upheld the contested decision . The court noted that the applicant sought a judicial review of administrative decisions before the civil court and , eventually , a declaration that they should be declared null and void for being unlawful . However , under legal provisions concerning jurisdiction of ordinary courts and of ORG , civil courts lacked jurisdiction to examine appeals against administrative decisions . The court observed that had ordinary courts been allowed to examine appeals against administrative decisions , this could have led to situations in which contradictions would arise between final decisions rendered by the courts and by the administrative court in respect of the same administrative decision . The court further observed that both decisions about which the applicant complained could not be reviewed in any judicial proceedings . The court referred in this respect to the decision of ORG of DATE ( decision III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Consequently , the decision under appeal was in conformity with the law .", "On an unspecified later date the applicant lodged with ORG an appeal against the administrative decisions of DATE and DATE .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeals , considering that under LAW Supreme Administrative Court Act an administrative decision could not be appealed against to that court if administrative proceedings in which the decision had been rendered , had been instituted before DATE .", "On DATE the Minister of ORG refused to lodge an extraordinary appeal against this decision , finding that it was in conformity with the law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s efforts to be awarded veteran status", "By a letter of DATE the Veterans\u2019 Office informed the applicant that his request to have veteran status awarded to him could not be satisfied . It was further stated that he had been convicted in DATE , whereas the Veterans\u2019 Act provided for granting veteran status only to persons who had been persecuted by the communist authorities in DATE . Therefore he did not meet the relevant legal requirements .", "The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG which was rejected on DATE , the ORG considering that no appeal to the court against an information of an administrative body lay , and that no administrative decision had been given in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s social insurance entitlements", "On DATE ORG quashed a decision of ORG concerning the applicant \u2019s retirement benefits and ordered that the case be reconsidered and that the ORG issues a new decision .", "On DATE the ORG gave a new decision . The applicant appealed .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against a decision of ORG .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against this judgment .", "On DATE ORG , in reply to the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , informed him that his complaint did not comply with the relevant legal requirements since it had not been drafted and signed by a lawyer . He was further informed that the constitutional complaint could not be lodged as an ordinary appeal against individual judicial or administrative decisions , but that its purpose was to call in question the compatibility with the LAW of legal provisions , which served as a legal basis for an individual decision .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant legal aid to be paid by the legal aid scheme , and a lawyer was assigned to represent him in the proceedings before ORG . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the lawyer informed the applicant that his complaints did not satisfy the requirements of the constitutional complaint as set out by law .", "The applicant complained to ORG . By a letter of DATE ORG informed him that the lawyer \u2019s conduct was not open to criticism , given that the constitutional complaint could not be lodged against individual decisions . ORG could only examine whether laws which had served as a basis for an individual decision were compatible with LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against a decision of ORG concerning the calculation of periods giving rise to the applicant \u2019s retirement pension .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "CARDINAL . Administrative proceedings by which a final administrative decision can be declared null and void", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that an appeal can be lodged against a second - instance administrative decision with ORG on the ground that the decision is not in conformity with the law . LAW states that the ORG shall set the decision aside wholly or in part if it establishes that the decision was issued in breach of substantive law ; that the proceedings leading to the decision were flawed with a deficiency which led to the decision being null and void ; or if such procedural shortcomings had occurred in the proceedings leading to the decision which would justify reopening of the proceedings .", "LAW permits the amendment or annulment of any final administrative decision at any time where necessary in the general or individual interest if this is not prohibited by specific legal provisions . In particular , a final administrative decision can be annulled if it has been issued by an authority , which had no jurisdiction or without a legal basis or contrary to the applicable law .", "In DATE , by virtue of ORG , the judicial review of second - instance administrative decisions was introduced . LAW relating to temporal scope of its jurisdiction provided that an administrative decision could not be appealed against to the ORG if administrative proceedings in which the decision had been given , had been instituted before DATE .", "CARDINAL . Provisions concerning the regulation of ownership of agricultural property", "Article CARDINAL of ORG of DATE provides that the general provisions of LAW concerning amendment or annulment of final administrative decisions do not apply to decisions confirming the ownership of agricultural real property issued in accordance with ORG of DATE .", "A decision of ORG of DATE states that LAW does not confer a right to claim before a civil court that such decisions be declared null and void ( decision III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Veteran status", "The PERSON of DATE on NORP and Other Victims of War and Post - War Repression repealed the PERSON of CARDINAL DATE on the Special Status of Veterans and enacted new criteria on which veteran status can be granted .", "Under LAW , which was subsequently replaced by LAW , veteran status gives rise to various special employment and social insurance entitlements . The periods of veteran service are taken into account in calculating the periods giving rise to seniority . The same periods are multiplied by CARDINAL in calculating periods giving rise to a retirement pension . Veterans who remain in employment are entitled to CARDINAL days\u2019 additional paid leave per year . They are entitled to retire earlier than other employees : women at DATE , and men at DATE , if they have satisfied another requirement for the acquisition of a retirement pension , i.e. if they have worked for periods set out in LAW . The retired veterans are further entitled to the special veterans\u2019 benefit , paid together with their retirement pension as a certain fixed sum .", "CARDINAL . Constitutional complaint", "Under LAW DATE , every person whose constitutionally guaranteed rights or freedoms were breached , is entitled , pursuant to procedure set out by a statute , to lodge a constitutional complaint with ORG , claiming that a statute law enacted by ORG ( PERSON ) or other legal provision , which served as a legal basis for a final judicial or administrative decision by which his or her rights , freedoms of obligations were determined , are incompatible with the LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
