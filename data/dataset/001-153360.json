In DATE and DATE teachers at the school refused to teach the applicant because of the alleged assault . On DATE the teachers went on strike . In order for the strike to be resolved , the applicant voluntarily excluded himself from school and was provided with alternative educational assistance .", "CARDINAL . The strike nonetheless generated a great deal of publicity . CARDINAL articles appeared in ORG ( CARDINAL of GPE main DATE newspapers ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first article carried the headline \u201c Details of school \u2018 ORG revealed \u201d and continued :", "\u201c Details of the alleged attack which sparked the ORG strike at [ the school ] have been released exclusively to ORG ...

This article also contained details from the monitoring diary , including the applicant \u2019s marks for behaviour and comments made by teachers .", "CARDINAL . During the strike , the media made enquiries of the police , the ORG and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) as to what action had been taken in respect of the alleged assault at the school . The ORG , through a ORG press release , informed the media that a youth had been reported to the ORG by ORG ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) , that a decision had been issued and that there would be a first appearance on summons in DATE on a charge of assault . In response to further queries , the PPS informed the media that the youth \u2019s court appearance would take place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The press release did not disclose the applicant \u2019s name , age or school . However , subsequent media reports connected the youth in the press release to the previous stories about the strike at the school . Although the applicant \u2019s name was not published , his age , the name of his school and the date of his hearing before ORG were disclosed in these reports .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to the PPS asking it to explain its decision to issue the press release . They also invited the PPS to withdraw the summons and reissue it without informing the media that a new court date had been set .", "CARDINAL . In the absence of a reply from the ORG , the applicant issued judicial review proceedings in which he contended that the information it had disclosed to the ORG and the press constituted an unjustified interference with his rights under LAW ( see section CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in order to have the media excluded from the trial , the applicant applied to ORG for the case to be adjourned to a date not to be announced in open court . The application was refused by GPE , who instead adjourned the hearing to DATE and ordered that CARDINAL reporters could attend it .

Those arguments were heard on DATE . ORG was represented and opposed the applicant \u2019s application for exclusion ; the PPS made no representations .", "CARDINAL . After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments , the District Judge refused the application on the ground that , due to the extent of the publicity in the case , much of it from the perspective of the teacher alleged to have been assaulted , the applicant would be disadvantaged by a media ban because it would mean his version of events would not be aired .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought judicial review of the District Judge \u2019s decision , relying on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and Article CARDINAL ) of LAW on the Rights of the Child ( see Relevant law and practice below ) .", "CARDINAL .

However , on DATE the applications were dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The Divisional Court accepted that LAW was engaged as the applicant had a reasonable expectation of privacy due first , to the statutory scheme in place under the DATE Order ; and secondly , to the personal intrusion which had arisen from the extensive nature of the media reporting of the case . In reaching this conclusion , ORG did not consider the applicant \u2019s complaints individually but instead had general regard to the intrusive nature of the media reports taken as a whole .", "CARDINAL . Having found that Article CARDINAL was engaged , ORG went on to consider whether the ORG had been justified in the disclosures it made and whether ORG had been justified in allowing CARDINAL members of the press into the hearing . In respect of the PPS disclosures , ORG found that it was the responsibility of the media not to publish anything that disclosed the name , address or school of a child covered by LAW and the ORG had not been under any obligation to warn the media of its responsibilities .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the attendance of the press at the hearing , ORG found that the public interest in securing open justice had outweighed the interest of the applicant in preventing reporting of the case . It added that , in the course of ORG hearing , personal material relating to the applicant might be disclosed in which there was little or no public interest . However , ORG considered that ORG would make appropriate orders preventing publication of such information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused to certify a point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s trial began on DATE .

NORP Before the trial , the applicant \u2019s solicitors had complained to the police about the conduct of the media and alleged that the school had breached its obligations under LAW DATE in releasing personal information about him to the media . The police advised the applicant \u2019s solicitor that the complaint about the release of personal information to the media would be forwarded to Information Commissioner as that aspect of the complaint was not a matter which they could investigate . The police took a statement from the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG wrote to the applicant \u2019s solicitor to confirm that a report has been submitted to the PPS and its advice and direction were awaited . On DATE the ORG notified the applicant \u2019s solicitor that the PPS had advised that the offence in question was a summary only offence and , as such , had become statute barred DATE after the date it was committed . No prosecution could therefore be brought .", "CARDINAL .
