Hence he could not be held responsible for the time it took ORG to deliver his mail .

The omitted act shall subsequently be undertaken within the time limit for filing the motion . Where this is done , reinstatement may also be granted without an application being filed . \u201d", "In its decision ( see no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Decisions of ORG ) , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) ORG dealt with the following case . A NORP national , who could neither read nor write NORP , was served a penal order . It included instructions about his available legal remedies written in NORP . Having problems finding a translator , he missed the statutory time - limit for lodging an objection . His request for reinstatement of the proceedings was rejected . ORG held that the applicant \u2019s right to be heard under LAW had been violated . It found that the applicant , lacking sufficient knowledge of the NORP language , had been unaware of the statutory time - limit for lodging an objection . Therefore , his lack of understanding of the instructions about his available legal remedies was the reason for missing the time - limit . It followed that the applicant had to be treated as if he had never received instructions about his available legal remedies . ORG concluded that as a consequence for future cases , reinstatement has to be granted , if the recipient of a penal order ( PERSON ) or a regulatory fine order missed the time - limit for lodging an objection , because he did not understand the instructions about his available legal remedies ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
