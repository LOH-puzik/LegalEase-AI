BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr Rumen PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in Ahtopol . He was represented by Mr M. Ekimdjiev , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant obtained construction rights over a plot of municipal land in GPE , the municipality of PERSON ( formerly GPE ) . In accordance with the relevant law as in force at the time , the municipal authorities issued an order granting construction rights and also entered into a contract with the applicant . The surface of the plot was QUANTITY . The price was set at CARDINAL \u201c old \u201d NORP levs ( ORG ) , which the applicant paid on DATE . At that time LAW was the equivalent of CARDINAL average DATE salaries in the country .", "The contract stipulated , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s right to construct a building would expire in the event of his failing to complete the building within DATE .", "The applicant hired an architect and on DATE he obtained a building permit for a CARDINAL - storey house of QUANTITY to be constructed on the plot . The applicant also purchased construction material , transported it to PERSON and stored it there .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the municipal building authorities refused to authorise the commencement of the construction works as the technician who had visited the site had noted that a high - voltage electricity conduit passed over the plot .", "It appears that during the same period persons claiming rights over neighbouring plots obstructed the applicant \u2019s preparations for the construction of his house . In DATE the applicant brought an action against them , seeking damages . The municipality of PERSON was summoned as a third party . By judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim against the neighbours , noting that the impossibility for the applicant to realise his project was only imputable to the municipality which had sold him construction rights over the plot in disregard of the fact that constructing a building there was not allowed owing to the passage of a high - voltage electricity conduit .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant wrote to the municipality asking them to provide him with another plot . He allegedly received assurances that that would be done later .", "By decision of CARDINAL DATE the local land commission ordered the restitution of the land on which the applicant had obtained construction rights to the heirs of the person who had owned it prior to the collectivisation of agricultural land in GPE in DATE .", "In DATE the applicant travelled to GPE and started working there .", "On DATE the mayor of PERSON issued an order cancelling the applicant \u2019s construction rights .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant brought an action against the municipality of PERSON seeking restitution of the price paid by him under the DATE contract and damages for breach of contract . Initially he claimed BGL CARDINAL . On DATE he increased the claim to ORG CARDINAL .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG partially granted the claim . On an appeal by the applicant , on DATE the ORG increased the award . The final judgment was that of ORG of DATE , which upheld ORG judgment .", "The courts found , inter alia , that the PERSON municipality had breached the DATE contract with the applicant in that it had granted him construction rights over a plot which could not be built over and had failed to remedy that situation despite his complaints . It followed that the municipality was liable to pay all ensuing damages . The applicant had proven the alleged losses in respect of the price paid by him in DATE to the municipality ( LAW ) , the architect \u2019s fees paid by him in DATE ( ORG CARDINAL ) and the expenses incurred by him in DATE for the transport of construction material ( BGL CARDINAL ) .", "The remainder of his claims , which concerned alleged loss of profits , were dismissed as unproven . The applicant had stated that in normal circumstances he would have completed the house within DATE and would have rented it DATE during DATE . The courts found that the applicant had not substantiated the alleged loss of profits . He had relied solely on information about average property and rental prices at the relevant time .", "The amount awarded to the applicant was thus BGL CARDINAL plus interest . Owing to the depreciation of the NORP currency , by DATE , when the award became enforceable , it represented , together with all interest accrued , the equivalent of not QUANTITY ( ORG ) .", "In his appeals before ORG and ORG the applicant protested that the courts had awarded him sums which had become worthless . He insisted that the award should be commensurate to the value of the actual damage he had sustained .", "In reply to those arguments the courts stated that in accordance with the relevant law and established practice the applicant was entitled to compensation for the actual damage suffered at the time when it was occasioned .", "In DATE the applicant submitted a claim in which , in confused terms , he sought a declaration that the mayor \u2019s order of CARDINAL DATE was null and void and also requested compensation . The courts interpreted the claim as an action for a declaration of nullity and rejected it as unfounded by final decision of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
