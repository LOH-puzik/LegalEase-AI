FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 6+6-3-d - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing) (Article 6 - Right to a fair trial;Article 6-3-d - Witnesses);No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6-2 - Presumption of innocence)", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE the applicant was questioned by the police about suspected dishonesty as a debtor . Subsequently , charges were brought against him . The trial before FAC ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) involved DATE of hearings . The court received testimony from the defendants , the complainants and CARDINAL witnesses . On CARDINAL May and DATE the prosecution presented documentary evidence , including some documents drawn up by a PERSON , who was working off - shore for a bank and who , in answer to a letter rogatory sent by ORG ( keskusrikospoliisi , centralkriminalpolisen ) to the GPE authorities , had produced documents ( including \u201c notes for archives \u201d pertaining to meetings on CARDINAL and DATE and charts ) related to a plan to transfer funds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of CARDINAL counts of dishonesty as a debtor and CARDINAL counts of aggravated tax fraud . He was sentenced to DATE and DATE imprisonment . The ORG judgment ran to CARDINAL pages . In short and in so far as relevant , the court found on the basis of , inter alia , the testimonies of GPE , PERSON , the applicant and his brother and the documentary material , including the documents obtained from the GPE authorities , that the applicant and his brother had discussed the planned transfers of assets with PERSON It also found that the documentary evidence pertaining to the off - shore companies and the transfer of moneys proved that the assets acquired from the sale of the \u201c bank group ORG had been transferred via companies specified in PERSON 's charts to trusts , the beneficiaries of which the brothers had appointed . As both brothers had been present during the negotiations with PERSON on DATE and the plan to transfer funds had been proved to have materialised , the court found that they had acted together in , inter alia , removing the funds from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) . In his grounds of appeal he submitted , inter alia , that the documents drawn up by PERSON , resident in GPE , who had not been questioned during the pre - trial investigations or heard as a witness before ORG , should not have been taken into account as he had not had a possibility to respond to that important evidence .", "CARDINAL . In its decisions of CARDINAL and DATE ORG refused , as being unnecessary , the request of the applicant 's co - accused brother that PERSON be heard as a witness . It stated that it would provide further reasons in its judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a preparatory hearing . The applicant 's brother unsuccessfully renewed the request for PERSON to be heard as a witness .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing took place on DATE . The parties and altogether CARDINAL witnesses gave oral evidence , of whom CARDINAL were fresh witnesses . The hearing of CARDINAL other proposed witnesses had been rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of dishonesty as a debtor , CARDINAL counts of aggravated tax fraud and CARDINAL counts of aiding and abetting accounting offences . It sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment and ordered his immediate detention . He also lost his military rank .", "CARDINAL . As regarded the reasons for not hearing PERSON as a witness , the court held , inter alia , that :", "\u201c ORG notes that no request to hear PERSON as a witness was made in ORG although the documents relating to the plan to transfer moneys from the \u201c bank group ORG , had been presented at the hearings of CARDINAL May and DATE ... Also [ the applicant 's brother , who was a co - defendant ] relied , as written evidence , on [ some ] documents drawn up by PERSON without requesting that PERSON be heard as a witness ...", "The documents allegedly drawn up by PERSON have not been drawn up for the purposes of the pending proceedings . The import of the documents can be assessed without hearing him as a witness . The question whether it is necessary to hear him as a witness depends solely on whether such a hearing could produce relevant new information . In assessing this question ORG takes into account the fact that in the District Court PERSON was not proposed as a witness and the fact that the parties have been provided with an opportunity to put forward all their opinions concerning the content and reliability of the documents during the trial .", "ORG notes that the documents in question have been requested by the public prosecutor and ORG by sending letters rogatory to the GPE authorities . ORG does not have any reason to suspect that the documents were drawn up by someone other than PERSON ...", "The documents clearly indicate that there has been a deliberate conspiracy to transfer the assets acquired from the sale of the \u201c bank group ORG to companies established abroad and to invest the moneys . The transfer of assets has been conducted , as later explained in detail in chapter CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , by order of ... [ the applicant and his co - accused brother ] . The question whether PERSON himself thought that he was involved only in legal investment activities is therefore not relevant .", "The documents drawn up by PERSON are however relevant in assessing ... [ the applicant 's and his co - accused brother 's ] possible guilt of the offence of dishonesty as a debtor ... As becomes manifest in the reasons given in considering the charges , ORG has not however decided the matter basing itself entirely on the documents in question . The court has instead assessed the value of the documents in an overall context , [ in NORP kokonaisyhteydess\u00e4 ] in which PERSON can not have anything relevant to say .", "ORG has heard witness PERSON , as requested ... about the events relating to the documents . The testimony of PERSON , which in [ the applicant 's brother 's ] opinion proves the content of the discussions with PERSON , has thus been taken into account ... ORG holds that the requirements of a fair trial do not require that PERSON be heard as a witness either . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal judgment ran to CARDINAL pages . In so far as relevant , the court principally endorsed ORG evaluation of the evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . If an item of evidence that a party wishes to present pertains to a fact that is not material to the case or has already been proved , or if the fact can be proved in another manner with considerably less inconvenience or cost , the court may refuse to admit it ( LAW , LAW as amended by Act no . DATE ) of the Code of Judicial Procedure ) .", "CARDINAL . Chapter DATE , LAW , as in force at the relevant time , provided that a written statement drawn up for a pending or imminent trial , could not be used as evidence , unless specifically provided for by law or unless the court so decided for particular reasons .", "CARDINAL . Chapter DATE , LAW ( as amended by Act no . ORG ) , as in force at the relevant time , provided that ORG was to hold an oral hearing when necessary . LAW , LAW ( as amended by Act no . ORG ) , as in force at the relevant time , provided that ORG could not change a lower court 's conviction based on the evaluation of evidence without holding an oral hearing , unless the case concerned an offence punishable by fines only or unless an oral hearing was manifestly unnecessary , in particular taking into account the defendant 's need for legal protection .", "CARDINAL . The provisions concerning ORG duty to hold an oral hearing were amended ( Act no . PERSON ) with effect from CARDINAL DATE . The new provisions did not apply to criminal proceedings which had commenced prior to the entry into force of the new Code on Criminal Procedure ( laki oikeudenk\u00e4ynnist\u00e4 rikosasioissa , lagen om r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ng i brottm\u00e5l ; Act no . CARDINAL ; in force from DATE ) . The afore - mentioned former provisions applied therefore to the instant case . The new LAW , LAW no . PERSON ) provides that ORG is to hold a hearing , regardless of whether one has been requested , if the decision in the matter turns on the credibility of the testimony received in ORG or on new testimony to be received in ORG . In this event , the evidence admitted in the ORG proceedings is to be readmitted in the principal hearing , unless there is an impediment to this ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-2", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
