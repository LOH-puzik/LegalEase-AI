It went on to hold that , while section CARDINAL ) of the DATE Election of Members of LAW expressly provided for judicial review of some of ORG decisions , this did not mean that the decisions not expressly mentioned therein were not subject to such review , in view of the general rule that judicial review of administrative decisions could be limited only by statute , which was not the case here .
