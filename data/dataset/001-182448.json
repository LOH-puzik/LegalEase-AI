He also contended that he had been erased from the register of domicile and residence in GPE without ever being informed thereof . He was therefore unable to regularise his residence status in GPE and thus to find employment , to move freely without valid documents or to travel , which was neither a lawful nor a proportionate interference with his LAW rights .

ORG further stressed that the applicant had been invited several times to provide a valid travel document and he had promised to contact the embassy of GPE in this connection but had failed to do so . Accordingly , in the ORG \u2019s view , his arguments that he had not been a typical alien and that the relevant authorities had formalistically applied the relevant law had been misplaced . Moreover , there was a possibility for him to obtain a temporary travel document in order to travel to his country of origin so as to obtain a valid travel document .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the ORG \u2019s decision before ORG . He contended that he had been a national of the SFRY and that he had had a registered residence in GPE since he had arrived there in DATE , which had been erased at a later stage .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s administrative action endorsing the reasoning of the ORG \u2019s decision . The applicant challenged these findings before ORG ( ORG upravni sud PERSON ) and the proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL .
