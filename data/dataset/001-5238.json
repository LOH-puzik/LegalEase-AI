CYPRUS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants are CARDINAL enterprises and individuals who are the owners and operators of hotel units and hotel apartments in GPE . Their names are as follows : ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , PERSON , ORG , PERSON , ORG , ORG , PERSON and ORG , ORG , PERSON , ORG , ORG , ORG , PERSON and ORG , PERSON and ORG , PERSON , GPE and PERSON , ORG , ORG , ORG , PERSON ( GPE ) , PERSON , ORG , ORG and ORG", "They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "Under LOC of DATE and Appendix I thereto , based on LAW of DATE , ORG and hotel apartments were charged with sewerage fees at the rate of CARDINAL of a cent for every pound of the assessed value of each building , whereas all other buildings in the same area were charged with fees at the rate of CARDINAL of a cent for every pound of the assessed value .", "CARDINAL owners of hotels in GPE , including the applicants , lodged an application with ORG , sitting at first instance , seeking a ruling that ORG , and in particular Rule CARDINAL , as well as the decision of ORG ) rendering the applicants liable to pay their contribution for DATE , were unconstitutional , illegal and invalid . The applicants argued that ORG acted ultra vires because Rules CARDINAL and CARDINAL and Appendix I fell outside the scope of Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the application considering that the above matter was a regulation and not an administrative decision concerning specific individuals , and thus could not be subject to judicial review according to LAW .", "The applicants appealed to ORG , sitting as an appeal court , which on DATE quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . ORG considered that LAW constituted an executory administrative act which could be challenged under LAW .", "On DATE ORG , ruling on the merits of the case , considered that the applicants\u2019 submission that LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL was limited to contributions of a repayment character was unfounded . The court referred to a previous judgment ( PERSON ORG of GPE ) in which it had held that \u201c the rates in this case were plainly a tax . They constituted a compulsory exaction of money by a public authority for public purposes , enforceable by PERSON and were not a payment for services rendered \u201d . LAW did not link the power to levy a charge with the immediate availability of sewage services but expressly extended this levy to owners or occupants of immovable property which would benefit in the future from such services . Thus by levying a charge , after the initiation of works for a sewage system but before its completion , ORG had not acted ultra vires . The distinction made by the Rules between owners of hotels and hotel apartments , on the one hand , and owners of apartments in ordinary blocks of flats on the other was triggered by LAW , which permitted the imposition of different fees according to the nature of the property . This difference had been acknowledged in the case of ORG and Others v. ORG . ORG had then held that such a distinction was not only legally justified but also fair , having regard to the use and the benefits derived from the sewage system . Moreover , the number of tenants per square meter in hotel accommodation was , in comparison with other immovable property , much higher and , in proportion , the use of the sewage system was more extensive .", "The case of ORG and Others had been brought by certain hotel owners ( including some of the applicants ) who claimed that the decision on their liability to pay sewage charges for DATE was unconstitutional . ORG had sent them notification of the charge and the hotel owners had refused to pay . They claimed that as ORG had not determined the fee due for DATE , it could not expect payment . Further , some parts of Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL were unconstitutional because they conflicted with LAW which provides for non - discrimination ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
