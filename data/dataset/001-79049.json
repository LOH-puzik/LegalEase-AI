{"ITEMID": "001-79049", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "SZULA v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is NORP citizen born in DATE and resident in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr C. Fyfe , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant was sent to a residential approved school at PERSON , ORG , by a court for having committed the offence of stealing a tricycle . He remained there until DATE . The school was associated with an order of religious brothers known as the De La Salle Order . Its certificate of approval was granted by ORG .", "Throughout his time at the school , the applicant was physically and sexually abused by ORG , a teacher at the school . This included being spanked on the bare buttocks , DATE sexual assaults ( usually including PERSON sodomising the applicant ) and being regularly beaten with a riding crop or piece of wood by ORG was assaulted by other persons at the school including the Headmaster ( Brother T. ) , PERSON ( Brother PERSON ) and PERSON The assaults by the latter included the administering of electric shocks .", "In DATE police enquiries into events at the school commenced . CARDINAL individuals , PERSON ( born DATE ) , ORG born DATE ) and PERSON ( born DATE ) were indicted on CARDINAL charges of assault and sexual assault covering a period from DATE to DATE , involving CARDINAL complainers including the applicant .", "In DATE , the CARDINAL men were convicted on various charges , including the administering of electric shocks to the applicant , and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The prosecution of a fourth suspect was withdrawn due to the ill - health of the accused .", "The applicant had been led to understand that a decision about whether to prosecute ORG would be made after this trial . At this point , he was informed by ORG that ORG would not be prosecuted .", "By letter dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitor wrote to ORG advising that they had amassed considerable evidence and requesting that they reconsider whether to prosecute ORG or permit a private prosecution . By letter dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitor forwarded statements from the applicant and CARDINAL other witnesses . This included a statement by GPE that he had seen ORG force a boy to perform oral sex and a statement by PERSON that he had witnessed the sexual abuse of other boys .", "By letter dated DATE , ORG advised that they had decided not to prosecute due to a number of factors , including the age of the accused ( date of birth DATE ) , the age of the offences and the state of the evidence .", "In DATE , the applicant presented a petition for judicial review of the decision of the Lord Advocate not to prosecute ORG , invoking inter alia LAW .", "In DATE the counsel for the Lord Advocate provided a detailed explanation for the failure to prosecute ORG , variously at a meeting on DATE , in written answers to the petition and in a letter from ORG dated DATE . It was explained that on DATE PERSON Fiscal had written a letter to ORG \u2019s solicitors stating that \" after full investigation I have decided not to instigate proceedings . \" He had taken this position as he was aware only of CARDINAL allegation of serious sexual assault made by GPE and this had not been corroborated by any other evidence . The statement of the applicant given to the police on DATE had not made allegations of serious sexual abuse or sodomy by PERSON The police had not at that time sent to him the applicant \u2019s later statement dated DATE which alleged that ORG had sodomised him . The ORG had taken the view that the letter of DATE prevented any future prosecution of ORG relying on the allegation of sodomy by GPE While the ORG reviewed the later allegations made by the applicant and the police carried out further investigation , including interview with ORG , it was considered that the allegations of CARDINAL witnesses were too remote in time from those made by the applicant , that there was insufficient evidence to justify criminal proceedings and that it would not be in the public interest to do so . Since the applicant had not mentioned sodomy in his first detailed statement and only mentioned sodomy in DATE , the inconsistencies would have in any event raised difficulties for the prosecution and there was real doubt that a conviction for sodomy would be obtained . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE , the ORG advised that it would not consent to a private prosecution of ORG", "The applicant lodged an amendment to his claim , challenging the ORG \u2019s contention that the letter dated DATE had barred the prosecution of ORG , arguing that it did not specify any charges which ORG might have faced or formed an unequivocal and unqualified announcement that no proceedings would be taken in respect of any pending charge .", "On DATE , prior to the first hearing in the judicial review proceedings , counsel for the Lord Advocate advised that even if there was no bar to using GPE \u2019s evidence , the ORG would not prosecute as ORG had first been interviewed by the police in DATE and his right to be tried within a reasonable time would prevent a prosecution . In a letter dated DATE , ORG confirmed that given the antiquity of the offences , the fact that Mr PERSON was DATE , the passage of time since ORG \u2019s interview in DATE and his right not to be prosecuted after such a period of time , it was no longer possible to prosecute ORG", "Following advice from senior counsel , the applicant accepted that there was no merit in proceeding with the petition for judicial review . TIME was signed agreeing that the petition should be refused ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
