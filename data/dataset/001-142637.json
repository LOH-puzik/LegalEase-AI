The applicant , a professor of medicine , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a well - known journalist / columnist published an article in the DATE newspaper Cumhuriyet in which he drew attention to the similarities between the books Mother \u2019s Book , written by Professor PERSON I.D. , a prominent academic and president of ORG DATE , and that of Dr PERSON entitled Baby and Childcare . It mentioned , humorously , that the latter must have copied from Professor Dr ORG \u2019s book .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought to the attention of the members of ORG the allegation that Professor PERSON had committed plagiarism in respect of the above - mentioned book .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , acting as the head of ORG of ORG , together with CARDINAL other members of ORG , submitted a CARDINAL - page report in which they took the view that Professor PERSON had committed plagiarism in his book entitled Mother \u2019s Book . They gave CARDINAL examples in this connection . They asked ORG to take various actions in this regard . It appears , however , that no action was taken .", "CARDINAL . Similar allegations were also made by Professor Dr M.T.H. in his book The History of the University in Turkey , CARDINALnd edition , DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE an article written by the applicant entitled \u2018 Ethics of Science and plagiarism\u2019 was published in ORG . In this article the applicant renewed his claim that Professor PERSON had committed plagiarism in his book entitled Mother \u2019s Book .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , a DATE newspaper , ORG , had published a shortened version of the article that was to be published in ORG . The headline read , in small type , \u201c the ORG is establishing an ethics committee to examine the ethics of science of docent candidates \u201d , and in larger type \u201c NORP should first be reprimanded \u201d . A photograph of Professor PERSON accompanied the article .", "CARDINAL . In this article the applicant stated , inter alia , that there were many ways to deviate from the ethics of science , but that the most primitive and dangerous way was to present the work of others as one \u2019s own , that \u201c plagiarism \u201d was , unlike in GPE , an action frowned upon in NORP culture , and those who committed it were seen as common criminals , that such actions were punished by the laws on copyright , and that in developing countries like GPE creative ideas and their products had not yet reached the sacred untouchable status they had in developed countries . In this connection , the applicant noted that the ORG had decided to create an ethics committee to examine the publications of docent candidates . He maintained that plagiarism was so common that the GPE \u2019s decision was well - founded , and proposed that the latter should approach its founder , ORG , and ask him to apologise for the plagiarisms he had committed . In this part of the article the applicant claimed that Professor PERSON \u2019s book Mother \u2019s Book was plagiarised from Dr PERSON book Baby and Childcare . The applicant congratulated GPE for the initiative of the ethics committee , but considered that it was not possible to correct \u201c our ethics of science \u201d without first dealing with this issue . Later in the article the applicant criticised the application of the statute of limitations to plagiarism and the lack of flexibility of the applicable sanction .", "In a small box next to the article the applicant gave an account of his unsuccessful attempt to deal with plagiarism while head of the ethics committee at ORG . In this connection , he referred to the ethics committee \u2019s above - mentioned opinion regarding PERSON and the resistance it had encountered in that respect , prompting the resignation of committee members .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG condemned the above article published in ORG , considering it an attack on Professor PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE Professor PERSON ( \u201c the plaintiff \u201d ) brought a civil action for compensation against the applicant before ORG of First Instance on the ground , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s assertion that the book written by the plaintiff entitled Mother \u2019s Book was plagiarised from PERSON Baby and Childcare constituted an attack on his personality rights .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant brought a civil action for compensation against Professor PERSON on the ground that some of the remarks made by the plaintiff constituted an attack on his own personality rights .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings before ORG of First Instance that court decided to obtain an expert report with a view to establishing the veracity of the applicant \u2019s assertion that the plaintiff had committed plagiarism . It appointed CARDINAL professors of paediatrics and CARDINAL lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant objected to the appointment of the CARDINAL professors of paediatrics on the ground that they both had close links with the plaintiff . In this connection , he stated that CARDINAL of them currently worked and the other one had worked prior to his retirement at ORG , which had been established by the plaintiff , and that they were members of ORG , which was also headed by the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert report , which concluded that there had been no plagiarism , was submitted to the firstinstance court . It held , in brief , that the content of Professor Dr I.D. \u2019s book was \u201c anonymous \u201d information regarding child health and care which organisations such as ORG or ORG sought to have disseminated , that the plaintiff in the introduction to the book stated that the book had been compiled on the basis of questions asked by parents and conclusions reached from scientific research and experience of experts in the field , that it was natural for the CARDINAL books to resemble DATE they were handbooks , and neither of them contained any bibliography or sources . In this connection , it pointed out similarities which existed in other similar handbooks , such as ORG and ORG . The experts also noted that the book in question was not a scientific publication . The report also assessed the merits of the complaint , holding that in the present case the plaintiff \u2019s personality rights had been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( CARDINALth ORG ) , relying on the conclusions reached by the expert report of DATE , held , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s assertion was neither true nor topical . It ordered the applicant to pay compensation to Professor Dr I.D. in the amount of MONEY ( TRL ) , plus interest at the statutory rate applicable from the date of the impugned publication . Counterclaims by the applicant were dismissed , and those decisions subsequently became final , as the applicant did not lodge an appeal in this respect .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal to ORG the applicant argued , inter alia , that CARDINAL of the experts had close ties with the plaintiff and that therefore the expert report was biased . In this connection , the applicant submitted that the first expert was the plaintiff \u2019s student and that the second expert was a student of the first expert and that they were both members of ORG , which had already voiced its opinion on this subject . He maintained that experts should not be chosen from ORG , because those universities had been set up by the plaintiff .", "The applicant further argued , inter alia , that the domestic court had based its decision on the conclusions of an inadequate and biased report which contained praise for the plaintiff and that the applicant \u2019s comments were true , as had been attested to by witness and documentary evidence included in the case file , including a report dated DATE and written by Professor PERSON , Professor of NORP Literature and Comparative Literature at ORG . ( This report compares the DATE edition of Mother \u2019s Book with that of Dr PERSON and concludes , inter alia , that a number of paragraphs and sentences in the plaintiff \u2019s book were copied from PERSON book by way of word - by - word translation and by using other methods considered as plagiarism . The report contains an annex with some examples . ) The applicant further argued , by referring to various examples such as legal changes in domestic law provisions , that the issue of plagiarism was a topical subject .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( CARDINALth Division ) held a hearing and quashed the judgment of the first - instance court . In its decision it held that the first - instance court should first determine whether the allegations of plagiarism were well - founded . In this connection the court , inter alia , found the PERSON report inadequate and not in compliance with the rules prescribed in LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the plaintiff \u2019s request for rectification of its decision .", "CARDINAL . When the case was remitted back to the first - instance court , the latter appointed as experts Professor PERSON , professor of paediatrics , Professor GPE , professor of paediatrics , and Professor PERSON , professor of LANGUAGE . These appointments were made on DATE . All these experts worked at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the experts\u2019 report , which concluded that there had been no plagiarism , was submitted to the firstinstance court . The experts compared the plaintiff \u2019s book with that of PERSON as translated into NORP by PERSON , and noted , inter alia , that there was no similarity between the manner in which the CARDINAL books were conceptualised and shaped , namely the number of pages , picture on the cover , and section headings . Underlining the differences in each section of the book , the experts also concluded that there were no similarities as regards the contents of the book . The experts noted that it was natural for certain information such as ORG scales or symptoms of various childhood illnesses to be similar . In this connection , they held that these were not the \u201c original views \u201d of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the course of the proceedings the applicant objected to the report , particularly on the ground that the first CARDINAL experts worked with a person close to the plaintiff and that they were themselves members of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Following objections to the report by the applicant , on DATE the first - instance court appointed CARDINAL new experts for a second report .", "CARDINAL . On various dates CARDINAL of the court - appointed experts , namely Professor PERSON and Professor PERSON , both professors of LANGUAGE language and literature at ORG , resigned because of a potential conflict of interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the experts\u2019 report prepared by Professor Dr N.A. , professor of paediatrics at ORG , Professor PERSON , professor of paediatrics at ORG , and Professor PERSON , professor of LANGUAGE language and literature at ORG , was submitted to the court .", "CARDINAL . In this report , the experts submitted that they had compared the first edition of the plaintiff \u2019s book , published in DATE , with a copy of PERSON book as originally published . In sum , the experts held that the plaintiff \u2019s book was a popular health book , that it was not a word - for - word translation or citation from PERSON book , that in the first edition of his book the plaintiff referred at the end of his book to PERSON and PERSON as regards the methodology he had followed , that there were sections in the book which did not exist in PERSON book , and that the plaintiff \u2019s book contained national - specific matters and various laws and customs , but that in certain parts of the book there were paragraphs where the translation method had been used and which were similar to PERSON . As regards this last point the experts considered that these parts did not concern scientific information but anonymous information known to all paediatricians , and that following these paragraphs the plaintiff had referred to national- specific matters . They further considered that certain conditions required for scientific books , such as citation of sources , were not required for books published at that time , and that an acknowledgement only in the form of thanks sufficed .", "The experts concluded that the book written by the plaintiff was a popular health book , that in its first edition he had thanked those whose books had inspired him , and that the book was in conformity with the rules of the time of its publication . In this connection , they noted that even DATE reference by full citation was mostly applicable only to scientific and academic books , and that even if such ethical rules should be held to be applicable to popular health books a book written in DATE should not be judged by current standards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office , claiming that the transcript of the court decision of DATE regarding the appointment of experts , namely Professor PERSON , had been tampered with .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( CARDINALth ORG ) ordered the applicant to pay compensation to Professor PERSON I.D. in the amount of MONEY ( TRL ) , plus interest at the statutory rate applicable from the date of the impugned publication .", "In its decision , the court began by stating that , after the parties had asked the court to appoint experts , it had requested a list of qualified experts from all universities in GPE and that it had appointed experts who had not taken part in the academic debate between the parties . It further added that following the applicant \u2019s objection to the first report the court had commissioned a second expert \u2019s report .", "The court , referring to the evidence in the case file , held that the book written by the plaintiff was not a copy of the book written by PERSON , that it was a genuine publication , and that therefore the applicant \u2019s assertion was not correct . It found therefore that there had been an unlawful attack on the plaintiff \u2019s personality rights and scientific career .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining , inter alia , that CARDINAL of the experts , Professor PERSON , was working at ORG , which gave rise to concerns as to her impartiality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( CARDINALth Division ) held a hearing and quashed the judgment of the first - instance court . The court , after referring to the importance of citation of sources in publications , especially scientific publications , held , relying on the information provided in the PERSON report , that a mere reference to PERSON , as regards the methodology followed in the book , in the original edition , was not sufficient to consider that the plaintiff had made a proper reference and that , in addition , in subsequent editions there was no such reference in the book in question . It therefore found no unlawfulness in the applicant \u2019s remarks and held that the case should be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( CARDINALth ORG ) decided not to abide by the decision of ORG , and ordered the applicant to pay compensation to Professor PERSON I.D. in the amount of MONEY ( TRL ) , plus interest at the statutory rate applicable from the date of the impugned publication . In its decision , it held , inter alia , that experts had been appointed in accordance with the previous decision of ORG , that these experts had concluded that there had been no plagiarism , and that the court could not draw conclusions which were contrary to the assessment of the experts . The court held that the applicant had suggested that the plaintiff had committed plagiarism , which under the disciplinary regulation of the ORG required the heavy sanction of expulsion from the university . It underlined in this connection that everyone had the right to criticise a person exercising a public function . However , criticism which overstepped objective boundaries and became unjust vilification or belittling in bad faith was unlawful . In the circumstances of the present case , the court considered that the plaintiff \u2019s personality rights had been infringed .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal to LAW of ORG , the applicant underlined , inter alia , that the first - instance court had failed to properly assess the decision of ORG . In particular , the court had failed to address the fact that there were parts of the book which were translations , and that a reference to PERSON in the first edition , which in any event does not figure in later editions , could not be considered a proper citation . In this connection , the applicant underlined that using a methodology adopted in another book and repeating the same words and paragraphs can not be considered provision of anonymous information , and that there was no scientific basis for the first - instance court \u2019s view that plagiarism only applied to original ideas .", "The applicant repeated , inter alia , that there was no unlawfulness in his assertion that the plaintiff had in his book plagiarised from PERSON book by way of translation and quotations without providing proper references , that this fact was already known by the public as such allegations had been previously made by others and the plaintiff had failed to sue them , and that the voicing of this fact was in the public interest .", "The applicant further criticised the wording of the decision , in particular the use of capital letters to emphasise certain words , and others .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( plenary session ) , by a majority , upheld the judgment of the first - instance court . In its decision , the court held , inter alia , that all the experts\u2019 reports included in the case file since the beginning had insistently underlined that both books were handbooks , that they contained anonymous information and not original ideas developed by the authors , and that therefore it was not necessary to provide references therein . It further considered that , contrary to the experts\u2019 reports , the applicant had since DATE brought similar criticisms against the plaintiff , leading sometimes , as in the present case , to unlawful attacks on the plaintiff \u2019s personality rights . In the present case the applicant in the article in question had insulted the plaintiff and attacked his personality rights instead of assessing the establishment of the ethics committee by the ORG . The court considered that there was not even the smallest connection between the subject of the article and the plaintiff . It therefore found that the subject was not topical . The court maintained that there was no reason why the applicant would include the plaintiff in this subject . It therefore held that the incident , as established by experts\u2019 reports , was not only false but also not topical .", "The court further noted that when it had first quashed the decision of the first - instance court , ORG ( CARDINALth Division ) had held that the veracity of the allegation was to be established by a report written by experts on the subject and that the first - instance court should make its decision on the basis of that report . It therefore held that if the report concluded that there had been no plagiarism , the applicant \u2019s article - as it was not topical - would constitute an attack on personality rights and an award of compensation would be required .", "It considered that since the first - instance court had decided to abide by the above decision of ORG there was an acquired procedural right in favour of the plaintiff . It considered , however , that ORG , in its second decision to quash the first - instance court judgment , had revised its view and , contrary to the PERSON report , had taken the view that the book was a scientific publication . In this connection , the court referred to its case - law in which it had previously held that where an issue required expertise judges could not rule on it on the basis of their own personal views and opinions . It underlined that this case - law was also applicable to ORG . Otherwise , the acquired procedural right would be violated .", "The court underlined the conditions that must be met for compensation to be awarded for an attack on personality rights in the press : unlawfulness , fault , damage and interconnectedness between reason and conclusion . It further held that for a published criticism or news item to be held unlawful there must be a violation under one of the following criteria : truthfulness , topicality , public interest , public good and interconnectedness between the subject , form and idea .", "The court noted that in the present case , according to experts\u2019 reports , the article published in ORG was not true , that the article was not topical , and the opinions expressed in the article exceeded the limits of criticism and insulted the plaintiff .", "It further found that ORG assessment referred to above was contrary to its case - law regarding the assessment of experts\u2019 reports .", "The court therefore found that the first - instance court \u2019s decision to resist ORG judgment was justified . It transferred the case back to ORG of ORG for determination of the amount of compensation .", "CARDINAL dissenting members ( judges sitting on the bench of ORG ) considered , inter alia , that in the instant case the conditions of public interest , topicality and veracity had been met , and that the form and the words used by the applicant in his criticism of an important public figure and academic was not contrary to law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( plenary session ) dismissed a request by the applicant for rectification of its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( CARDINALth Division ) , finding the amount awarded to the plaintiff excessive , reduced the amount of compensation to CARDINAL new NORP liras ( TRY ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( CARDINALth Division ) dismissed the parties\u2019 request for rectification of its decision .", "CARDINAL .
