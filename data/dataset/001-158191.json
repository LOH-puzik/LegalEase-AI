The motion did not contain any reasoning and was not accompanied by any supporting documentation and was , therefore , unsubstantiated . She further argued that judicial decisions were not supposed to be subject to a review other than by way of an appeal procedure prescribed by law . Thus , the commission of gross violations of the law ( the alleged grounds for her dismissal ) could only have been found by a higher court ( which had not happened in her case ) and not by non - judicial bodies and officials , such as ORG or the Minister of ORG .
