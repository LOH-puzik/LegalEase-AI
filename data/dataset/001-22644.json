FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants [ Mr PERSON and PERSON ] are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in LOC ) . They were represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON , of the Paris Bar .", "The applicants are the joint owners of a pharmacy in Salleboeuf .", "On DATE CARDINAL women arrived at the same time at the applicants\u2019 pharmacy to be told in turn that they could not be supplied with the contraceptives prescribed to each of them by their doctors in prescriptions whose validity has never been called into question .", "On DATE the CARDINAL women in question filed a complaint against the applicants for refusing to sell contraceptives on a doctor \u2019s prescription , an offence provided for and punished by DATE , paragraph CARDINAL of Decree no . DATE of DATE and LAW . They lodged a civil - party claim in which they were joined by an association .", "The applicants argued before ORG that the refusal to sell of which they were accused was justified on the legitimate ground that no statutory provision required pharmacists to supply contraceptives or abortifacients . They relied on LAW of LAW , under which pharmacists were not required to supply single or compound preparations based on oestrogens .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG found the applicants guilty of the offences of which they had been accused . ORG noted the following : \u201c LAW , on which the defendants rely , does not in any way concern contraceptive medicines but only abortifacients \u201d ; the products that the applicants had refused to supply were contraceptive medicines \u201c which [ could ] not be regarded as the equivalents of abortifacients \u201d . ORG added : \u201c Ethical or religious principles are not legitimate grounds to refuse to sell a contraceptive . There is no legislation which authorises pharmacists to refuse to supply contraceptives , unlike the provisions relating to doctors , midwives and nurses as regards the termination of pregnancy ( LAW ) \u201d . In conclusion ORG held as follows : \u201c Consequently , as long as the pharmacist is not expected to play an active part in manufacturing the product , moral grounds can not absolve anyone from the obligation to sell imposed on all traders by the law ( LAW ) \u201d . The applicants were sentenced to a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) each and ordered to pay , jointly and severally , ORG CARDINAL in damages to the CARDINAL complainants .", "The applicants appealed against that judgment . In a decision of DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment . It noted that the applicants had never disputed that they had committed the acts of which they were accused and that they had stated that their conduct was dictated by religious reasons . It further observed : \u201c The offences of refusing to sell for which the defendants stood trial did not stem in any way from a practical impossibility to satisfy their customers but were committed in the name of religious convictions which can not be interpreted as a legitimate reason within the meaning of LAW . Thus the failure to stock this type of product in their dispensary was not the cause but indeed the consequence of this refusal on principle \u201d . ORG also noted that the defendants\u2019 pharmacy was the only one in Salleboeuf . It upheld ORG finding that the products which the applicants had refused to sell were not covered by LAW of LAW .", "The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment . They relied in particular on LAW , asserting that the freedom to manifest one \u2019s religion implied that a pharmacist was entitled not to stock contraceptives whose use amounted to an interference with their religious beliefs . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed that appeal . It agreed with ORG finding that \u201c personal convictions ... [ could ] not constitute for pharmacists , who have the exclusive right to sell medicines , a legitimate reason within the meaning of LAW . ORG decision was served on the applicants by a letter from the prosecuting authorities of ORG dated DATE and posted on DATE .", "\u201c It is prohibited to refuse to sell a product or provide a service to a customer for no legitimate reason , to make the sale of a product conditional on the purchase of a compulsory quantity or the concomitant purchase of another product or payment for another service or to make the provision of a service conditional on the provision of another service or the purchase of a product .", "This provision shall apply to all the activities contemplated in the last paragraph of LAW . \u201d", "\u201c The rules relating to the scope of Ordinance no .
