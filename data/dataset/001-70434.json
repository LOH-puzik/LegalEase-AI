Many , if not all the witness statements from the file have been falsified or obtained through pressure and blackmail . Even the graphological examination did not prove that it was PERSON \u2019s signature on the documents , on the basis of which the criminal investigation commenced .... The heads of ORG have put great pressure on me to obtain favourable conclusions from the graphological experts ...", "I can say that the Vice - Ministers U. and PERSON have put pressure on the President of ORG .
