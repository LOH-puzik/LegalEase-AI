The applicant was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge at ORG ( Landgericht ) , having heard the applicant , ordered that he be taken into pre - trial detention on suspicion of , inter alia , embezzlement and continuous aggravated fraud ( file no . CARDINAL Vr CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . He found that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had enticed a number of persons to entrust him with the investment of their capital , which he had then fraudulently diverted using a network of partly foreign companies . Giving detailed reasons , the investigating judge found that there was a danger of absconding , a danger that the applicant might influence witnesses , and also a danger of repetition of the offences . Finally , having regard to the seriousness of the offence , the applicant \u2019s detention was proportionate to the sentence he risked incurring .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) held a hearing on the applicant \u2019s request for release ( GPE ) . The applicant was not represented by counsel at this hearing . Following the hearing , the court ordered that the applicant \u2019s detention be continued . It confirmed the reasons advanced by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Vaduz ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request of CARDINAL DATE to have a legal - aid counsel appointed for him . Regarding the applicant \u2019s submissions concerning his income and assets , and the fact that he was represented by CARDINAL counsel of his own choosing in a second set of proceedings ( file no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , it found that he had sufficient means to pay for counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s representation by legal aid counsel . It noted that the investigations and , in particular , an expert opinion , which had meanwhile been submitted , had shown that the applicant had been living exclusively on money obtained from the investors in his various companies and had therefore no means to pay for defence counsel . In TIME of DATE ORG appointed PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing on the applicant \u2019s renewed request for release .", "CARDINAL . At the beginning of the hearing , the applicant \u2019s counsel pointed out that he had only been appointed at TIME on DATE before and had therefore been limited to TIME of consultation with the applicant without having had a possibility to study the voluminous file . The ORG noted that it had not been informed of the late appointment of counsel for the applicant and drew his attention to the fact that he remained free to request that the hearing be adjourned as the statutory CARDINAL days\u2019 time - limit for its preparation had not been complied with . However , counsel did not request an adjournment .", "CARDINAL . At the close of the hearing , the court ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s detention . It confirmed the reasons given in the decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed PERSON as legal - aid counsel for the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera as a panel of CARDINAL judges , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that he did not have sufficient time to prepare for the hearing of DATE concerning his detention , the court noted that his counsel had waived the right to request an adjournment . There were no reasons to doubt the validity of the waiver .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention be extended to up to DATE on account of the complexity of the case . The investigating judge supported this request on DATE . The applicant was given no opportunity to comment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera as a panel of CARDINAL judges , ordered that the applicant \u2019s detention would be allowed to last DATE , i.e. until DATE at the latest . With regard to the suspicion against the applicant and the danger of absconding and of a repetition of the offences , the court referred to its decision of DATE . Invoking Article CARDINAL of LAW ( Strafprozessordnung ) , according to which detention on remand must not exceed DATE unless the investigations are particularly complex , it found that the present proceedings concerned an exceedingly complex case of white - collar crimes . The offences to be investigated had been committed by a number of co - accused over DATE , numerous companies with links to foreign countries were involved and a great number of witnesses had to be heard , many of them under letters rogatory . A period of detention of DATE appeared proportionate , all the more so because , given the maximum sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , even a further prolongation of the detention to DATE would be admissible under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) declared inadmissible the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that he had not been heard on the requests for prolongation of his detention prior to ORG decision , ORG , referring in detail to ORG ( PERSON ) case - law , found that the right to be heard could also be complied with where the person concerned had a possibility to appeal against the decision . However , it was advisable in the future to hear detainees on requests for prolongation of the detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against ORG decision of DATE . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that he had not been heard prior to the decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG noted that LAW did not require that a detainee be heard prior to a decision to prolong the detention . In these circumstances , the lack of an opportunity to comment was remedied by the possibility to appeal against the decision itself . Nevertheless - as ORG had rightly pointed out - it would be desirable to hear a detainee before deciding on a request for prolongation of the detention . ORG also found that ORG as well as ORG had given sufficient reasons for their decisions .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . It found that ORG had rightly noted that the applicant \u2019s first request for legal aid had , on the basis of his own submissions , been dismissed on the ground that he was not indigent . It added that , even conceding that the applicant lost his income on account of his detention , he had considerable assets and had admitted it . The assumption that he was not indigent was confirmed by the fact that at the time he was represented by CARDINAL counsel of his own choosing in a second set of criminal proceedings . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s financial situation had become transparent only after the expert opinion had been filed in DATE . Shortly afterwards a legal - aid counsel was appointed for him . As to the complaint that the legal aid counsel appointed on DATE did not have sufficient time to prepare for the hearing of DATE , ORG confirmed the finding that counsel had validly waived his right to request an adjournment of that hearing .", "CARDINAL .
