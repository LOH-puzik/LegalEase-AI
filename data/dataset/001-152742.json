POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Guido Raimondi;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant is a co - owner of CARDINAL plots of land located in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a new local development plan . The plan stipulated that a public road was to be constructed on the applicant \u2019s property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant formally requested ORG to alter the local development plan and to adopt a different location for the future road . ORG refused this request in a resolution adopted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG against the resolution of CARDINAL DATE . She alleged , inter alia , that the local development plan had unlawfully designated part of her property for a future road . She argued that such a designation resulted in restrictions on developing her property and the reduction in its value . This amounted to a breach of her property rights .", "CARDINAL . ORG on DATE dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It found that the local development plan constituted an interference with the applicant \u2019s property rights which , however , was justified by the public - interest considerations . The plan did not affect the core of the applicant \u2019s property rights since she retained the possibility to use and to dispose of the property . With regard to the alleged reduction in the value of the property , the court noted that the applicant could have pursued her compensation claim under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant filed a cassation appeal . She argued , inter alia , that ORG had erroneously applied the provisions of LAW . In this respect she submitted that the local development plan had deprived her of the possibility to develop her property and resulted in the reduction of its value . The applicant further alleged that the municipality had not adopted an alternative , less onerous , proposal for the location of the road .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed her cassation appeal . It concurred with the lower court that the location of a road retained by the municipality had been the most favourable to the applicant \u2019s interests . ORG found that the interference with the applicant \u2019s property rights had not been excessive since only part of her property had been designated for a road while the remaining part could be developed .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE questions of land development were governed by LAW on ORG . Under this law owners of properties to be expropriated in the future were not entitled to any form of compensation for damage resulting from restrictions on the use of their property or the reduction in its value originating in expropriations to be carried out at an undetermined future date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new ORG was enacted ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) . It entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act created for local authorities a number of obligations towards owners whose properties were designated for expropriation at an undetermined future date under land development plans adopted by the competent municipal authorities . The municipalities were obliged to buy such property , replace it with other land within DATE of an owner \u2019s request , or provide compensation for the damage caused by the designation .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , pursuant to section QUANTITY , these obligations and the corresponding claims of the owners applied only to plans adopted after LAW had entered into force , i.e. to plans adopted by local authorities after DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the DATE Act , plans adopted before its entry into force were to expire on DATE . In DATE an amendment to the DATE LAW was adopted under which the validity of such plans was extended for a further two years until DATE . Again , on DATE , ORG passed a law amending LAW which extended until DATE the validity of the land development plans adopted before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new ORG was enacted ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . It entered into force on DATE and repealed the DATE Act . Under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act , all local plans adopted before DATE remained valid , but not beyond DATE .", "CARDINAL . Compensation entitlements for owners , provided for by DATE Act , were in essence maintained by LAW . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of the latter Act , when , following the adoption of a new local land development plan , the use of property in the manner provided for by a previous plan had become impossible or had been restricted , it was open to the owner to claim compensation from the municipality for actual damage sustained , or to request the municipality to buy the plot or its part . These claims may be also satisfied by the provision of an alternative property to the owner by the municipality . Any litigation which might arise in this respect between local authorities and owners could be pursued before the civil courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
