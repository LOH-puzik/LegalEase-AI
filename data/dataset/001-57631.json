ORG Mr PERSON , who resides at PERSON , was formerly employed by a private insurance company ( \" the company \" ) as the director of their regional branch office for GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE a dispute arose between the applicant and the company concerning various paid activities which it proposed to withdraw from him . Mr Obermeier instituted proceedings in ORG ( Arbeitsgericht ) .

ORG After having unsuccessfully sought the opening of disciplinary proceedings , the applicant decided to challenge his suspension in the courts . Accordingly , on DATE , he brought , in ORG , an action for a declaratory judgment ( PERSON ) and , in the alternative , an action for performance ( PERSON ) . The first action was intended to establish the invalidity of the contested measure , while the second sought its revocation . He alleged in particular that the measure in question was designed to penalise him for having instituted legal proceedings against the company and was therefore unjustified .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) allowed PERSON appeal as regards the part of the judgment concerning the revocation of the suspension . It considered that by virtue of clause CARDINAL of the collective agreement for insurance employees ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which was applicable , suspension of an employee was subject to certain conditions and that the first - instance court should have ascertained whether they were satisfied . The fact that Mr Obermeier had instituted legal proceedings against his employer could not in itself justify the impugned measure . The court dismissed the remainder of the appeal , finding that , under LAW ) , a declaratory judgment may bear only on the existence of a legal relationship ( Rechtsverh\u00e4ltnis ) and not on the validity of a legal measure ( GPE ) such as the suspension of an employee .", "CARDINAL . ORG The company appealed on points of law to ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) which , on DATE , upheld ORG judgment . The case was therefore remitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the meantime the company had decided to terminate PERSON employment , his dismissal taking the form of \" administrative retirement \" ( administrative GPE ) .

On CARDINAL DATE Mr Obermeier had been declared disabled for the purposes of that LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG took the view that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL left the decision concerning the authorisation in question to its discretion but that it had to exercise that discretion in accordance with the spirit of the LAW , in other words taking account of the legitimate interest of the employer in the dismissal and the employee \u2019s special need for social protection . Following a hearing , the ORG gave its consent to the dismissal on DATE , finding that the relationship of trust between the parties had been irremediably undermined .", "CARDINAL . Mr Obermeier appealed against this decision , alleging inter alia that ORG had failed to hold an inquiry into the case and had obtained only the company \u2019s observations . ORG ( PERSON ) for GPE confirmed the ORG \u2019s decision on DATE , after proceedings in which no argument was taken .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant then appealed to ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) which dismissed his appeal on DATE . It considered that the authorisation for his dismissal given by ORG and confirmed on appeal was not unlawful since it was not vitiated by errors of law ; the contested decision had not exceeded the discretionary power which the law conferred on the administrative authorities in this field ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It added that the procedural requirements had been complied with in the administrative proceedings , in particular as regards PERSON access to the file .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant sought relief from ORG judgment by an application ( no . CARDINAL ) to ORG , which was declared inadmissible on CARDINAL DATE ( Decisions and Reports no . DATE , pp . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Simultaneously with the administrative proceedings relating to the authorisation for the applicant \u2019s dismissal , ORG resumed consideration of his suspension , following ORG decision remitting the case to it ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The company pleaded Mr PERSON \u2019s lack of a legal interest ( NORP ) in the revocation of his suspension , since in the meantime he had been dismissed . The applicant , for his part , challenged the lawfulness of his dismissal . He stressed in particular that it had been pronounced before the authorisation from ORG had become final , as the case was still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the court rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . The dismissal had been pronounced with the authorisation of the competent administrative authority and the proceedings in ORG did not have suspensive effect . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld this judgment , observing that , in the intervening period , ORG had dismissed PERSON appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed on points of law to ORG which , on DATE , quashed the decisions of the labour courts . Overruling its previous case - law , it found that the company should have waited until ORG authorisation had become final ( rechtskr\u00e4ftig ) . Since the applicant \u2019s dismissal was therefore invalid , he had an interest in challenging his suspension ; accordingly , ORG remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following this judgment , the company sent to the applicant , on DATE , a further notification of dismissal , which was to take effect on DATE . On DATE it requested ORG for a retroactive authorisation for the dismissal pronounced on DATE . It alleged that ORG overruling of its own case - law had not been foreseeable and therefore constituted an exceptional case for the purposes of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the ORG rejected the company \u2019s request on the ground that its decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had final effect ( Rechtskraft ) . On appeal by both parties , the Provincial Governor set aside this decision on DATE and gave his retroactive consent to the applicant \u2019s first dismissal .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law to ORG ) which , on DATE , referred the case to ORG . The latter court allowed the appeal on CARDINAL DATE , finding that the company had committed an error of law by dismissing PERSON before the authorisation had become final . Consequently , on DATE , the NORP Governor confirmed the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr Obermeier then asked ORG to declare , pursuant to sections CARDINAL of ORG , that his employment contract subsisted . ORG and the Provincial Governor found , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively , that they lacked jurisdiction to make such a declaration , the matter being one for the ordinary courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following ORG order of DATE remitting the applicant \u2019s case to it ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim on DATE . In its view , the legal proceedings instituted against the company by Mr Obermeier were in no way vexatious and therefore did not justify a measure of suspension , by which the employer had prejudged the outcome of the proceedings pending .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , on an appeal by the company , ORG set aside this decision , notwithstanding the applicant \u2019s request for a stay pending the decisions of ORG and ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG considered itself bound by the Provincial Governor \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE authorising PERSON dismissal as from DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It concluded therefrom that the applicant no longer had any legal interest in obtaining the revocation of his suspension .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law lodged on DATE . It found that ORG had been correct in regarding ORG authorisation as binding ; since only the administrative authorities were competent to apply the Disabled Persons ( Employment ) Act , those authorities were not bound by the opinion expressed by ORG in its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that the conditions laid down in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW in question for the granting of retroactive authorisation were not satisfied . ORG stated that it was not for the civil courts to review the decisions of the administrative authorities . On the contrary , they were required to base their own judgments on such decisions , without any further examination .", "In its judgment , ORG did not take into account the applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG and ORG . Indeed it seems to have been unaware of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Simultaneously with the administrative proceedings instituted by him , PERSON also challenged his dismissal in the labour courts . On DATE he brought an action in ORG for a declaration that his dismissal was invalid . He argued that the company had not waited until the authorisation given by ORG had become final in law and had in addition failed to inform the works council , as it was required to do under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG After having stayed these proceedings on DATE , the court dismissed PERSON action on DATE on the ground that , in the meantime , the NORP Governor had given his retroactive consent to the applicant \u2019s dismissal from employment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The parties did not appeal from this decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant filed an application on DATE for the proceedings to be reopened ( PERSON ) and requested that such proceedings also deal with the second dismissal from employment . ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which allowed this application , was upheld on DATE by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) and , on DATE , by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG Ruling on the merits on DATE , ORG found that Mr Obermeier had never been validly dismissed . It took the view that the effects of the prior authorisation given by ORG were not permanent and that such authorisation could provide the legal basis only for a dismissal which was closely linked to it both in terms of the period of time which had elapsed and as regards the substance ; this was not the case in respect of the second dismissal .", "CARDINAL . ORG On an appeal by the company , ORG set aside this decision on DATE on the ground that the situation was a continuous one so that there was a sufficient connection between the consent given by the administrative authority and the dismissal from employment pronounced on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant claimed that he had cited at the hearing , as an additional ground for the invalidity of his dismissal , disregard of clause CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the collective agreement ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which requires the valid consent of the works council . The transcript of the hearing , notified to the applicant on DATE , did not refer to his statements in this respect ; he therefore lodged an objection to it on DATE , which ORG dismissed on DATE as out of time .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the meantime , the applicant had appealed on a point of law against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE in a supplementary memorial he stressed that for his second dismissal no valid prior consent had been obtained from the works council as was required under clause CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the collective agreement .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE , holding that section CARDINAL of LAW , by virtue of which any dismissal from employment without prior consultation of the works council is invalid , did not apply to a disabled person . In such cases the consultation of the works council had already been effected by the interposition of the Board , acting in pursuance of section LAW . ORG declared the memorial of DATE inadmissible under the rule that CARDINAL appeal may be lodged ( ORG der ORG , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , even before a copy of ORG judgment had been served on him , the applicant instituted new proceedings in ORG , sitting as a social and labour court . He sought a declaration that the second dismissal was void on the ground that the company had not obtained the prior consent of the works council , as it was required to do under clause CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the collective agreement . The court dismissed the action on DATE , finding that the agreement given by the works council in DATE was also valid in relation to the DATE dismissal .", "ORG , and subsequently ORG , dismissed PERSON appeals on DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant applied again to ORG for a declaration that the dismissal of CARDINAL DATE and the authorisation given by the administrative bodies were void as being contrary to honest practices ( GPE ) . On CARDINAL DATE the court rejected the claim . It took the view that the administrative organs in question had , by implication , expressed their opinion on the matter by giving their agreement pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of GPE , because an authorisation accorded for a dismissal contrary to honest practices would have been inconsistent with the criteria which ORG had laid down for the validity of such decisions . On DATE ORG upheld this judgment . On appeal on points of law by PERSON , ORG quashed these CARDINAL decisions but dismissed his application on DATE , on the ground that the judicial decisions which had closed the proceedings in which the applicant had already contested the validity of his dismissal in the labour courts ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) were final .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the intervening period , PERSON had , on DATE , applied to the labour courts for the reopening of the proceedings concerning his suspension , proceedings which had been terminated by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

ORG On DATE ORG ordered the proceedings to be reopened but allowed the company \u2019s application for a stay pending the conclusion of the proceedings concerning the dismissal of DATE .
