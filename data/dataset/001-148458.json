NORP The applicant in both cases , Mr PERSON , is a LOC national , who was born in DATE and lives in ORG . At the relevant time he was the Director of ORG , a public institution . He was also a member of ORG of ORG ( ORG narodna stranka ; hereinafter \u201c SNS \u201d ) . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the complaints concerning the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a \u201c Public letter to the artists and writers of ORG \u201d ( Otvoreno pismo hercegnovskim umjetnicima i piscima ) , signed by ORG , on his own behalf and on behalf of CARDINAL other artists , was published in some of the printed and electronic media in GPE . The letter stated , inter alia , that the applicant , as the Director of ORG , had refused an exhibition of an NORP painter in DATE , as well as , soon afterwards , a programme for the presentation of \u201c DATE of GPE in ORG \u201d . He had allegedly also attempted to censor an artistic selection for another exhibition , which had made several artists withdraw . In conclusion , it was requested that the art institutions in ORG be run again \u201c by artists and writers of integrity and reputation and not by semi - skilled culture - agitators and party activists \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , apparently as an associate journalist ( novinar saradnik ) of an opposition DATE magazine \u201c Pokret \u201d , which existed at the time , wrote an article entitled \u201c A special war against ORG \u201d . The article stated , inter alia , that \u201c the idea about the \u2018 ORG of the exhibition was [ ... ] elaborated by a group of the so - called \u2018 prominent ORG [ including ORG ] . [ ... ] Of course , few cared what the \u2018 prominent ORG would say , as it was well known that they had to sign whatever nastiness ( gadost ) they were given to sign , as otherwise they would be neither \u2018 prominent\u2019 nor \u2018 Montenegrin\u2019 , and they were certainly not intellectuals \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON filed a private criminal action ( privatna krivi\u010dna tu\u017eba ) against the applicant for insult ( uvreda ) , claiming that the above - cited statement publicly \u201c belittled him and underestimated his personal and professional values \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE , as a single judge of ORG ( PERSON ) in ORG , found the applicant guilty of insult , fined him CARDINAL ( \u201c EUR \u201d ) , ordered him to pay ORG CARDINAL for the court fees ( sudski pau\u0161al ) and decided that the judgment at issue would be published in \u201c NORP \u201d . The judgment further specified that if the fine was not paid within DATE as of DATE when the judgment became final , it would be converted into a prison term , EUR CARDINAL being equal to DATE in prison .", "CARDINAL . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s defence that he could not be held responsible for something he had said as a journalist and without any intention to belittle , and that his statement was merely an opinion provoked by the untrue allegations relating to the refusal of the said exhibition contained in the public letter . The court also considered that the applicant , being also a journalist , must have known that the freedom of expression was restricted by the need to protect the honour and the reputation of others , and should have acted accordingly . It was further held that the public letter was not insulting for the applicant , as it was written in the context of a serious professional criticism of the applicant \u2019s work as ORG Director , with the aim of protecting interests of greater public importance . The court concluded that the expressions used by the applicant belittled and underestimated ORG personal and professional integrity . In deciding on the amount of the fine , the court took into consideration , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s insulting statement was given \u201c as a reaction to an earlier insult by the private prosecutor and the others \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE upheld the decision that the applicant was guilty of insult and at the same time reduced the fine to LAW . It was reaffirmed that the fine , if not paid , would be converted into a prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date thereafter the fine was allegedly paid by the SNS , following a decision of the SNS President to that effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in ORG issued a decision converting the fine into DATE of imprisonment as it had apparently not been paid within the specified time - limit . The applicant did not file an appeal against this decision . It would also appear that he has not served a prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained in his submissions to the ORG that a number of the court documents had not been served on him properly and in a timely manner . The Government , for their part , submitted a copy of the delivery slips signed by the applicant and his representative in the domestic proceedings confirming that the High Court judgment was served on them on DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL of the LOC DATE newspapers published an article entitled \u201c PERSON : ORG wants to move me out of GPE \u201d ( \u201c PERSON : ORG ho\u0107e da me iseli iz PERSON \u201d ) . The article contained the SNS \u2019s comments on the first - instance judgment rendered by GPE in the first set of criminal proceedings against the applicant . It continued with the applicant \u2019s comment , part of which read as follows : \u201c ORG of GPE filed CARDINAL complaints ( prijave ) with the court in ORG against me as an associate journalist of \u201c NORP \u201d . [ The complaints ] have been processed as a priority ( preko reda ) even though the [ court ] has a backlog of CARDINAL unresolved cases . This time , due to loyalty to the party ( po partijskoj du\u017enosti ) , everything had to be done as a priority . A hearing was scheduled in a particularly short period . CARDINAL such trial was held DATE and it resembled the proceedings before a court martial ( prijeki sud ) rather than regular proceedings . I was fined ORG CARDINAL for a publicly expressed opinion which I made as an associate journalist . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE filed a private criminal action against the applicant , claiming that the following words , in particular , amounted to defamation : \u201c this time , due to loyalty to the party , everything had to be done as a priority . A hearing was scheduled in a particularly short period . CARDINAL such trial was held DATE and it resembled the proceedings before a court martial rather than regular proceedings \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the hearing held after a remittal , the applicant stated , inter alia , that as a politician , journalist and a legal representative of ORG he had the right to express his personal , political and professional opinions as well as to criticise negative phenomena in society . He stated that he had never mentioned GPE , although , as a public official , she had a duty to tolerate criticism even when it was not justified . He maintained that the trial against him had been treated as a priority as the judges had first to deal with the older cases . In this regard he referred to a public statement of the President of ORG that each judge at the court in ORG had a backlog of CARDINAL cases and that the older cases were priority . The applicant confirmed that DATE after the delivery of the judgment in the first set of criminal proceedings he had indeed commented publicly on the work of the court and its dealing with cases which were not priority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE found the applicant guilty of defamation and fined him LAW , which fine could be converted into a prison sentence if it was not paid within DATE as of DATE when the judgment became final . He was also ordered to pay ORG CARDINAL for the court fees . The court considered that even though the applicant had not mentioned GPE personally , it was clear from the text and its context which judge and judgment he had been referring to . The court held that the statement at issue was untrue and that , in particular , the words \u201c due to loyalty to the party \u201d , \u201c in a particularly short period \u201d and \u201c court martial \u201d could harm GPE \u2019s personal and professional honour and reputation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision . He submitted , in particular , that the court had not taken into consideration either the Convention or the ORG \u2019s case - law and that both the private prosecutor and himself , as public officials , had a duty to tolerate a higher level of criticism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE upheld the first - instance judgment , in substance endorsing the reasons given by ORG . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that he had criticised the work of the court in general and not GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal filed on CARDINAL DATE and found a violation of LAW . It quashed the ORG judgment and ordered a re - trial . In doing so , ORG held , in particular , that the interference with the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression was not necessary in a democratic society and that the reasoning of the domestic courts was not relevant and sufficient to justify it . The disputed expressions used by the applicant related to the behaviour of GPE in her official capacity and not to her private life . In addition , the nature and the level of the fine , which under certain conditions could be replaced by imprisonment , were of particular importance in assessing the proportionality of the interference . The court also ordered that its decision be published in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overturned the judgment of ORG of DATE and acquitted the applicant given that the defamation had been decriminalised in the meantime ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant paid the court fees . It would appear that he has never paid the above fine .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the President of ORG stated that each judge of ORG in ORG was in charge of CARDINAL cases , some of which were DATE , and that the older cases ( predmeti iz prethodnih godina ) should be given priority .", "CARDINAL .

In particular , section CARDINAL provides that when ORG finds a violation of a human right or freedom , it shall quash the impugned decision , entirely or partially , and order that the case be re - examined by the same body which rendered the quashed decision .", "CARDINAL .
