From the limited material provided by the parties the ORG can discern the following as the few facts which appear to be not in dispute . Both parties have agreed that the applicant was abducted in GPE at TIME on DATE ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) . It follows by implication from the ORG \u2019s assertion that the applicant was kidnapped by unidentified people ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that they have acknowledged that the applicant was restricted in exercising his free will from that moment on . It is thus reasonable to assume that the Government have not contested the allegation that the applicant was involuntarily removed from the NORP territory . Furthermore , there is no dispute about the fact that the applicant was arrested and placed in custody in GPE by the NORP authorities , although there appears to be a certain amount of confusion as to the date of his arrest ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) .

Were the Government to be understood to be tacitly relying on the explanation appearing in that document , the ORG would be reluctant to accept is as satisfactory given that the interview in question was not attended by sufficient procedural safeguards against abuse and arbitrariness .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that it has established a number of general principles concerning situations in which , owing to a conflicting account of events by the parties , it has confronted difficulties when establishing the facts ( for a summary of those principles see PERSON v. \u201c the former GPE \u201d [ ORG ] , no .

GPE [ ORG ] , no . DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ) , or where , although it has not been proved that a person has been taken into custody by the authorities , it is possible to establish in the context of a disappearance complaint under LAW that he or she was officially summoned by the authorities , entered a place under their control and has not been seen since ( see ORG and Others v. GPE , no . MONEY , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL\u2013VIII ) .", "CARDINAL .

Given that CARDINAL documents issued by the NORP authorities that were submitted by the Government suggest that he reached GPE on DATE ( see paragraphs DATE above ) , the ORG is ready to accept , in the absence of any other evidence , that date as the date of arrival . As to the means of transportation , the applicant \u2019s representative submitted that the applicant was put on an aeroplane in CARDINAL of the GPE airports . The Government remained silent on the matter . The NORP authorities implied that the applicant took a bus from GPE to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that , owing to the scarcity of the information available , it can not establish the precise circumstances surrounding the applicant \u2019s travel from GPE to GPE . Nevertheless , it regards the following CARDINAL elements as salient for the analysis of the present case : ( a ) that the applicant was without his passport on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and ( b ) that , in order to arrive to GPE , he must have crossed the NORP State borders in CARDINAL manner or another .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes in this connection that it has previously concluded that a forcible transfer of an individual to a ORG that was not a party to the LAW by aircraft from GPE or the surrounding region could not happen without the knowledge and either passive or active involvement of the NORP authorities ( see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ; PERSON v. GPE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL DATE ; and GPE v. GPE , no . MONEY , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) . Any airport serving international flights is subject to heightened security measures , remaining under the permanent control of the respondent ORG \u2019s authorities and notably , the State border service ( ibid . , also , see Savriddin PERSON v. GPE , no . ORG , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ( extracts ) ) . As to the possibility of transport by bus , it would appear implausible that an individual whose name appeared on the wanted lists ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) could travel QUANTITY through GPE and GPE by bus and cross the GPE - GPE and GPE - Uzbekistan State borders unimpededly despite having no passport on him ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers , accordingly , that a strong presumption of the NORP authorities\u2019 involvement in the applicant \u2019s relocation to GPE has arisen . The Government , however , have failed to rebut this presumption . In particular , they did not disclose the passenger logs for the GPE flights which had departed from the GPE airports after DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Nor did the Government submit any explanation as to how the applicant could cross the NORP border without a passport .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , the ORG considers that , whereas the applicant made out a prima facie case that he had been abducted and transferred to GPE with the direct or indirect involvement of the NORP authorities , the Government failed persuasively to refute his allegations and to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation as to how the applicant arrived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG accordingly finds it established that the NORP authorities bear responsibility , as a result of direct or indirect involvement , for the applicant \u2019s forcible transfer from GPE to GPE . On the basis of this finding , the ORG will proceed to examine the applicant \u2019s complaints under LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "38"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["34"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
