In DATE a scheme , drawn up in DATE , was subjected to an environmental impact assessment ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . The conclusion was positive . In DATE the ORG was submitted for public discussion by the inhabitants of PERSON and modified in line with their comments . The scheme was approved by ORG of ORG in DATE and began to be implemented in DATE . It consisted in laying earth and soil and planting vegetation on the pond . Its implementation was stopped in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr PERSON , operating as a sole trader under the business name \u201c ET PERSON \u201d , proposed to ORG a new solution for the reclamation of the tailings pond . It consisted in the temporary capping of the pond 's surface and slopes with soil cement , to prevent the spreading of dust , and in the use of sludge from a waste - water treatment plant in GPE for biological reclamation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a negative opinion on the new scheme . It expressed doubts as to the sustainability and the stability in acidic environments of the soil cement intended to be used for capping the pond . The proposed technology would provide a provisional solution for containing the dust spread from the pond , but would not lead to the pond 's full reclamation . Moreover , ORG had not specified the chemical composition of the sludge from the GPE waste - water treatment plant . It appeared to contain heavy metals , as the plant treated not only domestic , but also industrial waste water . According to the relevant classifier , sludge resulting from the treatment of the latter was hazardous waste .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON 's mayor also expressed a negative opinion on the new scheme . He noted , among other things , that the previous scheme had been fully approved and had begun to be implemented . In addition , the composition of the sludge from the GPE plant was unclear , as it treated not only domestic , but also industrial waste water . This meant that the sludge might contain heavy metals .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE ORG approved ET PERSON 's proposal and allowed him to submit a new scheme .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE to ORG , the regional governor said that the new reclamation scheme was not technologically superior to the previous one and should not be approved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of Industry transferred the tailings pond from the assets of the ORG - owned company ORG to those of a specially formed ORG - owned company , PERSON ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ET PERSON presented its scheme to ORG . At about the same time ORG , which had been implementing the initial reclamation scheme ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , presented ORG with an update to the initial scheme .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appointed a specialist board of experts to assess the CARDINAL schemes . The board comprised experts from ORG , of ORG , and from ORG , as well as from ORG and ORG . It held a meeting on DATE to discuss the relative merits of the CARDINAL schemes . It noted that both lacked checks on the stability of the pond . However , according to an expert 's report , neither of them would impair the pond 's stability . Both lacked climatological and hydrological descriptions of the area and data on the expected consolidation of the sludge after the reclamation had ended . The problems relating to the neutralisation of the acid water were partially addressed in ORG scheme and not addressed in ORG 's scheme . According to an expert 's report , it was possible to use stabilised waste - water sludge from the GPE treatment plant . The area around the pond did not have enough humus for the biological reclamation envisaged by ORG 's scheme ; it would thus be necessary to enrich the existing soil artificially . ET PERSON scheme envisaged finishing the reclamation in DATE and resolving the dust - spread problem even before that . PERSON ORG 's scheme also had an eighteenmonth timeline , but it was unrealistic . ET PERSON scheme provided for the restoration of the productive qualities of CARDINAL ha of polluted soil outside the tailings pond and its use for the production of specialised grass . According to accounts submitted by the CARDINAL firms , ORG scheme would cost MONEY ( ORG ) and ORG scheme ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . On that basis , the board recommended that ORG approve ORG scheme . CARDINAL experts representing ORG disagreed , saying that this scheme did not meet various regulatory requirements . In particular , wastewater sludge was not appropriate for reclamation ; humus was much better suited for that task . It was also unclear whether the use of sludge would yield stable and safe results . According to the relevant classifier , the sludge from the GPE plant was hazardous waste , because it came not only from domestic but also from industrial waste water . The documents relating to the scheme did not specify the exact toxic - substance content of the sludge . Lastly , the scheme 's scope and potential effects on the environment warranted an ORG . The updated initial scheme suffered from none of these drawbacks , but , on the contrary , would provide a sustainable solution .", "CARDINAL . ORG , comprising representatives from several ministries , considered the CARDINAL schemes on DATE . It examined the findings of the specialist board of experts , as well as the opinions of ORG , of GPE 's mayor , and of the regional governor . It also heard PERSON explanations . Following a discussion , which touched upon , among other matters , the alleged heavymetal content in the sludge from the GPE plant , the ORG unanimously resolved to approve ORG scheme . The resolution was later approved by the Minister for Industry .", "CARDINAL . In a newspaper interview published on DATE the Minister for the Environment said that the new reclamation scheme was controversial and that she intended to challenge it . In her view , a fresh method of reclamation was to be sought , if need be with the help of university scientists .", "CARDINAL . The new scheme began to be implemented in DATE . PERSON was the investor and ORG the contractor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the company carrying sludge from the GPE plant to the pond was doing so without the licence required under section CARDINAL ) the DATE Limitation of the Adverse Impact of Waste on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which corresponded to an administrative offence . On DATE it fined the company .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , ET PERSON applied for such a licence , which was granted by the Minister for ORG on DATE . In her decision the Minister allowed ORG to process up to QUANTITY of domestic wastewater sludge a day . In particular , it could carry stabilised sludge from the GPE treatment plant to the pond , store it in pits or other openair containers and use it for fertilising soils or improving the environment . The sludge was to be carried in lorries , with CARDINAL from the GPE plant to the pond per day . It was to be laid on the pond in keeping with the technology approved by ORG and with certain other precautionary measures . The laying of sludge had to be finished before DATE . In the meantime , ORG had to present DATE chemical analyses of the sludge to ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . After finding out about the above licence , on DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( NORP \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434 ) for judicial review of the Minister 's decision to grant it . He started by contending that he had a sufficient legal interest to contest the decision , because it impacted on his right under LAW ( see paragraph QUANTITY in limine below ) to live in a \u201c healthy and favourable environment corresponding to the established standards and norms \u201d . He pointed out that he lived in PERSON , close to the place where the licence allowed sludge to be laid , and that the sludge could have adverse effects on the environment and human health . He also referred to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine below ) . He further argued that the decision was null and void , as its implementation was impossible . The decision allowed ORG to carry and process domestic waste - water sludge . However , this could not be done , because the waste water treated in the GPE plant came from both domestic and industrial sources . It was unfeasible to separate the domestic from the industrial sludge and for this reason it was impossible to carry and process solely domestic sludge . The applicant further argued that the Minister 's decision unlawfully classified the sludge as industrial waste , as under the relevant rules it was hazardous waste ; this was also evident from various analyses . Furthermore , the Minister had taken the decision in breach of the rules of procedure , as no ORG had been drawn up .", "CARDINAL . In his application the applicant also requested the court to stay , as an interim measure , the enforcement of the impugned decision , as failure to do so could frustrate the purpose of the proceedings and cause irreparable harm to the environment , thus infringing the right of PERSON 's inhabitants to a safe and healthy environment . As the court did not rule on that request , on DATE the applicant renewed it . He argued that the continuing implementation of the decision could lead to irreparable harm for the environment , as the spreading of sludge was still going on at a regular pace .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG , ORG \u043e\u0442\u0434. ) a threemember panel of ORG declared the application inadmissible . It found that the applicant had not been party to the administrative proceedings and therefore had no standing to seek review of the Minister 's decision . His interests could not be adversely affected by the decision , but solely by the potential unlawful actions of those whom the decision authorised to carry and process waste .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the applicant , on DATE a fivemember panel of ORG quashed the threemember panel 's ruling and remitted the case for an examination on the merits ( \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON , \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 ) . It held that in view of the aim of the environmental protection legislation \u2013 to prevent or at least reduce the adverse effects of waste on the environment and human health \u2013 all individuals living in an area at risk of pollution due to wastetreatment operations could be considered as interested parties . The applicant , as well as all persons living near the tailings pond , had an interest in preventing activities , such as those allowed by the impugned ministerial decision , which could pollute their environment and thus possibly impair their health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant reminded the court once more of his request for a stay of execution of the decision . On DATE the CARDINAL - member panel turned down the request , saying that the materials in the file did not point to any danger for the applicant 's interests .", "CARDINAL . A hearing listed for DATE did not take place , as ORG had not been properly summoned . It took place on DATE . The court heard the parties ' arguments . A public prosecutor participating in the proceedings ex officio submitted that the application should be allowed .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant appealed , arguing , among other things , that he had a continuing legal interest in seeking judicial review of the decision , because it had allowed waste disposal near his home , which could lead to problems for his health . The annulment of the decision was in addition a prerequisite for successfully prosecuting a claim in respect of the harm occasioned by the unlawful waste disposal . The decision 's effects had not ended on DATE , as the negative results of the activities which it had made possible could persist for DATE to come .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a fivemember panel of ORG upheld the discontinuance ( \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 DATE \u043e\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE , ORG , \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 ) . It noted that the subsistence of a legal interest in seeking the annulment of an administrative decision was mandatory throughout the proceedings . The threemember panel had had regard to a fresh development \u2013 the expiry of the licence DATE which had come to pass while the proceedings were pending . The allegation that the applicant had suffered damage at the time when the licence had still been in force was not sufficient to establish the existence of a continuing legal interest , as reparation for such damage could be sought in civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The new reclamation scheme drew widespread disapproval from PERSON 's inhabitants . On CARDINAL and DATE Mr GPE , member of ORG , sent letters to ORG and to ORG ( a subdivision of ORG ) . He asked them to give their expert opinion on the question whether the implementation of the scheme could put at risk the health of the people living near the pond .", "CARDINAL . The ORG replied on DATE . It said that there was a risk of heavy - metal contamination impacting on the population 's health within a tenkilometre perimeter around the pond . The reclamation scheme lacked a suitable system for monitoring the underground water , where the migration of such metals could be expected , as the polymer cover was not stable in the long term . According to an expert in the ORG 's toxicology laboratory , the heavy - metal content of the sludge spread on the pond was above the regulatory maximum , as shown by the chemical analysis of samples . The high levels of copper , zinc , cadmium , nickel , cobalt and chrome led to a pollution risk and a risk to the population 's health . So did the presence in the sludge of lead and manganese . Those metals could have a negative impact on the nerve , respiratory and cardiovascular systems , the kidneys , the liver and the production of blood . Some of them were allergens , mutagens and carcinogens . The scheme 's implementation would thus lead to a risk of dust from the sludge spreading in the atmosphere . There was also a risk that those metals would migrate through the surface and underground water , because of the acid pH of the water in the pond . The methodology for reclaiming old polluted areas classified the area situated QUANTITY from the source of the pollution as being at risk .", "CARDINAL . Having received the ORG 's opinion , on CARDINAL DATE Mr GPE asked the Chief Sanitary Inspector to stop the operation of the site . He did not receive a reply . Mr PERSON also alerted the mayor of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE 's mayor appointed a commission to take samples from the place where the sludge was being spread and to submit it to a laboratory for an analysis of its heavy - metal content . Such samples were taken and sent to ORG . In a letter of DATE , accompanied by the expert opinion of a researcher in its toxicology laboratory , the ORG said that the lead , cadmium , copper , zinc , chrome and nickel content of the sample was well above the maximum permitted levels . Copper and zinc had a negative effect on agricultural crops and livestock . Lead , cadmium , chrome and nickel were systematically toxic for mammals and humans : they could harm the peripheral and central nervous systems , the production of blood , the liver and the kidneys . Those metals also had mutagenic and carcinogenic effects . In addition , chrome , cadmium and nickel were strong allergens . The underlying soil cement cover would provide some protection for the underground water in the region , but it was unclear how it would prevent the migration of heavy metals to the surface water .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE 's mayor and the regional governor wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister . They urged him to halt the scheme 's implementation and noted that its continuation could lead to civil unrest in PERSON . Apparently no reply was received .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted PERSON ORG a permit to discharge waste water , setting certain limits on the content of heavy metals and other toxic substances in it , and requiring the company to report to the competent authorities on a DATE basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the works on the pond were accepted by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON 's mayor asked the environmental inspection authorities in GPE to provide him with information about PERSON ORG 's DATE selfmonitoring reports . On DATE those authorities replied that they did not have such reports on file and that they were pressuring the company to comply with its reporting obligations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as a result of pressure from inhabitants of PERSON , the Minister for ORG ordered PERSON ORG to commission an ORG . In an additional decision of DATE she specified that the ORG was to be ready by DATE .", "CARDINAL . As a result of a hunger strike by CARDINAL members of a public committee opposed to the scheme and of a visit by the Minister for ORG , on DATE ORG , noting that no ORG had been drawn up , ordered that the implementation of the scheme be stopped pending completion of the assessment . However , by that time CARDINAL ha of the CARDINAL.CARDINAL ha of the pond had been covered with sludge . It seems that the total amount deposited was QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . The ORG was ready in DATE or DATE . It was submitted for a public discussion , at which CARDINAL experts from ORG faculty of geology and geography expressed their misgivings about the scheme .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG decided not to accept the ORG and sent it back for revision . She noted some serious omissions in its estimation of the health risk to the population arising from the reclamation scheme , the lack of information about the hazardous substances involved in the scheme , and the fact that the team which had drawn it up did not include an expert on the health and hygienerelated aspects of the environment . The Minister instructed the experts to revise the ORG and , in particular , to make a comparative study of the existing analyses and make an additional chemical analysis of the sludge laid on the pond . It was to be specifically checked for heavy metals and mercury content . The taking of samples for that analysis had to be done in the presence of the persons concerned . The experts were also to indicate the tailings ' permeability , before and after the pond 's capping with soil cement , as well as the permeability of the underlying rocks and the stability and the permeability of the soil cement after DATE of use . The revised ORG was to analyse all aspects of the scheme with reference to their effect on the health of the inhabitants of the villages surrounding the pond , and to propose concrete measures to tackle the problem . The analysis had to focus specifically on the penetration of heavy metals in the food chain .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON ORG and the company which it had hired to draw up the ORG submitted additional documents to the ORG . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Minister said that those documents did not contain the information requested in her decision of DATE . It was thus impossible to draw any reliable conclusions as to the effect of the reclamation scheme on the people and the environment . However , under the regulations in force , it was not necessary to pursue the matter further and finalise the ORG . As the works on the site had already been completed , it was sufficient for ORG to produce a self - monitoring report on the scheme 's impact .", "CARDINAL . Following pressure from PERSON 's inhabitants and the local authorities , on DATE the Minister of Health ordered ORG to carry out an assessment of the environment and the impact of the reclamation scheme on the local population 's health . In a letter of DATE the ORG informed the Ministry that its experts were ready to complete the task , but that it could come up with QUANTITY of the necessary funding , amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . In DATE , DATE and DATE the applicant asked the municipality of GPE to cover the remaining MONEY of the amount , but the municipality made no provision for such an outlay in its budget . At the time of the latest information from the applicant on that point ( DATE ) the money had not been found and the assessment had not been completed .", "CARDINAL . The first selfmonitoring report by PERSON ORG was drawn up in DATE and covered the period DATE and DATE . It gave an account of , among other things , the heavymetal content of water coming out of the pond and of grass near it . These measurements were based on CARDINAL water samples and CARDINAL grass samples . CARDINAL of the water samples did not show a heavymetal content above the regulatory maximum levels , whereas the other did , leading the report to conclude that the pond 's drainage water was heavily polluted . According to the report , the polluting content of the grass samples was below the regulatory maximum level , but the applicant submitted that its authors had used the wrong comparators , using the regulatory maximum levels for soil , not grass , which were considerably lower . The report said that the pond should continue to be monitored , but at a decreasing pace , with sampletaking once a year for grass and twice a year for water . Further reporting was envisaged in DATE .", "CARDINAL .
