On DATE CARDINAL members of ORG , including the applicants , brought an action against ORG under section CARDINAL of ORG ( Law no . CARDINAL ) and LAW ) of LAW . They sought declarations that the amendment of DATE to the internal rules and , consequently , the decision to expel their association were ORG ( neplatnost ) and that ORG remained a member of ORG . They maintained that ORG decision had damaged the reputation of ORG and had caused patients to become wary of doctors practising homeopathy ( a fact which they submitted gave them a relevant interest for the purposes of LAW ( c ) of LAW ) .

The review procedure is now set out in Chapters I and II of Part CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , which defines jurisdiction in administrative appeals on points of law and requires the review [ of a decision ] within the meaning of section CARDINAL to be interpreted by analogy . Support for that view is also to be found in other provisions of Law no .

CARDINAL did not specify under which provisions of LAW they should have brought their action and that , since ORG was not an administrative authority , Part CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , which only applied to the judicial review of decisions of the administrative authorities , could not be applicable in their case . They further submitted that having found that it had no jurisdiction to decide the case on the basis of the pleaded provision , the court should have declined jurisdiction , not dismissed their claim . They were not required by the provisions of LAW governing the conditions of form applicable to actions to bring their claims under specific statutory provisions or to specify the procedure the court should follow , as the court was required first and foremost to consider the substance of their claim .", "CARDINAL .

They complained that ORG had failed to respond to their arguments that Part CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure was inapplicable in their case . They further submitted that the impugned decisions of ORG had infringed their right to freedom of choice of their profession for the purposes of LAW , to scientific freedom , as guaranteed by LAW charter , and to freedom of association , as guaranteed by LAW and LAW .

I \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , ORG said that if an appellant was unsure whether an application he had just lodged for leave to appeal on points of law would be granted , then in order to avoid being out of time with his constitutional appeal , he should lodge his constitutional appeal at the same time , without waiting for the decision on the application for leave , since , if leave was refused , the final decision in his case would be the appeal court decision .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , applications nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG ( PERSON , GPE v. GPE and PERSON v. GPE , respectively ) , which have been lodged with the ORG and communicated to the respondent Government , show that the effectiveness of lodging an appeal on points of law simultaneously with a constitutional appeal may prove to be purely theoretical . In these cases , the applicants lodged both forms of appeal at the same time , but their constitutional appeals were declared inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies , as appeals to ORG were still pending . They subsequently lodged fresh appeals with ORG , once ORG had refused them leave to appeal . However , their constitutional appeals were again declared inadmissible , this time on the ground that they were out of time ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
