The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Following a petition from her former husband , on DATE the ORG dissolved their marriage . It gave the applicant custody of the couple \u2019s only child , and also gave her the use of the former matrimonial home . It found that this home was a flat acquired jointly by the former spouses during their marriage , situated in the \u201c LOC neighbourhood of GPE , and intended by them to fulfil the family \u2019s housing needs ( the applicant had moved into that flat in DATE although it had not been fully finished ) . The fact that the applicant \u2019s former husband had never lived there was of no relevance , as this had been the result of his disregarding his duty to cohabit with his spouse . As the applicant had been given custody of their only child , the court held that she was entitled to use the flat .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s former husband appealed against the court order relating to the former matrimonial home . He averred that this home was in fact another flat DATE situated in the \u201c GPE \u201d neighbourhood of GPE and coowned by him and his mother and sister \u2013 where the spouses had lived before their de facto separation in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the order . It agreed with GPE that the former matrimonial home was the flat in \u201c PERSON , as it had been acquired , by means of a preliminary contract with the builder , during the marriage , for the family \u2019s housing needs , as at that time the spouses had not owned another home , and as the applicant and her child had been living there at the time when the marriage was dissolved . The flat in \u201c FAC was not the former matrimonial home , because it was co - owned by the applicant \u2019s former husband and third parties and both spouses had left it in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s former husband appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and remitted the case . It held that the former matrimonial home was the flat in \u201c GPE \u201d , not the CARDINAL newly built in \u201c PERSON . According to its settled caselaw , the former matrimonial home was the one which had been used before the dissolution of the marriage and , in case of a de facto separation preceding the dissolution , the one used before the separation .", "CARDINAL . NORP On remittal , ORG , in a judgment of DATE , again upheld the order of GPE . It relied on interpretative decision no . CARDINAL of FAC of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , according to whose point CARDINAL ( b ) , in the event of a de facto separation , the former matrimonial home is the CARDINAL acquired during the separation with funds accumulated during the marriage . On this basis , it found that the former matrimonial home was the flat in \u201c PERSON . Given the unambiguous rule set out in the interpretative decision , the fact that the spouses had not lived in that flat together was immaterial .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s former husband appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE . The applicant was represented by counsel , who asked the court to dismiss the appeal and said that he had developed his arguments in a memorial which he filed during the hearing .", "CARDINAL . In the memorial , which ran to CARDINAL pages , the applicant \u2019s counsel argued that ORG had not erred by taking into account interpretative decision no . CARDINAL instead of the guidelines of ORG given in the judgment of DATE , since where there was conflict between the instructions given in a specific case and the solution envisaged by a binding interpretative decision the latter prevailed . He further presented a number of arguments why the flat in \u201c PERSON was the former matrimonial home and why its use should be given to the applicant . He asserted that this flat had been acquired by the spouses with a view to fulfilling the family \u2019s housing needs , that the applicant had contributed financially to its acquisition and that the only reason why she did not have title to it was her former husband \u2019s protracting the conclusion of the final contract for its acquisition from the builder . The applicant had brought a separate suit , seeking a court order declaring the preliminary contract with the builder final . However , that suit was still pending . The spouses had lived in the flat since DATE , but even assuming that the applicant \u2019s former husband had not done so throughout the entire period , this had been due to his dereliction of the duty to cohabit with his wife . The applicant and her child could not live in the flat in \u201c FAC , because this was not the former matrimonial home , and this would mean cohabiting with their former inlaws , with whom they did not have good relations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed GPE judgment . In the beginning of its twoandahalf page opinion it observed that the applicant had not made submissions in the proceedings before it . It found no indication that the spouses had obtained title and thus acquired the flat in \u201c Strelbishte \u201d during the marriage ; there was merely a preliminary contract in respect of it . The date of delivery of the flat was irrelevant . Therefore , point CARDINAL ( b ) of interpretative decision no . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was not applicable . However , even if the spouses had acquired the flat during the marriage , it would not have become the matrimonial home , because it had not been acquired in order to fulfil the family \u2019s housing needs . Where a home had not been acquired for such purpose , point CARDINAL ( b ) was inapposite on account of the repeal in DATE of a DATE statute restricting the number of properties which an individual was allowed to own . Thereafter , the contribution of funds by both spouses could be of importance solely for the existence or otherwise of a joint title to a home acquired during the marriage , not for its designation as the matrimonial home . The former matrimonial home was the flat in \u201c GPE \u201d , as the spouses had lived there before their de facto separation in DATE . Since the couple \u2019s child was already an adult and since the applicant shared some of the responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage , the use of the former matrimonial home was to be given to her former husband .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel asked ORG to rectify the statement in its judgment that he had not made any submissions in the cassation proceedings . He considered that statement to be an obvious mistake , because , as noted in TIME of the hearing , he had filed a memorial , which featured after page CARDINAL in the case file . On DATE the court refused , saying that only errors in the operative provisions of a judgment could be rectified .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE LAW provides that when a court allows a divorce petition , it must give the use of the former matrimonial home to CARDINAL of the spouses if it can not be used separately by both of them . In reaching its decision , the court must have regard to the interests of the children , the fault for the breakdown of the marriage , the health of the spouses and all other relevant circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Interpretative decision no . CARDINAL of FAC of ORG ( \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043d\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. , GPE \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0421 ) was adopted on DATE under the CARDINAL Family Code ( which was superseded by the DATE LAW ) . It deals with all issues relating to the use of the former matrimonial home . Point CARDINAL ( b ) of its operative provisions defines the former matrimonial home as the CARDINAL acquired while the spouses were separated de facto , but with funds accumulated during the marriage ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
