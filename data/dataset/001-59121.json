DATE the applicant was the sole managing director of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a company which owned and controlled CARDINAL of the CARDINAL casinos licensed to operate in GPE . ORG was a subsidiary company of ORG plc ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) of which the applicant was also managing director . Both companies will hereafter be collectively referred to as GPE Clubs .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a raid took place at the various premises of ORG . The raid was carried out by the police in the presence of officials of ORG for GPE ( \u201c the Gaming Board \u201d ) , a statutory body which inspects and monitors the gaming industry . A large quantity of documents were seized . In DATE ORG lodged objections with the clerk to ORG , with regard to ORG \u2019s DATE application for renewal of the licences it held in respect of each of its casinos . ORG also made cancellation applications in respect of the existing licences held by ORG .", "A meeting was held between ORG and the non - executive directors of ORG and their legal advisors on DATE . As a result of this meeting , the applicant and the other executive directors ( with the exception of the finance director ) resigned with effect from DATE , on the understanding that such resignation was involuntary and constituted dismissal by ORG .", "Subsequently an agreement was reached between ORG and ORG , whereby ORG would apply for new licences for the casinos , via re - constituted operating companies , to which application ORG would not object . If the applications were successful and new licences were granted by ORG , ORG would undertake to surrender its existing licences , thereby avoiding the necessity for the applications for cancellation or renewal to be heard .", "ORG issued ORG with certificates of consent , which ORG were statutorily obliged to obtain from ORG as a pre - requisite to making an application to ORG for new licences . Objections to the issuing of new licences were made by a rival casino owner . However these objections were rejected and new licences were granted in DATE , after DATE hearing before ORG . ORG was represented at the hearing and expressed to ORG its support for the application of ORG , explaining the grounds on which ORG itself had granted ORG certificates of consent in the following terms :", "\u201c In determining that it should issue certificates of consent ORG took into consideration , amongst other relevant factors , the degree to which ORG had addressed the ORG \u2019s grave concerns at the matters of complaint referred to above , and in particular had in mind the following :", "Those executive directors of ORG and of [ ORG ] who in the ORG \u2019s view carried the principal responsibility for the matters of complaint ... [ the applicant was named along with CARDINAL others ] have left the company and relinquished their management shares : ( ..... )", "ORG viewed the matters raised in their cancellation applications extremely seriously . However they are satisfied that the practices that were unacceptable have now been eradicated and that those individuals responsible for encouraging or tolerating them have been removed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Chairman of ORG , PERSON , addressed ORG at their DATE luncheon . Her speech referred to ORG and commented :", "\u201c We [ ORG ] satisfied ourselves that the practices we and the Police had regarded as unacceptable had ceased , that persons regarded by ORG as not fit and proper had been removed ... . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As a result of this speech , the applicant \u2019s legal advisors entered into correspondence with ORG solicitors , on the basis that the speech was defamatory . ORG alleged that the \u201c persons \u201d referred to were minority shareholders and no reference to the applicant was intended . The applicant did not accept this explanation , however defamation proceedings were not commenced .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s legal advisors received written notice that ORG was considering whether the applicant personally was a fit and proper person to hold the ORG \u2019s certificate of approval , as required by LAW DATE , in order to hold a management position in the gaming industry . By a letter dated DATE , ORG informed the applicant formally that it was \u201c minded to revoke \u201d the applicant \u2019s LAW certificates and that the applicant would be given the opportunity to state his case against revocation either in writing or orally at an interview before ORG ( \u201c a LAW hearing \u201d ) .", "The letter detailed the matters which ORG wished to discuss with the applicant and also referred to the particulars of ORG complaints in the application for cancellation of ORG \u2019s licences ( the hearing of which had , in fact , never taken place ) . The complaints , numbered CARDINAL to BCARDINAL , claimed , inter alia , that there had been breaches of LAW of LAW DATE , in that cheques had been accepted without any expectation that they would be met promptly ( CARDINAL ) ; that the applicant had been involved in granting cheque cashing facilities to members without proper investigation of their creditworthiness ( BCARDINAL ) ; that cheques had been accepted which exceeded the ORG cheque cashing facility ( BCARDINAL ) ; that third party cheques had been accepted in a way which would permit circumvention of DATE Guidelines of ORG ( BCARDINAL ) ; that NORP players had been assisted in breaching NORP exchange control regulations ( BCARDINAL ) ; that gifts or hospitality had been made to substantial players in breach of further DATE LAW BCARDINAL ) ; and that the method for computing the \u201c cash drop \u201d in casinos produced inaccuracies , and was open to abuse ( BCARDINAL ) . Examples were given .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s legal advisors objected to ORG presiding over the LAW hearing , suggesting that an independent tribunal be set up as an alternative . The applicant \u2019s principal objection was based on the fact that ORG had already publicly expressed the view ( at the hearing before ORG ) that the applicant was not a fit and proper person to remain as an executive director of ORG . As such , the applicant contended , ORG could not be considered an impartial tribunal appropriate to consider the issue of whether the applicant \u2019s LAW certificates should be revoked .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the request for an independent tribunal and a Section CARDINAL hearing commenced on DATE before a panel of CARDINAL , all members of ORG ( \u201c the Panel \u201d ) . The hearing was conducted in private and lasted for DATE . The applicant was represented by senior counsel . ORG solicitors , a senior ORG official and a representative of ORG accountants also attended the hearing .", "By a letter dated DATE , the applicant was informed that ORG did not consider the applicant to be a fit and proper person to continue to hold the ORG \u2019s certificates of approval and that , accordingly , ORG would revoke his LAW certificates within DATE of receipt of the letter . This letter detailed the matters which had concerned ORG and the complaints that it deemed were established against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The effect of the revocation of the LAW certificates was that the applicant was unable to obtain employment in any sector of the gaming industry in GPE or in any jurisdiction which had a relationship with the GPE gaming authorities .", "CARDINAL . By an application dated DATE , the applicant sought leave to apply for judicial review of the decision of ORG to revoke his LAW certificates . The decision was challenged on the grounds that the ORG was biased , or had the appearance of bias , and that its findings were vitiated by errors of law and were irrational .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the judicial review proceedings a document entitled \u201c LOC to Minutes of ORG of ORG for GPE , \u201d dated DATE , was exhibited to an affidavit sworn by the Chairman of ORG . This document recorded that ORG had taken a decision at its meeting on DATE that it had :", "\u201c sufficient evidence before it to conclude that [ the applicant ] ... was not a fit and proper person to be a director of a casino company . \u201d", "CARDINAL . All the members of the Panel who presided over the Section CARDINAL hearing were present at the ORG meeting and were parties to this decision , which was made prior to the hearing itself .", "CARDINAL . The application for judicial review was dismissed on DATE by Mr Justice PERSON after a hearing lasting over DATE . He delivered CARDINAL separate judgments in respect of the applicant \u2019s appeal . The first judgment dealt with the scope of the phrase \u201c a fit and proper person \u201d in Schedule CARDINAL of LAW DATE . The second judgment considered the applicant \u2019s claim that he had a \u201c legitimate expectation \u201d that ORG would be precluded from taking account of any breaches of its guidelines unless the breaches were unlawful . The third judgment which dealt with \u201c ORG \u201d challenges and allegations of bias runs to CARDINAL pages . The judgment of ORG stated that the ambit of judicial review was such that he was not concerned to review findings of fact as on an appeal , but rather to assess whether the findings of the ORG disclosed illegality , irrationality ( referred to as \u201c ORG unreasonableness \u201d ) or procedural impropriety .", "CARDINAL . NORP On CARDINAL of the third judgment , PERSON dealt with the applicant \u2019s \u201c ORG \u201d challenges to the findings in respect of the various complaints made of him .", "CARDINAL . By way of example , it was accepted that cheques drawn by CARDINAL player , a Mr S , on a NORP and a NORP bank were not cleared within DATE after payment into a NORP bank , as would be the normal course of events . Rather , the average time for clearance was DATE . The ORG found that this practice breached LAW of LAW , which prohibits credit betting save when a cheque is exchanged for tokens . The applicant alleged that the cheques he accepted were not shams , as none of the NORP cheques was ever dishonoured . The judge found that the ORG \u2019s conclusion - that what took place amounted to an agreement between Mr S and ORG , such that LAW was breached - was a conclusion it was entitled to reach .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL pages of the third judgment were devoted to the issue of bias . Jowitt J. described the test of bias under LANGUAGE law in the following terms ( pp . CARDINAL of the judgment ) :", "\u201c [ Counsel for the applicant ] submits that the decision to revoke the applicant \u2019s LAW certificates of approval should be quashed because the ORG was biased . The grounds on which leave to move for judicial review were granted asserted firstly that the ORG could not and did not approach its decision with objectivity and impartiality . Secondly , it was asserted that whether or not there was actual bias the applicant reasonably believed there was and that the ORG should have had regard to the appearance of bias which had been created by its actions ...", "There was no disagreement between the parties as to the approach the court should adopt when bias is alleged . It is a CARDINAL stage test . The applicant has first to show from the evidence that there is an appearance of bias . NORP v. PERSON Coroner Ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL . [ Counsel for ORG ] properly and realistically accepts that in the light of the available evidence the applicant has surmounted this hurdle . Having done so , he has to go on to show that on a proper examination by the court of the evidence before it there is demonstrated a real danger of injustice having occurred as a result of bias ... [ The analysis in that case of ] the decision of ORG in NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] AC CARDINAL ... illuminates my task in relation to this second stage .", "\u2018 ( CARDINAL ) Any court seized of a challenge on the ground of apparent bias must ascertain the relevant circumstances and consider all the evidence for itself so as to reach its own conclusion on the facts . ...", "( CARDINAL ) In reaching its conclusion the court \u2018 personifies the reasonable man\u2019 .", "( CARDINAL ) The question on which the court must reach its own factual conclusion is this : is there a real danger of injustice having occurred as a result of bias ? By \u2018 real\u2019 is meant not without substance . A real danger clearly involves more than a minimal risk , less than a probability . One could , I think , as well speak of a real risk or a real possibility .", "( CARDINAL ) Injustice will have occurred as a result of bias if \u2018 the decision - maker unfairly regarded with disfavour the case of a party to the issue under consideration by him\u2019 . I take \u2018 unfairly regarded with disfavour\u2019 to mean \u2018 was pre - disposed or prejudiced against CARDINAL party \u2019s case for reasons unconnected with the merits of the LOC .", "( CARDINAL ) A decision - maker may have unfairly regarded with disfavour one party \u2019s case either consciously or unconsciously . Where , as here , the applicants expressly disavow any suggestion of actual bias , it seems to me that the court must necessarily be asking itself whether there is a real danger that the decision - maker was unconsciously biased .", "( CARDINAL ) ... the court is [ not ] concerned strictly with the appearance of bias but rather with establishing the possibility that there was actual although unconscious bias . \u2026", "( CARDINAL ) It is not necessary for the applicant to demonstrate a real possibility that the ... decision would have been different but for the bias ; what must be established is the real danger of bias having affected the decision in the sense of having caused the decision - maker , albeit unconsciously , to weigh the competing contentions , and so decide the merits , unfairly\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Jowitt J. then applied the test of bias which he had set out to the facts of the case , and concluded that , on the evidence before him , he could not say that the applicant had established that there was a real danger of injustice having occurred as a result of bias . He concluded that there was no unconscious bias on the part of any of the ORG members .", "CARDINAL . Jowitt J. stated , further , that if , contrary to his finding , there was unconscious bias on the part of the ORG , the \u201c doctrine of necessity \u201d fell to be considered . He said :", "\u201c When a body is charged by statute with the power or duty , which can not be delegated , to make a decision in circumstances in which a question of bias arises because :", "( i ) in pursuance of that statutory power or duty an initial view has been formed upon a matter affecting the interests of someone in respect of whom the body in the exercise of its statutory power or duty has thereafter to make a decision , or final decision , after receiving and considering representations which he is entitled to make or", "( ii ) in the exercise of a statutory power or duty to make a decision a conflict arises between the interests of another or others which have to be taken into account and the body \u2019s own interests :", "the decision will not be liable to be impugned on account of bias provided that :", "( i ) if only some of those charged with the power or duty to decide are potentially affected by bias such of them as can lawfully withdraw from the decision making do so and", "( ii ) those of the decision makers who are potentially affected by bias but can not lawfully withdraw use their best endeavours to avoid the effect of bias and , consistently with the purpose for which its decision has to be made the body takes what reasonable steps are open to it to minimise the risk of bias affecting them \u2026 \u201d", "Jowitt J. indicated that if , contrary to his finding , there was unconscious bias on the part of the ORG , the doctrine of necessity would apply , and the decision of the ORG would stand . Counsel for the applicant submitted before PERSON that the ORG had failed to take the reasonable step of appointing an independent panel to hear evidence and report to the ORG . PERSON rejected the submission , on the grounds that no useful reference could have been made to an independent tribunal which did not involve an impermissible delegation .", "CARDINAL . In respect of all other allegations brought by the applicant , PERSON concluded that the applicant had failed to establish that the ORG \u2019s decision was irrational or unreasonable or to make out any sufficient ground for judicial review . PERSON noted that , by trying to frame his allegations in the context of ORG unreasonableness , the applicant was in fact making an impermissible attempt to re - argue the case as though on appeal in order to re - examine the factual merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . ORG , after an oral hearing on DATE , refused an application for leave to appeal from ORG decision . PERSON ( with whom ORG agreed ) held , on the \u201c doctrine of necessity , \u201d as follows :", "\u201c I am prepared to assume in favour of [ the applicant ] that he would have an arguable case sufficient to justify leave to appeal , that there was a real risk that the decision of the ORG had been actuated by bias even though they were not in fact biased against him . That would leave the question of how the doctrine of necessity would be applied to the facts of the case .", "[ Counsel for the applicant ] did not seek to suggest that the propositions of law which ORG enunciated , and which I have quoted , were not accurately formulated by him , but he sought to challenge the final conclusion , to which I have just referred , that there could have been a useful reference to an independent ORG which did not involve an impermissible delegation . The question of bias , therefore , depends on the very limited point on whether it is arguable that Jowitt J was wrong in that respect . I am bound to say that , on that limited point , I think he was manifestly right . The decision for ORG was , at DATE , whether or not Mr PERSON was a fit and proper person . That could not be delegated to an independent panel and if they were actuated by bias , apparent or real , then the decision would still have to be made by them . Therefore , on the doctrine of necessity , which is accepted , there could have been no meaningful independent panel and the decision would stand because the decision has to be made by ORG and could not be delegated to the independent tribunal . It seems to me that there is no arguable point , susceptible on this part of the case , which would justify giving leave to appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
