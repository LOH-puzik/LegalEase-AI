With regards to the specific detainees referenced in the ORG \u2019s note , the ORG understands that ORG does not intend to seek the death penalty in those cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a majority , held that the applicants had illegally been denied access to habeas corpus ( Boumediene v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE _ _ ( DATE ) ) . The concluding paragraphs of the majority opinion read as follows :", "\u201c In considering both the procedural and substantive standards used to impose detention to prevent acts of terrorism , proper deference must be accorded to the political branches . GPE v. ORG , CARDINAL U. S. CARDINAL , CARDINAL ( DATE ) . Unlike the President and some designated Members of ORG , neither the Members of this ORG nor most federal judges begin DATE with briefings that may describe new and serious threats to our Nation and its people . The law must accord the Executive substantial authority to apprehend and detain those who pose a real danger to our security .", "Officials charged with DATE operational responsibility for our security may consider a judicial discourse on the history of LAW of DATE and like matters to be far removed from the Nation \u2019s present , urgent concerns . Established legal doctrine , however , must be consulted for its teaching . Remote in time it may be ; irrelevant to the present it is not . Security depends upon a sophisticated intelligence apparatus and the ability of our ORG to act and to interdict . There are further considerations , however . Security subsists , too , in fidelity to freedom \u2019s first principles . Chief among these are freedom from arbitrary and unlawful restraint and the personal liberty that is secured by adherence to the separation of powers . It is from these principles that the judicial authority to consider petitions for habeas corpus relief derives .", "Our opinion does not undermine the Executive \u2019s powers as Commander in Chief . On the contrary , the exercise of those powers is vindicated , not eroded , when confirmed by the Judicial Branch . Within the LAW \u2019s separation - of - powers structure , few exercises of judicial power are as legitimate or as necessary as the responsibility to hear challenges to the authority of the Executive to imprison a person . Some of these petitioners have been in custody for DATE with no definitive judicial determination as to the legality of their detention . Their access to the writ is a necessity to determine the lawfulness of their status , even if , in the end , they do not obtain the relief they seek . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL holders of mandates of special procedures of the former ORG submitted a joint report on the situation of detainees at LOC ( E / CN.CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The conclusions read as follows :", "\u201c DATE . International human rights law is applicable to the analysis of the situation of detainees in LOC . Indeed , human rights law applies at all times , even during situations of emergency and armed conflicts . The war on terror , as such , does not constitute an armed conflict for the purposes of the applicability of international humanitarian law . GPE has not notified to the Secretary - General of ORG or other GPE parties to the treaties any official derogation from LAW [ hereinafter \u2018 ORG ] or any other international human rights treaty to which it is a party .", "CARDINAL . The persons held at LOC are entitled to challenge the legality of their detention before a judicial body in accordance with article CARDINAL of ORG , and to obtain release if detention is found to lack a proper legal basis . This right is currently being violated , and the continuing detention of all persons held at LOC amounts to arbitrary detention in violation of article CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The executive branch of ORG operates as judge , prosecutor and defence counsel of the LOC detainees : this constitutes serious violations of various guarantees of the right to a fair trial before an independent tribunal as provided for by article CARDINAL of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Attempts by ORG to redefine \u2018 torture\u2019 in the framework of the struggle against terrorism in order to allow certain interrogation techniques that would not be permitted under the internationally accepted definition of torture are of utmost concern . The confusion with regard to authorized and unauthorized interrogation techniques over DATE is particularly alarming .", "CARDINAL . The interrogation techniques authorised by ORG , particularly if used simultaneously , amount to degrading treatment in violation of article CARDINAL of ORG and LAW of LAW . If in individual cases , which were described in interviews , the victim experienced severe pain or suffering , these acts amounted to torture as defined in article CARDINAL of the Convention . Furthermore , the general conditions of detention , in particular the uncertainty about the length of detention and prolonged solitary confinement , amount to inhuman treatment and to a violation of the right to health as well as a violation of the right of detainees under article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of ORG to be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person .", "CARDINAL . The excessive violence used in many cases during transportation , in operations by ORG and force - feeding of detainees on hunger strike must be assessed as amounting to torture as defined in DATE LAW .", "CARDINAL . The practice of rendition of persons to countries where there is a substantial risk of torture , such as in the case of Mr PERSON , amounts to a violation of the principle of non - refoulement and is contrary to article QUANTITY of LAW and article CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The lack of any impartial investigation into allegations of torture and ill - treatment and the resulting impunity of the perpetrators amount to a violation of articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention against Torture .", "CARDINAL . There are reliable indications that , in different circumstances , persons detained in the LOC detention facilities have been victims of violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief , contrary to article CARDINAL of ORG and the DATE [ Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief ] . It is of particular concern that some of these violations have even been authorised by the authorities . In addition , some interrogation techniques are based on religious discrimination and are aimed at offending the religious feelings of detainees .", "CARDINAL . The totality of the conditions of their confinement at LOC constitute a right - to - health violation because they derive from a breach of duty and have resulted in profound deterioration of the mental health of many detainees .", "CARDINAL . There are also serious concerns about the alleged violations of ethical standards by health professionals at LOC and the effect that such violations have on the quality of health care , including mental health care , the detainees are receiving .", "CARDINAL . The treatment of the detainees and the conditions of their confinement have led to prolonged hunger strikes .

Whilst the ORG therefore offers its full support to GPE in its efforts to fight terrorism , this must be on condition that all measures taken are fully respectful of human rights and the rule of law . Conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law is not a weakness in the fight against terrorism but a weapon , ensuring the widest international support for actions and avoiding situations which could provoke misplaced sympathy for terrorists or their causes .", "CARDINAL . GPE has long been a beacon of democracy and a champion of human rights throughout the world and its positive influence on NORP development in this respect since the Second World War is greatly appreciated . Nevertheless , the ORG considers that ORG has betrayed its own highest principles in the zeal with which it has attempted to pursue the \u2018 war on GPE . These errors have perhaps been most manifest in relation to LOC .", "CARDINAL . At no time have detentions at LOC been within a \u2018 legal black hole\u2019 . International human rights law has at all times been fully applicable to all detainees .
