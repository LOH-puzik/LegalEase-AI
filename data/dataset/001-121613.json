The authorisation was granted at the request of ORG ( \u201c the RIS \u201d ) under LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office issued a new similar authorisation , under LAW , granting interception of another of the applicant \u2019s telephone lines , also until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the RIS informed the prosecutor that the applicant had given bribes to several judges and prosecutors in order to obtain decisions favourable to her clients . It based the accusation on information obtained through the telephone tapping . Several conversations between the applicant and judge V.A. concerning cases of the applicant \u2019s clients had been recorded between CARDINAL and DATE .", "The PERSON handed over the audio tapes and their transcripts to the prosecutor \u2019s office . The prosecutor then continued the surveillance of the applicant \u2019s activities , including through telephone tapping .", "CARDINAL . In its report , the RIS referred to ORG as the applicant \u2019s \u201c intimate friend \u201d , whereas other participants in the various conversations recorded are referred to simply as \u201c friend \u201d . Those syntagms were reproduced several times in the decision adopted by the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant ( \u00eenceperea urm\u0103ririi penale ) .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of CARDINAL DATE , as the applicant was returning home by car accompanied by ORG , a fellow lawyer , she was apprehended by the police and taken to the prosecutor \u2019s office for questioning on charges of corruption .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was shown the PERSON report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and then questioned throughout the night . According to her , GPE was not allowed to attend the actual questioning ; he was allowed to see the applicant only afterwards , when she was writing a statement , which he then read and countersigned . In her statement the applicant confessed to the crimes and gave a detailed description of the facts . While the applicant was in the prosecutor \u2019s office , ORG completed a power of attorney document so that he could represent her in the event that she was taken into custody that TIME . The applicant did not sign that document .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a criminal complaint against the prosecutor in charge of the proceedings on TIME , but on DATE ORG attached to ORG decided not to prosecute . The applicant did not object to that decision before the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was hospitalised for panic attacks , impulsive personality disorders and stress induced by her workload . She left the hospital DATE , on her own initiative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor ordered the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial . However , she could not be arrested , as she had left the country . On DATE the applicant was apprehended in GPE .

On DATE , DATE and DATE , and DATE the applicant gave new statements to the prosecutor in the presence of her appointed counsels . She retracted her initial confession , claiming that it had not represented the truth but was a mere reproduction of what the prosecutor had read to her from the PERSON report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . She claimed that at the time she had made the initial statement she had been in a state of shock , having been traumatised by the prosecutor and forced to confess to deeds that she had not committed . The prosecutor had suggested that if she confessed , only disciplinary action would be taken against the judges and prosecutors suspected of corruption ; she was therefore led to believe that through her action she would help the magistrates who were under investigation .", "She denied having committed any of the acts of corruption imputed to her and claimed that she could not remember what she and the other defendants had been referring to in the conversations recorded by the PERSON and played to her by the prosecutor during questioning .", "Mention was made in the statements that the applicant had been informed of the charges brought against her and of the rights of the defence .", "CARDINAL .

Several other persons were committed to trial under the same measure , including judges V.A. and ORG and a prosecutor .", "In particular , the applicant was accused of having offered money to judges , including V.A. and ORG , in an attempt to have some of her clients released from pre - trial detention . She was also accused of having fled the country in order to escape the criminal proceedings against her .", "CARDINAL . The case was heard by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard testimony from each defendant and the relevant parts of the audio tapes were played in their presence . None of them denied having had the recorded conversations .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant denied having committed any crime and claimed that she could not remember exactly what she had been referring to in the conversations recorded by the RIS . She maintained that the discussions with V.A. had concerned only matters of law .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON also denied having committed any crime . He explained that his discussions with the applicant , which had been recorded through secret surveillance , as well as those he had had with his fellow judges about the cases referred to by the applicant , had concerned only questions of law . He maintained that he had not accepted any money or promise of money from the applicant . He reiterated that in his capacity as judge inspector , he was entitled to discuss questions of law with his colleagues .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON also denied having committed any crimes . She claimed that the only relevant discussions she had had with V.A. were in connection with the cases in which they had been sitting on the same bench . She declared that she did not know the applicant , had not accepted any money to intervene in any case and that the measures under scrutiny had been legitimate .", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing on DATE , the co - defendants alleged that there were procedural defects . They argued that as the prosecutor had failed to request the necessary authorisation for intercepting GPE conversations , the audio recordings were illegal .", "The court gave detailed answers to their complaints . Concerning the telephone tapping , it noted that CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s clients had been indicted for weapons and ammunition smuggling , which , under LAW , constituted a threat to national security and thus allowed the ORG , under a procedure regulated by LAW , to seek authorisation from the prosecutor to intercept the suspect \u2019s conversations . The fact that during the surveillance activity the authorities came across telephone discussions among the codefendants which led them to believe that the applicant was trying to corrupt judges constituted preliminary investigation ( acte premerg\u0103toare ) .", "ORG reiterated that so long as the recordings had been obtained during the preliminary investigation phase , they did not constitute evidence . Only if the judicial authorities considered their content relevant for the criminal proceedings could those recordings be admitted to the file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the statements made by the defendants were read out in court . They were allowed to supplement their testimony and put questions to their co - defendants .", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing ORG heard testimony from the witnesses for the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the GPE request , ORG ordered an expert examination of the audio tapes , in accordance with LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE ORG dismissed a request by the co - defendants , GPE and ORG , for the PERSON to be asked to adduce the reports drafted by the officers in charge of the surveillance and the reports attesting to the transfer of the audio tapes between the PERSON and the prosecutor \u2019s office . ORG considered that that evidence was irrelevant in so far as none of the parties involved had contested having had the recorded conversations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , CARDINAL May , and DATE ORG heard eight witnesses for the defence .", "CARDINAL . Lawyer T.C. attested that the applicant had been in a state of shock the night when she had been taken to the prosecutor \u2019s office to give a statement ; that he had accompanied her there but had not been allowed to attend the actual questioning ; and that only afterwards had he seen her writing the statement , which he had then read and countersigned . He reiterated that while the applicant had been in the prosecutor \u2019s office , he had completed a power of attorney document so that he could represent her ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL experts rendered their report , as requested by ORG . They concluded that the audio tapes were neither authentic nor original and advised against admitting them as evidence in the criminal trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a CARDINAL - judge bench , rendered its decision . It changed the legal classification from a continuous crime of giving bribes , to CARDINAL individual crimes of giving bribes . It convicted the applicant for the CARDINAL counts of giving bribes , for trading in influence and for illegally crossing the border , and sentenced her to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The co - defendants were likewise convicted and received prison sentences for their deeds . The sums of money received in bribes were confiscated .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the statements made by the defendants and the witnesses , both before the prosecutor and in open court , corroborated the theory that some of the applicant \u2019s clients had been released from prison because she had bribed the judges . The court also noted that some of the witnesses for the prosecution who had retracted their initial statements had admitted , either before the prosecutor or in court , that they had been pressured by the defendants into changing their declarations . The court also considered that the testimonies given by the applicant and the witnesses corroborated the transcripts of the telephone conversations .", "CARDINAL . ORG also made a lengthy analysis of the transcripts , thus responding to the GPE allegations that they had been obtained unlawfully and that they could not be used as evidence as they had been collected during the preliminary investigation stage . The court reiterated that none of the participants had denied having had the conversations recorded on the tapes produced by the prosecutor and listened to in open court . It noted that the experts had not questioned that aspect either .", "As for the authenticity and originality of the tapes , which the experts contested , the court pointed out that , in the sense of LAW , the report concerning the transcripts , drafted by the prosecutor after the opening of the criminal proceedings , represented the evidence and not the tapes themselves ( which were attached to the prosecutor \u2019s report , as the law required ) ; neither did the original harddisk on which the conversations had been recorded . In his report , the prosecutor attested to the authenticity of the recordings and proved that the procedure in place for the telephone tapping had been respected . The court confirmed those aspects . The defendants had had ample opportunity to challenge it , as provided for by the ORG .", "Moreover , the court observed that the original recording had been digital , done straight onto the hard - disk of the equipment used by the RIS for telephone tapping ; the tapes attached to the prosecutor \u2019s report were consequently copies of the original recordings . Because of its nature and purpose , the hard - disk could not be attached to the prosecutor \u2019s report ; furthermore , it did not need to be attached as it did not constitute evidence . The court concluded that the absence of the hard - disk did not automatically disqualify the transcripts from being used as evidence .", "The court noted that , for obvious reasons related to respect for the private life of those involved , it had not listened to all the conversations recorded by the ORG , but only to those relevant to the charges brought before it . However , the parts presented to it and to the defendants by the prosecutor represented full conversations . The dialogues were coherent , the sentences were not truncated and no words were missing or had been inserted into the dialogues . It observed that neither the experts nor the parties had claimed that the content of the conversations heard in court had been falsified .", "CARDINAL . The court was therefore satisfied that the prosecutor \u2019s report on the telephone tapping and its transcripts qualified as lawful evidence for admission to the case file .", "CARDINAL . ORG further dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaints concerning the manner in which she had been questioned by the prosecutor in TIME CARDINAL DATE . In particular , the court observed that the applicant \u2019s statement was clear and coherent . In the court \u2019s opinion , it showed no signs of having been given in an unbalanced mental state , as the applicant had tried to claim afterwards . The court proceeded to examine in parallel the PERSON report and the applicant \u2019s incriminatory statement , and noted that she had offered significant details that did not figure in the PERSON report . This proved that she had had the conversations , as only a direct participant could have known aspects that had not been revealed in the PERSON report but had later been confirmed by supporting evidence . It also noted that neither she nor her counsel had made any complaints at that time about the questioning or the alleged disregard for the rights of the defence .", "CARDINAL . All parties appealed against the judgment . In particular , the applicant complained that ORG had changed the classification of the crimes ; that she had been forced to make the initial statement of CARDINAL DATE ; that the telephone tapping had been illegal and in breach of LAW she asked the court to hear evidence from the experts \u2013 and lastly , that there had not been sufficient elements to justify her conviction by the lower court .", "The applicant made no specific complaints concerning the wording of the judgment , in particular about the manner in which the court had qualified CARDINAL of her interlocutors as an \u201c intimate friend \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The case was heard by a CARDINAL - judge bench of ORG , who rendered the final decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the telephone tapping had not observed the stricter requirements relating to magistrates . It was nevertheless satisfied that such requirements were not relevant in the case because the magistrates had not been targeted by the initial measure of telephone tapping ; on this point it reiterated that the information concerning the GPE alleged involvement had been obtained incidentally by the prosecutor . It observed that for the procedural acts concerning the magistrates the prosecutor had obtained all the necessary authorisations . The court also reiterated that as the tapes had disclosed information on the commission of crimes , they could not have been ignored by the authorities . Furthermore , the tapes had been made with the prosecutor \u2019s prior approval , as the law had required at the time , and had not contravened public order . ORG attached great importance to the fact that the defendants had not denied having had the recorded conversations . It also noted that the information obtained through the telephone tapping had been confirmed by the evidence in the file . It therefore concluded that the tapes could be used as evidence .", "ORG also decided that the evidence had to be interpreted in its entirety and in context , and reiterated that the law did not give precedence to any type of evidence to the detriment of others .", "CARDINAL . It therefore concluded that the evidence in the file was sufficient and that the first - instance court had correctly interpreted the facts based on the elements at its disposal .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the first - instance court had changed the legal classification of the crimes committed by the applicant from a continuous crime of giving bribe to several individual crimes of giving bribes and of the crimes committed by V.A. from a continuous crime of trading in influence and aiding and abetting the applicant to give bribes to several individual crimes of trading in influence and aiding and abetting the applicant to give bribes . It accepted that the first - instance court had erred in not allowing the parties to discuss the new legal classification of the crimes . However , it noted that such a failure did not trigger the nullity of the judgment and that in fact there had not been any risk of the defendants being disadvantaged by the new classification , as the consequences in law for both situations were identical .", "CARDINAL . From the date of her arrest on DATE until her release on DATE , the applicant was held mainly in ORG and ORG . She was first taken to the latter on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the conditions of detention in ORG , the applicant alleged that she had been held in overcrowded , badly ventilated cells . She claimed that the occupancy rate had been CARDINAL prisoners to CARDINAL - bed cell . She had had to share the cell with individuals suffering from consumption or HIV . She alleged that the detainee who had been suffering from HIV had been violent and had threatened her fellow inmates that she would contaminate them with the virus . The applicant further alleged that the prison authorities had failed to intervene , despite her complaints .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the official prison documents submitted by the Government that in ORG the applicant was held in a QUANTITY . m cell containing CARDINAL bunk beds . The cell had a QUANTITY . m window , and the ventilation was ensured naturally through the door and window . It contained a separate toilet measuring CARDINAL sq . m with a window and a shower room measuring QUANTITY m. The detainees had permanent access to running drinkable water ; hot water was available twice DATE for TIME at a time . The inmates were responsible for cleaning the facilities with products provided by the prison administration .", "The detainees were allowed DATE walks of TIME in the prison court yard .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , during her stay in FAC she had had to work for TIME each day and received less than the DATE average salary .", "CARDINAL . The official prison records submitted by the ORG attested that the applicant had worked an average of DATE a month for DATE TIME a day , which was below TIME working day permissible under LAW ( \u201c Law no . CARDINAL \u201d ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In accordance with the relevant law , the applicant \u2019s sentence was reduced in proportion to the work performed . She also received remuneration for her work , of which , in accordance with the law , PERCENT was paid to her and PERCENT to the prison .", "CARDINAL . During her stay in FAC the applicant lodged a complaint under Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the rights of persons deprived of their liberty ( \u201c Ordinance no . CARDINAL \u201d ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) alleging lack of privacy when making telephone calls from prison . She complained that the telephones were too close to each other to allow for private conversations and that the wardens remained close by when prisoners were using the phones . She sought MONEY ( ORG ) in damages for mental suffering .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the information submitted by the prison authorities that detainees were required to write down in a special register the date and start time of telephone calls , the number dialled , and to sign their name .", "DATE . On DATE the Ploie\u015fti District Court dismissed the complaint , considering that the situation in FAC respected the relevant regulations concerning the confidentiality of telephone conversations and that therefore no infringement of the privacy rights guaranteed under LAW CARDINAL could be found .", "CARDINAL . In an appeal lodged against ORG judgment , the applicant pointed out that all the phone numbers dialled from prison were recorded in a special register , along with the date and time of the respective calls .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld ORG decision . It observed that the telephones were placed at regular QUANTITY intervals CARDINAL metres from the warden \u2019s booth . Under the regulations , the warden had an obligation to check that the telephone number dialled was the same as that entered by the prisoner in the special register , but she did not monitor the telephone conversation itself . The court considered that the registration of the dialled numbers did not constitute a breach of ORG privacy rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed for divorce and custody of her minor child , on the grounds that her relationship with her husband had started to become tense in DATE ; he had neglected their CARDINAL children and had ultimately left home in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The request was granted and in a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared the couple divorced . The applicant reverted to her maiden name , Niculescu .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was suspended from ORG for the duration of the criminal proceedings against her .", "On DATE ORG decided , based on a recommendation by ORG , to exclude the applicant from its list of members . This decision was not communicated to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . As the final decision of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and following , above ) did not prohibit the applicant from exercising her profession , on DATE she asked ORG to reinstate her . On DATE the ORG refused her request and informed her of the decision taken on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having objected unsuccessfully to ORG , the applicant lodged a complaint with the administrative courts , invoking both procedural and substantive flaws in the contested decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint , giving detailed responses to all the arguments raised by the applicant . In particular , the court noted that the applicant \u2019s name had been struck from ORG list of lawyers not to prohibit her from exercising her profession , but because , in committing crimes in the exercise of her profession , she had become unfit to practise as a lawyer , in accordance with LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . An appeal lodged by the applicant was subsequently dismissed by ORG and ORG , which gave the final ruling in the case on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

However , a NORP NGO , ORG for ORG in GPE \u2013 ORG ) visited that establishment on CARDINAL DATE . The report prepared following its visit indicated that , based on the information submitted by the authorities , the average personal space for each prisoner was QUANTITY . m. The overcrowding was obvious when visiting individual cells : CARDINAL of the cells visited , measuring QUANTITY m , had accommodated CARDINAL prisoners , even though CARDINAL beds had been available . The report indicated that CARDINAL detainee had complained about the quality of the prison food and that many prisoners had preferred to eat the food they received from home or bought from the shop ( see PERSON v.

Concerning the telephone tapping at the preliminary investigation stage , ORG and ORG considered , in a decision rendered in an appeal on points of law ( decision no .

However , the person concerned had subsequently had an opportunity to listen to the recordings and contest their content .
