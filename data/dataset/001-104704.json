On DATE ORG of Rostov - on - Don held that the search had been carried out in compliance with the domestic law . The applicant alleged that he had not been informed of the above decision until DATE . Thus , he had been prevented from lodging an ordinary appeal against it . Later , the applicant tried to initiate a supervisory review of the decision of DATE . However , on CARDINAL DATE the Rostov ORG found that there were no grounds for quashing the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Rostov - on - Don remanded the applicant in custody . The decision read as follows :", "\u201c ... From the material submitted by the prosecution , it follows that [ the applicant ] was charged with several particularly serious offences , and there are grounds to suspect him of having committed other similar crimes ... Besides , as it follows from the submitted material , during the search carried out at the applicant \u2019s flat on DATE , [ the applicant \u2019s wife ] went to the balcony and threw out [ documents ] , suggesting that she was therefore trying to hide material evidence from the investigation ... This gives grounds to believe that , if not detained , [ the applicant ] may interfere with the proper administration of justice by destroying or hiding evidence , preventing the investigative authorities from uncovering other instances of his illegal activities , as well as putting pressure on those witnesses who had not yet been identified or questioned .", "[ The applicant ] did not provide any medical documents certifying that his state of health prevented him from being held in detention ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention interrupted the inpatient treatment he had meanwhile been undergoing for an aggravated chronic kidney condition ( acute pyelonephritis ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court held as follows :", "\u201c ... [ The applicant ] is charged with several particularly grave crimes committed by an organised group ; until now , the investigating authorities have not identified all those involved in the criminal activities in respect of which [ the applicant ] has been charged ; [ the applicant ] knows the persons in question . In view of the above , the court considers that , if not detained , the applicant might threaten witnesses and destroy the evidence , thereby obstructing justice ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , claiming that the above decision was groundless . In particular , the applicant did not know any of the witnesses , all the relevant documents were seized by the investigating authorities , the applicant was suspended from work , his access to documents was restricted and the key to his office was confiscated . Furthermore , the applicant stated that he had no criminal record , that he had a permanent place of residence and a family , that , prior to his detention , he had been undergoing medical treatment for pyelonephritis but that the treatment had been interrupted and thus the condition had been aggravated and that others involved in the case had been given more lenient preventive measures .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant made an application for release , which on DATE was dismissed by ORG with reference to the absence of sufficient grounds for altering the preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG maintained the applicant \u2019s custodial measure and extended it until DATE . The court reasoned its decision by the fact that the criminal case against the applicant was being examined at the final stage of the judicial investigation , that the applicant was charged with several particularly serious offences and that , if released , he might abscond or otherwise obstruct the administration of justice .", "CARDINAL .
