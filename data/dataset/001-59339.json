According to the applicant , in DATE he joined ORG ( \u201c the CUF \u201d ) , an opposition party in GPE . He was an active member , attending meetings and contributing money to the party funds . In DATE the applicant was arrested by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d , the ruling party ) officers because of his involvement with the CUF . He was detained at GPE police station in GPE for DATE , where he was tortured . He was repeatedly locked in a cell full of water for DATE at a time so he was unable to lie down . He was hung upside down with his feet tied together until he bled through the nose , and he was also subjected to electric shocks .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant stated that he was released from detention following pressure from CUF leaders on the NORP government . He was admitted to hospital , where a medical officer recorded that the applicant was haemorrhaging severely through the nose as a result of his treatment and had been subjected to harm endangering life .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that his brother had been taken into detention shortly before he was . He had been ill - treated and died in DATE in hospital where he had been taken from prison .", "CARDINAL . NORP Following his release , the applicant stated that he only contributed funds to the CUF . In DATE the police came looking for him while he was out . The police detained his wife TIME and questioned his friends . He decided to leave his home and GPE , fearing for his safety .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE and claimed asylum . DATE a pro forma interview was held with an immigration officer , where the applicant was assisted by an interpreter . According to the form , the purpose of the interview was to enable the immigration officer to take down the initial details of the asylum application . When asked what the basis of his asylum claim was , the applicant was noted as having said : \u201c Because of the problems in the country and my safety . I have been threatened a lot by the ruling party so I decided to leave the country . \u201d The applicant stated that he had been a member of the ORG since DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the full asylum interview held on DATE , the applicant was recorded as stating that he had had no problem in obtaining a passport as he was a businessman , and that he had organised his passage to GPE himself . When asked what the basis for his asylum claim was , he stated that he had been taken away and detained for DATE , from DATE , at GPE police station , where he had been tortured . He had been locked in a room with a very low ceiling , where he could not stand up , and then placed for DATE in a room filled with water up to the chest , where he could not lie down . He was taken out and returned there twice a week . DATE before he was released he was hung upside down and given electric shocks . He had been arrested because he gave money to the CUF . He was told that he had been released because the CUF leaders had approached the authorities in GPE . After his release , he was treated in a private clinic . He produced his ORG card . He had been an ordinary member , doing nothing more than give money . He had not taken part in the demonstration which had been allowed . He mentioned that his brother had been arrested in DATE and died after being in police custody . His brother had been badly beaten and was vomiting blood , so they had released him to hospital on DATE as they knew he was going to die . His uncle had helped him to leave , obtaining an income - tax clearance and an airline ticket . His uncle checked in with the ticket for him and he was able to board the plane .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG refused asylum , finding the applicant \u2019s account implausible and noting inconsistencies in his answers . The applicant \u2019s appeal to a special adjudicator was dismissed on DATE . During the proceedings the applicant had claimed that the NORP authorities intercepted the letters he was sending home , knew that he had claimed asylum , and had summoned his parents to explain", "\u201c about [ their ] son who [ was ] in a foreign country to abuse the government which [ was ] in power ... \u201d", "He provided correspondence from ORG concerning his enquiries about money which had gone missing from a registered letter dated DATE which he had sent to his parents in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In his decision the special adjudicator noted inconsistencies between the evidence given by the applicant before him and the answers given in his asylum interviews . He placed considerable weight on the fact that the applicant had not mentioned his arrest and torture at his first asylum interview and did not accept the applicant \u2019s explanation that the interviewing officer told him that it was not necessary to give details at this stage or that he was having difficulties with the interpreter . He also noted that the evidence concerning his brother \u2019s arrest was contradictory and that no documentary evidence such as a death certificate had been produced . He therefore did not accept that the applicant \u2019s brother was arrested , tortured or killed . He also observed that the applicant had not provided documentary evidence that the GPE authorities were accusing him of tarnishing GPE \u2019s good name , and therefore did not accept that it existed . Looking at the evidence as a whole , he concluded that there was no well - founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason established to the required standard .", "CARDINAL . Leave to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant obtained a copy of his brother \u2019s death certificate and a medical report which recorded that his brother died on DATE , after being brought to hospital from prison with a history of severe chest pain and general body weakness associated with a fever . He also obtained the summons from the Pemba police headquarters to his parents dated CARDINAL DATE requesting their attendance to explain the applicant \u2019s unlawful conduct in embarrassing the government and country . He made representations to the Secretary of ORG dated DATE , providing copies and requesting that his letter be considered as a fresh asylum application .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the Secretary of ORG expressed the view that the police summons was self - serving and not significant , while the death certificate did not disclose proof that his brother , who died of a fever , had been murdered by the authorities . He had , accordingly , decided not to treat the representations as a fresh application for asylum , but to reconsider the original asylum application on all the evidence available to him . He refused on that basis to reverse his decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s representatives requested , alternatively , that the new material be referred to the special adjudicator under LAW of LAW DATE . By letter dated DATE the Secretary of ORG informed them that he had decided not to refer the material in question .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s representatives submitted to the Secretary of ORG a medical report about the applicant \u2019s treatment following detention in GPE , and requested that the new materials be submitted to the special adjudicator under section CARDINAL . They submitted further representations on DATE .", "The hospital medical report , dated DATE , from a medical officer recorded that the applicant had suffered a severe nasal haemorrhage , that this was of a \u201c dangerous harm \u201d degree and that the injury had been inflicted by hanging upside down .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the Secretary of ORG informed the applicant that he had considered the new material , but that this evidence did not cause him to reverse his decision to refuse asylum . He noted that the documents would have been available to the applicant at the time of his appeal hearing but were not produced , which cast doubt on their authenticity . Even if the medical certificate and police summons were authentic , however , he saw no reason why the applicant could not return to live safely and without harassment in mainland GPE . He refused to make a reference under section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s refusal to refer the new material to the special adjudicator . He submitted an expert opinion confirming that the documents were genuine . The Secretary of ORG submitted that the documents were irrelevant because the applicant could live safely in mainland GPE . He relied on a letter from ORG in GPE dated DATE which stated that in general there was no evidence of politically motivated detentions on the mainland , although there were \u201c more general human rights problems such as arbitrary detentions and poor penal conditions \u201d on the mainland .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the application for leave was rejected by ORG . Mr Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c The Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision [ is ] that things have changed and that as matters now stand , whatever was or was not the case in DATE and whatever ought or ought not to have been the outcome of the appeal heard then , the applicant can safely return to his home country , provided he goes to the mainland . Having looked at the letter [ from ORG ] , I can see no arguable grounds for saying that the Secretary of ORG has acted with ORG unreasonableness in concluding that in the light of this new material he has no need to refer the matter to the Special Adjudicator and this application must be refused . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG arguing that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s refusal was wrong in law and \u201c ORG unreasonable \u201d and that , in claiming that the applicant could live safely on the mainland , he was not complying with international obligations by failing to take into account the applicant \u2019s specific case or documentation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to apply for judicial review . In its judgment it noted that the hospital records showed that his brother had died of fever and did not support the applicant \u2019s evidence that his brother had been tortured . Even assuming that the medical report on the applicant and the summons by the police to his parents were genuine , there was no evidence to suggest that the conclusion reached by the Secretary of ORG that the applicant could live without harassment on the mainland was wrong .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was notified that he would be removed to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife arrived in GPE and claimed asylum shortly afterwards . It was recorded that she stated in her interview that the police had harassed her due to her husband \u2019s involvement with the CUF . She had been detained for DATE in DATE and questioned about her husband \u2019s whereabouts . The police came to her house on DATE , wanting to know if her husband was back in GPE as there was a rumour that GPE had sent back most of the asylum - seekers from GPE . They were angry because he had claimed asylum and tarnished the name of the President . They threatened to arrest her instead .", "CARDINAL . Asylum applications are determined by the Secretary of ORG , pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL of ORG and section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Where leave to enter is refused by the Secretary of ORG pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , the person may appeal against the refusal to a special adjudicator on the grounds that the removal would be contrary to GPE obligations under LAW ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . An appeal lies from the special adjudicator to ORG ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where in any case :", "( a ) an adjudicator has dismissed an appeal , and there has been no further appeal to ORG , or the tribunal has dismissed an appeal made to them ... ; or", "( b ) ORG has affirmed the determination of an adjudicator dismissing an appeal ... the Secretary of ORG may at any time refer for consideration under this section any matter relating to the case which was not before the adjudicator or ORG ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Rule CARDINAL of ORG provides that the Secretary of ORG will treat representations as a fresh application if the claim advanced is sufficiently different from the earlier claim . He disregards , in considering whether to treat the representations as a fresh claim , material which is not significant , or is not credible , or was available to the applicant at the time when the previous application was refused or when any appeal was determined .", "CARDINAL . There have been a number of domestic cases where special adjudicators have rejected \u201c internal flight \u201d possibilities for ORG members from GPE . In PERSON v. the Secretary of ORG ( DATE ) , the Government pointed out that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s counsel had not been present to argue the point . In PERSON the Secretary of ORG ( DATE ) , the asylum claimant was an escaped prisoner from GPE and a target for internal extradition proceedings . In PERSON v. the Secretary of ORG ( DATE ) , the adjudicator found that there was no evidence before him to show that the claimant would be any safer on the mainland than in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the case of PERSON v. the Secretary of ORG ( DATE ) , ORG allowed the appeal of a NORP asylum - seeker who had been involved in ORG activities , on the basis that , as he had suffered torture in GPE and a summons had been issued against him in GPE generally , there was a very reasonable prospect that he would be picked up by the police and undergo ill - treatment similar to that previously received in GPE , either at the hands of the GPE authorities or of the police in mainland GPE who also exercised brutality on prisoners in their custody . It therefore rejected the \u201c internal flight \u201d option .", "CARDINAL . Decisions of the ORG Secretary to refuse asylum , to make a deportation order or to detain pending deportation are liable to challenge by way of judicial review and may be quashed by reference to the ordinary principles of LANGUAGE public law .", "CARDINAL . These principles do not permit the courts to make findings of fact on matters within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of ORG or to substitute their discretion for the minister \u2019s . The courts may quash his decision only if he has failed to interpret or apply LANGUAGE law correctly , if he has failed to take account of issues which he was required by law to address , or if his decision was so irrational or perverse that no reasonable Secretary of ORG could have made it ( ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the recent case of NORP v. Home Secretary , ex parte PERSON ( DATE ) , concerning the Secretary of ORG \u2019s refusal of asylum to a young male NORP draft evader , Lord Justice PERSON , in ORG judgment , stated as follows :", "\u201c I therefore conclude that the domestic court \u2019s obligation on an irrationality challenge in an LAW case is to subject the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision to rigorous examination and this it does by considering the underlying factual material for itself to see whether it compels a different conclusion to that arrived at by the Secretary of ORG . Only if it does will the challenge succeed .", "All that said , however , this is not an area in which the ORG will pay any especial deference to the Secretary of ORG \u2019s conclusion on the facts . In the first place , the human right involved here DATE the right not to be exposed to a real risk of LAW treatment DATE is both absolute and fundamental : it is not a qualified right requiring a balance to be struck with some competing social need . Secondly , the ORG here is hardly less well placed than the Secretary of ORG himself to evaluate the risk once the relevant material is before it . Thirdly , whilst I would reject the applicant \u2019s contention that the Secretary of ORG has knowingly misrepresented the evidence or shut his eyes to the true position , we must , I think , recognise at least the possibility that he has ( even if unconsciously ) tended to depreciate the evidence of risk and , throughout the protracted decision - making process , may have tended also to rationalise the further material adduced so as to maintain his pre - existing stance rather than reassess the position with an open mind . In circumstances such as these , what has been called the \u2018 discretionary area of judgment\u2019 \u2013 the area of judgment within which the ORG should defer to the Secretary of ORG as the person primarily entrusted with the decision on the applicant \u2019s removal ...

Other human rights problems included police beatings and mistreatment of suspects , which sometimes resulted in death .
