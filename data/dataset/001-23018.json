THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON O\u2019Connell , are GPE nationals , who were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and are currently detained or live in FAC PERSON Yarm , FAC The GPE , GPE ( GPE ) and ORG ( GPE ) , respectively . They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON ( GPE and PERSON ) and PERSON PERSON ( GPE and O\u2019Connell ) , solicitors practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are former police officers in the detective branch of ORG in GPE , who were convicted of offences of corruption committed in the course of their police work . PERSON and PERSON were tried together along with CARDINAL other police officers and GPE and O\u2019Connell were tried together along with CARDINAL other police officer .", "The convictions of PERSON and PERSON relied , inter alia , on the evidence of CARDINAL witnesses who were also involved in the events at issue and charged with related offences . The first witness , PERSON , was a former police informant who was in prison for drug offences and the second , ORG , was a police officer who had worked with the applicants . The convictions of ORG and O\u2019Connell depended essentially on the evidence given by ORG .", "In DATE , PERSON was removed from prison by officers of ORG under the authority of an order under LAW DATE . While held in police custody over a period of DATE , she made detailed allegations of crimes allegedly committed by her with various police officers including PERSON and PERSON . She was detained in various police stations but was removed for the purposes of entertainment , shopping trips , welfare visits etc .", "In DATE , ORG home was searched and he subsequently admitted CARDINAL acts of corruption in which he said he had engaged with other police officers including PERSON and PERSON . ORG was charged with these offences and remanded in custody but subsequently removed from prison and detained in police stations on the same basis as PERSON . While in detention , he admitted participation in further offences , also implicating PERSON , PERSON and others . He was periodically brought back before ORG and remanded in custody . He was also removed from the police station for social and welfare visits , entertainment and on CARDINAL occasion to test drive a sports car .", "Both witnesses recorded , in letters or a diary , that they were threatened by the police as to the very serious consequences of failing to reveal crimes . During the detention of the CARDINAL witnesses , some conversations were tape - recorded and under formal caution while others were not under caution and/or were not recorded in notes .", "In DATE , the CARDINAL witnesses were charged with the criminal offences they had admitted over DATE of detention and were taken to court . On DATE , PERSON and ORG pleaded guilty to various offences and sentence was postponed at the request of the prosecution .", "In DATE , PERSON and PERSON were arrested and charged and committed for trial in DATE .", "On DATE , the trial of PERSON and PERSON began . Despite the submissions of the applicants to the contrary , the trial judge , Mr Justice PERSON , decided that the CARDINAL witnesses should be sentenced at the end of PERSON and PERSON \u2019s trial on the basis that he would then be in a better position to assess the relevance of the evidence to any particular defendant .", "On DATE , PERSON was called as a witness and stated that she did not wish to give evidence since she had believed that the hearing would be in camera . On DATE , the judge made several orders restricting the disclosure of certain information relating to PERSON .", "On DATE , following the receipt of a letter from PERSON requesting that her evidence be heard in camera , the judge ruled that parts of PERSON \u2019s evidence would be heard in camera . On DATE , ORG overturned the ruling of the trial judge and held that PERSON \u2019s evidence should not be heard in camera . PERSON subsequently declined to give evidence unless the questioning was limited .", "On DATE , the jury were discharged after the judge was told in open court and counsel of the defence were assured privately by the prosecution that PERSON would not be called as a witness in a retrial . Counsel for the prosecution stated to the court that :", "\u201c Publicity relating to the evidence that she has given would potentially prejudice such a re - trial because she [ Fleckney ] would not be a witness in any circumstances . \u201d ( emphasis added )", "On DATE , at a hearing prior to the commencement of the second trial , the prosecution informed the court that PERSON had reconsidered and was willing to give evidence , and that they intended to call her as a witness . Counsel for PERSON and PERSON argued that it was unfair to admit PERSON \u2019s evidence since they had relied on the undertaking given by the prosecution and the evidence should be excluded under section CARDINAL of ORG . Alternatively , counsel argued that the court should only allow PERSON to be called after a voir dire , asking her for an explanation for her change of position since the defence believed that inducement by the prosecution had caused this volte face . The judge refused the request for a voir dire and ruled that it would not render the trial unfair or constitute an abuse of process for PERSON to be called as a witness and permitted the prosecution to call her . This decision was made on the grounds , inter alia , that the undertaking given by the prosecution was not that there would be no trial as in previous cases where an abuse of process was found and that the evidence of PERSON was capable of being relevant , admissible and probative .", "On DATE , counsel for PERSON renewed the application to exclude PERSON \u2019s evidence and pointed to a statement from PERSON submitted on CARDINAL DATE to the effect that if he had been aware that PERSON might be called at a retrial , he would have decided to continue with the original trial . The judge stated that all these points had been covered in the ruling on DATE and it was not appropriate for him to re - open the matter in the absence of reference to some authority which indicated that ruling to be wrong .", "At the close of the prosecution case , counsel for PERSON and PERSON applied to stay the proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process , inter alia , on the basis of section CARDINAL of ORG \u201c PACE DATE \u201d ) due to the manner of the detention and the interrogation of PERSON and GPE . On DATE , the trial judge ruled that the relevant part of PACE DATE did not apply to PERSON and GPE since they had both already been remanded in custody by a court . Applying the common law test ( which he believed was identical to that in PACE ) , the judge ruled that the admission of their evidence would not have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that he ought not to admit it .", "On DATE , PERSON was convicted of CARDINAL counts of conspiracy to supply Class B drugs and CARDINAL counts of perverting the course of public justice . He was acquitted of CARDINAL other counts . On DATE , PERSON was convicted of CARDINAL count of conspiracy to supply Class B drugs and CARDINAL counts of perverting the course of public justice . He was acquitted of CARDINAL other counts .", "On DATE , PERSON and PERSON , and PERSON and ORG sentenced . PERSON was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and PERSON was sentenced to DATE . PERSON was convicted of CARDINAL offences and sentenced to DATE ordered to run concurrently with her existing sentence of DATE . PERSON was convicted of CARDINAL offences and sentenced to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment after the deduction of CARDINAL of the sentence for his guilty plea and a further CARDINAL for his assistance to the prosecution in the cases of PERSON and GPE .", "The prosecution case against ORG and O\u2019Connell rested principally on ORG evidence and at the start of the trial , counsel for each of the applicants applied to the judge to exclude the evidence of ORG and/or to stay the proceedings for abuse of process . The trial judge , Judge PERSON , dismissed these applications on the grounds that PACE DATE did not apply and that insofar as there were any breaches of the code of practice which was applicable under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act DATE ( \u201c CPIA Code DATE \u201d ) in the interrogation of GPE , they went to the weight and reliability of ORG evidence rather than its admissibility .", "On DATE , ORG was convicted of conspiracy to supply a Class B controlled drug and O\u2019Connell was convicted of doing an act tending and intended to pervert the course of public justice . They were each sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "PERSON and GPE both appealed , inter alia , on the grounds that it was an abuse of process for the Crown to call PERSON as a witness in light of the undertaking given at the aborted first trial and that the judge should have allowed a voir dire regarding PERSON \u2019s change of position . The second ground was that the evidence of PERSON and PERSON was obtained as a result of wrongful detention , inducement , oppression and contraventions of PACE , which together amounted to an abuse of process which should have led the judge to exclude such evidence . ORG and O\u2019Connell both appealed , inter alia , on the grounds that the trial judge erred in failing to exclude the evidence of ORG under section CARDINAL of PACE DATE and that the judge should have stayed the proceedings as an abuse of process for the breaches of the CPIA Code CARDINAL .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the appeals of all of the applicants against conviction but allowed the appeals of PERSON and PERSON against sentence , reducing their sentences by DATE and DATE respectively . In respect of the claim regarding breach of the prosecution \u2019s undertaking , ORG held that there was no abuse of process on the grounds , inter alia , that the prosecution \u2019s undertaking was made in good faith , the reversal of position was due to a sudden change in circumstance and the defence did not suffer real prejudice or irremediable disadvantage by PERSON being called . The court stated that even if the applicants had believed that PERSON might be called at the retrial , the judge would not have granted a request to continue with the original trial . Further , a voir dire to discern the reason for PERSON \u2019s change of position was unnecessary and would have usurped the function of the jury . With regard to the argument that the evidence of PERSON and GPE should be excluded on the grounds of abuse of process , the prosecution conceded that there may have been breaches of LAW and the codes of practice which were applicable under PACE DATE due to the failure of the police to record all the interviews with PERSON and GPE . However , the court held that the police acted in good faith and did not deliberately circumvent the rules in a manner which would make it an affront to the public conscience for the prosecution to proceed . The court stated that the witnesses and their legal representatives consented to the procedure adopted and that the irregularities conceded by the prosecution did not amount to an abuse of process .", "On DATE , ORG refused the petitions of GPE , PERSON and GPE for leave to appeal .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act ( PACE ) DATE provides that :", "\u201c In any proceedings the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the court that , having regard to all the circumstances , including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained , the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it . \u201d", "It is possible to stay criminal proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process . In NORP v. PERSON ORG ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON , ORG stated that it is for the judge in the exercise of his discretion to decide whether there has been an abuse of process , which amounts to an affront to the public conscience and requires the criminal proceedings to be stayed .", "In the case of NORP v. GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON , ORG found that where an indication had been given coram judice ( in the presence of the judge ) that the prosecution would not proceed with the case and subsequently went back on its undertaking , the proceedings should have been stayed for abuse of process since to allow such practices would bring the administration of justice into disrepute . In the present case , ORG distinguished GPE on the grounds that there , the question was whether or not the prosecution \u2019s breach of undertaking rendered it an abuse of process for proceedings to be brought at all whereas here , the issue was whether it was an abuse of process for the trial to proceed with , rather than without , PERSON \u2019s evidence due to the prosecution \u2019s indication that she would not be called .", "In the present case , ORG applied a CARDINAL - prong test to the question of whether it was an abuse of process for PERSON to be called contrary to the prosecution \u2019s previous indication :", "( CARDINAL ) What were the nature and circumstances of the indication ?", "( CARDINAL ) What was the reason for the indication ; was it given bona fide and without intention to mislead the defence ?", "( CARDINAL ) What was the explanation for the change of position ?", "( CARDINAL ) Did the undertaking result in substantial detriment or irremediable prejudice to the defence or otherwise render a fair trial impossible ?", "Regarding the holding of a voir dire on possible abuse issues , the decision as to whether this is necessary or appropriate is a matter for the discretion of the judge . A number of cases , cited by ORG , state that it is generally undesirable for a judge to hold a voir dire to decide an issue as to whether evidence is fabricated as it usurps the function of the jury ( e.g. R v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . CARDINAL ) .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG DATE gives effect to Schedule CARDINAL of the Act , which provides inter alia that :", "\u201c CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) If the Secretary of ORG is satisfied , in the case of \u2013", "( a ) a person remanded in custody in any part of GPE in connection with an offence ;", "( b ) a person serving a sentence of imprisonment in any part of GPE ; or", "( c ) a person not falling within paragraph ( a ) or ( b ) above who is detained in a prison in any part of GPE ,", "that the attendance of that person at any place in that or any other part of GPE or in any of GPE is desirable in the interests of justice or for the purposes of any public inquiry , the Secretary of ORG may direct that person to be taken to that place . \u201d", "This provision of LAW replaced section CARDINAL of LAW DATE .", "Part IV of PACE DATE governs the conditions of police detention but according to section CARDINAL ) , a person is considered to be in police detention if :", "\u201c ( a ) he has been taken to a police station after being arrested for an offence ...", "( b ) he is arrested at a police station after attending voluntarily at the station or accompanying a constable to it . \u201d", "This definition does not cover serving prisoners ( PERSON ) or those remanded in custody ( ORG and thus , the PACE safeguards did not apply . Certain parts of LAW \u201d and all of LAW on ORG with Suspects \u201d issued under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of PACE appear to apply to all persons in police detention . Further , LAW under the ORG DATE applies to all criminal investigations conducted by police officers and section CARDINAL requires the recording of all material relevant to the investigation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
