Furthermore , in DATE O.O. ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) went to PERSON and met the applicant and PERSON , who showed him the documents .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a statement given before the prosecutor on DATE , the applicant said that he could not remember having discussed the secret documents with ORG He also said that as soon as he had found out about the information in question , he became interested in it as a journalist . Because there were doubts about the authenticity of the documents , he had had to contact a number of people in order to verify the information . It was in that context that he had discussed and shown the said documents to ORG and GPE , who had let him believe they had connections with high - ranking politicians . He acknowledged that he might have told some of his friends that he had seen secret documents in order to be given more credit as an investigative journalist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of ORG informed the chief prosecutor of the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG and ORG that the documents which formed the object of the investigation and which had been issued by the NORP army , and had been compromised by their publication in the media , had been de - classified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG and ORG decided that \u201c by receiving ( obtaining ) from ORG a CD that he [ had ] watched CARDINAL times ; by saving on the hard drive of his computer the information classified as ORG secret and work secret and by giving the CD to GPE and ORG , outside the legal framework set forth by the provisions of PERSON no . PERSON and ORG no . CARDINAL \u201d , the applicant had committed , in a continuous form , the crime proscribed by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . The prosecutor decided , however , not to indict the applicant but to sanction him with an administrative fine of CARDINAL NORP lei ( ROL ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . The applicant was further ordered to pay part of the judicial costs incurred in the investigation in the amount of ORG EUR CARDINAL ) . The prosecutor also ordered the confiscation of the hard drive seized from the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor \u2019s decision was based on the NORP legal framework on classified information , which was held to include PERSON no . ORG on the protection of classified information , Government Decision no . CARDINAL approving national standards for the protection of classified information , ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the protection of professional secrets and PERSON no . CARDINAL on national security . The decision further mentioned that the applicant had received the secret military information and had proceeded to verify its nature and importance . He had further shared the information with other people . From the elements in the file , the prosecutor concluded that the purpose of the applicant \u2019s actions was just to make himself more visible as an investigative journalist and not to serve the public interest . Noting that the protection of classified information was an obligation incumbent only on authorised personnel , the prosecutor nevertheless considered that information concerning national defence was classified and could not be of public interest , as provided for by LAW no . ORG on access to public information . As a result , although anyone unauthorised in the field of national defence \u2013 such as a journalist DATE was not bound by a duty to protect this type of information , he or she did not have the right to disclose it to the public .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , the prosecutor considered that the applicant had acted with intent to disclose classified information outside the above - mentioned legal framework . However , the prosecutor considered that the crimes committed by the applicant and the other CARDINAL suspects were not serious enough to require the pursuit of the criminal investigation . In this connection , the prosecutor noted firstly that the information in dispute was not likely to endanger national security but only to harm the interests of ORG and its armed forces . In addition , the information was outdated and hence was no longer likely to endanger the NORP military structures in GPE . The information in question had already been \u201c compromised \u201d ( disclosed by a member of the armed forces to a civilian ) as early as DATE , with no measures having been taken by the institution concerned . The prosecutor also mentioned that the actions undertaken by O.S and the applicant in order to gather information concerning the content , nature and importance of the secret documents in question , by contacting active or reserve members of the armed forces or other journalists were part of the working methods of investigative journalists and did not necessarily present a danger for society .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained against that decision to the superior prosecutor , who rejected the complaint as ill - founded on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained against the ORG decisions before ORG . He submitted that he had been wrongfully found guilty of the crime proscribed by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . In his opinion , that Article , as well as the entire law , imposed obligations only on people authorised to work with secret information . He contended that he had not made any steps to gather military secrets but had merely passively received information that was already in the public domain . Invoking LAW , the applicant submitted that the ORG had already decided that once information concerning national security had entered the public domain , it was difficult to justify the imposition of sanctions for its publication . He therefore urged the court to acknowledge that his actions could not be regarded as crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint as ill - founded . The court held that the facts established during the investigation had led to the conclusion that the applicant had secretly transmitted the CD containing secret information to other people he knew , avoiding handing it over to the competent authorities of ORG or ORG . The court further held :", "\u201c The accused \u2019s capacity as a journalist can not exonerate him from the commission of this crime because anyone who finds out about secret military information does not have the right to publish it since this might endanger the lives of soldiers , officers in the conflict environment . But the applicant , by the means described above , covertly shared the secret information , which could have reached people interested in putting military structures in danger .", "The accused did not even wish to use his profession in order to bring to the public \u2019s knowledge the leak of information , as he failed to ask the newspaper for which he worked to make public the breach of state secrets in the military ( obviously the military secret information could not have been published ) .", "The freedom of the press invoked by the accused can not give a journalist the right to make public , to unofficial people , secret military information , because this may endanger the right to safety of certain military structures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was ordered to pay court fees in the amount of ROL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment . He alleged that the information in dispute had already been in the public domain at the time it had been brought to his attention . He submitted that the prosecutor \u2019s decision had breached his freedom of expression in an attempt to cover up an embarrassing situation for the authorities , who had allowed the information to be leaked to the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the High Court of Cassation and ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint with final effect . The court held that LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL applied to anyone who gathered and shared secret information outside the legal framework . It further held that the applicant had not contested the fact that he had come into possession of secret information which he had then shared with other people outside the legal framework . Moreover , he had done this with direct intent . Considering that the information in question had not been in the public domain , the court held that journalists coming into possession of such information must submit it to the competent authorities and were allowed by law to share with the public only the failure of the institution concerned to protect its confidentiality . Having failed to act in that way , the applicant had committed the crime proscribed by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . The court concluded that the prosecutor had correctly considered that the crime had not , however , attained the degree of seriousness to require criminal sanctions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was ordered to pay court fees of ORG ( EUR CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
