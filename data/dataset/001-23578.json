SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national born in DATE . When filing the application he was detained in NORP prison in GPE . He is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "As from DATE onwards , the applicant and his wife ran a children \u2019s home in LOC . In DATE CARDINAL girls were accepted as boarders , i.e. A , born in DATE , and the CARDINAL sisters B and C , born in DATE and DATE , respectively . In DATE , the CARDINAL girls left the home and were placed in CARDINAL different foster families .", "On DATE A \u2019s foster parents , PERSON and PERSON , reported to the police that they suspected the applicant of having sexually abused A while she was in the children \u2019s home . On DATE a policewoman questioned PERSON and , in her presence , A , whereupon a criminal report was filed against the applicant , accusing him of having committed sexual acts with A from DATE . On DATE A underwent a medical examination .", "The suspicion then arose that B and C had been sexually abused . On DATE a policewoman interviewed B and C. On DATE a criminal report was filed accusing the applicant of also having sexually abused B and C from DATE . The report noted that the statements of B and C coincided substantially with those of A.", "The applicant was remanded in custody on DATE .", "Based on the medical examination of the victims on DATE , ORG of the Canton of St. Gallen , prepared a report on DATE . On DATE , ORG ( Kinder- und PERSON ) of LOC prepared an expert opinion as to the credibility of the statements made by A , B and C during the various interviews . It concluded that A \u2019s previous statements could be confirmed . The statements of B and C as recorded in the minutes most probably reflected what they themselves had experienced . There was no indication of sexual abuse by any other person , and it appeared most unlikely that the children had made up the events themselves .", "On DATE PERSON was appointed by ORG ) to supervise the fostership of GPE", "On DATE , PERSON questioned A alone . A made various statements , pointing out the areas on her body where the applicant had hurt her , and explaining how this had happened . PERSON prepared a report on this conversation . She informed the investigating judge first by telephone , later she was questioned by him on DATE , whereby she was reminded of her duty to tell the truth .", "On DATE the investigating judge interviewed A in the presence of the foster mother . A \u2019s statements , referring to various sexual acts by the applicant , coincided with those previously made by her . The case was referred to trial on DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( GPE ) of GPE convicted the applicant of having committed sexual acts with children and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In its judgment the ORG analysed in detail the various statements made by A , B and C during the investigations which had not been called into question by the forensic expert opinion of DATE . They had been regarded as credible by ORG , and the court considered them to be correct . The court found it established that the applicant had abused the children and did not regard it as necessary to comply with the applicant \u2019s request to hear further witnesses , in particular PERSON , the foster mother .", "The applicant filed a plea of nullity ( PERSON ) with ORG ( Kassationsgericht ) of GPE .", "Meanwhile , the applicant ordered the preparation of a private expert opinion . The expert opinion , prepared by a psychiatrist and submitted on DATE , noted deficiencies in the report of ORG DATE .", "ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity on CARDINAL DATE . In its judgment it rejected various elements of evidence as being belated , including the applicant \u2019s private expert opinion of CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant filed with ORG ( PERSON ) a plea of nullity and a public law appeal ( staatsrechtliche Beschwerde ) . In the former he complained of the sentence and in the latter of the unfairness of the proceedings . Both applications were dismissed by ORG on DATE . The judgments were served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "In its judgment concerning the applicant \u2019s public law appeal , ORG considered the issue of questioning victims in the absence of the accused ; the court found that \u201c while this had not been raised , it has however been addressed ( nicht ger\u00fcgt , aber angesprochen ) \u201d . In the court \u2019s view , in such a case the accused \u2019s defence rights had to be ensured in other ways . In respect of the applicant \u2019s complaint that the questions had been put in a suggestive manner , ORG noted that this particular matter had been the decisive issue before the lower courts and had received ample consideration . Noting the extensive verbatim TIME , ORG considered that the children had explained themselves in many different ways \u2013 verbally and non - verbally . These indications militated against the conclusion that the children had been manipulated or that the questioning had followed any insinuating structure . ORG concluded that ORG could on tenable grounds and without arbitrariness conclude that the children \u2019s statements had been credible and correct ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
