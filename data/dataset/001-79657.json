The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On an unspecified date , the applicant was arrested and placed in pre - trial detention on suspicion of involvement \u2013 together with others \u2013 in various ( attempted ) thefts of lorries containing merchandise and thefts of merchandise from lorries ( inter alia , washing machines , laundry dryers and other household appliances , telephones , computer parts , car radios , audiovisual devices and materials , clothes , bags , shoes , camping and sports equipment ) committed DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was summoned to appear before the ' sHertogenbosch ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) on CARDINAL DATE in order to stand trial on various charges of ( attempted ) burglary , deliberately handling stolen goods and membership of a criminal organisation . Separate criminal proceedings were brought against a number of co - accused .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ' s - ORG convicted the applicant of several counts of participation in ( attempted ) burglary , deliberately handling stolen goods and membership of a criminal organisation . ORG found it established that the applicant had been involved in the theft of CARDINAL laundry dryers from a lorry and a trailer ; the theft of a lorry ; the theft of large numbers of telephones , computer parts and car radios from a lorry ; the theft of CARDINAL CD auto changers , CARDINAL radio cassette players and a speaker sound system from a truck ; the theft of large quantities of , inter alia , audio devices , dishwashers , shoes , vacuum cleaners and clothing from lorries and thefts of lorries ; the handling of CARDINAL or more stolen video cameras ; the attempted theft of a lorry and the attempted theft of goods from a lorry . It sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment less the time spent in pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with the ' s - Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal ( gerechtshof ) . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , convicted the applicant of having participated on CARDINAL or DATE in the theft of a lorry and a trailer containing CARDINAL laundry dryers , of having on DATE stolen an articulated lorry and a number of printers and of having handled DATE in the period between CARDINAL August CARDINAL and DATE a piece of clothing and a video camera in the knowledge that these items had been obtained through crime . It acquitted the applicant of the remainder of the charges , having found that these had not been lawfully and convincingly proved . ORG sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , of which DATE were suspended for DATE . In addition , it declared inadmissible the compensation claim filed by ORG ( benadeelde partij ) . Finding this claim to be too complicated to be dealt with in criminal proceedings , ORG decided that it should be brought before a civil court .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the public prosecutor had summoned the applicant to appear before the ' sHertogenbosch ORG on DATE in order to be heard in connection with the prosecutor 's request for an order for the confiscation of an illegally obtained advantage ( vordering tot ontneming van wederrechtelijk verkregen voordeel ) within the meaning of LAW ( Wetboek van Strafrecht ) , which had been assessed by the public prosecutor at a total amount of MONEY ( NLG \u2013 equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held before ORG on DATE the prosecutor maintained the request for a confiscation order , arguing that it also concerned similar offences as referred to in LAW and that , although ORG had acquitted the applicant of most of the offences he had been charged with , there remained sufficient indications that he had committed them . The applicant argued that a confiscation order could only be imposed in respect of the offences of which he had been found guilty . This would , according to the prosecutor 's assessment , result in a confiscation order for an amount of NLG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) at most .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG issued a confiscation order for the amount of NLG CARDINAL , to be replaced , if this sum was not paid or recovered , by DATE detention in lieu . It held that the acquittal in the judgment handed down by ORG on DATE , for which no specific reasons were given , could therefore only be understood as meaning that there were no indications that the applicant had committed the offences concerned , let alone that he might have derived any resulting advantage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , but not the public prosecutor , filed an appeal against this ruling with the ' s - Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal . The applicant denied having derived any advantage from the offences of which he had been convicted .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG quashed the ruling of DATE and imposed a confiscation order in the amount of NLG CARDINAL , to be replaced , if this sum was not paid or recovered , by DATE detention in lieu . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c [ The applicant 's acquittal ] on appeal of a number of offences [ with which he had been charged ] does not lead to the conclusion that those offences , in view of their nature , can no longer be regarded as similar offences within the meaning of LAW of LAW . The relevant applicable statutory provisions do not oppose this in any way . In addition to the condition of similarity , it is only required that there exist sufficient indications that [ the applicant ] has committed the offences concerned .", "The court is therefore of the opinion that it can still consider , in respect of all offences on which the public prosecutor has based the [ request for a confiscation order ] , whether there exist sufficient indications [ that the applicant has committed them ] .", "By judgment of DATE of the ' s - ORG [ the applicant ] has been convicted of ...", "Pursuant to LAW it must be examined whether , and if so to what extent , the defendant has illegally obtained an advantage \u2013 including savings in costs \u2013 by means of or from the proceeds of the offences found proved , of similar offences or of other offences in respect of which there exist sufficient indications that they have been committed by the defendant and for which a fifth - category fine may be imposed .", "The court finds that [ the applicant ] has not only illegally obtained an advantage from the above - mentioned offences ... found proved , but has also obtained an advantage from the following similar offences , all set out in the initiatory summons served on [ the applicant ] ... in respect of which [ offences ] there are sufficient indications that they have been committed by him .", "The amount fixed by the court as the estimated advantage obtained by [ the applicant ] is set out after each of the offences .", "count CARDINAL of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL ;", "count CARDINAL of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL ;", "count CARDINAL of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL ;", "count CARDINAL of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL ;", "count CARDINAL of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL ;", "count CARDINAL of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL ;", "count CARDINAL of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL ;", "count CARDINAL g of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL ;", "count CARDINAL of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL ;", "count CARDINAL of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL ;", "count QUANTITY of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL .", "The court will fix the estimated advantage obtained by [ the applicant ] from the offences found proved , in accordance with the decision of ORG , in the following amounts :", "count CARDINAL of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL ;", "count CARDINAL of the initiatory summons , referred to as case CARDINAL : advantage NLG CARDINAL .", "The court therefore fixes the amount of the estimated advantage illegally obtained by [ the applicant ] at NLG CARDINAL .", "The court derives the assessment of the [ applicant 's ] illegally obtained advantage inter alia from a report of CARDINAL DATE by ORG , Financial Desk / BFO of ORG of the LOC - East Brabant Regional Police ( reference PERSON - CARDINAL ) , in particular as regards the calculation of the proceeds of the stolen goods and the distribution of the proceeds between those concerned .", "The means of evidence used by the court are set out in the addendum as referred to in LAW and ORG of LAW ( PERSON Strafvordering ) ; this addendum is appended to this ruling . ...", "It was argued in the appeal proceedings by and on behalf of the [ applicant ] that he had never received pecuniary remuneration for his part in the offences in which he was involved . The court rejects this argument , since the court has become convinced , on the grounds of the evidence cited above , that the [ applicant ] participated in a group of persons who were systematically involved in a very lucrative manner in the theft of costly goods from lorries , and that it is wholly implausible that the [ applicant ] should not have obtained his share of the proceeds of those goods that , according to the cited means of evidence , have often demonstrably been sold for good money ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In relevant part , the police report of CARDINAL DATE , as appended to this ruling , reads as follows :", "\u201c Determination of the illegally obtained benefit :", "A. Where amounts of money received are known", "The starting point in determining the amount of an illegally obtained advantage under LAW is the advantage actually obtained by the suspected / convicted person .", "In several of the incidents investigated , the amount of money that was paid by the receivers of stolen goods to the thieves and/or other receivers of stolen goods for the goods stolen appears from recorded intercepted conversations and/or statements .", "These amounts have been ascribed , as illegally obtained benefit , to the perpetrator(s ) and , where appropriate , divided evenly among the persons concerned .", "Relevant costs incurred by the suspect(s ) have been taken into account .", "B.

This presumably means CARDINAL of the retail price ... Where there is no specific information about the amounts of money received by the thieves and/or receivers of stolen goods , the illegally obtained benefit was assessed on the basis of the wholesale purchase value , excluding ORG ( value - added tax ) , of the stolen goods .", "Calculation in respect of the thieves", "With regard to incidents where the amount paid by the receivers of stolen goods to the thieves does not appear from the investigation , it has been assumed that an amount of PERCENT of the wholesale purchase value , excluding ORG , of the goods stolen was paid to the thieves .", "Applying this estimate results in a lower amount for illegally obtained benefit than an estimate based on PERCENT of the wholesale trade value or PERCENT of the retail price as the case may be . This is to the advantage of the suspect(s ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of each of the counts CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL - i and QUANTITY , as set out in the initiatory summons issued in the applicant 's case , the report of CARDINAL DATE in so far as it was used in evidence by ORG in the confiscation proceedings \u2013 contains a statement that , in the substantive criminal proceedings at first instance , the applicant was convicted of the charge concerned . It further appears from this report that , in respect of each of these counts , the estimate of the illegally obtained advantage was mainly based on the contents of intercepted telephone conversations in which the participants ( thieves and handlers of stolen goods ) discussed money matters in relation to stolen goods , the presence of some of the stolen goods in the homes of a number of perpetrators , and the wholesale purchase value of the stolen goods .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) against the ruling of DATE , complaining inter alia that the imposition of a confiscation order in respect of offences of which he had been acquitted violated his right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . In his advisory opinion , the Procurator General at ORG considered \u2013 on the basis of the ORG 's considerations in its judgment in the case of ORG v. the GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE , ORG CARDINAL-VII ) \u2013 that the scope of LAW generally did not extend to confiscation proceedings , but that this did not affect the obligation to verify whether it followed from the particular circumstances of the applicant 's case that an issue under LAW arose nevertheless . On this point , the Procurator General considered , on the basis of an extensive analysis of the ORG 's case - law under LAW , that the question arose whether the conclusion of ORG that there were sufficient indications that the applicant had committed offences similar to those of which he had been convicted entailed a finding of \u201c guilt \u201d , taking into account that the applicant had been acquitted of those similar offences .", "CARDINAL . The Procurator General observed that ORG had found that , despite the acquittal , there were sufficient indications that the offences of which the applicant had been acquitted had been committed by him . In his opinion , this was incompatible with the general rule DATE reaffirmed by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) \u2013 that following a final acquittal , even the voicing of suspicions regarding an accused 's innocence was impermissible and incompatible with LAW . Furthermore , ORG had based its finding in the confiscation proceedings on evidence apparently insufficient for a criminal conviction and this had resulted in a decision imposed on the applicant of such severity that it should be regarded as a \u201c penalty \u201d within the meaning of LAW . Further taking into account that ORG had also based its finding that there were sufficient indications that similar offences had been committed by the applicant on a convicting , yet subsequently quashed , judgment given by ORG , the Procurator General was of the opinion that the conclusion that LAW had been violated was unavoidable . In his opinion , the possibility under LAW of LAW to impose a confiscation order was limited to offences not included in a charge brought , such as offences appended to the summons for the court 's information ( ad informandum gevoegde feiten ) or other offences that were apparent from the case file ( andere feiten die blijken uit het proces - verbaal ) , as mentioned in the Explanatory Memorandum in respect of LAW of LAW . Consequently , he advised ORG to accept the applicant 's complaint under LAW , to quash the decision of DATE and to remit the case to a different ORG for a fresh determination of the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal in cassation . It held , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In its ruling of CARDINAL DATE , GPE [ PERSON Netherlands Law Reports ] DATE , no . CARDINAL , ORG held as follows :", "- The provisions of LAW and [ Articles CARDINALb \u2013 CARDINALi ] of LAW concern the imposition of a measure on the person convicted of a punishable offence , namely the obligation to pay a sum of money to the ORG for the purposes of confiscating an illegally obtained advantage . This does not constitute a penalty , but a measure ( maatregel ) aimed at depriving the person of the illegally obtained advantage . The fact that the imposition of that measure has been given a place in a criminal procedure does not alter its particular character .", "- That particular character is also expressed in the requirements set for imposing it . These requirements are less strict than those that must be met for imposing a [ criminal - law ] penalty . Thus , the rules of evidence applicable in criminal proceedings do not apply in their entirety . Consequently , offences included in a criminal charge that have resulted in an acquittal can still form the basis for the imposition of a ( confiscation ) measure . Also in such a case , the court will have to determine either that there exist sufficient indications that a similar offence or similar offences , referred to in LAW for which a fine of the fifth category may be imposed , has / have been committed by the person concerned , or that it is plausible that the other similar offences , referred to in LAW of LAW , have in some way resulted in the illegal obtaining of an advantage by the person concerned . Such a determination is preceded by the procedure regulated in ORG CARDINALb et seq . of LAW . This serves as a guarantee that the court which must determine a request for a confiscation order filed by the prosecution department will only do so after it has examined whether , and has found that , the statutory conditions , including whether there are indications within the meaning of the second paragraph [ of LAW ] or whether there is plausibility within the meaning of the third paragraph [ of LAW ] , have been met .", "- It follows from the above that the circumstance that the suspect has been acquitted of specific offences does not automatically constitute an obstacle to treating those offences , in the context of the confiscation procedure , as ' similar offences ' or ' offences for which a fifth - category fine may be imposed ' as referred to in LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG would add that this is not incompatible with LAW since the procedure under LAW et seq . of LAW provides the person concerned with the opportunity to defend himself , including the possibility to argue that insufficient indications exist that the similar offence or similar offences for which a fifth - category fine may be imposed , as meant in LAW , has / have been committed by [ him ] , or that it is not plausible that the other punishable offences , within the meaning of LAW CARDINAL of LAW , have resulted in the illegal obtaining of an advantage by [ him ] , and why this is so . The fact that the procedure following a ... [ request for a confiscation order ] must be regarded as a separate part or a continuation of the same [ set of ] criminal prosecution [ proceedings ] that can lead to conviction and sentence ( see PERSON , DATE ; GPE DATE ; no . CARDINAL ) does not necessitate any different finding .", "CARDINAL . Given that it has not been argued , nor is it apparent , that the opportunity referred to in [ the above paragraph ] CARDINAL . has not been provided in the instant case , the decision of ORG does not disclose an incorrect interpretation of the law . In view of the events of the appeal hearing , as recorded , that decision has been sufficiently reasoned . \u201d", "This decision was published in LAW DATE , no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant agreed with ORG ( ORG ) that he would pay ORG CARDINAL at once and the remainder in DATE instalments of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALe of LAW ( PERSON ) provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Upon the application of ORG , any person who has been convicted of a criminal offence may be ordered in a separate judicial decision to pay a sum of money to the ORG so as to deprive him of any illegally obtained advantage .", "CARDINAL . Such an order may be imposed on a person as referred to in paragraph CARDINAL who has obtained an advantage by means of or from the proceeds of the criminal offence in question or similar offences or offences for which a fifth - category fine may be imposed , in connection with which there exist sufficient indications that they were committed by him .", "CARDINAL . Upon the application of ORG , any person who has been found guilty of an indictable offence for which a fifth - category fine may be imposed and against whom , in connection with his being suspected of that offence , a criminal financial investigation ( strafrechtelijk financieel onderzoek ) has been instituted , may be ordered in a separate judicial decision to pay a sum of money to the ORG in order to deprive him of any illegally obtained advantage if , having regard to that investigation , it is likely that other criminal offences have led in whatever way to the convicted person obtaining an illegal advantage .", "CARDINAL . The judge shall determine the amount which the illegally obtained advantage is estimated to represent . The advantage shall be taken to include cost savings . The value of goods which the court deems to form part of the illegally obtained advantage may be estimated to be their market value at the time the decision is taken or may be estimated by reference to the yield to be obtained through public auction if the amount is to be recovered . The court may set the amount to be paid at less than the estimated advantage .", "CARDINAL . The expression ' goods ' shall be taken to mean all objects and property rights .", "CARDINAL . In determining the amount which the illegally obtained advantage is estimated to represent , legal claims from disadvantaged third parties awarded by a court shall be deducted .", "CARDINAL . In imposing the order , account shall be taken of orders to pay a sum of money by way of deprivation of illegally obtained advantage imposed under previous decisions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The possibility of depriving a person of proceeds of crime was introduced in DATE by LAW ( Wet Vermogenssancties ) . On DATE , the Act of DATE on the extension of the possibilities of applying the measure of deprivation of illegally obtained advantage and other financial penalties ( PERSON van de mogelijkheden tot toepassing van de maatregel van ontneming van wederrechtelijk verkregen voordeel en andere vermogenssancties ) entered into force . CARDINAL of the changes brought about by this LAW was that the proceedings concerning the measure of deprivation of an illegally obtained advantage were disconnected from the substantive criminal proceedings , among other reasons in order to prevent situations in which issues concerning the illegally obtained advantage would overshadow and affect the duration of the substantive criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The Act established a specific procedure \u2013 separate from the criminal proceedings taken against a suspect \u2013 for imposing a confiscation order under LAW . This specific procedure is set out in Articles QUANTITY of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Wetboek van Strafvordering ) . The legislature 's choice in setting it out thus was to demonstrate that it concerned a continuation of the criminal prosecution of the convicted person , the purpose being to determine the sanction to be imposed ( GPE ( Parliamentary Documents ) II , DATE session , CARDINAL no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . The confiscation order procedure is not designed or intended to determine a criminal charge or a criminal penalty , but to detect illegally obtained proceeds , to determine their pecuniary value and , by way of a judicial confiscation order , to deprive the beneficiary of these proceeds . The aim pursued by the possibility of imposing confiscation orders is twofold ; in the first place to remedy an unlawful situation and , secondly , to bring about a general crime - prevention effect by rendering crime unattractive on account of an increased risk that proceeds of crime will be confiscated .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , a request for a confiscation order under LAW must be filed by the public prosecutor with ORG as soon as possible and not DATE after a conviction has been handed down in the substantive criminal proceedings by the first - instance trial court . It is not required that , when such a request is filed , the conviction should have obtained the force of res judicata .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW obliges the public prosecutor to indicate no later than when delivering the closing speech ( requisitoir ) before the first - instance trial court in the substantive criminal proceedings whether the prosecution intends to seek a confiscation order in the event of a conviction . The purpose of this obligation is to prevent a situation where a convicted person is confronted , at DATE after his conviction by a first - instance court , with a request for a confiscation order , and to make clear that a confiscation order procedure does not constitute a fresh , second prosecution based on the same facts but is to be understood as a separate part of the earlier substantive criminal proceedings and that the prosecution does not stop after the end of the substantive criminal proceedings but is pursued in the confiscation order procedure .", "CARDINAL . The notion of \u201c similar offence or offences \u201d under LAW of LAW relates to offences of a similar nature to those having formed the object of the criminal proceedings against the accused , such as , for instance , drugs offences , property offences and offences involving forgery and fraud .", "CARDINAL . The rules of evidence that apply in criminal proceedings , as set out in ORG CARDINAL - CARDINALa of the Code of Criminal Procedure , are not applicable to the confiscation order procedure . In that procedure it is for the public prosecutor to establish a prima facie case that there are sufficient indications that the person concerned has committed CARDINAL or more similar offences within the meaning of LAW of LAW , thereby generating an illegally obtained advantage . It is for the person concerned to rebut the prosecutor 's case . The judge will decide the case on the basis of a balancing of probabilities , comparable to the standard of proof applicable in civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The fact that the rules of evidence applicable in criminal proceedings do not apply to the confiscation order procedure implies that DATE if in criminal proceedings an accused has been partly convicted and partly acquitted of the charges brought against him \u2013 in subsequent confiscation order proceedings the judge may impose a confiscation order against the person concerned which is not only based on the offence(s ) of which he has been convicted , but also on the similar offence(s ) of which he has been acquitted but in respect of which the judge is satisfied , on the balance of probabilities , that there exist sufficient indications that he has nonetheless committed them .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the judge can derive the assessment of the actual amount of an illegally obtained advantage under LAW only from the contents of \u201c lawful means of evidence \u201d ( wettige bewijsmiddelen ) . LAW defines \u201c lawful means of evidence \u201d as the personal observations of the judge , statements of the accused , statements of a witness , statements of an expert , and written materials ( such as , for instance , judicial decisions and formal minutes and records ) . However , unlike the requirement in criminal proceedings that a conviction can only be based on evidence that is corroborated by other evidence , the assessment of the amount of an illegally obtained advantage in confiscation order proceedings can be based on CARDINAL evidentiary item , such as , for instance , a formal record containing the statement of the person concerned ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
