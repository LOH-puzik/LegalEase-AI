The facts of the case may be summarised as follows :", "CARDINAL . All applicants were , when submitting their applications to the Commission , conscript soldiers serving in different non - commissioned ranks in the GPE armed forces . On separate occasions , various penalties had been passed on them by their respective commanding officers for offences against military discipline . The applicants had appealed to the complaints officer ( beklagmeerdere ) and finally to ORG ( PERSON ) which in substance confirmed the decisions challenged but , in CARDINAL cases , reduced the punishment imposed .", "Mr. PERSON", "CARDINAL . In DATE , Mr. PERSON was serving as a sergeant in ORG . He in fact lived at home during off - duty hours . The applicant was a member of ORG ( PERSON GPE ) which was created in DATE and aims at safeguarding the interests of conscripts . It was recognised by the Government for taking part in negotiations in this field and its membership included CARDINAL of all conscripts .", "Mr. PERSON was a candidate for the vice - presidency of the PERSON and on DATE he submitted a request to his company commander for leave of absence on DATE in order to attend a general meeting in GPE at which the elections were to be held . He did not , however , mention his candidature .", "Subsequently he became ill and stayed home under the orders of his doctor who gave him sick leave until DATE and authorised him to leave the house on DATE . On DATE , the company commander had a talk with the battalion commander and it was agreed that no decision should be taken regarding the above - mentioned request pending further information from the applicant who had given no notice of his absence or return . However , on the following day a check was made at the applicant 's home and it was discovered that he was not there . In fact , he had gone to the meeting of the V.V.D.M. where he had been elected vice - president .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr. PERSON returned to his unit and on DATE his company commander punished him with DATE light arrest for having been absent from his residence on DATE .", "The applicant considered this penalty a serious interference with his personal affairs in that it prevented him from properly preparing himself for his doctoral examination at ORG which had been fixed for DATE . According to the applicant , he had made several attempts on DATE to speak to an officer on this point but without success . Believing that under the army regulations non - commissioned officers were allowed to serve their light arrest at home , he left the barracks in the evening and spent TIME at home . However , DATE his company commander imposed a penalty of DATE aggravated arrest on him for having disregarded his first punishment .", "The applicant , who had just been informed that , with effect from DATE , he had been demoted to the rank of private , again left the barracks in the evening and went home . He was arrested on DATE by the military police and provisionally detained in strict arrest for DATE , by virtue of LAW ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE his company commander imposed a penalty of DATE strict arrest for having disregarded his CARDINAL previous punishments .", "CARDINAL . The execution of these punishments was suspended by ministerial decision in order to permit the applicant to take his doctoral examination which he passed on DATE . Moreover , on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE Mr. PERSON complained to the complaints officer about the penalties imposed on him by the company commander . On DATE the complaints officer decided , after having heard the parties , that the first punishment of DATE light arrest should be reduced to a reprimand , the second punishment of DATE aggravated arrest to DATE light arrest , and the third punishment of DATE strict arrest to DATE strict arrest . In the last CARDINAL cases the decision was based on the fact that the previous punishment(s ) had been reduced and that the applicant had obviously been under considerable stress owing to his forthcoming examination . The complaints officer further decided that Mr. PERSON 's punishment of DATE strict arrest should be deemed to have been served from DATE , during his provisional arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against the decision of the complaints officer relying , inter alia , on the Convention in general terms . The ORG heard the applicant and obtained the opinion of ORG for ORG . On DATE , that is DATE after the date of the disciplinary measures in dispute , the ORG confirmed the contested decision . It referred to LAW CARDINAL ( b ) ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-b ) of the LAW and held that the applicant 's detention had been lawful and had been imposed in order to secure the fulfilment of an obligation prescribed by law . The system under LAW and LAW required in fact that every serviceman should submit to and co - operate in maintaining military discipline . This obligation could be enforced by imposing disciplinary punishments in accordance with the procedure prescribed by LAW . In these circumstances , the applicant 's punishment of DATE strict arrest had been justified in order to secure the fulfilment of that obligation .", "The applicant had not received the assistance of a legally trained person at any stage in the proceedings against him ; perusal of the file in the case does not reveal if he asked for such assistance .", "Mr. PERSON", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON , at the time of his application to the Commission , was serving as a corporal in ORG . On TIME CARDINAL DATE he was TIME late for duty . His car had broken down during DATE leave and he had had it repaired before returning to his unit instead of taking the first train . On these grounds , the acting company commander , on DATE , imposed a penalty of DATE light arrest on the applicant . DATE he revised the above grounds to include a reference that the applicant had not previously requested the commander 's leave of absence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant complained about his punishment to the complaints officer invoking , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . In this respect he alleged that he had been deprived of his liberty by a decision which , contrary to the requirements of LAW ) , had not been taken by a judicial authority ; that furthermore his case had not been heard by an independent and impartial tribunal ( LAW para . CARDINAL ) ( article DATE ) ; that he did not have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence ( Article CARDINAL para .

On DATE , the ORG heard the applicant , who was assisted by a lawyer , ORG , and obtained the opinion of ORG for ORG . The ORG then quashed the complaints officer 's decision but confirmed the punishment of DATE light arrest imposed on the applicant on the original grounds stated on DATE .", "The ORG first found that LAW was not applicable in a case where neither the determination of a criminal charge nor the determination of civil rights and obligations was in question . The ORG referred to the definition of military disciplinary offences contained in LAW ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) and concluded therefrom that disciplinary proceedings clearly did not fall within the scope of LAW ) . Nor was there any substance in the applicant 's argument that , since a conscripted man had not volunteered to come within the jurisdiction of the military authorities , any disciplinary measure imposed upon him in fact had a criminal character .", "As regards the complaints based on LAW , ORG first held that DATE light arrest did not constitute \" deprivation of liberty \" . In the alternative , the ORG further stated that the disputed punishment was meant to \" secure the fulfilment of ( an ) obligation prescribed by law \" , within the meaning of LAW para . CARDINAL ( b ) ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-b ) .", "CARDINAL . At first and second instance in the proceedings Mr. PERSON had not received any legal assistance , and during the proceedings before ORG the legal assistance granted to him had , in line with the practice described above at paragraph CARDINAL , been restricted to the legal aspects of the case .", "Mr. PERSON", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON , at the time of his application to the Commission , was serving as a private in ORG .

On DATE , the complaints officer heard the applicant who was assisted by ORG , a lawyer and member of the central committee of the GPE , such assistance having been granted by reason of the fact that the applicant had invoked the LAW . The complaints officer also examined CARDINAL witnesses , including CARDINAL , namely ORG , on the applicant 's behalf , and then confirmed the punishment while altering slightly the grounds stated therefore . He rejected the allegations under the LAW , referring to a judgment of ORG dated DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant appealed to ORG against that decision . In accordance with LAW , the applicant 's successive appeals had the effect of suspending execution of his punishment ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG heard the applicant and his above - mentioned legal adviser and obtained the opinion of ORG for ORG . On DATE , the ORG , without mentioning the applicant 's previous behaviour , reduced the punishment to DATE aggravated arrest , which sentence was executed thereafter . It considered that , in the circumstances , the committal to a disciplinary unit for DATE was too heavy a penalty .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleges that in his case the calling of CARDINAL other witnesses on his behalf , namely ORG and PERSON , was prevented at every juncture . He also complains that the legal assistance granted to him had been restricted to the legal aspects of his case .", "Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON was serving as a private in ORG at the time of his application to the Commission . As editor of a journal called \" Alarm \" , published in stencilled form by the PERSON at the General PERSON barracks at GPE , he had collaborated in particular in the preparation of no . CARDINAL of that journal dated DATE . Acting in pursuance of LAW , a ministerial decree of DATE , the commanding officer of the barracks provisionally prohibited the distribution of this number , whose contents he considered inconsistent with military discipline .", "On DATE , CARDINAL officers met in commission on the instructions of the commanding officer in order to hold an enquiry into the appearance of the said number . The applicant , among others , was heard by the commission .", "On DATE , the applicant was sentenced by his competent superior to DATE committal to a disciplinary unit for having taken part in the publication and distribution of a writing tending to undermine discipline . The decision was based on LAW . CARDINAL of LAW , read in conjunction with the first paragraph of LAW which provides :", "\" Any person who , by means of a signal , sign , dumb show , speech , song , writing or picture , endeavours to undermine discipline in the armed forces or who , knowing the tenor of the writing or the picture , disseminates or exhibits it , posts it up or holds stocks of it for dissemination , shall be liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding DATE . \"", "Entitled \" The law of the strongest \" ( PERSON ) , the article objected to in no . CARDINAL of \" Alarm \" alluded to a demonstration that had taken place at GPE on CARDINAL DATE on the initiative of the executive committee of the PERSON According to Mr. PERSON , the demonstration was terminated almost at once since the demonstrators had promptly returned to DATE following the promise by the commanding officer that , if they did so , no disciplinary sanctions would ensue . Nevertheless , a few soldiers were allegedly transferred soon afterwards for having participated in the incident .", "The passages in the article which gave rise to the disciplinary punishment of CARDINAL DATE read as follows :", "( a ) \" There happens to be a General PERSON who writes to his ' inferiors ' ' I will do everything to keep you from violating the LAW ' ! But this very General is responsible for the transfers of GPE and PERSON . Yet , as you know , measures are never allowed to be in the nature of a disguised punishment . How devoted to the law the General is - as long as it suits him \" ;", "( b ) \" ... in addition to ordinary punishments , the army bosses have at their disposal a complete series of other measures - of which transfer is CARDINAL - to suppress the soldiers . That does not come to an end by questions in ORG - that makes them at most more careful . That only comes to an end when these people , who can only prove their authority by punishment and intimidation , have to look for a normal job . \"", "CARDINAL . The decision ordering the applicant 's committal to a disciplinary unit referred to the extracts quoted above . Furthermore , the decision took into account some aggravating circumstances : Mr. PERSON had collaborated in the publication of no . CARDINAL of the journal , which had likewise been prohibited under LAW \" by reason of its objectionable contents ; in addition , he had taken part in the demonstrations at GPE and had , in particular , published in connection therewith a pamphlet , for which he received on CARDINAL DATE a punishment of strict arrest .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON , a private in ORG at the time of his application to the Commission , was also an editor of the journal \" Alarm \" . The facts regarding his case are identical to those of Mr. PERSON 's except that his punishment initially amounted to DATE committal to a disciplinary unit owing to the additional aggravating circumstance of his participation in the publication of ORG for new recruits the distribution of which had been prohibited by reason of its negative content .", "CARDINAL . As early as CARDINAL DATE , the CARDINAL applicants announced their intention to complain about their punishment . According to them , they were then asked to refrain from any further publication while proceedings were pending against them . The Government maintain that they were only requested not to publish other articles tending to undermine military discipline . The applicants replied before the ORG that they had not the slightest intention to write such articles and that they had emphasised this on DATE before the commission of enquiry . According to the report of the latter , Mr. PERSON had declared that it was not at all his aim to write articles that he expected to be prohibited , and Mr. PERSON is recorded as saying : \" When we produce pamphlets of this kind , it is not our intention that they should be prohibited . The intention is that they should be read . The risk of their being prohibited is great . \"", "Be that as it may , the applicants refused to give the undertaking requested and they were thereupon both placed under aggravated arrest in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants complained about their punishment to the complaints officer who on DATE confirmed it , while in the case of Mr. PERSON slightly modifying the grounds . He rejected the applicants ' submissions , including those concerning ORG , DATE and DATE ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) of the Convention . In connection with ORG and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) , he referred to a decision of ORG delivered on DATE . The complaints officer also specified that the applicants should remain in interim custody in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG , Mr. PERSON on DATE and Mr. PERSON on DATE , invoking Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "Pursuant to LAW , the successive complaints and appeals by the applicants suspended their committal to a disciplinary unit but not their interim custody ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "On DATE , the ORG ordered release of the applicants after they had promised to accept the ORG 's judgment on the merits of the case , to comply therewith in the future and , while proceedings were pending against them , to refrain from any activity in connection with the compilation and distribution of written material the contents of which could be deemed to be at variance with military discipline . According to the applicants , this undertaking was given only in extremis as there was no legal remedy available to terminate their interim custody .", "Like Mr. PERSON , the applicants had been assisted before ORG who was , however , able only to deal with the legal aspects of their case ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG confirmed Mr. PERSON 's committal to a disciplinary unit for DATE , reduced Mr. PERSON 's committal from DATE and modified slightly the grounds for punishment in both cases . The ORG rejected as being ill - founded the applicants ' allegations . Making mention in both cases of their previous conduct and convictions , the ORG recalled particularly that they had previously participated in the publication and distribution of writings that were prohibited on the basis of the decree of DATE ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . When fixing the punishment , the ORG deemed these factors to be indicative of their general behaviour .", "The ORG then dealt with the applicants ' allegations under ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) of the Convention , and also rejected them .", "As regards LAW ) , the ORG held that the obligation to serve in a disciplinary unit did not constitute \" deprivation of liberty \" . In the alternative , adopting reasoning similar to that contained in its decision on Mr. PERSON 's appeal ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG found that the disputed punishments had been justified under LAW para . CARDINAL ( b ) ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-b ) .", "On the issue of LAW para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) , the ORG considered that the disciplinary proceedings relating to the publication of the journal \" Alarm \" had involved the determination neither of any \" civil right \" , such as freedom of expression , nor of any \" criminal charge \" ; on the latter point , the ORG based its decision on reasons similar to those given in the decision on Mr. PERSON appeal ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The applicants also contended that the measures taken against them interfered with their freedom of expression . In this respect , the ORG relied on paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) ; in its opinion , the restrictions objected to had been necessary in a NORP society for the prevention of disorder within the field governed by LAW .", "Finally , the applicants maintained that their interim custody had been inconsistent with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) ( article QUANTITY ) of the LAW and claimed compensation on this account under LAW para . CARDINAL ( LAW ) . ORG held that it had no competence to examine and decide such a claim .", "CARDINAL .

They were not allowed to leave this establishment during DATE ; moreover , they were both locked up in a cell during TIME .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the particular facts relating to Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON , there was in the background a pattern of conflict between the ORG and the GPE In DATE , for instance , there had occurred the demonstration at PERSON mentioned above at paragraph CARDINAL . The applicants also cite the fact that prior to their punishment , and in particular DATE and DATE , the Minister of Defence had decreed a great number of prohibitions on publications by the V.V.D.M. Furthermore , other servicemen , as editors of sectional journals of the ORG , had been punished in criminal or in disciplinary proceedings - by aggravated arrest , fines and , in CARDINAL case , military detention ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ) - for writing or distributing publications considered as likely to undermine military discipline within the meaning of LAW .", "Since a ministerial instruction , dated DATE , and thus subsequent to the measures presently complained of , all cases involving a possible infringement of LAW have had to be submitted to the military criminal courts ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) and not to the disciplinary authorities .
