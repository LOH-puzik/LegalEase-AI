GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . The respondent Government are represented by their Deputy Agent , Mr H .\u2013 PERSON , GPE , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant \u2019s late father was the owner of real estate located in GPE in GPE . In DATE the NORP PERSON seized that plot of land for the purpose of railway construction , but did not expropriate the land . In DATE the NORP ORG intended to buy that plot of land , but the negotiations between the applicant \u2019s father and the company failed . Following the foundation of GPE ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) on DATE ORG ( ORG ) of the GPE continued to use the land . The plot has a size of QUANTITY . At an unknown point of time the applicant \u2019s father left GPE .", "At the time of the NORP reunification on DATE the applicant \u2019s father was listed as the real estate \u2019s owner in the land register ( Grundbuch ) . In DATE the NORP ORG and the applicant \u2019s father again negotiated the purchase of the land and agreed on a purchase price of CARDINAL MONEY ( ORG ) ( CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) . However , ORG of the former GPE withdrew its offer shortly before the signing of the contract .", "Subsequently the NORP ORG of the former GPE and ORG of GPE ( ORG Bundesbahn ) merged to form ORG ( ORG ) , which is a ORG - owned company . ORG continues to use the plot of land in question . The applicant \u2019s father passed away on DATE and the applicant inherited the plot of land . A copy of the land register ( PERSON ) dated DATE lists the applicant as the current owner .", "The applicant does not pay property tax ( ORG ) , but ORG does .", "The applicant brought an action for delivery of possession ( Klage auf Herausgabe- rei vindicatio ) against ORG in ORG . On DATE ORG ordered ORG to deliver ( herausgeben ) the real estate . The court held that the applicant \u2019s father had never been expropriated and that the applicant was thus the owner . Furthermore , it found that the applicant \u2019s claim had not lapsed ( ist nicht erloschen ) according to LAW for ORG Caused by the War and the ORG of the NORP Reich \u201d ( \u201c PERSON allgemeinen GPE durch den FAC entstandener GPE \u2013 Allgemeines Kriegsfolgengesetz \u2013 hereinafter called the \u201c ORG \u201d \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . According to section CARDINAL of that act all claims against ORG or ORG are excluded , but according to ORG section CARDINAL claims of delivery of possession ( Herausgabeanspr\u00fcche ) are to be satisfied by the successor of ORG and ORG .", "However , according to LAW of DATE ( Einigungsvertrag ) only sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and not section DATE , of the aforementioned act were to apply in the territory of the former GPE ( neue ORG - hereinafter called new L\u00e4nder ) . Nevertheless , ORG held that the aforementioned provisions had to be interpreted in conformity with LAW ) , and accordingly , the applicant \u2019s claim could not be excluded .", "ORG confirmed the lower court \u2019s decision . It held that the applicant was the owner and that ORG possessed the real estate within the meaning of ORG . The court considered that the pertinent provisions of LAW could not be interpreted in accordance with LAW . However , it found that sections DATE and following of ORG had to be applied by analogy . It pointed out that when deciding on LAW the German ORG had been of the opinion that section DATE was no longer needed as no such claims existed anymore . Therefore , the ORG had overlooked that there was still a need for regulation of cases such as the present one . Hence sections DATE and following had to be applied by analogy , as there was no objective reason for treating the applicant \u2019s case differently from CARDINAL in which the real estate in question was located on the territory of GPE ( \u201c FRG \u201d ) prior to the NORP reunification ( alte Bundesl\u00e4nder- hereinafter called old ORG ) . The court also pointed out that the applicant was not entitled to any compensation under current NORP PERSON for her loss of possession , as the regulations which awarded compensation for acts of ORG required an act of expropriation .", "While the proceedings were pending before the court , ORG offered the applicant to buy the real estate for ORG ( PERCENT ) per square metre , resulting in a purchase price of CARDINAL ORG . The applicant refused that offer .", "ORG set aside the judgment of ORG . It acknowledged that the applicant was the property \u2019s owner ( \u201d die Kl\u00e4gerin ist Eigent\u00fcmerin eines ... Grundst\u00fccks \u201d ) , but rejected her claim for delivery of possession .", "The court found that section CARDINAL of ORG could not be applied by analogy as this would be contrary to the legislator \u2019s will . From the pertinent provisions of LAW it deduced that the legislator actually intended to treat the owners of real estate located in the old or new LOC differently . It found that , according to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires , those provisions of LAW were meant to be a final settlement of the question of the damages caused by the war and the collapse of ORG . The court concluded that the legislator had not wished to include claims such as in the present case , because it considered that there was no further need for regulation . Furthermore , the court found that there was no indication that the legislator might have erroneously overlooked that in some particular cases the need for regulation persisted . On the contrary , the legislator had accepted that in some cases the aim of ORG could not be achieved .", "The court held that the rejection of the applicant \u2019s action for delivery of possession did not violate the German Basic PERSON for the following reasons . The exclusion of claims for delivery of possession did not fall within the ambit of LAW , which guarantees the right to property ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . It doubted that the applicant still had a right protected by that provision . The real estate had been in possession ( i QUANTITY Besitz ) of the GPE for DATE . Therefore , it found that the applicant \u2019s property had become an \u201c empty shell \u201d ( blo\u03b2e ORG ) . In any event , LAW was not applicable as LAW of LAW Basic PERSON was lex specialis in the present case ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . It stipulates that the ORG can determine which liabilities of the GPE are to be satisfied .", "The court pointed out that in the context of the NORP reunification similar questions had arisen as after DATE Second World War . In DATE ORG had passed the afore - mentioned ORG in order to determine the liabilities accumulated by ORG . To rectify the de facto bankruptcy of ORG , the ORG was in general allowed to repudiate the liabilities of ORG .", "ORG held that this reasoning could be applied to the situation subsequent to the NORP reunification , as far as it concerned the damages caused by the war and the collapse of ORG with which the GPE had not dealt . Therefore , the ORG was entitled to choose which liabilities it would fulfil . The court stressed that the legislator , when assessing the ORG \u2019s financial capacity in this respect , enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation .", "The court furthermore held that the applicant had not been discriminated against contrary to LAW see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . It pointed out that under GPE law the applicant \u2019s right of ownership had already been diminished , as her real estate had been in public use during the entire time . Furthermore , there had been DATE between the end of the war and the NORP reunification . It concluded that the NORP legislator had had a wide margin of appreciation in this respect , in particular regarding the financing of the NORP reunification .", "Lastly it found that even the fact that the applicant permanently lost the possession of her property while remaining proprietor did not make a difference . The court held that this had to be accepted ( hinnehmen ) by the applicant . It further denied any compensation under civil law for the continued use of the property by ORG , stating that such claims had lapsed as well according to ORG .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint solely invoking LAW ( prohibition of discrimination ) .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s complaint against the judgment of ORG and the above - mentioned provisions of LAW . It acknowledged that the applicant had suffered a disadvantage in comparison to owners whose property , located in the old L\u00e4nder , had been seized by ORG during the war . However , the court found that this disadvantage did not breach LAW , as there were objective reasons for it . It found that the Second World War had led to the establishment of GPE with different forms of Government and social orders . Each ORG had dealt with the damages caused by the war and the collapse of ORG in a different way and was responsible for those caused in its territory . Therefore , the ORG was under no obligation to compensate for damages which had not been taken care of by the GPE . Moreover , the court found that the ORG would have been administratively and financially overstrained with that task in any event . It concluded that the disadvantage suffered by the applicant was reasonable ( zumutbar ) , in particular because , DATE after DATE , the applicant could not expect to ever resume possession of her property again .", "The relevant provisions read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "Forfeiture of Claims", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Claims against", "ORG , including the separate estates of ORG ( ORG ) and ORG ( ORG ) ,", "the former ORG ,", "the enterprise NORP Motorways ( PERSON )", "expire , unless this LAW provides differently . ... \u201d", "Section CARDINAL", "Claims placed on a footing of equality ( gleichgestellte Anspr\u00fcche )", "\u201c The provisions of this LAW are to be applied , as appropriate , to", "...", "CARDINAL .
