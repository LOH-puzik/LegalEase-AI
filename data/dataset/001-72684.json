The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The facts , as found by Mr Justice PERSON ( \u201c Wall J \u201d ) , who heard the parties\u2019 oral evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , are as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her partner , J , commenced treatment at ORG ( \u201c the clinic \u201d ) . The applicant had been married and had been referred for fertility treatment at the clinic with her husband in DATE , but had not pursued it because of the breakdown of her marriage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and J were informed , during an appointment at the clinic , that preliminary tests had revealed that the applicant had serious pre - cancerous tumours in both ovaries , and that her ovaries would have to be removed . They were told that because the tumours were growing slowly , it would be possible first to extract some eggs for in vitro fertilisation ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , but that this would have to be done quickly .", "CARDINAL . The consultation of DATE lasted TIME in total . A nurse explained that the applicant and J would each have to sign a form consenting to the ORG treatment and that , in accordance with the provisions of ORG \u201c the DATE LAW ) , it would be possible for either of them to withdraw his or her consent at any time before the embryos were implanted in the applicant \u2019s uterus ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The applicant asked the nurse whether it would be possible to freeze her unfertilised eggs , but was informed that this procedure , which had a much lower chance of success , was not performed at the clinic . At that point J reassured the applicant that they were not going to split up , that she did not need to consider the freezing of her eggs , that she should not be negative and that he wanted to be the father of her child . Wall J found that J gave these assurances in good faith , because at that time he loved the applicant , genuinely wanted a child with her and wanted to support her during a very difficult period ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , the couple entered into the necessary consents , by signing the forms required by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Immediately beneath the title to the form appeared the following words :", "\u201c NB \u2013 do not sign this form unless you have received information about these matters and have been offered counselling . You may vary the terms of this consent at any time except in relation to sperm or embryos which have already been used . Please insert numbers or tick boxes as appropriate . \u201d", "J ticked the boxes which recorded his consent to use his sperm to fertilise the applicant \u2019s eggs in vitro and the use of the embryos thus created for the treatment of himself and the applicant together . He further ticked the box headed \u201c Storage \u201d , opting for the storage of embryos developed in vitro from his sperm for the maximum period of DATE and also opted for sperm and embryos to continue in storage should he die or become mentally incapacitated within that period . The applicant signed a form which , while referring to eggs rather than sperm , essentially replicated that signed by J. Like J , she ticked the boxes providing for the treatment of herself and for the treatment \u201c of myself with a named partner . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the couple attended the clinic and CARDINAL eggs were harvested and fertilised . CARDINAL embryos were created and consigned to storage . On DATE the applicant underwent an operation to remove her ovaries . She was told that she should wait DATE before attempting to implant any of the embryos in her uterus .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the relationship broke up . The future of the embryos was discussed between the parties . On DATE J wrote to the clinic to notify it of the separation and to state that the stock of embryos should be destroyed .", "CARDINAL . The clinic notified the applicant of ORG \u2019s withdrawal of consent to further use of the embryos and informing her that it was now under a legal obligation to destroy them , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Schedule DATE CARDINAL Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant commenced proceedings in ORG , seeking an injunction requiring J to restore his consent to the use and storage of the embryos and a declaration , inter alia , that he had not varied and could not vary his consent of DATE . Additionally she sought a declaration of incompatibility under LAW DATE to the effect that section CARDINAL of , and Schedule CARDINAL to , LAW breached her rights under LAW , CARDINAL and DATE . She also pleaded that the embryos were entitled to protection under LAW and DATE . Interim orders were made requiring the clinic to preserve the embryos until the end of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge , Wall J , heard the case over DATE and took evidence from , among others , the applicant and J. On DATE , in a CARDINAL page judgment ( PERSON v. ORG and others , [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Fam ) ) , he dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims .", "CARDINAL . He concluded that J had not given consent to the continuing treatment of the applicant on her own and that there had been no consent on his part to the use of the embryos irrespective of any change of circumstance . He rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that J was estopped from withdrawing his consent , finding that both the applicant and J had embarked on the treatment in good faith on the basis that their relationship would continue . It did not , however , and in the changed circumstances of separation , it would be inequitable not to allow either party to change his or her mind and to withdraw consent to the treatment .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s Convention claims , Wall J held in summary that an embryo was not a person with rights protected under the Convention , and that the applicant \u2019s right to respect for family life was not engaged . He did , however , accept that the relevant provisions of LAW did interfere with the private life of both parties , but held that it was proportionate in its effect , the foundation for the legislation being a treatment regime based on the twin pillars of consent and the interests of the unborn child ( see further paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . He considered it entirely appropriate that the law required couples embarking on ORG treatment to be in agreement about the treatment , and permitted either party to withdraw from it at any time before the embryo was transferred into the woman .", "CARDINAL . Wall J emphasised that the provisions of Schedule QUANTITY ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) applied equally to all patients undergoing ORG treatment , irrespective of their sex , and concluded with an illustration of how the requirement for joint consent could similarly affect an infertile man :", "\u201c If a man has testicular cancer and his sperm , preserved prior to radical surgery which renders him permanently infertile , is used to create embryos with his partner ; and if the couple have separated before the embryos are transferred into the woman , nobody would suggest that she could not withdraw her consent to treatment and refuse to have the embryos transferred into her . The statutory provisions , like Convention rights , apply to men and women equally . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG was dismissed in a judgment delivered on DATE ( PERSON v. ORG , [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) .", "The court held that the clear policy of LAW was to ensure the continuing consent of both parties from the commencement of treatment to the point of implantation of the embryo , and that \u201c the court should be extremely slow to recognise or to create a principle of waiver that would conflict with the parliamentary scheme \u201d . J was thus entitled to withdraw his consent as and when he did and such withdrawal prevented both the use and continued storage of the embryos . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that J had concealed his ambivalence , thereby inducing her to go forward with him into couple treatment , holding this to be an unjustified challenge to the finding of the trial judge who had had the obvious advantage of appraising the oral evidence of the applicant , J , and the other witnesses ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . ORG was also informed by ORG \u2019s counsel that ORG clear position in withdrawing his consent was CARDINAL of fundamental rather than purely financial objection .", "CARDINAL . While there was an interference with the private lives of the parties , Lord Justices PERSON and PERSON found it to be justified and proportionate , for the following reasons :", "\u201c The less drastic means contended for here is a rule of law making the withdrawal of [ J \u2019s ] consent non - conclusive . This would enable [ the applicant ] to seek a continuance of treatment because of her inability to conceive by any other means . But unless it also gave weight to [ J \u2019s ] firm wish not to be father of a child borne by [ the applicant ] , such a rule would diminish the respect owed to his private life in proportion as it enhanced the respect accorded to hers . Further , in order to give it weight the legislation would have to require ORG or the clinic or both to make a judgment based on a mixture of ethics , social policy and human sympathy . It would also require a balance to be struck between CARDINAL entirely incommensurable things . ...", "... The need , as perceived by ORG , is for bilateral consent to implantation , not simply to the taking and storage of genetic material , and that need can not be met if CARDINAL of the consent is no longer effective . To dilute this requirement in the interests of proportionality , in order to meet [ the applicant \u2019s ] otherwise intractable biological handicap , by making the withdrawal of the man \u2019s consent relevant but inconclusive , would create new and even more intractable difficulties of arbitrariness and inconsistency . The sympathy and concern which anyone must feel for [ the applicant ] is not enough to render the legislative scheme ... disproportionate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lady ORG stated , by way of introduction , that :", "\u201c The DATE Act inevitably uses clinical language , such as gametes and embryos . But it is clear that LAW is concerned with the very emotional issue of infertility and the genetic material of CARDINAL individuals which , if implanted , can lead to the birth of a child . ... Infertility can cause the woman or man affected great personal distress . In the case of a woman , the ability to give birth to a child gives many women a supreme sense of fulfilment and purpose in life . It goes to their sense of identity and to their dignity . \u201d", "ORG noted that neither ORG nor the Green Paper which had preceded the legislation had discussed what was to happen if the parties became estranged during treatment ( see paragraphs DATE below ) . However , she went on to find :", "\u201c Like PERSON and PERSON , I consider that the imposition of an invariable and ongoing requirement for consent in LAW in the present type of situation satisfies LAW . ... As this is a sensitive area of ethical judgment , the balance to be struck between the parties must primarily be a matter for ORG ... . ORG has taken the view that no one should have the power to override the need for a genetic parent \u2019s consent . The wisdom of not having such a power is , in my judgment , illustrated by the facts of this case . The personal circumstances of the parties are different from what they were at the outset of treatment , and it would be difficult for a court to judge whether the effect of [ J \u2019s ] withdrawal of his consent on [ the applicant ] is greater than the effect that the invalidation of that withdrawal of consent would have on [ J ] . The court has no point of reference by which to make that sort of evaluation . The fact is that each person has a right to be protected against interference with their private life . That is an aspect of the principle of self - determination or personal autonomy . It can not be said that the interference with [ J \u2019s ] right is justified on the ground that interference is necessary is protect [ the applicant \u2019s ] right , because her right is likewise qualified in the same way by his right . They must have equivalent rights , even though the exact extent of their rights under LAW has not been identified .", "The interference with [ the applicant \u2019s ] private life is also justified under LAW because , if [ the applicant \u2019s ] argument succeeded , it would amount to interference with the genetic father \u2019s right to decide not to become a parent . Motherhood could surely not be forced on [ the applicant ] and likewise fatherhood can not be forced on [ J ] , especially as in the present case it will probably involve financial responsibility in law for the child as well . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the issue of discrimination , Lord Justices PERSON and PERSON considered that the true comparison was between women seeking ORG treatment whose partners had withdrawn consent and those whose partners had not done so ; Lady ORG considered that the real comparators were fertile and infertile women , since the genetic father had the possibility of withdrawing consent to ORG at a later stage than in ordinary sexual intercourse . The CARDINAL judges were nevertheless in agreement that , whatever comparators were chosen , the difference in treatment was justified and proportionate under LAW same reasons which underlay the finding of no violation of LAW . ORG further refused leave to appeal against ORG finding that the embryos were not entitled to protection under LAW , since under domestic law a foetus prior to the moment of birth , much less so an embryo , had no independent rights or interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . The birth of the first child from ORG in DATE prompted much ethical and scientific debate in GPE , which in turn led to the appointment in DATE of ORG under the chairmanship of PERSON to \u201c consider recent and potential developments in medicine and science related to human fertilisation and embryology ; to consider what policies and safeguards should be applied , including consideration of the social , ethical and legal implications of these developments ; and to make recommendations . \u201d The Committee reported in DATE ( ORG ) and its recommendations , so far as they related to ORG treatment , were set out in a ORG issued for public consultation . After receipt of representations from interested parties , they were included in a ORG , ORG : ORG , published in DATE ( Cm CARDINAL ) . The White Paper noted \u201c the particular difficulties of framing legislation on these sensitive issues against a background of fast - moving medical and scientific development \u201d . Nonetheless , following further consultation , ORG and Embryology Bill DATE was published , and passed into law as ORG Embryology Act DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The solution recommended and embodied in LAW was to permit , subject to certain express prohibitions , the creation and subsequent use of live human embryos produced in vitro , subject to a number of conditions , restrictions and time limits .", "CARDINAL . Thus , by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , no person shall bring about the creation of an embryo , or keep or use an embryo except in pursuance of a licence . The storage or use of an embryo can only take place lawfully in accordance with the requirements of the licence in question . The contravention of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) is an offence ( created by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . One of the policy objectives of LAW was to promote the welfare of the child . Thus , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c A woman shall not be provided with treatment services unless account has been taken of the welfare of any child who may be born as a result of the treatment ( including the need of that child for a father ) , and of any other child who may be affected by the birth . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second important policy objective of the DATE Act was to ensure that both gamete providers ( i.e. the providers of the sperm and eggs ) continued to consent from the commencement of the treatment until the implantation of the embryos . The primacy of continuing bilateral consent had been central to ORG recommendations about the regulation of ORG treatment and although neither ORG nor the Green Paper had discussed what was to happen if the parties became estranged during treatment , the White Paper emphasised that donors of genetic material would have the right under the proposed legislation to vary or withdraw their consent at any time before the embryos were used .", "CARDINAL . By section CARDINAL(c ) of the LAW , it is a condition of every licence granted that the provisions of Schedule CARDINAL to the LAW , which deal with consent , shall be complied with .", "CARDINAL .

The material effect of Schedule CARDINAL was summarised in the judgment of ORG Justices PERSON and PERSON as follows :", "\u201c ( i ) Those contemplating the storage and/or use of embryos created from their gametes must first be offered counselling ; ( ii ) they must specifically be informed of the circumstances in which consent to the storage or use of an embryo may be varied or withdrawn ; ( iii ) consent given to the use of an embryo must specify whether the embryo is to be used to provide treatment services to the person giving consent , or to that person together with another , or to persons not including the person giving consent ; ( iv ) an embryo may only be stored while there is effective consent to its storage from both gamete providers , and in accordance with the terms of the consent ; ( v ) an embryo may only be used while there is an effective consent to its use from both gamete providers , and in accordance with the terms of that consent ; ( vi ) consent to the storage of an embryo can be varied or withdrawn by either party whose gametes were used to create the embryo at any time ; ( vii ) consent to the use of an embryo can not be varied or withdrawn once the embryo has been used in providing treatment services . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the material available to the ORG , including the \u201c Medically Assisted Procreation and the Protection of the Human Embryo Study on the ORG in GPE \u201d ( ORG , DATE ) , the situation in the various Member ORG would appear to be as follows . In GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , the right of either party freely to withdraw his or her consent at any stage up to the moment of implantation of the embryo in the woman is expressly provided for in legislation ; in the GPE , this rule is included in secondary legislation . In GPE , GPE and GPE clinical practice appears to conform to this model , and it further appears that , as a matter of law or practice , in GPE , GPE and GPE the male donor enjoys a similar power of veto to that afforded by GPE .", "CARDINAL . A number of countries have , however , regulated the consent issue differently . In GPE , for example , in recognition of the fact that medically - assisted reproduction represents a far heavier burden for the woman than for the man , and absent any prior written agreement to the contrary , the woman is entitled to proceed with the treatment notwithstanding the death of her partner or the divorce of the couple . In GPE , GPE and GPE the man \u2019s consent can be revoked only up to the point of fertilisation , beyond which it is the woman alone who decides if and when to proceed . In GPE , the man \u2019s right to revoke his consent is recognised only where he is married to and living with the woman .", "CARDINAL . The field of medically assisted reproduction is not regulated at federal level in GPE , and since few GPE have introduced laws concerning the subsequent withdrawal of consent by CARDINAL party , it has been left to the courts to determine how the conflict between the parties should be resolved . There is , therefore , a series of judgments by ORG regarding the disposal of embryos created through ORG .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON , ( CARDINAL S.W.CARDINALd CARDINAL , CARDINAL ; DATE ) , ORG held in DATE :", "\u201c ... disputes involving the disposition of pre - embryos produced by in vitro fertilization should be resolved , first , by looking to the preferences of the progenitors . If their wishes can not be ascertained , or if there is dispute , then their prior agreement concerning disposition should be carried out . If no prior agreement exists , then the relative interests of the parties in using or not using the pre - embryos must be weighed . Ordinarily , the party wishing to avoid procreation should prevail , assuming that the other party has a reasonable possibility of achieving parenthood by means other than use of the pre - embryos in question . If no other reasonable alternatives exist , then the argument in favor of using the pre - embryos to achieve pregnancy should be considered . However , if the party seeking control of the pre - embryos intends merely to donate them to another couple , the objecting party obviously has the greater interest and should prevail . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. PERSON ( CARDINAL GPE . TIME ) , the couple had signed an agreement with the clinic which stipulated that , \u201c in the event that we ... are unable to make a decision regarding the disposition of our frozen pre - zygotes \u201d , the embryos could be used for research . When the couple separated , PERSON sought to overturn the agreement and proceed to implantation . Although she prevailed at first instance ( the court reasoning that just as a woman has exclusive control over her reproduction so should she have the final say in the area of ORG ) , ORG decided that the existing agreement was sufficiently clear and should be honoured .", "CARDINAL . In GPE v. LANGUAGE , ( DATE , CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL ; CARDINAL N.E. CARDINALd DATE ) there was again a previous written agreement , according to which , in the event of separation , the embryos were to be given to the wife , who now wished to continue with the treatment , contrary to the wishes of the husband . However , ORG considered that the arrangement should not be enforced because , inter alia , as a matter of public policy \u201c forced procreation is not an area amenable to judicial enforcement \u201d . Rather , \u201c freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life \u201d should prevail .", "CARDINAL . This judgment was cited with approval by ORG , in PERSON ( DATE PERSON ) . Here , it was the wife who sought the destruction of the embryos while the husband wanted them preserved for use with a future partner . Although constitutional arguments were advanced on behalf of the wife , the court declined to approach the matter in this way , reasoning that it was in any event not sure that enforcing the alleged private contract would violate her rights . Instead , the court subscribed to the view taken in the PERSON case regarding public policy and ordered that the wife \u2019s wishes be observed .", "CARDINAL . In the final case in this series , Litowitz v. Litowitz , ( DATE , CARDINAL ) , ORG of GPE decided in DATE to adopt a contractual analysis and to honour the couple \u2019s agreement with the clinic not to store the embryos for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In GPE v. PERSON ( CARDINAL ) LAW ( Isr ) ) a childless NORP couple decided to undergo ORG and then to contract with a surrogate in GPE to bear their child because the wife would not be able to carry the foetus to term . The couple signed an agreement with the surrogate , but not with the ORG clinic regarding the disposal of the embryos in the event of their separation . The wife had her last CARDINAL eggs extracted and fertilised with her husband \u2019s sperm . The couple then separated , before the embryos could be implanted in the surrogate , and the husband , who had gone on to have children with another woman , opposed the use of the embryos .", "ORG found in favour of the wife , holding that the husband could no more withdraw his agreement to have a child than a man who fertilises his wife \u2019s egg through sexual intercourse . A CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG reversed this decision , upholding the man \u2019s fundamental right not to be forced to be a parent . ORG reheard the case as a panel of CARDINAL judges and decided , CARDINAL , in favour of the wife . Each judge wrote a separate opinion . The judges in the majority found that the woman \u2019s interests and in particular her lack of alternatives to achieve genetic parenthood outweighed those of the man . CARDINAL of the minority judges , including the Chief Justice , reached the opposite conclusion , emphasising that the wife had known that her husband \u2019s consent would be required at every stage and that the agreement could not be enforced after the couple had become separated .
