GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of Art. 6-3-c", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , a NORP national , is a lawyer who practises in GPE . At the material time , he was facing criminal proceedings in ORG ( ORG ) in connection with his activities as the lawyer of various members of ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Initially he was represented by CARDINAL lawyers of his choice : PERSON , practising in GPE , and PERSON , having his office in GPE . Subsequently , on DATE , they were designated , at his request , to represent him as court - appointed defence counsel . The applicant had , moreover , chosen CARDINAL further lawyers to assist in his defence , CARDINAL of whom were LANGUAGE , but they did not participate in the criminal proceedings in question here .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on an application by the prosecuting authority , the President of ORG designated as third court - appointed defence counsel , PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr Croissant raised objections both to the appointment of a third defence counsel itself and to the choice of the person concerned . He objected in particular that Mr PERSON was a member of ORG ( ORG ) , while he was fundamentally opposed to that party . He requested either that the decision appointing PERSON be annulled or that the latter be replaced by PERSON , who also had his office in GPE .", "PERSON for his part asked to be relieved of his duties in the case .", "ORG dismissed both applications on DATE .", "On the first point it considered that it had been necessary to appoint a third defence counsel to ensure that the trial would take its course according to the principles laid down in LAW and , in any event , that the accused was adequately represented throughout the trial , having regard to its possible length and to the size and complexity of the case .", "As to the other objection , it agreed that when selecting a lawyer to be appointed as defence counsel the court should , as a rule , endeavour to choose a lawyer in whom the defendant places confidence . This rule was formulated for cases where the defendant has no defence counsel and the court must appoint CARDINAL . However , at Mr Croissant \u2019s request , the court had appointed CARDINAL defence counsel who enjoyed his full confidence . Nevertheless , when selecting the third court - appointed defence counsel , the court had not only taken into consideration which lawyer would offer the best guarantees for a proper and effective defence , having regard to the subject - matter of the trial , the factual and legal complexity of the case and the personality of the defendant . It had also tried to choose CARDINAL in whom the defendant would probably be able to place confidence .", "Taking into account all the circumstances which were relevant for assessing whether PERSON was a suitable person to defend PERSON , the court held that the fact that PERSON was a member of the ORG did not justify revoking his appointment : in so far as the defendant might wish the defence to make a sharp attack on the politics of this party , the other court - appointed counsel offered all the guarantees . PERSON too had expressed the opinion that he was in a position to appear for the defendant in spite of their political differences .", "Finally , PERSON was defending CARDINAL of Mr Croissant \u2019s former employees in other proceedings and the possibility of a conflict of interests could not be ruled out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) upheld this decision . It recalled that , according to the case - law of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , an appointment to act as defence counsel could and should only be revoked when its purpose - that is , to ensure that the accused will be adequately defended and the proceedings properly conducted - is seriously endangered . On similar grounds as the first - instance court , it held that Mr Croissant had not established that this requirement was met in respect of Mr PERSON \u2019s appointment .", "As to the appointment of a third defence counsel , the court found nothing to criticise . To appoint a further defence counsel having his office within ORG jurisdiction had been objectively justified by reason of the length of the proceedings , which could not be predicted accurately , and the size and complexity of the case .", "As to PERSON request to be discharged from the case , the court found that unjustified too . Neither Mr Croissant nor PERSON maintained , nor was there anything to show , that the relations between them were so strained or they had quarrelled in such a way as to make a proper defence impossible .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , PERSON tried to secure the additional assistance of PERSON , by choosing him as defence counsel , but to no avail . Under Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , an accused may not be represented by CARDINAL such lawyers ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and he had already retained CARDINAL counsel of his own choice ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "At the trial , which lasted DATE , the applicant was represented by the CARDINAL court - appointed defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of supporting a criminal organisation and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ; he was also barred from practising his profession for DATE and ordered to pay the costs and expenses , including those which he had been compelled to incur himself .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed PERSON appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the costs office ( ORG ) of ORG set the costs and expenses at ORG , including DM CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL for the fees and disbursements of the CARDINAL court - appointed defence counsel . In an additional bill ( GPE ) of DATE it fixed the final amount at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , DM CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL of which represented the ORG fees and disbursements . The amount payable in respect of PERSON was DM CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection ( GPE ) against this assessment , which he considered to be incompatible with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) ( article DATE ) of the LAW . He argued that once free legal assistance had been granted no payment could subsequently be demanded , so that he was under no obligation to pay the court - appointed lawyers and in particular PERSON , who had been imposed on him .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the objection ; it referred to the opinion which prevailed in NORP case - law and literature on the subject , which opinion had been endorsed by the ORG in a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Decisions and Reports CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr Croissant lodged an appeal ( Beschwerde ) in ORG , based on the same grounds . He stressed their particular relevance to PERSON , who had been appointed against PERSON will .", "On DATE the appeal was allowed in respect of CARDINAL minor items ( DM CARDINAL in total ) , but was dismissed as to the main issue . ORG held that the designation of a third court - appointed defence counsel had corresponded to a pressing need - ensuring an adequate defence - , on account of the scope and complexity of the case and in view of the probable duration of the trial . If the court , when making the appointment , had also purported to secure that the trial would take its legal course , it had rightly done so since that was a legitimate interest to be taken into account as well . As to the applicant \u2019s arguments based on Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) ( article DATE ) of the LAW , the court endorsed the reasons given by ORG . It added that the financial means of the defendant are immaterial for deciding whether or not the court should appoint a defence counsel . The question whether a convicted person is able to pay only arises after the criminal proceedings have ended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to entertain Mr Croissant \u2019s constitutional appeal ( ORG ) , taking the view that it had no prospect of success . In the light of the ORG \u2019s case - law , the court considered that it did not follow from Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) ( article DATE ) of the LAW that legal assistance was definitively provided free . It held that a convicted person \u2019s obligation to pay costs and expenses derived from the fact that proceedings had been brought as a result of his own conduct . The principle of the \" social state \" ( Sozialstaatsprinzip ) and the right to a fair trial no doubt guaranteed that , where necessary , legal assistance be accorded to an indigent accused , but they did not require him to be definitively dispensed from paying the fees incurred . The law on legal costs and expenses made available other possibilities ( arrangements for payment or stay of execution ) to take effective account of the financial difficulties of the convicted person . Finally , ORG conclusion regarding the necessity of appointing PERSON as the third lawyer ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was coherent and in any event had not been arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant had already requested an extension of the time - limit for payment ( Stundung ) , but this was refused by the President of ORG ( ORG ) on DATE . After a first appeal ( Beschwerde ) had failed , his further appeal ( PERSON ) was allowed on CARDINAL DATE , when ORG quashed the earlier decisions and remitted the matter to ORG . It considered that a decision to grant such an extension was primarily intended to facilitate the rehabilitation of a debtor who had already served his sentence . It was accordingly necessary to take account of the appellant \u2019s argument that a rejection of his request would force him to make a declaration of assets ( PERSON ) and would hamper his efforts to resume practising as a lawyer . It was also necessary to bear in mind that the applicant had agreed to the inspection of his documents and accounts by a member of ORG , in order to assess his income , and that ORG had proposed to ask him to make a confidential statement under oath before a notary instead of a declaration of assets . Even though granting the extension would mean in reality that a large part of the debt would remain unpaid indefinitely , that did not justify a refusal ; in any event it was unlikely that the total amount could ever be recovered . It was therefore necessary to reconsider the question and to determine whether it was possible to authorise smaller payments by instalments .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the President of ORG granted several extensions of the time - limit , on the most recent occasion until DATE . However , in DATE , on his own initiative , Mr Croissant started to pay ORG DATE , on the condition that this sum not be used to pay the court - appointed lawyers .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , DATE and DATE he had unsuccessfully sought to have the debt cancelled . A fourth such request , filed on DATE , led to an order made by the President of ORG on DATE . Whilst dismissing the remainder of the application , he reserved , pending the ruling of ORG , his decision on the payment of the fees and expenses of the court - appointed lawyers .", "CARDINAL . The following provisions of LAW concerning assistance by defence counsel are relevant in the present case .", "\" ( CARDINAL ) The accused ( PERSON ) may be assisted by a lawyer at any stage of the proceedings . He may not be represented by CARDINAL lawyers of his own choice .", "( CARDINAL ) ... \"", "\" ( CARDINAL ) The assistance of a defence counsel is necessary where :", "CARDINAL . the trial at first instance is conducted in ORG or ORG ;", "... \"", "\" ( CARDINAL ) In the cases provided for in LAW ) , a defence counsel shall be appointed for an accused who has been officially charged before the court ( PERSON ) and is not yet represented by counsel , as soon as the accused is invited ... to make a statement on the indictment .", "( CARDINAL ) Where the necessity of a defence counsel only becomes apparent at a later stage , CARDINAL shall be appointed immediately .", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) ... \"", "According to the case - law of ORG and ORG , LAW does not preclude a court from appointing , when it holds this to be necessary in the interests of justice , one or more defence counsel for an accused who is already represented by CARDINAL or more counsel of his own choice .", "\" ( CARDINAL ) In so far as possible , the President of the court ORG shall designate the lawyer to be appointed from among the ORG lawyers admitted to plead in a court within the same ORG jurisdiction .
