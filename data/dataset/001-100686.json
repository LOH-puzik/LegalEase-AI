The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ship ORG , flying the flag of the GPE , was sailing in the NORP exclusive economic zone off the coast of GPE , carrying QUANTITY of fuel oil . At a distance of QUANTITY from LOC it sent out an ORG after sustaining sudden and severe damage which produced a leak and caused the contents of its tanks to spill into LOC .", "CARDINAL . As the ORG was in danger of sinking , the maritime authorities launched a large - scale operation to rescue its crew . The ship was adrift and was approaching the coast , spilling its cargo into the sea . The applicant , who was the ship \u2019s Master , was taken by helicopter to the offices of the ORG ( A GPE ) harbourmaster , where he was arrested .", "CARDINAL . The spillage of the ship \u2019s cargo caused an ecological disaster whose effects on marine flora and fauna lasted for DATE and spread as far as the NORP coast . The shores of the LOC coast of GPE and GPE were severely polluted by the numerous waves of oil which were washed up . The oil spill blackened beaches and cliffs , destroyed marine life , adversely affected water quality and had an immediate environmental impact on numerous animal species . It caused damage to protected natural areas and had considerable repercussions on several sectors of the economy in the regions concerned , particularly on fishing , commerce and tourism .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG no . CARDINAL investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody and set bail at MONEY ( ORG ) , after finding that the facts of the case disclosed sufficient indicative evidence to justify opening a criminal investigation . While acknowledging that the oil spill had been caused by an accident , the judge said that some of the information in the file , although still provisional at that stage in the proceedings , suggested that the applicant had been at fault in several respects , in particular in failing to cooperate sufficiently with the port authorities when they had tried to take the vessel in tow . The applicant \u2019s conduct could constitute an offence of causing damage to natural resources and the environment and CARDINAL of failing to comply with the instructions of the administrative authorities . In the judge \u2019s opinion , the seriousness of the offences in question and the fact that the applicant was a foreign national who had no particular ties with GPE justified the high sum set for bail . The relevant part of the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c The information obtained discloses indicative evidence \u2013 still provisional at the preliminary investigation stage DATE of an offence of causing damage to natural resources and the environment for the purposes of LAW and , possibly , LAW , and of an offence of failure to comply with the instructions of the administrative authorities , punishable under LAW . The investigation has produced sufficient indicative evidence to suggest that Mr PERSON could be criminally responsible for the offences in question . In view of the penalties laid down in LAW for these offences , and the fact that the application provided for in LAW and LAW was made at the mandatory hearing , an order should be made , in accordance with ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of that Code , for the accused \u2019s pre - trial detention as a preventive measure , accompanied by the right for the accused to communicate with others and the possibility of release on bail .", "The reasonable indications referred to above emerge from the documents in the case file and , in particular , from detailed examination of the testimony of the witnesses who appeared TIME . All the evidence indicates that the severe damage to the ORG was caused by the unforeseeable phenomenon of a storm surge , but that actions were taken which could form the basis of a criminal prosecution , as indicated in the previous paragraph .", "It should be stressed that the steps taken hitherto and the conclusions to be drawn for the purposes of this decision are of a wholly provisional nature and that many further steps and much more expert evidence will be needed in order to fully elucidate the facts . However , it is clear at this stage that the ORG did not have any emergency towing equipment or that if it did , it was not in working order , as demonstrated by the recordings of conversations . It is also clear that the ship \u2019s Master , by repeatedly ignoring the instructions of the port authorities , hampered meaningful joint efforts to lessen the extremely serious risks .", "It appears that the Master of the Prestige refused for TIME to cooperate and subsequently continued to do so indirectly , creating difficulties by refusing to take the necessary steps to ensure effective towing of the vessel or to start the engine so that the ship could advance , however slowly . These events occurred within the country \u2019s GPE limit and , by definition , within the CARDINAL-mile zone . It is true , as already indicated , that further investigative elements are required , in particular the ship \u2019s log , which has been urgently requested , and that it will be necessary to verify all the other information contained in the recordings of conversations , transcripts of which appear to be in the possession of the LOC control centre .", "Without prejudice to all of the above , the accused \u2019s detention could be dispensed with subject to bail being furnished in the amount of MONEY . In the court \u2019s view , the security in question is justified in view of the seriousness of the offences concerned and the heavy sentence they carry and also because the investigation is in the early stages , the accused \u2019s release could impede the investigation , the case has clearly caused a major public outcry and , in addition to the issues of criminal responsibility raised , there are significant civil liability issues at stake involving substantial sums . Furthermore , Mr PERSON has no ties in GPE and could leave the country at any time and thus evade prosecution . For all the reasons outlined above it is necessary and unavoidable , in the present circumstances , to fix bail . Bail can not , for the time being at least , be replaced by a less restrictive measure . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested his release and , in the alternative , the reduction of bail to EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL to reflect his personal situation . He also submitted that his advanced age should be taken into account . In a decision of DATE , PERSON ) no . CARDINAL investigating judge refused the applicant \u2019s request . The judge took the view that the seriousness of the offences of which the applicant stood accused justified his continued pre - trial detention and that the latter measure was exceptional , subsidiary , temporary and proportionate in nature and thus satisfied the remaining criteria laid down by the case - law of ORG . As to the amount set for bail , the judge stated that the applicant \u2019s appearance at trial was vital in order to elucidate the sequence of events following the leak in the vessel . He also reiterated the arguments of the first investigating judge to the effect that the seriousness of the offences , the public outcry caused by the marine pollution , the applicant \u2019s NORP nationality , the fact that his permanent address was abroad and the fact that he had no ties with GPE justified setting a high level of bail in order to rule out any risk that the applicant might fail to appear .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same investigating judge confirmed the decision , rejecting an application from the applicant to set it aside ( recurso de reforma ) .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicant was dismissed on DATE by the Corunna Audiencia Provincial subject to the posting of bail in the amount of EUR CARDINAL . ORG noted the outcry caused by the alleged offences and took the view that the impugned decision was not open to criticism on any account , \u201c including with regard to the amount of bail \u201d .", "The Audiencia Provincial stressed that the prima facie evidence taken into consideration by the investigating judge in ordering the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention concerned serious offences , that it was too early to rule on whether the offence had been committed intentionally and that the applicant \u2019s detention pursued the legitimate aim of preventing the risk of his absconding , a risk closely linked to the seriousness of the alleged offence and his lack of any particular ties in GPE . It referred in that regard to the category of offences in question and the severity of the likely sentence , the fact that the accused \u2019s presence was essential to the investigation , the possibility that the trial might collapse if he absconded and the public outcry surrounding the established facts .", "ORG dismissed the ground of appeal based on the applicability of LAW on the Law of LOC DATE , holding that the provision in question referred only to administrative offences relating to pollution of the marine environment committed by foreign vessels beyond the territorial sea , for which only monetary penalties could be imposed , and not to wilful and serious acts of pollution in the territorial sea .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL investigating judge recorded the lodging of a bank guarantee in an amount corresponding to the sum set for bail , which was provided as a CARDINAL - off , spontaneous humanitarian gesture by the London Steamship ORG ( \u201c the GPE P&I Club \u201d ) , which insured the ship \u2019s owner . Accordingly , on DATE , the judge ordered the applicant \u2019s provisional release after DATE in detention , subject to the following conditions :", "\u201c ( a ) that [ the applicant ] supply an address in GPE ;", "( b ) that he report DATE before TIME to the police headquarters corresponding to the address supplied ;", "( c ) that he remain in the country and surrender his passport to the court \u2019s registry . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG and the ship \u2019s owner , ORG , paid out ORG CARDINAL in compensation for the damage for which they were civilly liable within the limits laid down by LAW ( \u201c the ORG DATE \u201d , see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . Relying on LAW ( right to liberty and security ) , the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with ORG . While he did not appeal against his pre - trial detention , for which he considered sufficient reasons to have been given , the applicant complained of the amount set for bail , arguing that it had been excessive and disproportionate in view of his financial circumstances and had made any prospect of provisional release unrealistic . He alleged that the amount had been fixed without account being taken of his personal circumstances , in disregard of the requirements of the court \u2019s case - law .", "CARDINAL . By a reasoned decision ( auto ) of DATE , ORG declared the appeal inadmissible . It began by observing that , according to its case - law , the fact that the applicant had been released did not render the amparo appeal devoid of purpose , given that \u201c ... in the event of a breach of the fundamental right asserted , the [ c]ourt should allow the appeal and grant the applicant amparo relief \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on the merits , ORG ruled as follows :", "\u201c ... LAW stipulates that the amount set for bail should take into account , among other factors , the nature of the offence , any previous convictions and other circumstances that might prompt the accused to seek to evade justice . According to the case - law of ORG , the object of bail is to secure the presence of the accused at the trial ... and the amount should act as a deterrent against any wish to abscond .", "...", "The rulings given in the instant case concerning the amount of bail and the refusal to reduce it provided ample reasons based on the primary objective of securing the accused \u2019s presence at the trial , the seriousness of the offences in question , the national and international disaster caused by the oil spill , the fact that the accused is a nonnational and the fact that he has no ties in GPE .", "These circumstances led the courts to consider that the risk of flight could only be reduced by setting such a high sum for bail ... They also took into consideration the accused \u2019s personal and financial circumstances and his professional environment . ... In fixing bail at a level such as to dispel any wish to abscond , they further took account of other aspects of the accused \u2019s personal situation , namely his NORP nationality , the fact that his permanent address is abroad and the fact that he has no ties whatsoever in GPE .", "It follows that bail was fixed on the basis of criteria of proportionality ... The exceptional amount reflects the exceptional nature of the situation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in DATE , the NORP authorities authorised the applicant \u2019s return to his country of origin , where he is now living , on condition that the NORP authorities ensured his compliance with the periodic supervision to which he had been subject in GPE .

The ECJ further held that \u201c serious negligence \u201d within the meaning of the Directive should be understood as entailing an unintentional act or omission by which the person responsible committed a patent breach of the duty of care which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes , knowledge , abilities and individual situation ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL , at p. CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) . In the ORG case it added that : \u2018 This is by no means a complete list of factors . Nor does the ORG intend to lay down rigid rules as to the exact weight to be attached to each of them\u2019 ( ITLOS Reports DATE , p. CARDINAL , at p. CARDINAL , para . DATE ) .

In doing so , the ORG is mindful of its duty not to prejudice the merits of the case , which are decided domestically .
