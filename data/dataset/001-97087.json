Mr GPE was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a member of the Alevi religious community , which is deeply rooted in NORP society and history . Their faith , which is influenced , in particular , by Sufism and certain pre - NORP beliefs , is regarded by some Alevi scholars as a separate religion and by others as the \u201c essence \u201d or \u201c original form \u201d of ORG . Its religious practices differ from those of the NORP schools of law in certain aspects such as prayer , fasting and pilgrimage ( see PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that his identity card , issued by the registrar of births , marriages and deaths , contained a \u201c religion \u201d box which indicated \u201c NORP \u201d , even though he was not a follower of that religion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he applied to the GPE ORG seeking to have his identity card feature the word \u201c Alevi \u201d rather than the word \u201c NORP \u201d . The relevant parts of his application read as follows :", "\u201c ... the word \u2018 Islam\u2019 featuring on my identity card does not reflect the true situation . As an Alevi citizen of GPE , I thought , on the basis of my knowledge and beliefs , that a person could not be at once \u2018 Alevi\u2019 and \u2018 Islam\u2019 ( sic ! ) . As a citizen of the secular Republic of Turkey , which , under its LAW , protects freedom of religion and conscience , I refuse to continue to bear the weight of this injustice and this contradiction stemming from the desire to offset a fear , which is wholly unfounded and deeply offensive . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a request by that court , the legal adviser to ORG issued his opinion on the applicant \u2019s request . He considered in particular that to indicate religious interpretations or subcultures in the religion box on identity cards was incompatible with national unity , NORP principles and the principle of secularism . He argued in particular that the word \u201c Alevi \u201d , designating a sub - group within ORG , could not be considered to be a separate religion or a branch ( mezhep ) of ORG . It was an interpretation of NORP influenced by NORP and having specific cultural features .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s request on the basis of the following considerations :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... the religion box on identity cards contains general information about ORG religion . It is accordingly appropriate to examine whether the Alevi faith ( PERSON ) constitutes a separate religion or an interpretation of ORG . It is clear from the opinion issued by the Presidency of ORG that the Alevi faith is an interpretation of ORG which is influenced by Sufism and which has specific cultural features ... Accordingly , that faith constitutes an interpretation of ORG and not a religion as such , in accordance with the general principles laid down in this regard . Furthermore , only religions in general are indicated on identity cards and not an interpretation or branch of any particular religion . No error has therefore been made in indicating \u2018 Islam\u2019 on the identity card of the applicant , who claims to be \u2018 Alevi\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . Books and articles submitted by the applicant reveal that AliCARDINAL is described as the \u2018 lion of ORG or similar . The fact that certain poems contain different expressions does not mean that the Alevi faith is not part of ORG . Since PERSON is CARDINAL of the CARDINAL caliphs of ORG and the son - in - law of PERSON , he must be considered to be CARDINAL of ORG \u2019s eminent personalities ...", "CARDINAL . NORP For example , in NORP too , there are sub - groups such as NORP and NORP , which nonetheless have their basis in NORP . That is to say that when someone adheres to a particular interpretation of ORG , it does not mean that that interpretation is not part of NORP ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant appealed to ORG . He complained that he had been obliged to disclose his beliefs because it was mandatory to indicate his religion on his identity card , without his consent and in breach of the right to freedom of religion and conscience within the meaning of LAW . He further alleged that the indication at issue , deriving from LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , could not be considered to be compatible with LAW , which provided that \u201c no one shall be compelled ... to reveal his or her religious beliefs and convictions \u201d . He also stated that he had lodged CARDINAL applications , the first to have the word \u201c NORP \u201d describing his religion on his identity card deleted , and the second , to have the word \u201c Alevi \u201d inserted into the relevant box . He stated that the court of first instance had been able to examine the CARDINAL requests separately , allowing the first and rejecting the second , finding that the indication at issue was not compatible with LAW . Lastly , he challenged the proceedings rejecting his application , in which ORG had described his faith as an interpretation of ORG .", "CARDINAL .

The inclusion of religion in the family record and on identity cards , before the child reaches the age of majority and without his or her consent , constitutes de facto mandatory disclosure of religion in daily life ... That disclosure obligation , stemming from the indication of religion on a document confirming civil status , and the presentation of that document when registering at a school or when carrying out military service formalities , does indeed amount , in my view , to \u2018 GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Legislation often includes the understandable attempt to define religion or related terms ( \u2018 PERSON , \u2018 ORG , \u2018 traditional religions\u2019 etc . ) . There is no generally accepted definition for such terms in international law , and many ORG have had difficulty in defining these terms . It has been argued that such terms can not be defined in a legal sense because of the inherent ambiguity of the concept of religion . A common definitional mistake is to require that a belief in God be necessary for something to be considered a religion . The most obvious counter - examples are classical Buddhism , which is not theistic , and NORP , which is polytheistic . ...", "CARDINAL . Religion or belief .
