In the first applicant \u2019s case the court held , in particular :", "\u201c The Justice of the Peace has correctly established that Mr PERSON had disobeyed a lawful order of a police officer ... , in particular : at TIME on DATE at CARDINAL PERSON , GPE ( near NORP hotel ) , after an authorised public event ( meeting ) , in a park of FAC , he participated with a group of CARDINAL people in a march that had not been notified to the executive authorities , went out on the road and continued walking from FAC , down the side streets to FAC , FAC , and FAC in the direction of FAC ; by doing so he obstructed the traffic and created a risk of accident while shouting out \u201c Shame ! \u201d , \u201c This is our city ! \u201d , \u201c GPE without GPE ! \u201d , \u201c Down with the police state ! \u201d . In order to intercept the march a [ police ] cordon was set up at the crossroads of GPE and FAC . Repeated lawful orders to stop and end the march were given through a loudspeaker ; despite that , Mr PERSON with a group of people pushed through the cordon and came out onto PERSON while continuing to chant slogans , and there they were met by the police cordon . [ He ] did not react to the repeated lawful orders to stop these acts and disperse , continued his unlawful acts drawing the attention of citizens and the press . During his arrest Mr PERSON , in reply to an invitation to proceed to the police bus for the issuing of an administrative offence report , began to push away [ I. ] and [ F. ] , trying to cause panic among people , and by doing so [ he ] manifested his refusal to comply with the lawful orders of the police and prevented them from carrying out their duties , an offence under LAW .", "...", "Despite his denial , Mr PERSON \u2019s guilt is proven by the report on the administrative charges ... , the statements of the police officers [ I. ] and [ F. ] [ and ] their testimonies given to the Justice of the Peace at the court hearing .", "The Justice of the Peace gave a correct and convincing assessment of this evidence , which led to the conclusion that Mr PERSON had deliberately refused to comply with the police ORG lawful order to stop his actions breaching public order , and continued them in defiance of [ the police order ] .", "This evidence , which is relevant , admissible and credible , is consistent . No bias on the part of the aforementioned witnesses or grounds for them to slander Mr PERSON have been established [ by the court ] , including the appeal instance ; therefore the explanations of Mr PERSON , as well and the witness testimonies of A. and T. , have been duly rejected for want of reliable corroboration ; the ruling of ORG is sufficiently reasoned in this respect .", "...", "... As follows from the [ escorting report ] and the [ detention report ] , the [ police ] had sufficient grounds for arresting PERSON and for escorting him to the ORG police station , GPE , in particular , the impossibility of drawing up an administrative offence report on the spot . The reports comply with the requirements of the law , in substance and in form . At the same time the court dismisses the arguments of the defence concerning the unlawful deprivation of liberty during TIME as unsubstantiated . As follows from the case file , after his arrest at PERSON , at TIME on DATE Mr PERSON was taken to the Kitay - Gorod police station , GPE , where the administrative material against him was issued . On DATE the administrative case was remitted to the ORG of the FAC . The police officers have complied with the terms of administrative detention provided for by LAW .", "...", "During the [ appeal ] hearing ... Mr PERSON was examined as a witness . He testified that at the time of Mr PERSON \u2019s arrest he had been with him at FAC . At the time of arrest [ they ] were on the pavement near the underpass , and did not commit any unlawful acts . CARDINAL people were blocked by the riot police . Then both Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON were arrested , virtually simultaneously . At this point the police officers did not give any orders , there was no disobedience on the part of [ the applicants ] . The police officers [ I. ] and [ F. ] did not take part in their arrest ; their court testimonies were false .", "Giving its assessment of the witness testimony of PERSON , the court finds it unreliable and dismisses it because it contradicts the testimonies of [ I. ] and [ F. ] , which are logical , consistent , concordant and objectively corroborated by the written evidence ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judgment held in the second applicant \u2019s case was essentially the same , including the similar testimonies of the other applicant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11", "13", "3", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1", "5-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
