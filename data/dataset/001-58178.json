SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-2;Not necessary to examine Art. 6-1;Not necessary to examine Art. 6-3;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "C. Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants are all NORP nationals who live in GPE . They are the widow and sons of the late Mr P. , who died on DATE .", "Mr P. had been the sole shareholder of a construction company , and the applicants were Mr P. \u2019s only heirs . The company \u2019s business was carried on by Mr P. \u2019s sons .", "CARDINAL . An inventory of Mr P. \u2019s estate was drawn up by the municipal authorities on CARDINAL DATE . A copy of that document in the ORG \u2019s file is dated CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE period within which the applicants could have renounced the inheritance ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Swiss Civil Code \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) apparently expired on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE the tax authorities examined the books kept by the company . Their inspection showed that over a period of DATE Mr P. had appropriated certain back payments due to the company and failed to declare them as income , thus evading both cantonal and federal taxes .", "CARDINAL . NORP The cantonal and federal tax authorities each initiated proceedings against the applicants for recovery of the unpaid taxes and at the same time imposed fines for tax evasion .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicants cooperated with the tax authorities by providing them with the information needed to calculate the correct assessments . However , they resisted the imposition of the fines and appealed to the appropriate tribunals , maintaining that they were innocent of the tax offence committed by Mr P.", "CARDINAL . NORP The cantonal proceedings ended on CARDINAL DATE with a judgment of ORG . ORG considered that it was a principle of criminal law in a ORG based on the rule of law that the innocent should not be punished , and DATE departing from its earlier case - law \u2013 held that the imposition of fines on the heirs for tax evasion by the deceased was accordingly illegal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG , deciding on an objection lodged by the applicants , issued an assessment of the direct federal tax unlawfully withheld by PERSON P. over CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL and imposed fines on the applicants . The fines came to MONEY ( CHF ) for MONEY CARDINAL for CARDINAL . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c By incorrectly declaring his income , the taxpayer withheld taxes from the ORG and thus became guilty of tax evasion . Pursuant to ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , respectively , of the Ordinance on Direct Federal Tax his heirs must therefore pay a fine of CARDINAL times the amount in addition to the tax withheld . For the tax period PERSON , when CARDINAL was evaded , the fine amounts to CARDINAL times the amount , and for the tax period CARDINAL , when CARDINAL was evaded , it amounts to CARDINAL times the amount of the taxes withheld . However , as it can be observed that the heirs have done everything possible to clarify the incorrect declaration of taxes , the fine is reduced to CARDINAL . \u201d", "ORG declined to follow the precedent set by the judgment of ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) on the ground that it could not deviate from clear provisions of federal law as long as the unconstitutional nature of those provisions had not been clearly established .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG of the GPE of GPE , relying inter alia on LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision on DATE .", "The assessment for DATE was quashed on the ground that it had not been lawfully communicated to the applicants within the DATE limitation period ( LAW .", "The assessment for DATE was upheld . In this context , ORG held that LAW could be relied on directly only in so far as it provided guarantees additional to those under LAW which it did not .", "In an obiter dictum ORG made a distinction between the presumption of innocence and the principle that only the guilty should be punished . The heirs\u2019 liability to pay fines incurred by the taxpayer , which did not offend against the latter principle \u2014 as construed in domestic law and applied to the deceased \u2014 did not necessarily offend against the former presumption either .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an administrative - law appeal with ORG on DATE .", "In addition to reiterating their complaints concerning the fines , they argued that they were entitled , under LAW CARDINAL of the ORG , to a public hearing and to the rights of the defence .", "CARDINAL . The Zurich ORG and the federal tax authorities , which had been invited to submit written comments pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , expressed the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed . ORG of ORG , which had also been invited to submit comments , declined to do so .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal without a hearing ( section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in a judgment delivered on CARDINAL DATE and served on the applicants on DATE . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c Unlike back tax , the fine for tax evasion ( save in so far as it may comprise interest intended to compensate for delay ) pursuant to LAW character ... Moreover , the definition of tax evasion requires that the taxpayer should be guilty , whether by commission or by omission , of a breach of duty resulting in his being underassessed for tax .", "However , according to the principle that heirs inherit tax liabilities ... the latter are liable , under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Ordinance on Direct Federal Tax , up to the amount of their share in the estate , and irrespective of any personal guilt , for the deceased person \u2019s evaded taxes and the fines . The provision in question of the Ordinance on Direct Federal Tax thus expressly contemplates that the heirs enter into the position of the deceased even in respect of the penal tax without being personally guilty . It follows that as regards the liability of heirs , the applicants can not derive any argument PERSON from the presumption of innocence enshrined in LAW , which only applies to persons charged with a criminal offence ... Nor can the general principles of the criminal law prayed in aid by the applicants avail them in the circumstances . \u201d", "ORG did not rule on the ORG claims under LAW QUANTITY CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , tax evasion was punishable by a fine of CARDINAL times the amount evaded , the fine being payable in addition to the amount due ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Ordinance on Direct Federal Tax ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided , inter alia :", "\u201c If the evasion is discovered only after the death of the taxpayer , proceedings shall be brought against his heirs . Irrespective of personal guilt , the heirs shall be jointly liable for the deceased person \u2019s evaded taxes and the fine incurred by him up to an amount not exceeding their share in the estate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Swiss Civil Code , an inheritance passes upon the death of the deceased .", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of LAW of the Swiss Civil Code provide :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The heirs shall automatically acquire the entire estate as soon as it passes .", "CARDINAL . Subject to the statutory exceptions , all claims and actions , property rights and other rights in rem and possessions of the deceased shall automatically pass to them , and they shall become personally liable for the deceased \u2019s debts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Swiss Civil Code , the heirs have the right to renounce the inheritance which has devolved to them . The time - limit for so doing is DATE ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It was open to the taxpayer to lodge an objection against an assessment of direct federal tax to the authority which had made it ( Article CARDINAL of the Ordinance on Direct Federal Tax ) .", "CARDINAL . An appeal against the decision given in the objection proceedings lay to ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) . ORG of the canton and the federal tax authorities could also bring such an appeal ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
