[ and that could make me cry ] . Not only because of the taste \u2013 although that alone would easily be enough for an abundant cry : sour , blunt and over - oxidised stuff , bad - quality ingredients collected from all kinds of leftovers , grey mould plus a bit of sugar from GPE , musty barrel \u2013 but because we are still there ... : CARDINAL of NORP drink [ this ] shit with pride , even devotion ... our long - suffering people are made to eat ( drink ) it and pay for it at least twice ( [ because we are talking about a ] ORG - owned company ) ; it is being explained diligently , using the most jerk - like demagogy from both left and right , that this is national treasure , this is how it is supposed to be made , out of the money of all of us , and this is very , very good , and we even need to be happy about it with a solemn face . This is how the inhabitants ( subjects ) of the country are being humiliated by the skunk regime through QUANTITY of alcoholised drink .", "And once again , I would remind everybody of how people were whining back then , saying that foreigners were coming to destroy [ T. ] , buy up the market and make everything multinational and alien - hearted ; and then it turned out that those foreigners made gorgeous wine , just like some lucky , resolute and very talented NORP family wineries , that they tried to make [ T. ] world - famous again , because this was their business interest ( profit , ugh ! ) ; while we as a community are trying to destroy their achievements using ORG money , lest something finally could be a success . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
