The applicant appealed against the decision . Referring to reports of various NGOs , he stressed that the problem of ill - treatment of detainees persisted in NORP and that he feared his extradition not only because of the general situation in the country but also because of his own experience of ill - treatment at the hands of the ORG officials , who were persecuting him on religious grounds .
