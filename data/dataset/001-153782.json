NORP The applicant , Ms Nada \u010coko , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .

On DATE the applicant was dismissed from her employment at company B.", "CARDINAL . On DATE she brought a civil action in ORG ( PERSON ) , seeking to have the company \u2019s decision to dismiss her reversed . Company B. had CARDINAL representatives in the proceedings , PERSON and PERSON", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( hereafter \u201c the principal judgment \u201d ) ORG ruled for the applicant and ordered her reinstatement .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the ORG ( PERSON u PERSON ) dismissed an appeal by the defendant company and upheld the principal judgment . The applicant \u2019s representative was served with a copy of the second - instance judgment of the \u0160ibenik ORG on CARDINAL DATE . PERSON was served with a copy of it on DATE and PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG stamped the applicant \u2019s copy of the principal judgment with certificates of finality and enforceability . Those certificates indicated that the judgment had become ( a ) final on DATE and ( b ) enforceable on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defendant company applied to ORG seeking to have the certificate of the enforceability of the principal judgment set aside . In so doing it argued that the certificate wrongly indicated that the judgment in question had become enforceable on DATE whereas it had actually become enforceable earlier . That error was due to the fact that ORG , when determining the date of enforceability , had mistakenly taken into account the date on which judgment had been served on PERSON instead of the date on which it had been served on PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG set aside the certificate of enforceability of DATE . ORG held that , as the principal judgment had been served on PERSON on DATE , it had therefore already become enforceable on DATE , after the DATE grace period for voluntary compliance had expired ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The relevant part of the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c The certificate of enforceability of the [ principal ] judgment of ORG ... is hereby set aside .", "...", "The judgment ... became final on DATE , the date of the judgment of the \u0160ibenik ORG ... , by which the defendant \u2019s appeal was dismissed .", "The judgment of the \u0160ibenik ORG ... was served on CARDINAL of CARDINAL representatives of the defendant on DATE , meaning that the DATE time - limit for voluntary compliance with the final judgment began on DATE , after the expiry of which the judgment became enforceable .", "The fact that the second - instance judgment was served on the second defendant \u2019s representative on DATE has no significance for the enforceability of [ that ] judgment ...", "Since this court has linked the issuance of the certificate of enforceability to the date of service on the defendant \u2019s second representative ... without bearing in mind that the defendant was duly served through the first representative ... the certificate of enforceability is hereby set aside . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision , arguing that since DATE , the date on which the principal judgment had been served on her , she had made DATE enquires about the enforceability of the judgment with ORG , but had only been able to obtain a certificate of enforceability on DATE . The applicant also argued that this date should not be changed , even if only the date on which the principal judgment was served on the first of the defendant \u2019s CARDINAL representatives was taken into account , as the time - limit had been properly calculated from the date on which the acknowledgement of acceptance of service had been returned to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance decision . It held that the principal judgment had indeed been served on PERSON on DATE and had become enforceable DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint arguing that the decisions of ORG and ORG had deprived her of the ability to have the final judgment entitling her to reinstatement enforced , as they had retroactively created a situation in which her application for enforcement had been lodged outside of the DATE statutory time - limit provided in section QUANTITY of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant complained about the significant gap between the date when the defendant \u2019s first representative PERSON had signed the acknowledgement of acceptance of service and the date when he had returned it to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) declared the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible because the contested decisions were not susceptible to constitutional review as they could not be regarded as decisions referred to in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) against which a constitutional complaint could be lodged .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant applied for enforcement of the principal judgment to ORG . She also sought payment of salary arrears in the period DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG issued a writ of execution ( rje\u0161enje o ovrsi ) ordering the defendant company to reinstate the applicant within DATE . It however dismissed her claim for salary arrears .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the defendant company appealed against that decision . In its appeal , the defendant company claimed that the applicant had failed to comply with the DATE statutory time - limit for seeking the enforcement set forth in section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) because she had been served with the second - instance judgment of DATE already on DATE but had applied for enforcement only on DATE ( see paragraphs QUANTITY above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the defendant company \u2019s appeal . It found that the applicant had applied for the enforcement of the principal judgment on DATE that judgment had become enforceable and thus complied with the statutory time - limit provided in section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and paragraph CARDINAL below ) . At the same time , the court allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and quashed the part of the first - instance decision dismissing the applicant \u2019s claim for salary arrears and remitted the case .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed enforcement proceedings , ORG held hearings on DATE and DATE . These hearings were adjourned after the defendant company asked the court to wait for a decision on its application to have the certificate of enforceability of the principal judgment set aside ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Another hearing was held on DATE . It was adjourned due to the possibility of the parties reaching an out - of - court settlement . At a hearing held on DATE the court decided to forward the entire case file to its President with a view to deciding on the defendant company \u2019s application to set aside the certificate of enforceability .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , relying on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) discontinued the enforcement proceedings because a certificate of enforceability had in the meantime been set aside ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .

However , given that the enforcement creditor has to exercise his or her right within that time - limit , the moment when that time - limit starts to run has to correspond to the moment when the enforcement creditor learns that [ the judgment sought to be enforced ] has become enforceable .
