THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE . He is represented before ORG , lawyers practising in PERSON , GPE . The second applicant is a NORP national living in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , lawyers practising in St Helier , GPE . The respondent Government were represented by Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "At TIME on DATE the first applicant collected CARDINAL bags containing QUANTITY of cannabis resin from an accomplice in a car park in GPE . He transferred those bags to a car and was arrested at TIME while attempting to make a telephone call from a kiosk . He said that he thought the bags contained money as he had previously been involved in similar exchanges of money with the accomplice as part of a tax evasion scheme . He contended that he did not have an opportunity to examine the contents of the bags before his arrest . He maintained that he had been surprised to have been given the bags by the accomplice on the occasion concerned as he had on previous occasions normally given bags to that person . He said that the telephone call was an attempt to clarify the situation with another accomplice .", "The first applicant \u2019s trial was in FAC before the inferior number , which consisted of a judge of law ( the \u201c deputy bailiff \u201d ) and CARDINAL judges of fact ( the \u201c jurats \u201d ) . His defence was that he did not know that the bags contained drugs and had no reason to believe that this was the case . At DATE trial the deputy bailiff delivered a summing up in open court before retiring with the jurats . The first applicant was convicted on DATE of offences of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on importation of cannabis resin and of being in possession of a controlled drug . No reasons were given for the verdict . He was sentenced to DATE , CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "In a judgment delivered on DATE ORG allowed his appeal against conviction for being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on importation of cannabis on the ground that the deputy bailiff had failed to direct the jurats fully on the ingredients of that offence . It dismissed his appeal against the conviction of being in possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply and substituted a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "The principal grounds of appeal related to alleged deficiencies in the summing up by the deputy bailiff . CARDINAL allegation was that the summing up had contained a number of factual deficiencies because it had referred to the first applicant \u2019s defence counsel as having implied that the purpose of the first applicant \u2019s going to the telephone kiosk was to telephone an accomplice to ask him what was in the bags and because it stated that part of his evidence was that a woman had rushed in and out of the kiosk \u201c within TIME of his being there \u201d . ORG concluded that :", "\u201c In our judgment these minor factual errors are not significant and could not possibly have affected the verdict of the jurats . \u201d", "Another allegation was that the summing up had not fairly put the defence case . For example , it indicated that it would have been \u201c very easy \u201d for the first applicant to inspect the bags before his arrest without referring to the defence counsel \u2019s contentions to the contrary . In this regard the court concluded :", "\u201c We have examined carefully the points made by [ the first applicant \u2019s counsel ] in relation to this submission but we find no force in it . Some of the points which were alleged to be unfavourable to the appellant on analysis proved to be neutral or even favourable to him ... .While it is true that the jurats were not reminded of every piece of evidence which was favourable to the defence , the deputy bailiff was under no duty to do so . What we do find is that the deputy bailiff was at pains to remind the jurats throughout the summing up that the appellant \u2019s defence was that he did not know that the bags contained cannabis resin and that it was his state of mind at the relevant time which was important . The deputy bailiff also reminded the jurats on CARDINAL occasion that the appellant \u2019s version of events was supported by other witnesses . We accordingly reject this criticism of the summing up \u201d .", "In the course of the proceedings before ORG , argument was also heard on the question whether , having delivered a summing up in open court , the presiding judge ( in this case the deputy bailiff ) should retire with the jurats , who are initially the sole judges of fact ( see below ) . The court made no observations on this point other than to suggest that", "\u201c ... this is an issue which merits careful consideration by the ORG \u201d .", "ORG concluded that :", "\u201c There was ample evidence upon which the jurats could make a finding of guilt . The appeal against conviction for possession of the cannabis resin with intent to supply was accordingly dismissed . \u201d", "The first applicant petitioned ORG of ORG for special leave to appeal against his conviction . On DATE , after an oral hearing , this was refused .", "The second applicant was arrested on TIME of DATE following a stop and search by police on a street in GPE . He was found to be in possession of CARDINAL packages of diamorphine ( heroin ) valued at GBP CARDINAL . He had travelled to GPE and back DATE . He said at his trial that he had gone there to visit an exhibition at ORG and maintained that he had only found the packages upon his return to his flat that TIME . He said that he initially thought that the packages contained diamonds , as he had previously carried them for a man called PERSON between GPE and GPE , where he had handed them over to a man called DATE He had met DATE at GPE railway station in GPE DATE but had explained to him that , at that time , he had no diamonds . He maintained that , at the time of his arrest , he was on his way with a friend to a public house to try to find PERSON because he did not know what was in the packages and had not examined their contents .", "The second applicant \u2019s trial commenced before the inferior number of ORG of GPE on DATE . At the conclusion of the closing speeches of the defence and prosecution counsel , the deputy bailiff and CARDINAL jurats retired . The deputy bailiff \u2019s summing up was delivered in private . On DATE the second applicant was convicted of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on importation of a controlled drug and of being in possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply it to another . No reasons were given for the verdict . He was sentenced to DATE , CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "The second applicant appealed on a number of grounds , including the fact that the deputy bailiff summed up in private . However , shortly before the appeal hearing , in a letter dated DATE , he withdrew CARDINAL of the CARDINAL grounds of appeal , and elected to proceed only on the question whether there had been sufficient evidence that the applicant had imported the heroin to form the basis of a conviction on the first charge .", "DATE before the appeal hearing ORG disclosed to the second applicant \u2019s representatives the existence of witness statements given by CARDINAL NORP police officers who had observed his movements in GPE on DATE in question . Those statements confirmed , inter alia , that the second applicant had met DATE at GPE station DATE and had gone on to ORG .", "On DATE ORG allowed the appeal against the conviction of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on importation of cannabis on the ground that the prosecution should have disclosed this evidence before , or at least during , the trial and that the non - disclosure had led to a substantial miscarriage of justice in relation to that conviction . It dismissed the appeal against the conviction of being in possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply on the ground that the non - disclosure did not affect that conviction . It stated that the new evidence :", "\u201c ... could not go to substantiate either directly or indirectly [ the second applicant \u2019s ] claim to have an entirely separate relationship with PERSON as a diamond courier . Nor could it explain his behaviour in relation to the QUANTITY packages on TIME after they had been left in his flat according to [ him ] by some unidentified person and without any explanation \u201d .", "ORG substituted a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "The second applicant petitioned ORG of ORG for special leave to appeal against his conviction , reverting , inter alia , to the question whether the summing up in private had been fair . There was a hearing before ORG on DATE , which was attended by the applicant \u2019s counsel and a representative of ORG . An account of this hearing prepared by ORG representative states :", "\u201c ... Their Lordships after hearing counsel on both sides and a short deliberation informed the parties that the Petition would be dismissed .", "I should point out that Lord PERSON [ the presiding judge ] remarked with great surprise at there being no summing - up by the Bailiff in open court , but went on to say that since the matter had not been raised before ORG , he did not believe that it would be appropriate for ORG to intervene in this regard at this stage without having any views from ORG .", "I rather got the impression from Advocate PERSON for the Petitioner , who attended at the hearing , that someone may well be looking at raising this subject again in an appropriate case in ORG , so that the matter may be raised yet again before ORG . ... \u201d", "The PERSON was first extended to LOC , under LAW ( now LAW , by a declaration registered at the Secretariat General on DATE . Protocol No . CARDINAL was extended to GPE with effect from DATE .", "There is CARDINAL bailiff and CARDINAL deputy bailiff in GPE . They are appointed by the Queen and can only be removed from office by her . The deputy bailiff is able to perform all the bailiff \u2019s functions , on the authority of the bailiff .", "ORG , comprised of bailiff and jurats , has existed in GPE since DATE . PERSON are charged with the execution of a range of judicial tasks . They are not required to decide legal issues , but instead represent the lay element in the process of judicial decision - making . They also form part of ORG and ORG .

In the case of serious statutory offences , including those of which both applicants were accused , trial is always before ORG by the inferior number .", "The roles of the bailiff and jurats at trial by inferior number are set out in LAW , which provides :", "\u201c POWERS OF THE BAILIFF AND PERSON", "CARDINAL ) In all causes and matters , civil , criminal and mixed , the Bailiff shall be the sole judge of law and shall award costs , if any .", "CARDINAL ) In all causes and matters , civil , criminal and mixed , other than criminal causes tried before ORG , in which causes the jury shall ... find the verdict , the PERSON ... shall be the sole Judges of fact and shall assess the damages , if any .", "CARDINAL ) In all criminal and mixed cases , the PERSON shall determine the sentence , fine or other sanction to be pronounced or imposed .", "CARDINAL ) In all causes and matters , civil , criminal and mixed , the Bailiff shall have a casting vote whenever the PERSON -", "( a ) being CARDINAL in number , are divided in opinion as to the facts or as to the damages to be awarded or as to the sentence , fine or other sanction to be pronounced or imposed ; or", "( b ) ( ... ) \u201d", "Since the entry into force of the DATE Law , the bailiff has - as a consequence of his own role as the sole judge of the law - been obliged to give the jurats guidance or directions on relevant matters of law . These directions are generally known as a summing up .", "In giving his directions on the law , it is common for the bailiff or deputy bailiff to advert to the issues of fact which are crucial to the legal issues upon which the directions are given . As a matter of practice , it is not usual for the bailiff to give a full and formal summing up of the facts , in the manner common in jury trials . The summing up used normally ( though not invariably ) to be given in private , after the trial itself - including the closing speeches of prosecuting and defence counsel - had taken place in public . However in the first applicant \u2019s case it was given in public . As a consequence of the comments of ORG in that case , it has been given in public in subsequent cases .", "After the trial , the bailiff ( or deputy bailiff ) and jurats retire together .
