The injuries to her head had been life - threatening and had led to permanent brain injury . The violence had been caused by the child \u2019s parents , Mr GPE and Mrs N.A. , directly by , amongst other things , blows and/or pushes against a hard surface and forceful shaking and/or by aiding and abetting the perpetration of the violence by not intervening and seeking to prevent the actions carried out against the child , in respect of whom both parents assumed the care . \u201d", "They were also indicted ( II ) under LAW ) , cf . ( CARDINAL ) , of having seriously and repeatedly exerted violence or otherwise infringed or illtreated someone in their household \u2013 in an aggravated manner because the abuse had been carried out over a long period , had been committed against a defenseless person and had been unprovoked . During the period from CARDINAL DATE until DATE , their son B had a number of times been exposed to violence resulting , inter alia , in the following injuries :", "\u201c - A fracture in the upper arm caused by twisting ;", "- blue nails on both of his big toes ;", "- several wounds , scars and miscolouring to the body , including scars after scratching on the throat .", "The violence had been caused by the child \u2019s parents , Mr U.A. and Mrs N.A. , either directly and/or by aiding and abetting the perpetration of the violence by not intervening and seeking to prevent the actions carried out against the child , in respect of whom both parents assumed the care . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( tingrett ) convicted the applicant and her former husband of the charges and sentenced them to terms of imprisonment of DATE , respectively . It was not in doubt that the CARDINAL children had been subjected to gross ill - treatment by adults but concluded that it was not possible from the evidence taken from the defendants and witnesses in the case to identify CARDINAL or more perpetrators . The statements given had been contradictory to such a degree that this could not be explained as being due to misunderstandings . Several of the statements ought to be considered as untrue leaving no possibility to distinguish between lies and truth on different points . On the other hand ORG found it established that the damage to the children had mainly occurred while the children had been in the flat . It was further proven that the accused Mr U.A. had been present in the tiny flat occupied by the family while the ill - treatment occurred , as had also been the case of the applicant . ORG also found it proven that each of the parents had aided and abetted in the commission of the violence by not having interfered or sought to prevent the acts of violence carried out against the children in regard to whom they had a duty of care . The parents were ordered to pay the children MONEY ( ORG ) ( CARDINAL and CARDINAL,CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her former husband appealed to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , which , sitting with a jury , held a hearing for DATE between CARDINAL DATE and DATE ) . It took evidence from the defendants and CARDINAL witnesses and QUANTITY court appointed experts . After the jury had answered all the questions put to it in the negative , the professional judges decided to accept the jury \u2019s verdict of acquittal .", "CARDINAL . In the same judgment of DATE , ORG ( without the participation of any members of the jury ) examined the children \u2019s claims for compensation of non - pecuniary damage under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW DATE . It held :", "\u201c According to this provision a person who with intent or gross negligence has caused personal injury may be required to pay compensation to the victim . ORG observes that such infringements as described in LAW can constitute a ground for awarding compensation for non - pecuniary damage under section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) , cf . section CARDINAL , even if no damage has occurred in the sense of the LAW . The assistance lawyer representing the children [ \u2018 bistandsadvokaten\u2019 ] has argued on their behalf that Mr [ U.A. ] and PERSON ] , with intent or gross negligence , have caused or aided and abetted [ \u2018 ORG ] in causing serious injury to [ A ] \u2019s head , her elbow getting out of joint and in seriously and repeatedly exposing [ B ] to violence .", "The ORG claims for non - pecuniary damage has its basis in the same acts as those in respect of which Mr [ U.A. ] and ORG ] has been acquitted in the criminal proceedings . The acquittal in the criminal proceedings does not hinder making an award of compensation for nonpecuniary damage to the victims , since less stringent evidentiary requirements applies to the latter than to criminal punishment . When a judgment of acquittal has been given in the criminal case , the presumption of innocence in LAW will set limits to what could constitute the basis for a decision on the civil claims . According to ORG case - law , the national courts can not justify their decision in a manner calling into doubt the acquitted person \u2019s innocence for criminal law purposes ( see ORG case - law reports PERSON . DATE p. DATE ) .", "A condition for establishing liability to pay compensation is that it was clearly probable that the damage had been caused by intent or by gross negligence ( ORG . DATE p.

ORG further finds it clearly probable that the parents had inflicted or have aided and abetted in inflicting great injuries to A \u2019s head and have inflicted or aided and abetted in inflicting injuries to B through repeated violence , including a fracture to his arm by twisting it .", "In its assessment of the evidence , ORG emphasises that several of the injuries ascertained are not compatible with accidental occurrences but on the contrary show that they have been inflicted by strong violence . ORG also points to the children \u2019s later reactions , including that [ B ] was in DATE diagnosed as suffering from post - traumatic stress syndrome . It further refers to witness statements from neighbours about noise in the form of screams of anxiety and painful cries from children in the apartment over a longer period .", "ORG is of the view that the physical and psychological injuries sustained by the children are a direct consequence of the illtreatment to which they have been exposed . In the High Court \u2019s view it was further foreseeable for Mr [ U.A. ] and PERSON ] that serious injuries , including serious brain damage , could occur in the case of such small children .", "Accordingly , the conditions for making an award of non - pecuniary damage have been fulfilled .", "The lawyer representing the children had filed a claim for compensation of non - pecuniary damage in an amount of up to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of [ A ] and up to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of [ B ] .", "An award of compensation for non - pecuniary damage is to be evaluated on the basis of a wide discretionary assessment of what would constitute a reasonable amount . Factors which are central in the assessment are the objective seriousness of the act , the extent to which the wrongdoer ( \u2018 skadevolder\u2019 ) is to be blamed and the damaging effects .", "This case concerns injury on very small children , from they were babies until [ A ] was DATE and [ B ] was DATE . The ill - treatment has occurred during a considerable part of the children \u2019s lives until it was revealed . At present [ B ] apparently manage well physically and has no physical ailments . However , in DATE he was diagnosed as suffering from post - traumatic stress syndrome . [ A ] was in part paralysed on one side and her development is far behind compared to that of other children of her age . Her injuries can be said to be permanent .", "Compensation for non - pecuniary damage in respect of [ A ] is to be awarded in an amount of ORG CARDINAL [ MONEY ( ORG ) ] and in respect of [ B ] in an amount of ORG CARDINAL [ approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ] .", "The decision on the civil claims is based on the less stringent evidentiary requirements than those applicable to criminal punishment .
