[ The applicant ] refuses to face his situation , does not want to change his conduct and distorts reality in such a way that he is never to blame for anything . In order for [ the applicant 's ] behaviour to change it is necessary for him to consult a psychiatrist . Having regard to his [ resistance thereto ] , the risk of him spreading the disease is obvious . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

He has had periods of extensive [ alcohol ] abuse as a consequence of learning that he was infected with HIV but also when he lost his job .

On DATE the county medical officer petitioned ORG anew for an extension of the applicant 's compulsory isolation . According to the record of a hearing held in camera on DATE , the applicant explained , among other things , the following :", "\u201c ... DATE he had had CARDINAL sexual relations per year . His partners were partly old acquaintances , partly new ones , whom he met in parks and so on . The boy , who was DATE when they met , took the initiative both emotionally and sexually . DATE [ the applicant ] realises that he infected the boy , which he finds very regrettable . A relative with psychiatric problems , with whom [ the applicant ] had had a longer sexual relationship , was likewise the initiator . While he was on the run from [ DATE until [ DATE , he had had no sexual relations . He had taken precautions against spreading the disease and , having had to visit physicians twice during his period at large , on both occasions he had informed them about his HIV infection . Mostly he had kept to himself . From DATE until DATE and from DATE until DATE , he had lived at a farm hostel and , during the periods in between , when the hostel was full , he had camped . He had spent his time shopping , cooking , watching TV , spending money on lottery games and drinking beer . He had drunk approximately CARDINAL strong beers DATE and never got drunk . He dreamt of living on his own in a flat , supporting himself on sickness benefit . He had lost all sexual desire and would in future have to decline all sexual relations . If he were to be exempted from compulsory isolation he would follow the instructions issued by the county medical officer . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The owner of the farm hostel gave evidence on the applicant 's behalf . The record of his statement reads , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] , under a pseudonym , had stayed at his farm hostel from DATE until DATE and from DATE until DATE . [ The owner ] had talked briefly with him DATE during those periods . [ The applicant ] had not bothered anybody and had not formed any personal relationships . He used to go shopping once a day , usually for beer , and [ the witness ] would estimate that he had drunk CARDINAL cans of beer every day ... [ The applicant ] had gone to GPE or GPE on a few occasions in order to deal with money matters ... However , in GPE he had primarily gone to the liquor store ... [ The witness ] could hardly imagine that [ the applicant ] had had any sexual relations while living at the hostel ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Also on the applicant 's behalf , an opinion was submitted by a chief physician , PERSON , on DATE regarding the applicant 's alcohol consumption . Having examined various laboratory tests performed since DATE in order to check the applicant 's liver , he found no divergent results . The most recent laboratory test , carried out on DATE , indicated that the applicant had a healthy liver .", "It was noted that subsequent to his return the applicant had been in contact with a chief physician and specialist in psychiatry , PERSON , who was not connected to the hospital .", "CARDINAL . A statement was submitted to the court by a consulting psychiatric chief physician , ORG , connected to the special care facility at the hospital to which the applicant had been admitted . After the applicant 's involuntary return , ORG had attempted to establish contact with him CARDINAL times , but in vain . He claimed that on the latest occasion , in DATE , the applicant had made a lunge at him . In PERSON 's view , the applicant had not made any positive progress since DATE , the date of ORG 's most recent official opinion regarding the applicant 's condition , in which he had , inter alia , made the following assessment :", "\u201c The applicant suffers from a paranoid personality disorder and from alcohol abuse . He is considered to be completely devoid of any sense of being ill and also lacks awareness . The combination of a sexual leaning towards younger men and a possible alcohol - related neuro - psychological functional impairment with , from time to time , a probably paranoid personality disorder , close to psychosis , and previous dangerous behaviour from the infection - spreading viewpoint , is deemed unfavourable . The chances of eliminating or limiting the continuous risk of the infection being spread by means of a prolonged placement in isolation in accordance with the LAW are deemed \u2013 all facts considered \u2013 to have not yet completely vanished . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Also submitted was a statement of DATE by ORG , a psychologist at the special care facility at the hospital who had met the applicant once . ORG found that the applicant was intellectually above average and that he appeared immature and fragile and showed signs of being suspicious and distrustful .", "CARDINAL . NORP The statement of the county medical officer , who gave evidence before the court , is recorded , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c During DATE when he was on the run , [ the applicant ] sought medical treatment twice and it has been established that both times he said that he had the HIV virus [ as opposed to the period when he absconded between DATE and DATE , during which he failed CARDINAL times to inform medical staff about his condition ] . Moreover , [ the applicant ] has [ finally ] accepted that he infected the young man with whom he had a long - lasting relationship from DATE , thus admitting that it was not the other way around . Also , he has agreed to sign a treatment plan and to consult CARDINAL physicians of his own choice ... These circumstances suggest the beginning of an improvement in [ the applicant 's ] attitude towards treatment . Nevertheless , it has not been established that [ the applicant ] has materially changed his attitude regarding the risk that he may spread the disease . He continues to show himself unable to accept the aid and support measures he is entitled to receive ; he has refused to consult the psychiatrist PERSON and the psychologist PERSON Moreover , having been in touch with the physicians whom [ the applicant ] has [ recently ] contacted voluntarily [ GPE and GPE ] , the county medical officer considers that these consultations were partly economically motivated [ on account of the fact that the applicant needed medical certificates in order to continue to receive sickness benefit ] , partly motivated by his wish to be declared mentally healthy , but [ not motivated ] by any willingness to commence treatment . During [ the applicant 's ] contact with the doctors in question , they did not discuss the risk of spreading the disease at all . A treatment plan was not formally signed [ by the applicant ] . In conclusion , in the county medical officer 's opinion , [ if released the applicant ] will not voluntarily comply with the instructions given or limit the spreading of the disease . \u201d", "As regards the laboratory tests concerning the applicant 's liver , the county medical officer found these to be of doubtful value , since they had been performed in connection with the compulsory isolation of the applicant at the hospital , but never in connection with a period of intoxication .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment , finding against the applicant for the following reasons :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] is HIV - positive and thus carries the HIV infection . He has been subjected to compulsory isolation since DATE and has during this period absconded from the hospital on several occasions \u2013 on the latest occasion for DATE . During DATE he did not have any contact with the county medical officer or the consulting physician . Periodically he has used a false name and has been living a very secluded life , obviously owing to the risk of being discovered . A life at liberty makes great demands upon the person carrying the infection . During the time preceding his compulsory isolation , [ the applicant ] was not able to follow the practical instructions issued . Subsequently , he has consistently declined the help offered by the consulting physician and the psychiatrist at the special care facility at the hospital and has instead responded with aversion and mistrust \u2013 and by escaping . [ The ORG ] finds that it has been difficult for [ the applicant ] to accept the information regarding the HIV infection and that he needs help in dealing with this critical situation . It appears from the evidence that [ the applicant ] still shows aversion to the treatment offered and that he is considered likely to abscond . [ The ORG ] has not been convinced that [ the applicant ] is not misusing alcohol and finds that , especially in connection with alcohol consumption , [ the applicant ] is likely to be unable to control his sexual behaviour . Against this background , [ the ORG ] finds that there is good reason to suppose that , if he remains free , [ the applicant ] will not comply with the practical instructions issued and that this entails a risk of the infection spreading . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again absconded , leaving his whereabouts unknown . In the meantime , he had appealed against the above judgment to ORG , before which he relied on an opinion of CARDINAL DATE by the aforementioned chief physician and specialist in psychiatry , GPE , which stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c The opinions [ by other psychiatrists and CARDINAL psychologist ] resulting from previous examinations were fairly unanimous in their conclusion that [ the applicant ] was a man with a paranoid personality disorder , who misused alcohol . ' ORG ' in psychiatric terms is defined as a maladaptive use of substances ... This diagnosis is to be distinguished from alcohol dependency , which means a compulsive use of alcohol with abstinence and social complications , and is more difficult to master . The diagnosis ' paranoid personality disorder ' is defined as a pervading suspiciousness and lack of trust in other people , whose motives are consistently perceived as malicious . It follows from the definition of ' paranoid personality disorder ' itself that this is manifest in the patient 's personality from the time he or she becomes an adult . Owing to the fact that the person in question perceives the disorder as part of his or her own self , the motivation for change is usually insufficient . It is not correct to talk in terms of lack of awareness of a disease , since it is not considered that a disease is involved but rather a variation in personality , although the latter may well cause complications in relations with other individuals and society . When such complications occur , an individual with a personality disorder may display different symptoms such as depression , anxiety , etc . In [ my ] interview with [ the applicant ] , the latter was fairly open and talkative . When he talked about experiences from his time at school , he displayed different emotions . He also showed empathy as far as other people from DATE were concerned . He was also partly able to shoulder responsibility for his own mistakes , without blaming others . However , he was very rigid in his interpretation of what had occurred in his adult life and particularly the events of DATE after he had been informed that he had the HIV virus in DATE . His attitude towards the county medical officer and the staff at the infection ward , whom he believed had kept harassing him unjustly , was almost hateful . [ The applicant ] felt that he had been subjected to persecution DATE . This could possibly be interpreted as a symptom of delusion . From DATE , he had not experienced feelings of persecution , inter alia since he had secured his own liberty . With regard to sexual relations , [ the applicant ] has stated that he preferred sexual contact with boys around DATE . He was not interested in pre - pubescent boys . He had been celibate since DATE and had no longer any particular sexual desires or fantasies . He was fully aware that he was carrying the HIV virus and was careful to stress that he was not afraid to die . His attitude towards medication against the HIV infection was negative . The reasons for this were that such medication could have side effects and perhaps , above all , because it would entail limitations on his freedom since he would be subjected to various check - ups . [ The applicant ] spontaneously expressed a wish to have further talks on a voluntary basis . When asked whether such talks could be part of a treatment plan in cooperation with the county medical officer and the staff at the infection ward , he answered ' no ' , the reason being that he would feel ashamed of himself if he were to give up this fight . \u201d", "In conclusion , PERSON , found that the applicant fulfilled the criteria for a paranoid personality disorder , and that , judging from previous information , the applicant suffered from misuse of alcohol but not from alcohol dependency . According to PERSON the applicant could be described in everyday terms as an odd person , but not as mentally ill . With regard to the risk that the applicant might pass on the HIV infection to other persons , PERSON believed that neither he nor anyone else could do anything but guess . The weightiest indications in this regard , however , ought to be deduced from the applicant 's behaviour during DATE he had spent at large .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE , ORG found against the applicant . Leave to appeal against the judgment was refused by ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Several applications for an extension of the applicant 's compulsory isolation were submitted by the county medical officer after DATE and granted , until on DATE an application was turned down by ORG , which referred to the fact that the applicant 's whereabouts were unknown and that therefore no information was available regarding his behaviour , state of health and so on .", "CARDINAL . It appears that DATE the applicant 's whereabouts have been known , but that the competent county medical officer has made the assessment that there are no grounds for the applicant 's further involuntary placement in isolation .", "CARDINAL .
