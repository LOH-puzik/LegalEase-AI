NORP In DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s house , car and premises used for commercial activities to be searched in view of the strong suspicion that he had been a member of a criminal group and had committed offences concerning property and documents .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was arrested and on DATE he was remanded in custody by ORG on suspicion of forging documents , financial fraud and membership of a criminal gang .

On DATE ORG upheld the decision to detain him .", "CARDINAL . NORP In decisions of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE the GPE ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention , holding that there was a contradiction between the applicant \u2019s statements and the evidence collected in the course of the proceedings . In addition , some documents had been forged and the prosecuting authorities could not yet identify all the perpetrators of the offences . The court made reference to the activities already carried out and gave a precise indication of the evidence that still had to be taken . Consequently , it decided that it was indispensable to separate the applicant from the other suspects and from the evidence which had not yet been secured . The court also relied on the serious nature of the charges against the applicant and the severity of the penalty he faced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the charges against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention was prolonged on DATE by ORG and subsequently by ORG on DATE .

Owing to the fact that many of the accused had entered into a plea bargain , the prosecutor filed a new bill of indictment and the hearings scheduled for CARDINAL , DATE and DATE were adjourned until DATE in order to give the accused the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the new bill .", "CARDINAL .

Meanwhile , the applicant \u2019s detention was prolonged on DATE and DATE ( an appeal by the applicant was dismissed on DATE ) , DATE and DATE . The court relied on the fear of collusion stemming from the fact that many of the witnesses had not yet given evidence and that the members of the criminal group had maintained close relations . In particular , the court stressed that during the preparatory proceedings the defendants had illegally tried to contact each other . In its last decision the court also stated that the applicant and another defendant had twice lodged applications to adjourn the hearings at which it was to take evidence from the former co - accused , who possessed the greatest knowledge about the GPE activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made an application to ORG under LAW of LAW , requesting the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention beyond the statutory time - limit of DATE .

On DATE ORG dismissed a second application by ORG for the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention . The appellate court held that ORG had failed to conclude the proceedings within the expected time - frame and that the applicant should not have to suffer the negative consequences of that fact . It further argued that the proceedings could be terminated in the course of the forthcoming hearings , given that there remained CARDINAL witness to be examined and that in the event of his absence his statements could be read out . On DATE an appeal by the prosecutor against that decision was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Hearings were held on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL .
