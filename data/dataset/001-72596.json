On DATE these orders became enforceable .", "On DATE ORG opened bankruptcy proceedings concerning the F company . This decision was published in the bankruptcy data base ( ORG ) in the internet on DATE .", "On DATE the applicants requested ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) to enforce the above - mentioned payment orders by selling the F company \u2019s movable property ( Fahrnisexekution ) and by granting the applicants a lien on outstanding accounts which the F company held against GPE , GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE ORG granted this application and ordered enforcement of the payment orders ( Exekutionsbewilligung ) under Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( Exekutionsordnung ) . It appears that ORG apparently disregarded LAW ( see Relevant domestic law and practice ) when it granted this request .", "On DATE ORG , GPE and GPE , who were debtors of the F company and against whom that company had outstanding claims , appealed against this decision . They submitted that the enforcement order was unlawful as bankruptcy proceedings against the F company had been opened on DATE and that , following the decision to open bankruptcy proceedings , they were no longer allowed to honour individual request for enforcement .

The court further noted that , according to relevant case - law and doctrine , it was for the person requesting an enforcement order to substantiate already in the application why enforcement under LAW should be admissible irrespective of the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings . In the present case , the applicants had not made such submissions in their applications . ORG had opened bankruptcy proceedings against the F company on CARDINAL DATE . This decision had been published in the bankruptcy data base ( ORG ) on DATE . The enforcement order had been issued only on DATE and was therefore unlawful . The court further noted that the applicants had filed their request for enforcement of the payment order on DATE , although bankruptcy proceedings had already been pending at this time . It therefore ordered them to reimburse the costs of the appeal proceedings , i.e. CARDINAL ORG to be paid by the first applicant , CARDINAL ORG to be paid by the second applicant , and CARDINAL ORG to be paid by the third applicant .", "The enforcement of judicial decisions is regulated by LAW ( Exekutionsordnung ) , which provides for the satisfaction of a pecuniary claim by seizure of individual assets of the debtor ( ORG ) .", "However , after the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings against the debtor , individual satisfaction of a creditor gives way to collective satisfaction on a quota basis of all creditors with pecuniary claims ( Generalexekution ) .
