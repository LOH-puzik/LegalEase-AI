Following an extradition hearing in GPE , in DATE the applicant was transported to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) decided to detain him on remand for DATE , until DATE . The court referred to the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he was charged and in respect of which he would face , if found guilty , deprivation of liberty for a term exceeding DATE . It further noted that there was a reasonable fear that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings or go into hiding until the charges against him became time - barred . The court pointed out that the applicant had not remained at his place of residence , had refused to accept a summons from the prosecutor and , although he was aware that an investigation was being carried out in respect of him , he had moved to GPE in DATE with a view to waiting until the charges that had been brought against him became time - barred ; consequently , the proceedings against him had had to be stayed for DATE .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s state of health the court found that \u201c the problems cited by the applicant do not require any medical treatment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was extended until DATE . The court again referred to the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he was charged and on the severity of the penalty to which he would be liable if found guilty . It further noted that there was a reasonable fear that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings or go into hiding . In this respect the court referred to the fact that the applicant had moved to GPE on a previous occasion and had had to be located by means of an international search .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , referring , among other things , to his state of health . He submitted that he was suffering from serious neurological and orthopaedic problems which , if not treated properly , would pose a serious danger to his health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) upheld the challenged decision , confirming ORG view that the detention had been justified by the severe penalty and the possibility that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings . As regards the applicant \u2019s state of health the court referred to CARDINAL medical experts\u2019 opinions dated DATE and DATE respectively , according to which the applicant could be treated in the detention facilities and was able to participate in the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the relevant bill of indictment was submitted to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention for a further DATE , until DATE .

Lastly , the court stated that there were \u201c no grounds for releasing the applicant from detention ... in particular , [ there were none of the grounds listed ] in Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Proceedings \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG again extended the applicant \u2019s detention for further DATE . Apart from the grounds previously relied on , the court noted that the applicant had requested that several new witnesses be heard and considered that he might influence their testimony if released . The court considered that the applicant \u2019s declarations that he would appear before the court upon each and every summons did not correspond with his previous behaviour . It noted that on DATE the applicant had resisted being taken to the court . According to the ORG \u2019s submissions he had refused to be taken to the court without a wheelchair which had been provided by his wife . Lastly , the court determined , relying on the opinion of an expert neurologist and orthopaedist , that the applicant could be treated in detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He referred , among other things , to his state of health , the fact that he had to use a wheelchair , that he was waiting for a spine operation and that he could not undergo physiotherapy under conditions of detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the challenged decision relying , as previously , on the fact that in the past the applicant had gone into hiding . The court also found that the applicant had again obstructed the proceedings in that he had refused to be transported to the court hearing without a wheelchair .

The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the challenged decision . As regards the applicant \u2019s state of health , the court , relying on a physician expert opinion of DATE , considered that there were no obstacles to his further detention and his treatment in the prison facilities . The court noted that if the applicant \u2019s further detention threatened his health he could be released at any time ex officio .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant underwent a medical examination ordered by ORG . The applicant arrived for the examination in a wheelchair , from which he could not get up .

The doctor also ordered a further examination of the applicant , which took place on DATE . On DATE a fresh opinion was delivered , the relevant part of which reads as follows :", "\u201c There are obstacles to [ an extension of the ] stay of the applicant in FAC because he can not receive neurological treatment there ... the results of the electromyography examination ( ORG ) show a gradually worsening ] dysfunction of the peripheral nerves ... which qualifies the applicant for neurological surgery that can only be executed in a neurological ward . After the operation and rehabilitation treatment , depending on his neurological state , the patient will be able to continue his detention in the GPE detention centre \u201d .", "The doctor further stated that an objective assessment of the neurological state of the applicant was not possible due to his lack of cooperation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer requested that ORG lift the preventive measure applied to the applicant and to release him from detention . The lawyer referred to the applicant \u2019s state of health . He referred , among other things , to the fact that ORG had to order breaks in hearings because the applicant had to rest \u201c in a horizontal position \u201d . He also requested that the court order a further examination of the applicant by a specialist in neurology .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s lawyer \u2019s requests .

On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , upheld the challenged decision . The court held that ORG , which made a decision in first instance in composition of single judge , had been aware of the applicant \u2019s state of health and that this matter had been taken into account each time his detention had been extended . Apparently , the court had not yet become aware of the medical expert opinion of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting ex officio , released the applicant and imposed another preventive measure on him , namely that of police supervision . The court found that the grounds originally relied on to impose and extend the applicant \u2019s detention , in particular the risk that he might go into hiding , still existed . However , given the applicant \u2019s state of health , his release was necessary . The court referred to a medical opinion which was completed and issued on DATE ( see above ) . It was determined that the only neurological ward in which the applicant could be treated in detention was at ORG . The applicant , however , refused to agree to be operated on there . He undertook at the same time that if he were to be released , he would undergo such an operation once he was at liberty .

However , since the chair which he received in the detention centre was , according to his submission , in such a state that its use constituted a danger for persons using it , the applicant requested his wife to provide him with another wheelchair ; this she did , on DATE , with the approval of the prison authorities . The ORG submitted that the approval was granted for \u201c social reasons \u201d although there were no medical grounds for so doing . However , the applicant submitted copies of CARDINAL medical certificates dated DATE , together with a note made by a psychiatrist , which read :", "\u201c The patient collapsed in the corridor ( lost consciousness ? ) ...
