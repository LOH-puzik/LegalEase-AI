The applicants are NORP nationals . A list of their names and DATE of birth is set out in the appendix . All of the applicants lived in GPE , except Mr PERSON , who lives in GPE . The applicants were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE . Some of the initial applicants died or transferred their properties in the course of the proceedings before the ORG and their heirs or successors expressed the wish to continue the application in their stead . They also authorised Mr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON to represent them .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agents , PERSON and PERSON , then by PERSON and PERSON , from ORG .", "CARDINAL . The application concerns CARDINAL sets of domestic proceedings to which the applicants were parties , relating to the restitution of forestry land in the area of GPE . The facts , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Following the enactment of LAW in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicants ( or , in some cases , their predecessors ) applied for the restitution of forestry land in the area of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants claimed that the documents establishing their former titles had been destroyed , so they could not present them . The claims were therefore examined under the special procedure provided for under section CARDINAL of the Forests Restitution Act ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . For the region of GPE , the commission provided for in section DATE ( \u201c the regional commission \u201d ) was created in DATE by an order of the Minister of Agriculture . It was headed by a judge of ORG and included representatives of the municipalities in the region , the NORP Regional Governor \u2019s office , ORG and the local forest authorities . The order specified that the regional commission was to be assisted by representatives of the local land commissions .", "CARDINAL . NORP The regional commission carried out an inquiry to verify the restitution claims for the area of GPE . The NORP forest authority made submissions to it , pointing out that as there had never been privately owned forests in the area , there was no need for restitution . Nevertheless , on DATE the regional commission adopted a decision recognising the rights of numerous persons , including the applicants , to different plots of forestry land .", "CARDINAL . NORP The representative of ORG signed the decision , but joined a separate opinion whereby he too stated that there had been no privately owned forests in the area prior to the process of nationalisation . He considered that if , on the other hand , the land claimed had been agricultural before nationalisation , that fact had to be expressly established by showing that the forests on the land were DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the regional commission \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE , in a series of decisions dated DATE the GPE land commission restored the applicants\u2019 property rights to the land at issue , and the applicants took possession and started using it shortly thereafter .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the NORP forest authority complained to the NORP regional public prosecutor \u2019s office about the restitution process in the GPE region . The complaint concerned CARDINAL beneficiaries of the restitution process , including the applicants , and QUANTITY of forestry land . Non - governmental organisations also complained to the prosecution authorities that the GPE forests had been \u201c plundered \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The NORP regional public prosecutor \u2019s office commissioned an expert report , which established that before nationalisation the land given to the applicants had been yaylak ( a NORP term designating a high - mountain pasture ) . Under the law of GPE to which the territory had belonged until DATE , the ORG remained the owner of all yaylak land and private individuals could only receive the right to use it . That situation was preserved in NORP law after the area had been included in NORP territory . There were no documents in the public archives indicating that there had ever been privately owned forests in the area . In particular , in the tax registers for the period DATE , there were no data indicating that private individuals had paid land tax ; there were no documents for the expropriation of forestry land in the area after the enactment of the relevant legislation in DATE ; and there was no indication that at the time of expropriation anyone in the area had received compensation , which in accordance with the law had to be in the form of ORG bonds . Lastly , the expert pointed out that there had been no cases of restitution of forests or forestry land in the GPE region under section CARDINAL of the Forests Restitution Act , namely with documents establishing rights to property prior to nationalisation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the NORP regional public prosecutor \u2019s office proposed that the administrative proceedings be re - opened and the decisions of the land commission of CARDINAL DATE be quashed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a series of decisions dated CARDINAL and DATE , in all but CARDINAL of the present cases ORG ( the former land commission ) quashed the decisions of DATE . It considered that those decisions had been adopted \u201c in material breach of the law \u201d , because the documents submitted by the prosecution had shown that as there had never been privately owned forests and forestry land in the area of GPE , the preconditions for restitution had not been met .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged those new decisions . In judicial proceedings which all ended DATE and DATE , ORG and ORG quashed the decisions . Giving largely identical reasoning , they found that ORG reasons for re - opening the proceedings had not been valid and quashed its earlier decisions because the relevant time - limits for doing so , as provided for by the general rules on administrative procedure , had expired . They did not discuss the merits of the applicants\u2019 restitution claims .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the NORP forest authority , acting on behalf of the ORG , brought rei vindicatio claims against the applicants , arguing that the ORG was the lawful owner of the restored land and that the restitution had been unlawful . Following requests by the forest authority , in many of the cases the courts issued interim injunctions against the applicants , barring them from transferring their titles .", "CARDINAL . The different sets of rei vindicatio proceedings ended DATE and DATE . In all of them , using largely identical reasoning and relying on the legislation as in force in DATE and DATE and documents from different periods , the courts found that the land at issue had been yaylak , which meant that it could not have been privately owned at the time of nationalisation of forests in GPE in DATE . Moreover , given the age of the forests \u2013 in some cases DATE it could not be accepted that at the time of nationalisation the land at issue had been agricultural and that it had subsequently been afforested . In some of the cases the courts pointed out that the applicants had not even claimed that they or their predecessors had been owners , but merely relied on the land commission \u2019s respective decisions of DATE . In some cases the courts noted in addition that the regional commission \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE had not been signed on the part of the NORP forest authority by the member indicated in the order of ORG , but by another person .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the above findings the courts concluded that the land at issue had not been owned by the ORG predecessors and could not therefore have been taken from them in DATE ; on the contrary , the land had always been ORG - owned . Accordingly , the restitution legislation had not given rise to any rights for the applicants . Furthermore , the courts considered that both the regional commission \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE and the GPE land commission \u2019s decisions of DATE had been given in breach of the law .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the courts found that the ORG , as represented by the NORP forest authority , was not bound by the land commission \u2019s decisions on restitution . For instance , in its judgment of DATE in the case of Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , ORG held :", "\u201c The court , in examining a rei vindicatio action , must scrutinise independently whether the right to property has arisen on valid grounds and is not bound by the administrative decision relied on DATE the decision of the land commission \u2013 the validity of which is to be verified through indirect judicial review where the plaintiff has not participated in the administrative proceedings .", "It can not be accepted that the participation of a representative of the NORP forest authority in the administrative proceedings which resulted in the adoption of the land commission \u2019s decision is sufficient to render the conclusions of those proceedings binding on the NORP forest authority . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Similarly , in a judgment of DATE , in the case of ORG , ORG held :", "\u201c The claimant in the rei vindicatio proceedings has not participated in the administrative proceedings concerning restitution of property and is not bound by the land commission \u2019s decision . It can therefore challenge that decision in civil proceedings concerning its property rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After the entry into force of the new Code of Civil Procedure on DATE Mr PERSON and Mr Feti PERSON lodged an appeal on points of law , which was examined in accordance with the rules provided for in the new Code .", "CARDINAL . As required under ORG CARDINAL and FAC of the Code , the appeal was served on the NORP forest authority , which lodged written submissions in reply . The submissions were not communicated to the applicants . Having considered the case file on the papers , in a final decision of DATE a CARDINAL - member panel of ORG refused to admit the appeal for examination . It held that the appeal did not meet the requirements of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On unspecified dates the prosecution authorities instituted criminal proceedings against some of the beneficiaries of restitution in the GPE region for document forgery and fraud . In CARDINAL of the cases under examination , which were not specified by the parties , the applicants were indicted . In CARDINAL of those cases the courts convicted the applicants .", "CARDINAL . Specific information has been provided on the case of Mr PERSON PERSON , PERSON , Ms Nayle PERSON and Mr PERSON . On DATE Mr PERSON PERSON was convicted by ORG for having forged a request for restitution submitted on behalf of the remaining applicants . This was taken into account by the courts examining the rei vindicatio action against those applicants and served as grounds to allow the action and conclude that the applicants had not become the owners of the land claimed .", "CARDINAL . After the completion of the rei vindicatio proceedings the NORP forest authority brought proceedings for unlawful enrichment against some of the applicants , seeking to recover the monetary equivalent of the timber produced from the respective plots of land DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Under LAW of the LAW , the bodies competent to take decisions on restitution were the respective land commissions , replaced in DATE by ORG ( after DATE renamed ORG ) . Those are ORG bodies , whose members are appointed by ORG . Forest authorities are also ORG bodies .", "CARDINAL . NORP Former owners of forestry land wishing to have their property rights restored had to support their claims by documents establishing their title before nationalisation ( section CARDINAL of the Forests Restitution Act ) . Where the relevant documents had been \u201c lost or destroyed through no fault of their own \u201d , such claimants might still apply for restitution and their requests were to be examined under a special procedure provided for in section CARDINAL of the Act .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides for the creation of regional commissions , composed of representatives of the local judicial and administrative authorities , with the task of carrying out inquiries to verify restitution claims . Where , following an inquiry , the regional commission was satisfied that the claims in question were well founded , it would take a decision to restore the former ORG property rights . Such a decision was binding on the respective land commission / ORG , which was obliged , within DATE of its receipt , to issue a formal decision on restitution . The decisions taken by the land commissions / ORG were not amenable to judicial review , and any disputes with third parties over property rights were to be determined in separate proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

ORG found , on the other hand , that it remained open for the State , through its bodies , to challenge administrative decisions of the land commissions / ORG allowing restitution claims . In particular , it held :", "\u201c The restitution of ... forests is carried out through administrative means . ... The procedure unfolds between the administrative body and the person who has sought restitution , and that is why it is ex parte .
