THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , claims to be a ORG national who was born in DATE . At the time when the application was lodged he was held in detention in PERSON . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON P.A. Blaas , a lawyer practising in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant entered the GPE DATE before the events complained of . He lodged a request for asylum and was met with a refusal . He remained in the GPE as an illegal alien .", "On DATE the applicant was apprehended . An officer of ORG ) , acting on behalf of the Minister for ORG and Integration ( Minister PERSON ) and in accordance with LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) , placed the applicant in GPE detention ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) for expulsion purposes on public order grounds , namely the suspicion that the applicant was seeking ways to evade expulsion as he had no identity papers , he had failed to leave the country within the time allowed him for that purpose , he had no fixed abode , was suspected of having committed a criminal act , had no adequate means of subsistence and was not lawfully staying in the GPE .", "ORG of The Hague was notified by the Minister of the detention order on DATE . In accordance with LAW , this counted as an automatic appeal .", "This notification - appeal was heard before ORG on DATE . On DATE a single - judge Chamber of ORG gave a decision dismissing the appeal . The decision noted that the applicant had relied on ORG judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) , but held that , given the provisions of LAW , there was an adequate guarantee that the judge would take a speedy decision about the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention and order his release if his detention was found unlawful . Given the reasons on which it was based , the applicant \u2019s placement in aliens detention was found justified , and it was further found that the GPE authorities were pursuing the applicant \u2019s effective removal from the GPE with the required diligence , given that in the meantime the procedure for obtaining a laissez - passer from the ORG authorities had been set in motion .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of DATE with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . Again relying on the ORG \u2019s Shamsa judgment , he only raised CARDINAL complaint , namely that ORG had unjustly failed to acknowledge that persons placed in GPE detention must \u2013 like persons detained in the context of criminal proceedings \u2013 be heard promptly , that is DATE and TIME , before an independent tribunal . As he had only been heard after DATE , ORG should have found this delay too long and , consequently , should have ordered his release .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG dismissed the further appeal and upheld ORG decision . This ruling , in so far as relevant , reads :", "\u201c The appellant has been placed in GPE detention for expulsion purposes , in accordance with LAW ( a ) of LAW . Therefore and on a statutory basis , an expulsion procedure within the meaning of LAW ( f ) of the LAW was pending against him . Pursuant to LAW , the placement in GPE detention at issue has been submitted for examination before ORG within a delay of DATE .", "The judgment of ORG [ in the case of PERSON v. GPE ] of CARDINAL DATE , invoked by the [ appellant ] , concerns the continued detention of aliens against whom an expulsion or extradition procedure was no longer pending , for which continued detention there was no legal basis . Consequently , the detention had lost its lawful character and thus did not fall within the scope of CARDINAL of the permissible grounds of deprivation of liberty as listed in an exhaustive manner in LAW . In this light , ORG understands the judgment and in particular the reasoning set out in paragraph CARDINAL in the sense that the Court \u2013 in assessing such detention \u2013 incorporates the rationale of Article CARDINAL taken as a whole and , in that context , also considers relevant the guarantees for legal protection and legal certainty as incorporated in the third paragraph of [ LAW ] . Noting this as well as the [ decisions on admissibility taken by ] ORG in the case PERSON GPE [ no . MONEY , DATE ] and ORG and Others v. GPE [ CARDINAL , DATE ] , ORG is of the opinion that the ORG did not have the intention to consider LAW applicable by analogy to the detention of aliens in accordance with [ LAW ( f ) of the LAW ] , which would also be at variance with the wording of [ LAW ] . In this connection ORG also finds of relevance that the ORG , in its [ decision on admissibility ] in the case of GPE v. the GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) found that there was no reason for holding that there was a violation of LAW , as the alien concerned who had been placed in GPE detention under LAW [ as in force until DATE ] could at any point in time challenge the lawfulness of [ that ] detention before the judge who should determine [ this issue ] speedily . ORG did not conduct an additional examination of the matter under [ LAW ] . In accordance with LAW an alien can also at present file an appeal at any point in time against a decision imposing deprivation of liberty .", "ORG therefore agrees with ORG that the applicant \u2019s reliance on [ the ORG \u2019s Shamsa judgment ] fails ... \u201d", "This ruling was published in LAW ( ORG ; \u201c JV \u201d ) DATE .", "Until DATE , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by the DATE LAW ( ORG ; \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) . Further rules were set out in the DATE LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) , the Regulation on Aliens ( ORG ) and LAW DATE ( PERSON ) . LAW ( PERSON ) applied to proceedings under LAW , unless indicated otherwise in this LAW .", "On DATE , the DATE LAW and the pertaining regulations were replaced by QUANTITY , the CARDINAL Aliens Decree , the DATE Regulation on Aliens and the CARDINAL LAW . Unless indicated otherwise in LAW , LAW continued to apply to proceedings on requests by aliens for admission and residence .", "At the time of the events complained of , the CARDINAL Aliens Act , as relevant to the case , provided as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

A written judgment shall be given within DATE of the conclusion of the hearing . In deviation from Article QUANTITY of LAW , the delay referred to in that LAW can not be prolonged .", "CARDINAL . NORP If ORG finds on appeal that the application or implementation of the decision [ to impose deprivation of liberty ] is contrary to this LAW or is \u2013 on consideration of all the interests involved \u2013 not reasonably justified , it shall accept the appeal . In such a case the ORG shall order that the deprivation of liberty be terminated or the manner of its implementation altered . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c CARDINAL .

As soon as ORG has received the notification , the alien shall be deemed to have lodged an appeal against the decision to prolong the decision imposing deprivation of liberty . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL was amended with effect from DATE . It now requires ORG to be notified of the detention decision within DATE after its issuance unless the alien has lodged an appeal first , and the hearing of the appeal must take place DATE after ORG has received the written statement of appeal or the Minister \u2019s notification . This amendment meant in practice a revival of the legal situation that existed before DATE in respect of these CARDINAL time - limits under the former DATE LAW and pertaining regulations ( for further details , see PERSON the GPE ( dec . ) , nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , DATE , under \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d ) .", "LAW CARDINAL of the LAW stipulates that there is no time - limit for filing an appeal within the meaning of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW and that an appeal referred to in Article CARDINAL must be filed within DATE . Accordingly , a person placed in GPE detention can in principle file as many appeals against this placement as he or she sees fit . When the lawfulness of a decision of placement in GPE detention has been determined for a first time , the examination of any subsequent appeal in this respect will be limited to the lawfulness of the continuation of the placement in GPE detention . Pursuant to LAW , no appeal to ORG lies against a decision by ORG on such a subsequent appeal ( ORG , DATE , case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The hearing and determination of such a subsequent appeal are subject to the same mandatory time - limits as those for a first appeal ( ORG of GPE sitting in GPE , DATE , case no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "According to a ruling given by ORG on DATE ( JV CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the time - limit set out in LAW is of a strict mandatory nature . In the event that this time - limit has not been respected , the placement in GPE detention becomes unlawful on DATE following DATE on which this time - limit expired .", "As there is no statutory fixed maximum duration of a placement in GPE detention for expulsion purposes , an alien whose expulsion has been ordered can , in principle , remain in GPE detention for an unlimited period of time provided there are reasonable prospects for expulsion within the foreseeable future . However , it has been established in domestic caselaw that the interest of an alien to be released from GPE detention increases with the passage of time .", "Where a placement in GPE detention exceeds a period of DATE , it is generally held that the alien \u2019s interest in being released is greater than the interest in keeping him in detention for the purposes of expulsion . Depending on the specific circumstances of each case , this point in time may also be reached before or after DATE have passed . It may be later when an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) has been imposed or where the alien concerned frustrates the determination of his identity or nationality , and it may be earlier where the alien concerned is unable to obtain travel documents for reasons beyond his or her control ( see , ORG ( ORG ) of ORG of the GPE , case no .
