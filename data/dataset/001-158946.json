The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant took up the position of pastor in ORG ( ORG ) . As of DATE , he served in the parish of ORG . His rights and obligations as well as his remuneration were set out in an appointment letter ( lelk\u00e9szi d\u00edjlev\u00e9l ) issued by the parish presbyters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed that disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against him for stating in a local newspaper that ORG subsidies had been paid unlawfully to a NORP boarding school . Meanwhile , on DATE the first - instance ecclesiastical court had suspended the applicant \u2019s service with immediate effect until a decision on the merits , for a maximum of DATE . The applicant received a letter stating that he was entitled , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Statute no . I of DATE of ORG , to PERCENT of his service allowance during the period of his suspension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance ecclesiastical court removed the applicant from service , as a disciplinary measure . On an unspecified date , the second - instance ecclesiastical court upheld that decision and terminated the applicant \u2019s service with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant took his case to ORG , seeking the payment of PERCENT of his service allowance and other benefits to which , in his view , he should have been entitled during the period of his suspension . Arguing that his suspension had reached its statutory maximum duration on DATE , he also sought the payment of the whole service allowance from that date until the termination of his service , that is , DATE . He argued in substance that his ecclesiastical service was analogous to employment , referring to tax rules to that effect ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued ( megsz\u00fcntette ) the proceedings , holding that it had no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the applicant \u2019s claim . It considered that under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Statute no . I of DATE of ORG , ORG service with the ORG was regulated by ecclesiastical rules , whereas laymen \u2019s employment with the ORG was governed by ORG . Accordingly , since the dispute before it concerned the applicant \u2019s service as a pastor , the provisions of LAW were not applicable in the case , and there existed no judicial avenue before the ORG courts to decide on his claims .", "The Pest County Regional Court upheld the decision on appeal on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant did not apply for a review to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a civil - law claim against ORG . His claim was based in the first place on sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of the [ old ] Civil Code and on the agency contract he had allegedly concluded with the ORG . He maintained that for the period from DATE ( that is , the date when the suspension allegedly became unlawful ) until DATE ( that is , the date of termination of his appointment ) he was entitled to a fee for his services , which corresponded to the service allowance set out in his appointment letter . He thus sought enforcement of the contract . Alternatively , he based his claim on sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of the [ old ] Civil Code and on the breach by ORG its contractual obligations under the agency contract . He argued that by not paying him the allowance due for the period DATE and DATE , the ORG had failed to fulfil its contractual obligations . He thus claimed damages , amounting to the loss of service allowances to which he would have been entitled under the contract for the above - mentioned period .", "CARDINAL . The Pest Central District Court dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim on the grounds that no contractual relationship had been established between the parties under civil law . In the court \u2019s view , the claim had no basis in civil law . It therefore did not embark on an assessment of the applicant \u2019s secondary claims , such as liability for breach of contract or recognition of debt .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the first - instance decision on appeal , reasoning that ORG had no standing in the proceedings , since the applicant had been appointed by the parish of ORG , a separate legal entity .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a petition for review with ORG . By its decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG quashed the final decision and discontinued ( megsz\u00fcntette ) the proceedings . It stated as follows :", "\u201c ... In order to determine the rules applicable to the agreement ( meg\u00e1llapod\u00e1s ) in question and to the implementation of the rights and obligations arising from it , it is necessary to have regard to the very purpose of the agreement underlying the plaintiff \u2019s actual claim as well as the elements thereof defining the parties\u2019 rights and obligations . The first - instance court rightly stated in its assessment that the agreement serving as the basis of the applicant \u2019s claim was not an agency contract regulated by civil law or concluded by and between parties enjoying personal autonomy in the marketing of [ goods and services ] . The plaintiff was appointed as a pastor in an ecclesiastical procedure , and the obligations of the respondent were defined in an appointment letter by the assembly of presbyters . The parties established between themselves a pastoral service relationship , regulated by ecclesiastical law .", "Under LAW ) of Act no . DATE on Freedom of Conscience and Religion and on Churches , the ORG is separated from the ORG . Under sub - section ( CARDINAL ) , no State coercion can be used to enforce the internal laws and regulations of Churches .", "Relying on the above provisions , the applicant can make a claim under the ecclesiastical law before the relevant bodies of ORG . The fact that the agreement concluded under ecclesiastical law resembles a contractual agreement under LAW does not prompt ORG jurisdiction or the enforceability of the claim in a judicial procedure within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW . ( In the given case the basic elements of an agency contract and the conclusion of such a contract could not be established either . )", "The labour court reached the same conclusion in the earlier proceedings when assessing the claim under the ORG labour law and dismissing its enforcement in judicial proceedings .", "The first - instance court was right to point out that as the impugned agreement lacked a civil - law legal basis , the court could not examine the applicant \u2019s secondary claim ( compensation for breach of contract ) . On the basis of the reasoning above , there were no grounds to adjudicate on the claim on the merits .", "ORG accordingly quashes the final judgment , including the firstinstance judgment , and discontinues the proceedings under sections CARDINAL ) ( a ) and CARDINAL ( a ) of the Code of Civil Procedure ... \u201d", "This decision was served on the applicant at some point in time after DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
