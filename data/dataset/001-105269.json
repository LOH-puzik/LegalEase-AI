The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG . He is retired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he lodged a criminal complaint against ORG , claiming that she had stolen certain items from his flat . He stated that ORG regularly came to his flat to clean it and that on DATE she had removed several items of jewellery and clothing from his flat . He had only realised in DATE that those items had disappeared from his flat .", "CARDINAL . The case was heard by ORG , which delivered its first - instance judgment on DATE finding ORG guilty and sentencing her to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended . ORG was ordered to pay the applicant damages of MONEY ( ROL \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) at the time ) , representing the estimated value of the stolen items , and ORG ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in legal fees . ORG based its decision on the statements of the parties and of CARDINAL witnesses . According to CARDINAL of the witnesses , the applicant had complained to him in DATE that several items were missing from his flat . According to the second witness , in DATE the defendant had shown him several items of jewellery and clothing , mentioning that she had received them as a gift from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by ORG and the judgment of DATE thus became final and enforceable .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the Prosecutor General of GPE lodged an extraordinary appeal ( recurs in anulare ) against the judgment of DATE . ORG argued that ORG had been wrongfully convicted , as none of the evidence adduced was conclusive as to her guilt . This had led to a breach of her right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty . The prosecutor also indicated that ORG had submitted CARDINAL pieces of evidence as part of her defence which had been ignored in the ordinary proceedings . CARDINAL of the documents was a request lodged by the applicant to the ORG association in which he sought an exemption from utility costs for DATE , when he would be away in GPE . This document was relevant , as the applicant stated that ORG entered his flat only when he was there and he had declared that the items had been stolen on the exact date of DATE , when , according to that document , he was not in GPE . The second document was a report of a search conducted by the police at the home of the defendant , which indicated that none of the items claimed to have been stolen from the applicant \u2019s flat had been found there .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG allowed the extraordinary appeal , quashed the judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , acquitted ORG and relieved her of the obligation to pay the applicant compensation for the stolen items and the legal costs .", "The court held that the prior conviction had been based on the statements of CARDINAL witnesses who declared that they knew that ORG was doing housework for the applicant , that he owned the items mentioned in his criminal complaint and that after DATE some of the items were seen by CARDINAL of the witnesses in the house of ORG Nevertheless , the court indicated that these statements were contradicted by the evidence in the case file indicating that the applicant had been away from GPE DATE and DATE . Furthermore , taking into account that he had always stated that ORG only did housework in his flat when he was there , the court indicated that his submission that he had not noticed ORG leaving the flat with so many items was not credible .", "The court further concluded that the evidence adduced in the case was both contradictory and inconclusive in respect of the date the alleged theft was committed and of whether the defendant had committed the theft . It therefore quashed the earlier decisions on the ground that they had not been lawful and acquitted ORG of all charges , relieving her also of the obligation to pay compensation for the stolen items and for the court costs incurred by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant attended the hearing and submitted his arguments in support of his claims .", "CARDINAL .
