NORP In DATE the ORG took possession of the applicant \u2019s GPE house in GPE , allegedly under Decree no . CARDINAL on nationalisation . The applicant \u2019s parents were never informed of the grounds or legal basis for that deprivation of property . They were , however , allowed to continue to live in CARDINAL of the flats in the house as tenants of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , pursuant to Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the ORG sold the Mirescu brothers the flat which they had hitherto occupied as tenants . The intervener , Mr PERSON , and his sister , ORG , inherited the flat in DATE . After his sister \u2019s death in DATE the intervener was left as the sole successor in title to the flat .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , as the beneficiary of his GPE estate , brought an action in ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) seeking a declaration that the nationalisation was null and void on the ground that Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL provided that the property of employees could not be nationalised and his parents had been employed at the time of the nationalisation of their house . It is not clear from the documents before the ORG whether the applicant informed ORG of the sale by the ORG to the Mirescu brothers in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG held that the nationalisation of the applicant \u2019s GPE house under Decree no . ORG had been a mistake , as his parents had belonged to a category of persons whose property the decree exempted from nationalisation . The court went on to hold that the ORG had obtained possession by duress and so could not rely on prescription to establish title . It also ruled that the ORG could not have acquired title to the house under Decree no . TIME or Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL since those instruments had been contrary to LAW and DATE respectively . The court therefore ordered the administrative authorities DATE namely the mayor of GPE and a ORG - owned company , ORG , which managed ORG - owned housing DATE to return the house to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final and irreversible since it could no longer be challenged by way of an ordinary appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mayor of GPE ordered the house to be returned to the applicant and on DATE the C. company complied .", "CARDINAL . As of that date the applicant ceased to pay rent on the flat he was occupying in the house .", "CARDINAL . The applicant began paying land tax on the house on DATE and continued doing so until DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date the Procurator - General of GPE , acting at the instance of Mr PERSON , lodged an application ( recurs \u00een anulare ) with ORG to have the judgment of DATE quashed on the grounds that ORG had exceeded its jurisdiction in examining the lawfulness of the application of Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The hearing before ORG was set down for DATE . Mr PERSON was not invited to take part in the proceedings . On DATE of the hearing , the applicant requested an adjournment as his lawyer was absent through illness .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused that request and proceeded to hear oral argument , after which it reserved judgment until DATE , the applicant being ordered to file written submissions before that date .", "CARDINAL . In those submissions , the applicant requested ORG to dismiss PERSON application . He argued , first , that Decree no . ORG had been incompatible with the DATE LAW , both in that it had been published only in part and in that it had breached the principle that no expropriation should be effected save in the public interest and after payment of fair compensation . Secondly , he submitted that , since his parents had been employees at the time of the nationalisation , the decision to nationalise their house had contravened the terms of the decree , which provided that dwellings belonging to employees could not be nationalised . Lastly , the applicant relied on LAW of DATE , which guarantees unrestricted access to the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It held that property could be acquired by way of legislation , noted that the ORG had taken the house on DATE on which Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on nationalisation had come into force and reiterated that the manner in which that decree had been applied could not be reviewed by the courts . Accordingly , ORG could not have found that the applicant was the rightful owner of the house without distorting the provisions of the decree , thus exceeding its powers and encroaching on those of the legislature . ORG confirmed that former owners were entitled to bring actions for recovery of possession but held that the applicant in the case before it had not established his title , whereas the ORG had demonstrated title under the nationalisation decree . In any event , provision as to redress for any wrongful seizure of property by the ORG would have to be made in new legislation .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon , the tax authorities informed the applicant that the house would be reclassified as ORG property with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an application for restitution with the administrative board established to deal with applications lodged in GPE pursuant to Law no . DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . He submitted that he had been dispossessed of his house in DATE in breach of Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on nationalisation ; that ORG had held that that deprivation of property had been unlawful in a final judgment of DATE ; and that he was therefore entitled to be reinstated as the owner of the whole house .", "CARDINAL . In a report drawn up in DATE the valuation board established under PERSON no . NORP valued the applicant \u2019s house at MONEY ( ROL ) , of which the flat occupied by the applicant accounted for ROL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL , which put a ceiling on compensation , and to the ceiling applicable in DATE \u2013 ROL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL \u2013 the ORG awarded him ROL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged that decision in ORG , attacking the ORG \u2019s refusal to return the whole house to him and pointing out that no grounds for that refusal had been given . He argued that in his case , where there had been an unlawful deprivation of property , PERSON no . DATE which concerned lawful expropriations \u2013 did not apply . Accordingly , his only means of protecting his right of property was an action for recovery of possession . However , since he had already brought such an action , and since ORG , in a final judgment of DATE , had held him to be the owner of the house , he believed himself to be debarred from bringing a fresh action for recovery of possession . Consequently , he sought a declaration that he was the owner of the whole house and stated that he was not seeking compensation under PERSON no . LANGUAGE .", "CARDINAL .
