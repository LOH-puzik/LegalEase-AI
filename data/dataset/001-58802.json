On DATE Professor NORP , a doctor at ORG , examined C. and found that he presented post - traumatic ecchymosis caused by DATE in the home where he had been placed . On DATE he said in a letter to the investigating judge that it was \u201c possible that the child presented a propensity to major haematomic reaction to moderate trauma and [ that it was ] quite possible that that propensity had ... led to the degree of trauma being over - estimated during the child 's CARDINAL stays in hospital that had resulted in the public prosecutor 's office being informed . ... \u201d .

In a judgment of DATE the children 's judge extended the period of C. 's placement with the ORG for a year starting on DATE .

The father refuses to speak with the social workers .", "... the father lodged a report by a forensic expert in the criminal proceedings with the court . In addition to containing an opinion on whether the abuse was intentional or not ( a matter for the judge dealing with the criminal proceedings ) , it refers to the psychological trauma suffered by the child as a result of his separation from his mother and to the child 's need to live in a home , as the father is unable in his present condition to assume both the paternal and maternal roles .", "... those circumstances make it necessary to continue with protective measures , while it is hoped that relations between the father and the social services will improve through mutual acceptance .", "... It does , however , appear necessary for the child 's development to facilitate contact with the father by making it more extensive than the child - welfare service has currently decided , namely [ TIME every month ] .", "... the court considers it necessary to regulate access by allowing visits [ of TIME , twice DATE ] . ... It has been explained to Mr GPE that if the visits take place without disruption he will be able to apply to the children 's judge for a review of the arrangements and that any incidents must be referred to the children 's judge , who will review the case in the interest of the child . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert appointed by the investigating judge on DATE had lodged a report . The ORG quoted the following extract from that report in their memorial of DATE :", "\u201c The scars to the abdomen , face , and the right forearm are of traumatic origin . The lesions to the abdomen and face appear to have been caused by a blunt or cutting instrument and the lesion to the right forearm by a cigarette burn . An examination of the child 's mental state ... has not revealed any marked pathological symptoms but does suggest retarded development of adequate defence mechanisms to counter anxiety ... He does not present any of the characteristic psychological disorders seen in abused children .", "[ On ] examination , the cutaneous lesions presented by [ the child ] on his admission to hospital on DATE are consistent in both form and evolution with the suspected abuse , but can not constitute concrete evidence of abuse .", "On the other hand , the psychological after - effects which the child currently presents are directly related to the serious situation that has arisen as a result of severance from the mother figure which the child went through probably in DATE . Those psychological after - effects also demonstrate the incapacity of his father and brother to adopt with him a sufficiently stable maternal role ...", "The psychological after - effects by themselves justify his placement in a foster home , as it appears risky to force the father to assume the mother 's role alone , when the characteristic nature of that role is continuous presence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge held that the applicant had no case to answer as there was insufficient evidence against him .", "CARDINAL .

Mr GPE remains impervious to any advice concerning his son , whom he regards as his property and whom he affords no opportunity for independent development ; ... these circumstances justify renewing [ C. 's ] placement with the ORG for DATE and suspending contact for that period . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG of ORG upheld the order renewing the child 's placement with the ORG . With regard to the suspension of contact , it appointed an expert to assess whether , and , if appropriate , how , contact between the father and his son could take place and adjourned the hearing of the case \u201c to the first available date after the expert 's report is lodged \u201d .", "The expert 's report was lodged on DATE .

Admittedly , it seems highly unlikely that he will accept , but it must be impressed on him that all the experts agree that he is suffering from personality disorders . If this course of action is to have any chance of succeeding , it will be necessary for a committee to be set up composed of certain people in whom he has confidence ... , which will inform him of the prescribed treatment and ask him to follow it for the good of and out of love for [ C. ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG once again deferred a decision on contact and adjourned examination of the case to DATE , the applicant being invited in the meantime to envisage starting therapy , as advised by the expert .

The reasoning set out in his judgment was as follows :", "\u201c The domestic situation has remained largely unaltered over DATE . Although he has been kept regularly informed by the ORG of his son 's progress , Mr GPE has failed to get in touch , despite being offered appointments . He recently went to [ C.

[ C. ] has been making positive progress with his foster parents . It is not possible to envisage [ C. 's ] returning home at present . Before any meetings between the father and the son can take place , Mr GPE will need to contact the ORG so that the question can be explored . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE the children 's judge dismissed an application by the applicant for the care order to be lifted and renewed the placement with the ORG for DATE from DATE . The order stipulated that the applicant 's rights to ordinary contact and to residential contact would be conditional on \u201c professional support for both father and child being provided \u201d . The reasons for the order were as follows :", "\u201c Mr GPE seeks the return of his son , but did not attend the last hearing on DATE . He has been kept informed by the ORG of his son 's progress but says that he has never received any documents and refuses all contact with the social worker responsible for [ C. ] . He claims that he is able to tend to all his son 's needs and perceives the placement as having torn the family apart and as a means of persecuting him and his son 's need as an extension of himself . He rejects any idea of treatment or of a third party 's intervening between him and his son . [ C. ] is progressing well in his foster home but clams up when his father is mentioned and refuses to listen . The situation is currently in an impasse and it does not appear possible at present for contact between the father and his son to be envisaged without the presence of a mediator and a third party , and it will be necessary for [ C. ] to be accompanied and helped to find the strength to broach the subject of relations with his father . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG of the Lyons Court of Appeal . At his request , the applicant 's son was heard by a member of that ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG delivered the following decision :", "\u201c [ C. ] was placed into the care of the ORG after suspected abuse ; the placement was also a consequence of the father 's inability to tend to his material and educative needs . At the material time , Mr GPE , who had been living on his own since [ C. 's ] mother 's return to LOC in DATE , was also wholly incapable of bringing up his then adolescent sons , [ I. ] and [ PERSON . ] , who had to be placed in care by the children 's judge .", "The father 's violent conduct towards the social workers during visits to his son led the children 's judge to arrange for the visits to take place at a neutral location and subsequently to suspend them and to seek an informed opinion on whether contact between the father and the child was possible . The experts found that Mr GPE was suffering from severe personality disorders and was incapable of considering his son as a separate being ( Dr [ Pe . ] ) or other than as a narcissistic object ( Dr [ C. ] ) . In that connection , the appellant confirmed by his remarks at the hearing on DATE that he was incapable of imagining that [ C. ] could lead a separate existence ( he kept repeating : ' my son is dead ' ) .", "Mr GPE refuses to acknowledge that [ C. ] made a firm request at the hearing to be allowed to live with his foster parents ' all the time ' , though he also seeks contact with a father of whom he is fond .", "In these circumstances , returning the minor to his father would put his health and safety at risk and would be very damaging to his welfare . The decision to renew his placement will therefore be upheld .", "Although Mr GPE rejects the whole idea of treatment or meetings with third parties , in order to offer the meetings with [ C. ] , whom he has not seen for DATE , ' a chance of success ' ( Dr [ Pe . ] ) , attempts should be made to arrange contact at a neutral location through a specialist counselling service . As it will take some time to make the arrangements , the first visit will be during DATE ... ORG ... upholds the decision of the court below regarding [ C.

On DATE the children 's judge renewed the order placing C. in the care of the ORG for a period of DATE starting on DATE . The judgment contained the following reasons :", "\u201c ... Mr GPE continues to call for [ C. 's ] return ... He says that he finds their separation painful and regards it as unjustified and unlawful . He is unable to comprehend that renewed contact must take place gradually and does not consider that the children 's judge has any right to take decisions concerning [ C. ] .
