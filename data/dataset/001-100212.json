They were represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the first applicant placed on its Internet site notice of a forthcoming television ( \u201c TV \u201d ) broadcast entitled ' Money generation ' . This programme had been produced by the second applicant . The notice stated that the broadcast would reveal that \u201c an influential official and a well - known person openly asks for a bribe in return for his help in settling the gambling organisers ' problems . Who is he ? The answer will be given on DATE , TIME in the TV broadcast ' Money generation ' \u201d .", "Having read this announcement , PERSON , a member of ORG , on DATE wrote to the first applicant , asking that the broadcast be deferred until certain information had been thoroughly analysed . He stated that the programme would damage his honour and dignity because it was defamatory . Nevertheless , the first applicant went ahead with the following broadcast :", "PERSON ( the announcer and CARDINAL of the journalists at the company GPE ) : It 's ' Money generation ' on the air . If you follow public life in GPE at least a little , you might already know what we are showing you DATE .", "( Vignette of the broadcast ' Money Generation ' is being shown )", "PERSON ( the announcer ) : ( Announcement of the broadcast DATE views of a casino are being shown ) A dazzling casino and CARDINAL of naive people expecting to get rich in a moment .

In case I legalise paths will still cross , and this is ... Well ... My situation in PERSON is normal , why , well , this ...", "PERSON ( the announcer ) : ( Announcement of the broadcast is continued DATE views of a casino are being shown ) \u201c An influential official and a well - known person openly asks for a bribe in return for his help in settling the gambling organisers ' problems . However , he does not know that he is being filmed \u201d .", "( Vignette of the broadcast ' Money Generation ' is being shown )", "PERSON ( the announcer ) : This will , however , be shown later in the broadcast . ( The recording is aborted )", "The programme included a report , which was filmed with a hidden camera , of a conversation between PERSON and a businessman , showing the surname of PERSON in subtitles .", "After the transmission , the second applicant gave the video material to ORG ( PERSON tyrim\u0173 tarnyba ) , which is the responsible authority in the fight against corruption in GPE . Having analysed the submitted material the latter reported that the video included a conversation between PERSON , who was a member of ORG , and the director of a private company , about the gambling business . During that conversation , the businessman had asked PERSON for help several times , without specifying the nature of such help , or any remuneration for it . During the same conversation , PERSON commented on the methods by which the businessman pursued his business . He also commented on certain decisions and actions of the ORG authorities . ORG concluded that no objective and unquestionable data about any corruption - related criminal activity was disclosed by the video . Therefore , there was no factual basis on which to start a pre - trial investigation into PERSON 's activities .", "The recording was also examined by the Chief ORG ( ORG tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija ) , which found that PERSON had not violated the applicable legislation . However , the Commission noted that , having unofficially consulted a person who was engaged in illegal gambling without informing ORG , PERSON had behaved improperly .", "On DATE PERSON asked the first applicant to correct the statement in a future broadcast and to compensate him for non - pecuniary damage , but the first applicant did not comply with this request .", "On an unknown date PERSON suspended his duties and took unpaid leave . Subsequently , he brought a civil action for defamation before ORG against the first applicant . The second applicant joined the proceedings as a third party .", "In its response to the lawsuit , the first applicant argued that the information , which according to PERSON was untrue , was made public for the first time on DATE at TIME in another television channel 's news broadcast . In addition , the information had previously been published by the DATE newspapers ORG and PERSON . The first applicant stated that the authors of the television programme were honest , and that their main concern had been to inform society about potentially illegal actions by a public figure . The information in its Internet announcement represented the journalist 's opinion on the facts and a subjective evaluation of the events . The facts were ambiguous ; therefore the first applicant had the right to interpret them . PERSON was a public figure ; this allowed a critical opinion to be expressed about him . Consequently PERSON should have been more tolerant when reacting to criticism .", "On DATE the ORG ruled in favour of PERSON The court noted at the outset that the information which formed the basis of the lawsuit had been published by the aforementioned newspapers after the first applicant had already placed its announcement on the Internet . Moreover , the first applicant failed to submit a recording of the above - mentioned other television channel 's news broadcast . Therefore , ORG found that the first applicant was precluded from relying on Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Provision of Information to the Public ( see Relevant domestic law part below ) .", "Having considered the merits of the case , ORG noted that , pursuant to LAW , the data which had been made public was to be presumed to be erroneous unless the publisher proved the opposite . Given that the first applicant had failed to prove that the broadcast statement was true , as well as the fact that , in its report , ORG had found no objective and unquestionable data to prove the suspected corruption , ORG concluded that the information it had in its possession did not substantiate the accusation of alleged bribery . Nonetheless , the court partly agreed with the first applicant , in so far as the broadcast concerned issues of general public interest involving the criticable activities of a public official . The court took note of the conclusion of ORG that PERSON had acted improperly and that his actions had damaged society 's trust in the public service . Yet the court emphasised that disseminating untrue information about alleged bribery did not constitute justified criticism of PERSON 's activities .", "ORG did not agree with the first applicant 's argument that the announcement of the future broadcast , and the broadcast itself , expressed an opinion to which the criterion of truth did not apply . According to the national court , the main point , that the ORG official had met a representative of an illegal business , was clear . The official 's behaviour was indeed unethical , but at no point during the conversation did PERSON ask for a bribe . Consequently , the first applicant could have interpreted the content of this meeting and the conversation negatively , but without any allegation of bribery . The court , whilst acknowledging that some of the applicants ' statements expressed an opinion , nevertheless noted that the categorical interpretation of the main point as a clear request for a bribe amounted to new information which did not correspond to reality . According to the court , this publicly disseminated statement about a proposed bribe could only be understood by the public as an allegation that a crime had been committed by PERSON", "ORG also took into account the fact that , after the announcement of the broadcast , PERSON had requested the first applicant not to show the programme until the journalists ' information had been scrutinised . Despite this request , the first applicant had gone ahead with the transmission . In the opinion of the court , the first applicant had not acted honestly , as it had not taken all reasonable measures to evaluate PERSON 's actions based on correct and verified information .", "ORG found that , by making the statement that \u201c an influential official and a well - known person openly asks for a bribe in return for his help in settling the gambling organisers ' problems \u201d both in the notice of the forthcoming ' Money generation ' broadcast and at the beginning of that broadcast , the first applicant had damaged PERSON 's reputation , and ordered it to correct that statement publicly . The court also ordered the first applicant to pay FAC NORP litai ( LTL ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage and LTL MONEY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) in litigation costs . The court rejected as unsubstantiated PERSON 's claim for pecuniary damage , which PERSON had allegedly sustained due to the need to take unpaid leave .", "PERSON appealed , claiming that the award for non - pecuniary damage was too low . The second applicant appealed , claiming , inter alia , that the information contained in the broadcast was an opinion and not news and , therefore , the criterion of truth did not apply to it . Unlike the defence 's response to the lawsuit , the second applicant no longer argued that the statement about PERSON 's corrupt behaviour had been made public by other mass media before the ' Money generation ' programme was aired . Lastly , the second applicant maintained that the first - instance court had made too high an award for the litigation costs to be paid by the first applicant .", "The first applicant did not appeal .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal of the second applicant , upheld the decision of ORG and , in addition , awarded PERSON ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in compensation for pecuniary damage to S.J.", "On DATE the first and second applicants lodged a joint appeal on points of law , relying on LAW and the ORG 's judgment in the case of LOC v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and arguing , inter alia , that they had acted honestly in the interests of society and that , in their broadcast , they had merely expressed their opinion about PERSON , who was a public person and for that reason enjoyed less privacy . Again , the applicants no longer maintained that information about PERSON 's alleged corruption had been made public before the ' Money generation ' broadcast .", "By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG refused to examine the cassation appeal , on the ground that it did not meet the requirements of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "DATE the applicants lodged a new joint cassation appeal . Again , they argued that they had acted in good faith and had been punished for merely expressing opinions about a public figure . In support of their pleas , this time the applicants explicitly invoked LAW .", "On DATE ORG , relying on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , refused to accept the cassation appeal , finding that the applicants had failed to demonstrate convincingly that the alleged breaches of procedural and substantive law had an essential significance for the uniform interpretation and application of the law and could have caused the adoption of an unlawful decision .", "Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code regarding the protection of honour and dignity reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
