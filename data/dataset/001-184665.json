M.I. repeated her statement given before the prosecuting authorities ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted PERSON on the grounds that although it had been established that he had organised a prostitution ring in which he had recruited the applicant , it had not been established that he had forced her into prostitution . However , he had only been indicted for the aggravated form of the offence at issue and thus he could not be convicted for the basic form of organising prostitution . In finding this , the trial court in particular noted that it could not give sufficient weight to the applicant \u2019s testimony because her statement had been incoherent , she had been unsure and that she had paused and hesitated when speaking . At the same time , given that there was no other conclusive evidence , it applied the in dubio pro reo principle and acquitted PERSON The relevant part of the first - instance judgment reads :", "\u201c On the basis of the evidence given by the accused and the victim in these criminal proceedings the following facts have been established : that the accused and the victim met through the social network ORG when the accused contacted the victim ; ... that the accused gave a mobile telephone to the victim so that she could be contacted by the clients with whom she discussed providing sexual services ; that the victim indeed did provide sexual services in the flat where she lived with the accused ; that on CARDINAL or six occasions the accused drove the victim to the addresses of clients where she provided sexual services ; that the victim charged for providing sexual services the sum of HRK CARDINAL for TIME and the sum of HRK CARDINAL for an hour ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The State Attorney \u2019s ORG appealed against this decision , arguing that the first - instance court had erred in its factual findings concerning the charges against PERSON when it did not accept the applicant \u2019s testimony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal of ORG and upheld the first - instance judgment , endorsing its reasoning as well as the facts as established by the trial court . That decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) , complaining about the manner in which the criminal - law mechanisms had been applied in her case . She relied on ORG DATE , DATE and DATE of the LAW ( see below paragraph CARDINAL ) and Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention . In particular , she alleged that the national authorities had not properly investigated and addressed the element of force . Also , owing to the failure of the authorities to reclassify the offence , PERSON had not been convicted of any offence , to the applicant \u2019s detriment . She further stressed that she had not been provided with any psychological help or assistance during the court hearing to help cope with the fear and pressure she had felt from PERSON while testifying , which all resulted in her testimony being regarded as incoherent by the trial court . The applicant also alleged a failure of the authorities to secure effective respect for her private life in particular through the domestic court \u2019s inadequate assessment of all the relevant circumstances in which she had been recruited to PERSON \u2019s prostitution ring .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible on the grounds that the applicant had not had the right to bring a constitutional complaint concerning the criminal proceedings against PERSON since these proceedings had concerned a criminal charge against him . The decision of ORG was served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["4"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["4-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
