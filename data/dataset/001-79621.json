The first applicant claimed that a prison officer had hit him on the head with a radio causing him to fall to the ground with a bleeding head . An altercation had ensued in which CARDINAL prison officers received injuries . CARDINAL prisoners , including the applicants , were escorted to the segregation unit .", "At TIME on DATE , officers entered the first applicant \u2019s cell in full riot gear . They punched him , kicked him and swore at him , calling him a \u201c scumbag \u201d and a \u201c black bastard \u201d . He was pinned to the ground and handcuffed . A female officer cut off his clothes with scissors . Once he was naked a pair of boxer shorts was pulled on him and he was removed to the prison yard . The officers continued kicking and beating him and threw him face down on the ground in a puddle . He was placed kneeling in a prison van and taken to FAC nearby where the beating continued . He was placed in segregation and the officers threw food and water at him . He was forced to eat off the floor .", "The other applicants were assaulted in a similar manner . The second applicant , O\u2019Toole , was made to stand facing the wall . When he tried to look round , his head was smashed against the wall . The officers grabbed his hair and genitals .", "Following allegations by the prison officers concerning the applicants\u2019 conduct , the applicants stood trial , inter alia , for causing grievous bodily harm , violent disorder and affray .", "In DATE , the jury acquitted all CARDINAL applicants .", "The applicants lodged civil claims , inter alia , for assault and malicious prosecution .", "Following a hearing before judge and jury in ORG in DATE , the first applicant succeeded in his claims of assault and malicious prosecution , and the other applicants succeeded in claims of misfeasance based on incidents of assault . The jury found , inter alia , that the prison officers had wrongly alleged that the first applicant was involved in the assault on the prison officers on DATE , doing so deliberately without any honest belief in what they alleged and that the prison officers had punched and kicked him on DATE during his transfer to another prison . The jury awarded GBP CARDINAL to the first applicant , and GBP CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL respectively to the other CARDINAL applicants . The jury also made an award of GBP CARDINAL in exemplary damages to be shared by the applicants .", "After the conclusion of the civil proceedings , the applicants\u2019 solicitor wrote to ORG requesting a formal investigation into the allegations of abuse by prison officers . On DATE , ORG indicated that it had commissioned an investigation by a prison governor from outside the area , Governor PERSON of FAC . Though the applicants\u2019 solicitor contested his independence , the internal investigation proceeded . On DATE , ORG replied that Governor PERSON did not work in the area and was not subject to any line management from that area in respect of his functions as governor or investigator . It was satisfied that the investigation would be carried out fairly and impartially and would be independent without supervision of control from anyone else . It would be decided later how widely the findings of the investigation would be disclosed .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicants\u2019 solicitor that the investigation was completed . It stated that the report would not be disclosed . Following a threat of legal proceedings , the report was provided to the applicants\u2019 solicitor on DATE .", "According to the report , prison officers emphatically denied the allegations and new evidence had become available , namely statements by other prison staff and by CARDINAL prisoners who supported the accounts of staff . It noted that there had been extremely damaging inconsistencies in the account at trial of CARDINAL officer but that there had also been inconsistencies in the accounts of the complainants which did not appear to have been challenged in the civil trial . It considered that there was little , and thereby insufficient evidence , apart from the minor injuries to the complainants , to substantiate their allegations of assault and fabrication of dishonest allegations . As regarded the first applicant , it concluded that it was unlikely and not independently substantiated that he had been assaulted in an unprovoked attack by a prison officer on DATE or that he had been assaulted on DATE when being transferred in full view of the Governor , ORG and other senior managers .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitor wrote to ORG making a formal request for a properly independent investigation into the applicant \u2019s allegations . On DATE ORG refused that request .", "In line with ORG , no criminal or disciplinary sanctions have been commenced against any officer ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
