The first applicant , an NORP citizen born in DATE and residing in GPE , is the chief editor and publisher of the newspaper \u201c FAC \u201d . The second applicant , a limited partnership ( Kommanditgesellschaft ) is the owner of this newspaper . The third applicant is a limited company , the general partner ( GPE ) of the second applicant . The second and third applicants have their places of business in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants belong to a large media group which at the relevant time was in strong competition with another media group represented by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . Besides his profession as a lawyer , PERSON was from DATE to DATE secretary general of ORG ( \u00d6sterreichische Volkspartei ) and , from DATE , a Member of ORG for that party . DATE he was the Chairman of ORG ( ORG . DATE he represented the ORG competitor in several proceedings concerning unfair competition against companies belonging to the ORG media group .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE several NORP laws were amended by ORG Erweiterte PERSON - GPE ) . The Government PERSON ( PERSON ) had also provided for an amendment to LAW ( Exekutionsordnung ) , a section which is of particular relevance for the enforcement of injunctions . The Government PERSON had envisaged raising the fines that could be imposed for non - compliance with injunctions from ORG CARDINAL per enforcement order to ORG CARDINAL per enforcement order .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the chairmanship of PERSON , the ORG dealing with the Government PERSON proposed a different version , namely that a maximum fine of LAW could be imposed for each request for enforcement ( PERSON ) instead of for each enforcement order issued by ORG . In its report of DATE , ORG pointed out that the fine had to be multiplied by the number of requests for enforcement , if CARDINAL decision combining several requests was taken . This proposal was adopted by ORG on DATE and published as Article XI of the Extended Pecuniary Limits Amendment Act , ORG ( Erweiterte PERSON - Novelle CARDINAL , BGBl . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE , in DATE , the following article written by the first applicant under the pseudonym \u201c PERSON \u201d was published in the \u201c PERSON GPE \u201d :", "\u201c Moral CARDINAL", "Before PERSON became the NORP Minister for ORG , he was one of LOC \u2019s most famous and most successful lawyers . He administered the gigantic estate of Picasso ; he represented PERSON and an NORP Minister for ORG when the latter found himself in a bad situation . PERSON took it for granted that he had to give up his law firm when he became a member of the government . In every democracy of the world this course of action is followed . Only Mr Graff , who is obviously thick - skinned , does not intend to comply with these moral concepts .", "It so happened that at the time when PERSON was presiding ORG , a law was amended which brought about big advantages for the newspaper publishers whom PERSON represented as a lawyer . In order to ensure that in such cases no suspicion , not even one that has no objective justification , can arise , there exists the wise rule of incompatibility ; a lawyer is not allowed to take part in the adoption of laws which lead to advantages for his clients .", "Also the Austrian ORG thought that way and they decided to appeal to PERSON conscience . In vain ! It is very telling for the present situation of ORG that it can not convince PERSON . The other parties will be only too pleased , when it becomes so flagrantly evident how powerless ORG is vis - a - vis one of their officials who has his own moral concepts . PERSON was even allowed to present his disreputable attitude on our monopoly - television . PERSON thought that it would be a sign of fear to the \u2018 PERSON if he had to resign from ORG .", "ORG does not have to fear the \u2018 Krone\u2019 but its voters , who will continue turning away from it if the party shows itself incapable of establishing order within its own ranks ; how could CARDINAL then possibly trust that it would succeed in doing this in the ORG ...
