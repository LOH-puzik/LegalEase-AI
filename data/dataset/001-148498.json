A list of the CARDINAL applicants , who are all NORP nationals , is set out in the appendix ( \u201c the applicants \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP This application and CARDINAL others ( nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ) concern the regularisation of the relationship between ownership and use of real property located in the cadastral area of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Certain land in this area was expropriated in DATE by the ( then socialist ) ORG and a public sports centre was built on it . The sports centre comprises buildings and various other facilities , such as a tennis court , a grandstand , a water station and paved areas .", "CARDINAL . After the post DATE political , constitutional and legal changes , litigation took place with a view to resolving various property claims made by the original owners ( or their legal successors ) against the entities that owned or operated the sports centre or various parts of it .", "CARDINAL . The land concerned is divided into a number of plots with various owners , many of whom are linked by family relations and history , and who had the same legal representation in the above - mentioned proceedings . Their lawsuits followed a similar pattern , but sometimes had varying results . They included the following proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants in the present case are all successors in title to a plot of land in the above - mentioned area . They inherited their title from the original owner , who died in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants or , as the case might have been , their legal predecessors , represented then and throughout the proceedings by a laywer , lodged an action against the owner of a sports club seeking to obtain a court order for the removal of the constructions on the land .", "CARDINAL . The principal line of argument was that the expropriation decision of CARDINAL DATE was invalid in law . The applicants were therefore the lawful owners of the land in question , in particular plot no . DATE ( recorded on sheet no . CARDINAL of the \u201c old \u201d records ) , and the defendant had no lawful title to have the constructions on the applicants\u2019 land .", "CARDINAL . The action was subsequently amended to state that , alternatively , the applicants sought a judicial ruling establishing an easement on their land for the benefit of the owner of the sports centre in return for financial compensation payable to the applicants . It was also extended to CARDINAL more defendants , a municipality and a private company , and to additional plots of land .", "CARDINAL . NORP The action was examined and determined at first instance by ORG s\u00fad ) . In its judgment ( rozsudok ) of DATE , ORG acknowledged that ( i ) the expropriation of DATE was legally ineffective on account of procedural flaws ; ( ii ) the applicants were the owners of the land in question ; ( iii ) the constructions on it had been built without a valid legal title in so far as the land was concerned ; and ( iv ) the applicants were entitled to seek redress under general civil law , that is to say LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) , which was not subject to any statute of limitation , unlike the special legislation on restitution , which contained specific time - limits .", "CARDINAL . As regards the options available under LAW for resolving the discrepancy between the ownership and use of the land and the constructions concerned , ORG found that , for practical reasons , it was out of the question to have the applicants established as the owners of the constructions and to order them to pay the current owners financial compensation . Furthermore , in the circumstances , it was likewise not practical to order the physical removal of the constructions in question . The establishment of an easement for the benefit of the owners of the constructions in return for compensation payable by them to the applicants was therefore an option .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in that connection , on the basis of expert evidence , ORG observed that part of the land concerned lay under a construction that fell within the definition of a \u201c building \u201d in terms of the law , whereas the remainder of the impugned land was not underneath \u201c buildings \u201d under the said definition .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG held that an easement over land could only be established for the benefit of the owner of a building in terms of civil law .", "CARDINAL . A distinction therefore had to be made between the part of the land that was under buildings , in respect of which the action was granted and an easement for the benefit of the owner of the buildings was established , and the remainder of the land , in respect of which the action was dismissed .", "At the same time , ORG transferred the claim for compensation for the easement established by the former ruling to another set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged the first - instance judgment by means of an appeal ( odvolanie ) to ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) .", "They argued in particular that ORG had failed to appreciate that the property in question was a part of a large complex serving a single purpose ; that a number of claims had been raised in respect of that property ; that the legal nature of those claims was identical to those raised by the applicants , differing only in the technical parameters of the specific plots at stake ; and that in its judgment in case no . CARDINALC CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG had established an easement in respect of plots of land comprising the sports centre , without differentiating between plots that had \u201c buildings \u201d on them and those that did not ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , sitting in chambers , dismissed the ORG appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment .", "It summarised in detail the written , oral and expert evidence taken and fully endorsed the factual and legal conclusions of ORG , providing further detailed explanations of the position taken , accompanied by references to the existing judicial practice . It also observed that the applicants could have asserted their property rights by other means , for example by lodging actions aimed at obtaining declaratory rulings and orders for compensation in respect of unjustified enrichment . However , they had not done so and the courts were bound by the legal classification of the claims they had pursued in the present proceedings .", "Nevertheless , ORG provided no specific answer to the arguments that the buildings and the adjacent facilities belonged to a single integrated complex and that a different conclusion had been reached in case no . CARDINALC CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , except for the CARDINAL applicant , lodged a complaint with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) under LAW no . PERSON . , as amended ) .", "Citing similar grounds to those mentioned above , coupled with the lack of a judicial response to what they considered to be crucial arguments , the applicants complained that the outcome of the proceedings had been arbitrary and alleged that their rights under , inter alia , LAW ( access , fairness , adequate reasoning ) and the constitutional equivalent of LAW No . CARDINAL had been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill founded . It observed that it was not a court of further appeal against decisions of the ordinary courts and found no constitutionally relevant unfairness , arbitrariness or irregularity in the impugned judgments .", "The decision was served on the applicants\u2019 lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The position taken by the courts was subsequently fully endorsed by ORG when it dismissed the applicants\u2019 petition for an extraordinary appeal on points of law to be lodged on their behalf in the present case .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL deals with situations concerning so - called \u201c unlawful constructions \u201d , that is buildings ( stavba ) constructed on somebody else \u2019s plot of land ( pozemok ) without an entitlement to do so .", "At the request of the owner of the land , the court has the power to order the removal of such buildings at the cost of the person who constructed them ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "However , if the removal of the building is not practical , and subject to consent by the owner of the land , the court has the power to rule that the title to the building be transferred to the owner of the land in return for compensation ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The court also has the power to regularise the relationship between the owner of the land and the owner of the building by taking other measures , in particular by establishing an easement , which is necessary for the exercise of ownership rights in respect of the building , in return for compensation ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a case registered at ORG under file no . CARDINALC CARDINAL/CARDINAL a different group of claimants raised essentially the same claims as the applicants in respect of other plots of land under the same sports centre , the defendant being the respective municipality .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before the case was resolved on the merits with final effect , ORG had determined the claimants\u2019 appeal on points of law ( dovolanie ) ( no . CARDINAL PERSON ) against a previous judgment of ORG . In its judgment of DATE , ORG observed that before the action could be determined on the merits ( of the claim for an easement ) , preliminary questions had to be answered as to whether the claimants were the owners of the property concerned and , if they were , whether they had standing to sue in the case .", "ORG further observed that , when dealing with those questions , ORG had noted that the land in question had been expropriated in DATE . ORG had therefore held that , even assuming that the expropriation had been flawed , it could only have been challenged by means of administrative - law remedies and within the timelimits prescribed for such remedies . That , however , had been beyond the scope of the case at hand and , therefore , ORG held that the DATE expropriation should be considered as being a matter of fact .", "CARDINAL . ORG disagreed with ORG position described above . As was found in the present case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it found that the expropriation of DATE was legally ineffective . As a consequence , the courts were bound to examine the preliminary question of the claimants\u2019 ownership independently and irrespective of the expropriation decision .", "CARDINAL . The case was finally decided on the merits by ORG on DATE . The action was granted and an easement was established for the benefit of the claimants in respect of the entire property covered by their claim , that is to say including some plots on which no \u201c buildings \u201d , in the sense explained above , were situated .", "The judgment was not appealed against and became final and binding on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ensuing question concerning the financial compensation payable by the municipality to the claimants for the easement was resolved by ORG in a judgment of DATE ( case no . CARDINALC CARDINAL ) on the basis of an expert assessment .", "CARDINAL . In another similar case concerning property in the same area as in the present case , the claimants raised in principle the same claims . The court took the same position as in the present case , that is to say that the claimants were entitled to assert their property claims under the general provisions of LAW and the determinative factor was whether or not the land in question was under \u201c buildings \u201d . As that was not so , the action was dismissed . The respective judgments were given on DATE ( ORG ) and DATE ( ORG ) , and the final decision was given by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a number of other cases concerning property in the same area and in a situation similar to the present case , the position was taken that the claimants could not assert their rights under the general provisions of LAW , as those provisions constituted a lex generalis , and their application was excluded by virtue of the special legislation on the restitution of property , as a lex specialis . However , that position does not appear to be settled .", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of the report state that , in order for the principle of legal certainty \u2013 essential for maintaining confidence in the judicial system and the rule of law \u2013 to be achieved , the ORG must make the law easily accessible and must also apply the laws it has enacted in a foreseeable and consistent manner . As the existence of conflicting decisions within the highest courts may be contrary to this principle , it is necessary for these courts to establish mechanisms to avoid conflicts and ensure the coherence of their case - law .", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of the Opinion read as follows :", "\u201c DATE . While recognising the judges\u2019 power to interpret the law , the obligation of the judges to promote legal certainty has also to be remembered . Indeed legal certainty guarantees the predictability of the content and application of the legal rules , thus contributing in ensuring a high quality judicial system .", "CARDINAL . ORG will apply the interpretative principles applicable in both national and international law with this aim in mind . ... In civil law countries , they will be guided by case law , especially that of the highest courts , whose task includes ensuring the uniformity of case law .", "DATE . ORG should in general apply the law consistently . However when a court decides to depart from previous case law , this should be clearly mentioned in its decision . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
