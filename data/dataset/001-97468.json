NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG of GPE ( \u201c the agency \u201d ) , further to a competitive examination , appointed the applicant in the post of economic deputy director in ORG ( \u201c the hospital \u201d ) , a public institution . The hospital was in charge with the enforcement of that decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the agency found management deficiencies by the applicant . Therefore on DATE the agency decided to dismiss him from his position as deputy director . That decision was to be enforced by the hospital and provided for a DATE time - limit to be challenged before the courts .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on CARDINAL DATE the hospital offered the applicant CARDINAL alternative posts , either as economist or as consultant in the accounting department , informing him that in case of refusal it would terminate his employment contract in accordance with LAW ) of LAW for professional incompatibility . The applicant declined the CARDINAL offers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hospital charged the applicant with pecuniary damage caused to the institution , on the basis of the above - mentioned findings .", "However , on DATE the GPE jurisdictional branch of ORG annulled that decision , considering that the pecuniary damage had not been caused by the applicant and therefore he was not liable under LAW . That judgment became final .", "On DATE the public prosecutor also found no grounds which would justify initiating a criminal action against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having regard to the decision of CARDINAL DATE and to the fact that the applicant had refused the CARDINAL alternative posts , the hospital dismissed him from his job .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE before the courts , seeking reinstatement in his previous job and payment of salary arrears . In his subsequent submissions , he also challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the post of economic director was discontinued in line with new legal provisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed that action in part and annulled the decision of DATE , considering that his dismissal under LAW ( e ) of LAW for management deficiencies had been groundless . It held that the legal grounds for terminating his employment contract should be reconsidered in a fair manner , by taking into account the applicant 's preference for ceasing or continuing in another post .", "However , the court dismissed his complaint against the decision of DATE as being out of time . Consequently , even if it found that the grounds for his dismissal were unfounded , it dismissed his other claims , considering that it could not order reinstatement in his previous job and payment of salary since that decision taken by the agency to dismiss him from his post had not been examined on the merits and had not been annulled . The court concluded that the hospital was not at fault for the termination of his employment contract because the applicant had previously been dismissed from his job by the hierarchically superior body and had not opted for another position . Therefore , in spite of upholding the annulment of his dismissal , the court considered that the provisions of LAW were not applicable in the case . That Article provided that in case of annulment of a dismissal decision , the institution had an obligation to reinstate that person in his previous job and to pay him damages .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , considering his reinstatement as the legal consequence of annulling the decision by which he had been dismissed . He also submitted that he had working relations with the hospital and that the decision taken by the agency was not relevant in his case .", "The hospital argued that the decision to dismiss the applicant had been taken by the hierarchically superior body , which had also employed him , and that the hospital had only enforced that decision in the absence of a positive answer by the applicant to its CARDINAL alternative job proposals . The hospital also submitted that the CARDINAL contested decisions did not have the same purpose because the decision taken by the agency aimed only at dismissing the applicant from his post , thus giving the possibility to continue working relations in another post , according to his qualifications .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld that judgment by a final decision . It considered that the annulment of the decision of CARDINAL DATE had no influence over the previous decision of CARDINAL DATE , which had not been challenged in due time . Therefore , since the latter decision had not been annulled , it was not possible to order the applicant 's reinstatement in his previous job or payment of salary . The court also considered to be irrelevant the fact that the applicant had working relations with the hospital , since the Regulations for the organisation and functioning of the public health agencies had provided that those agencies were entitled to revoke directors ' appointments in subordinate institutions ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the hospital to reinstate him in accordance with the judgments of DATE and DATE , considering that his employment contract was still in effect . He also submitted that he had the qualifications required for the post of accounting director or director in charge with reform . On DATE , during a meeting with the hospital 's management , the applicant was informed about the unavailability of any post of economist within the hospital . He was also informed that the post of accounting director was not vacant and that the appointment in the post of director in charge with reform was to be made by ORG , and not by the hospital .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , on DATE the hospital requested ORG ( the \u201c PERSON \u201d ) to find a corresponding job for the applicant and also informed the applicant about this action . On DATE the PERSON informed the hospital of the existence of CARDINAL available posts of economist in a certain company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hospital invited again the applicant to its headquarters . The applicant went on DATE , but refused to read the information sent by the PERSON , requesting to have it submitted to him by post . Eventually , the applicant refused those offers .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , on DATE the hospital terminated his employment contract under LAW ( a ) of LAW , which provided for dismissal of an employee by the institution when the post occupied by the former had been discontinued following reorganisation . In accordance with the judgments of DATE and DATE it annulled the mention in his employment record which provided that he had been dismissed because of management deficiencies . The decision further stated that the period DATE and DATE was not considered as length of service .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged that decision , seeking its annulment , his reinstatement in an equivalent post and payment of salary starting with DATE , the date on which the judgment of CARDINAL DATE became final ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He submitted that the annulment of the decision of CARDINAL DATE had restored the status quo ante and therefore his employment contract was still valid .", "The hospital submitted that the post occupied by the applicant had been discontinued in accordance with new legal provisions , that it had no vacancy suited to the applicant 's qualifications and that it had requested assistance from the PERSON . Since the applicant had declined those offers , the hospital reconsidered the grounds for his dismissal , as stated in the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his action . It considered his dismissal as the only alternative , taking into account that his post had been discontinued , that the hospital had offered him another post corresponding to his qualifications and also the fact that the applicant had claimed only a post of accounting director or director in charge with reform , which could only be filled by competitive examination .", "The court further noted that the judgment of DATE had only annulled the decision of CARDINAL DATE by which the applicant had been dismissed from his job , but not the decision taken by the agency on DATE with a view to dismiss him from his post . As a result his employment contract continued to be in effect , but his reinstatement in his previous job was no longer possible . The court also held that the period DATE and DATE had legally been considered as not amounting to length of service , since neither the applicant nor the employer had paid social security during that period , as provided for by the legal provisions . Finally , the court dismissed as groundless his claim for overdue salary starting with DATE for the reason that he had not worked .", "That judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . The order no . DATE of ORG on the organisation and functioning of the public health agencies provided that the hierarchically superior body was in charge with appointing or revoking the appointments of the directors from the subordinate institutions . Those attributes were preserved by the order no . CARDINAL of ORG on the approval of the Regulations for the organisation and functioning of the public health agencies ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
