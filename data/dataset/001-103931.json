The policemen were charged with using excessive force when apprehending CARDINAL suspects and later beating them while they were in custody .

The ORG also referred to the judgment of the same court of CARDINAL DATE , subsequently upheld by ORG , when QUANTITY police officers were convicted of abuse of authority and beating up a suspect during questioning . The conviction was based on the version of events presented by the victim , supported by corroborating medical examination . The fact that fellow police officers had testified in favour of the accused policemen did not cast doubt for the court on the credibility of the victim 's claims ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
