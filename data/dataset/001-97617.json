There is much to be said for this latter system in that the commissions are highly specialised whereas the courts tend to be less experienced with regard to electoral issues . As a precautionary measure , however , it is desirable that there should be some form of judicial supervision in place , making the higher commission the first appeal level and the competent court the second .", "Appeal to parliament , as the judge of its own election , is sometimes provided for but could result in political decisions . It is acceptable as a first instance in places where it is long established , but a judicial appeal should then be possible .", "Appeal proceedings should be as brief as possible , in any case concerning decisions to be taken before the election .

This means both that the time - limits for appeals must be very short and that the appeal body must make its ruling as quickly as possible . Time - limits must , however , be long enough to make an appeal possible , to guarantee the exercise of rights of defence and a reflected decision . A time - limit of DATE at first instance ( both for lodging appeals and making rulings ) seems reasonable for decisions to be taken before the elections . It is , however , permissible to grant a little more time to ORG for their rulings .", "The procedure must also be simple , and providing voters with special appeal forms helps to make it so . It is necessary to eliminate formalism , and so avoid decisions of inadmissibility , especially in politically sensitive cases .", "It is also vital that the appeal procedure , and especially the powers and responsibilities of the various bodies involved in it , should be clearly regulated by law , so as to avoid any positive or negative conflicts of jurisdiction . Neither the appellants nor the authorities should be able to choose the appeal body .

Due to different legal and political traditions , a variety of procedures are used in the resolution of election disputes . In many established democracies in western LOC ( like GPE , GPE , GPE , or GPE ) election appeals are heard by ordinary administrative and judicial bodies operating under special procedures . In contrast , in most emerging and new democracies in central and eastern LOC ( and in other regions of the world ) , the responsibility for deciding on election complaints and appeals is shared between independent electoral commissions and ordinary courts ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Of the GPE which replied to the ORG \u2019s questionnaire , CARDINAL ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) provided for the election of deputies intended to represent national minorities .

In GPE and GPE , threshold rules do not apply to such organisations .", "The NORP system is specific . The body of institutions is conceived in such a way as to establish a balance between the different linguistic groups ( rather than between minorities in the strict sense ) . Moreover , in certain areas which are mixed from a linguistic point of view , adjustments have been made so that electors from different linguistic communities are represented in the elected body .", "In most cases , however , the representation of minorities in an elected body is achieved through the application of the ordinary rules of electoral law , which treat people belonging to national minorities and others in the same way .", "CARDINAL .

NORP Despite differences in the organisation and characteristics of the electoral administration responsible for declaring results and the distribution of seats ( independent electoral commissions , government structures , temporary polling stations , courts ) , the information available to the Court concerning the legislation of a large number of ORG member GPE shows a degree of convergence as regards the existence of a post - electoral system of appeals . In certain GPE it is possible to lodge an appeal with a recognised court or tribunal body , be it an ordinary court , a special electoral court or ORG . While certain countries make provision for CARDINAL stages of appeal before the judicial authorities , others envisage CARDINAL such appeal , at first instance . The CARDINAL countries that envisage no judicial remedy beyond validation of powers by the legislative chamber are in western LOC ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) . The tendency towards investing courts with jurisdiction for post - electoral disputes is in line with the NORP standards recommended by ORG , which points out that in all cases there must be a judicial remedy available , since an appeal to the parliamentary validation commission or an electoral commission does not offer sufficient guarantees .", "CARDINAL . This is the system used by GPE and GPE . In GPE , decisions relating to the declaration of results may be challenged before the central electoral commission itself . However , the losing parties may subsequently appeal against the decision before a court ( the electoral chamber of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . While such a practice is fairly widespread , CARDINAL countries ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) stand out because the only post - election remedy available is validation by parliament , the decisions of the electoral offices being deemed to be final . That said , those CARDINAL countries have enjoyed a long tradition of democracy which would tend to dissipate any doubts as to the legitimacy of such a practice . ORG in general has reservations as to the effectiveness of this type of remedy , however , as there could be doubts as to the impartiality of such bodies ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The NORP example may be held up in this regard : when the validation commission ( which at the time was the only body authorised to hear appeals ) excluded CARDINAL Poujadist MPs from parliament in DATE , ORG created by LAW was tasked with avoiding such pitfalls and the practice of validation purely and simply disappeared from the NORP parliamentary landscape . It may also be useful to point out that in DATE , GPE created the possibility of an appeal to ORG ( while previously , the verification of powers by ORG served as the only appeal process ) .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , that practice remains the norm in certain GPE . Furthermore , various countries , including GPE , continue to use a dual system . Judicial review does not de facto prevent validation by parliament , in so far as their objectives remain separate . The purpose of the first is to settle potential disputes through the courts while the purpose of the second is to validate mandates by means of political supervision . This type of validation acknowledges the specific nature and independence of the legislature in relation both to the executive and the judiciary .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL type of appeal is that lodged with an \u201c ordinary \u201d court . The competent authorities may be administrative courts and courts of appeal , as in the following countries : GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ( ORG and ORG ) , GPE , GPE ( ORG of the ORG of ORG ) , GPE ( ORG of ORG ) and GPE ( Election Court of the High Court and appeal to ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Many countries confer jurisdiction for post - electoral disputes on ORG . However , that court may not necessarily have the same powers of review from CARDINAL system to another . It may merely review constitutionality ( GPE ) or it may verify and approve the results submitted by the electoral commission ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . Certain countries have adopted this type of remedy either at first or last instance : PERSON ( second instance ) , GPE ( first instance ) , GPE ( first instance ) , GPE ( first instance , before ORG as ORG ) , GPE ( first instance ) , GPE ( only where issues of constitutionality arise ) , GPE ( first instance ) , GPE ( second instance and protection of fundamental rights ) and GPE ( second instance before ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , some systems include courts which deal only with electoral disputes . They are composed of judges who are generally from other jurisdictions and they have a limited lifespan ( the time - limit for an appeal following the publication of the results ) , but they enjoy exclusive jurisdiction in electoral disputes . Specific bodies of this kind have been set up in the following countries : GPE ( electoral chamber of ORG ) , GPE ( ORG , specialising in certain types of dispute , including electoral disputes ) , GPE ( ORG ) and GPE ( Election Court ) .", "CARDINAL . Only CARDINAL case is known \u2013 that of GPE ( challenge before the cantonal government ) .
