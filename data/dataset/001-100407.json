The applicant was born in DATE and lives in LOC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his brother , PERSON , leased a substantial area of farming land . After the applicant had been hospitalised , he asked his brother to gather the crops . The applicant submits that his brother sold the crops and the agricultural machines which they co - owned and took all the profits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a claim against his brother in ORG , seeking MONEY ( ORG ) in compensation . He also sought an exemption from court fees ( ORG MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG exempted the applicant from court fees . On DATE it granted legal aid to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant modified his claim by joining his brother 's wife as a defendant . He also requested the court to issue an interim order to secure his claims by way of , inter alia , registering a charge over the defendants ' property and attaching their bank accounts . On DATE the applicant submitted some additional information requested by the court in relation to his request for an interim measure . On DATE ORG granted the interim order in part .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant increased his claim to PLN CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG revoked the applicant 's exemption from court fees and the decision to grant him legal aid . ORG considered that the information in the file indicated that the applicant was not an indigent person unable to pay court fees and other costs related to the litigation . It noted that the applicant owned QUANTITY houses and that in DATE he had had MONEY deposited in the bank . Thus , ORG found that the applicant had not submitted accurate information about his financial status . Consequently , it imposed a fine on the applicant in the amount of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision . He contested the court 's findings . The applicant submitted that a charge had been registered over his property in PERSON , while the other property , located in LOC , was a small house where he lived with his extended family . He further stated that all his savings had been invested in the farming of the leased land and that he had been deprived of any profits by his brother . He further submitted that his only income was a modest invalidity benefit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It relied on the fact that the applicant had failed to disclose all the relevant information about his financial status in his original application for an exemption from court fees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to pay ORG MONEY in court fees . On DATE the applicant applied for leave to pay the relevant fees in instalments . He claimed that he had been receiving invalidity benefit and could not pay the amount in question all at once . He also submitted that he could not take up any offers of work because of his poor health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant leave to pay the court fees in CARDINAL DATE instalments . Until DATE the applicant paid CARDINAL instalments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant increased his claim to ORG CARDINAL , following the submission of a number of documents by the defendant which indicated the amount of profit made from the jointly leased land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL in court fees for the modification of his claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the court to exempt him from those court fees and to cancel the CARDINAL remaining DATE instalments he was supposed to pay . The applicant submitted that his only income was an invalidity benefit in the DATE amount of ORG MONEY and that he was unfit for work . He stated that he had been hospitalised from DATE until DATE and that he had subsequently broken his spine and had again been hospitalised . He further submitted that he had transferred his property in LOC by way of a donation to his children . The other property , located in LOC , was a wooden house in need of renovation and lacking basic amenities . The applicant also supported CARDINAL of his children DATE . His wife worked at a school and her DATE salary was ORG . He did not have any savings and owned a fouryear - old NORP car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant 's request for exemption from the court fees . It held , referring to the case - law of ORG from DATE and DATE , that the donation of the applicant 's property to his children should be treated as a fraudulent disposal of the property with a view to fulfilling the eligibility requirements for exemption from court fees . Additionally , ORG considered that the applicant had adult children who had an obligation to support him financially if necessary . That obligation extended , in the court 's view , to helping the applicant in funding the court proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG considered that the applicant could have sold some of his property or mortgaged it . That way , in the court 's view , the applicant would have been able to secure sufficient means for funding the litigation . ORG underlined that the applicant 's case was not one in which it had been necessary to file a claim immediately . The court observed that a party intending to institute court proceedings had to take into account the costs involved and secure them in advance from the income received over a longer period of time . Only in exceptional cases , when the immediate institution of proceedings was necessary ( on account of the limitation of actions ) , could a party rely exclusively on his or her current income .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant , when increasing his claim to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , had to take into account the obligation to pay the relevant fees , even more so given that it had not been necessary to modify his claim at that particular time .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG decision . He submitted that he had not disposed of any of his property in order to obtain an exemption from court fees since he still owned the property in PERSON . However , that latter property did not generate any profit . The applicant disagreed with ORG regarding the motives behind his donation . He stated that he had simply wanted to provide for his children 's future . The applicant emphasised that he had no possibility of securing the required amount of court fees and that the impugned decision had been based on speculation about his financial status . Replying to ORG argument about the possibility of securing the necessary funds over a period of time , the applicant submitted that given his current level of income and his incapacity for work , he would never be able to secure the necessary funds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG . It further concurred with ORG finding that disposing of the applicant 's property in LOC by way of donation could not justify another exemption from court fees .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on a later unknown date the applicant paid the remaining CARDINAL instalments and the court proceeded with the examination of the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . Following a request of DATE , ORG exempted the defendants S.K and PERSON from the court fees at a session held in camera on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant once again increased his claim to ORG MONEY ( instead of the initial ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The court fee was set at ORG CARDINAL and the applicant asked for an exemption . The request was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The court held that while it was true that the applicant and his wife supported themselves from small invalidity pensions , the applicant owned a house in LOC . The court stressed that since the applicant had donated his property to his children , they should have helped him with the court fees . Lastly , the court held that the applicant did not justify the increased claim by any new facts or evidence but merely asked for a higher sum . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld this decision repeating the same reasons .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE the applicant again decided to modify his claim and increased it , this time to ORG MONEY ( instead of the ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . On DATE ORG dismissed his request to exempt him from court fees . The court referred to the reasons previously given .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment and dismissed the applicant 's claim . The judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legal provisions applicable at the material time and questions of practice are set out in paragraphs CARDINAL of the judgment delivered by ORG on DATE in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no .
