The organisation says that it is a successor of and continues the \u2018 national liberation struggle of the NORP nation\u2019 , including the \u2018 NORP fighters who fell victim to NORP State terrorism and GPE Its articles of association ] specify that [ the organisation ] will respect the territorial integrity of GPE , but only if \u2018 [ it is ] consistent with international law and international agreements on human rights , fundamental freedoms and the rights of GPE ; [ that the organisation ] will \u2018 express and safeguard the civil , social and economic rights of the NORP who live on NORP soil under NORP occupation ( jurisdiction ) and of the NORP who live in GPE The articles also ] insist that \u2018 the process of assimilation in LOC must be stopped\u2019 . Obviously , the aim is to distort the historical truth , to ignore the NORP character of certain geographical regions [ and ] to provoke overt opposition by CARDINAL part of the population to another . This also threatens the territorial integrity of the country , whereas Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of [ the LAW ] prohibits organisations from engaging in such activities .", "Even if , despite [ what was found ] above , it is assumed that the activities of [ Ilinden ] do not run counter to [ the LAW ] , its LAW provides that associations may not pursue political goals and carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties . The political character of the aims [ of ORG ] is clearly shown by [ its articles of association ] , while the [ applicable law ] provides that organisations seeking to engage in political , tradeunion or religious activities must be regulated in a separate statute .", "All this leads to the conclusion that what is sought is the registration of an association whose aims are illegal . It can not be accepted that what is at issue is an organisation seeking to preserve the historical traditions and the cultural riches of a specific community . ... The realisation of the true aims [ of ORG ] would no doubt be at the expense of the unity of the NORP nation [ and ] the sovereignty and the territorial integrity [ of the country ] , which is declared inviolable by LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Ilinden appealed to ORG , arguing , inter alia , that it was not threatening the country \u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity , nor trying to distort the \u201c historical truth \u201d . The refusal to register it was in breach of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , as it was based on the fact that it expressed views which differed from the officially sanctioned ones . It was not proposing to engage in activities characteristic solely of a political party either .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It held , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c ORG ... received an application by the managing council of the newly formed non - profit association [ Ilinden ] , requesting it to be registered ... in the special register kept by the court ... In [ the impugned judgment ORG ] refused to register the association ... , holding that [ Ilinden ] \u2019s goals and the means for attaining them have a political character and run counter to the spirit of [ the DATE LAW ] and the provisions of the [ LAW ] . This court shares those conclusions .", "The evidence submitted alongside the application for registration , namely the articles of the nonprofit association [ Ilinden ] , TIME of its founding meeting , held on DATE , a list of the founders , CARDINAL sample signatures of the members of the managing council , notarised and expressly stating that these persons wish to take part in the association \u2019s management and representation , and their criminal records , shows that a founding meeting was held on DATE . It was attended by CARDINAL individuals , who unanimously resolved to form a nonprofit association named [ Ilinden ] , adopted its articles and elected a managing council consisting of CARDINAL members . However , the wording of the articles \u2013 clauses CARDINAL and CARDINAL , [ which set out ] the association \u2019s goals and the means for attaining them \u2013 reveal their political character , which is impermissible for a nonprofit association . This follows from the interpretation of paragraph CARDINAL of [ the DATE LAW ] , which provides that organisations intending to carry out political , tradeunion or religious activities must be regulated by separate statutes . For instance , in clause CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) [ and ] ( CARDINAL ) of its articles the organisation proclaims itself as being a successor of and continuing the \u2018 national liberation struggle of the NORP nation\u2019 , including \u2018 the NORP fighters who fell victim to NORP State terrorism and PERSON , declares that \u2018 it will express and defend the civil , social and economic rights of the NORP who live on NORP soil under NORP occupation ( jurisdiction ) and of the NORP living in ORG , insists that \u2018 the assimilation process in GPE must ORG , etc . All those goals set by the newly formed organisation are directed towards distorting the historical truth and ignoring the NORP character of certain geographical regions , with a view to stirring overt confrontation between one group of NORP citizens and another , which imperils both the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation . This is in breach of the imperative rule of LAW of [ the LAW ] which provides that \u2018 organisations whose activities are directed against the sovereignty [ or ] the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation , towards the incitement of racial , national , ethnical or religious enmity ... are prohibited\u2019 . Moreover , the political goals and the ways of attaining them , set by the organisation in clause CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of its articles , are in breach of paragraph CARDINAL of [ the DATE LAW ] and LAW of [ LAW ] . Apart from that , the founders have elected CARDINAL members of the managing council , in breach of the articles which provide , in clause ORG , that the first managing council will consist of CARDINAL members who will manage and represent the association ( clause CARDINAL ) ) . This was equally in breach of section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) in conjunction with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of [ the DATE LAW ] , because it engenders uncertainty as to the manner of managing and representing the organisation .", "In view of the foregoing , this court finds that the newly formed organisation [ Ilinden ] has goals , ways of attaining them and representation which run counter to the provisions of [ the DATE LAW ] . For this reason , it should not be entered on the register of non - profit legal persons kept by [ ORG ] . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ilinden appealed on points of law . It argued , inter alia , that , contrary to ORG ruling , its articles , when read properly , showed that it did not intend to participate in political life . Nor was it trying to distort the historical truth \u2013 its aim was to promote it . The refusal to register it violated its right to freedom of association , enshrined in LAW , and was in breach of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

It is not permissible for a nonprofit association to carry out political , tradeunion or religious activities . The assertion in the appeal that [ Ilinden ] does not seek to engage in political struggles is not substantiated .

But even if [ the court ] were to accept the argument in the appeal that the organisation does not seek to attain goals which run counter to the constitutional order , those goals run counter to the [ DATE LAW ] , as they are characteristic of a political party , not of a nonprofit association . Thus , the alleged violation of LAW ] has not been made out .", "The argument in the appeal that the articles of association in reality merely mention the minimum number of members of the managing council , without further restrictions , is unfounded .

That is , clause ORG ) does not merely set a minimum , as claimed in the appeal . For this reason , [ ORG ] correctly found that the imperative rule of section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) in conjunction with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the [ DATE LAW ] has not been complied with \u2013 the manner of managing and representing the organisation is unclear .", "For the foregoing reasons , the court is of the opinion that the grounds of appeal have not been made out and that [ the impugned judgment ] should be upheld . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
