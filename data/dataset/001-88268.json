GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in GPE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "In DATE the applicant , a NORP national and therefore , at the time of the events in question , a national of a ORG outside ORG , commenced employment with a GPE company as a lorry driver . The contract was governed by GPE law and the lorry was registered in the GPE . The applicant was in possession of an employment certificate ( PERSON ) issued by ORG ( ORG ) which stated that his employer covered the transport risks and expenses and that the applicant was legally employed . He did not reside in the GPE , worked exclusively outside the GPE and , at the relevant time , had not ( yet ) been issued with a GPE work permit .", "On DATE and DATE , on his way from GPE to GPE and GPE to GPE , he was subjected to checks by the NORP police . After both events criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant .", "On DATE the NORP ORG convicted him of remaining in the country illegally in both cases and sentenced him to an overall fine of MONEY ( equivalent to MONEY ( EUR ) ) . The decision was based on sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW , see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . The court found that the exception to the requirement to hold a residence permit provided for in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) of the Order implementing LAW ( Durchf\u00fchrungsverordnung zum Ausl\u00e4ndergesetz , see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) did not apply as the applicant \u2019s journeys from GPE and GPE to GPE did not have a direct connection with the GPE , the ORG Member State where the company was established . That , however , the court pointed out , was an implicit condition of the provision in question , as demonstrated by its genesis and its aim of preventing bogus companies being set up and as further confirmed in a statement by ORG addressed to the applicant \u2019s legal counsel on DATE . On that ground the court found that the question whether the applicant was legally employed in the GPE was not decisive . It further established DATE referring also to the fact that information to that effect had been circulated by the authorities \u2013 that the applicant at least could have known that his actions were illegal .", "On DATE the GPE employment agency ( Arbeidsvoorziening ) issued the applicant with a work permit ( Tewerkstellingsvergunning ) allowing him to load and unload goods in the GPE . Thereafter the applicant also transported goods from and to the GPE .", "On DATE the ORG , after hearing evidence from the executive director of the company which employed the applicant and obtaining a translation of the documents in NORP , quashed his conviction as regards the first offence on the ground that the applicant could not have known that his stay was illegal given that he had been subjected to checks before without any consequences . However , it upheld his conviction as regards the second offence and reduced the fine to LAW . As regards the second conviction it found that the exception to the requirement to hold a residence permit , provided for in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) of the Order implementing LAW , did not apply as at the time of the events in question the applicant had not been in possession of a GPE work permit ( it found that the employment certificate could not be equated with a work permit , as it merely stated that the applicant \u2019s employer covered the transport risks and expenses and that the applicant was legally employed ) and had been working exclusively outside the GPE . In this latter respect it pointed out , referring also to a statement by ORG , that section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) of the Order implementing LAW was clearly aimed at benefiting only those employees whose ( legal ) residence and employment were actually in the Community Member State where the company was established and not those who , like the applicant , worked exclusively outside that Member ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It upheld the finding that , at the relevant time , the applicant had not been in possession of a GPE work permit . In this respect it also pointed out that only from DATE had he been entitled to work as a lorry driver in the GPE . Furthermore , it found that the applicant \u2019s case could not be compared to the case of PERSON ( ECJ , see below ) as , unlike Mr PERSON , the applicant was not in possession of a work permit issued by the ORG where the company was established .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the constitutional complaint , without indicating any reasons .", "CARDINAL . Relevant domestic law", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides :", "\u201c Any person entering or remaining in GPE must have a residence permit . In order to facilitate the residence of non - nationals in GPE ORG , with the consent of the GPE , shall issue an order providing for exemptions . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c Any person who , contrary to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , remains in GPE without a residence permit ... shall be liable to imprisonment for not more than one year or to payment of a fine . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) of the Order implementing LAW provides for an exception to the requirement to hold a residence permit if a person employed by a company from another ORG and resident in that ORG does not remain in GPE for DATE in DATE , if he or she :", "\u201c works in cross - border passenger or goods traffic , if the company employing him or her is established in a Member State of the ORG , if the vehicle is registered in that country and if the employee has the residence and work permits required in that country . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Judgment of the ECJ of DATE , PERSON v. Office des Migrations internationales , Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL", "In this judgment the ECJ ruled that under ORG a Member ORG was precluded from requiring undertakings established in another Member ORG , and entering the first Member ORG in order to provide services , to obtain further work permits in the ORG where the services were to be carried out for those employees who were nationals of a non - member country but who had been issued with work permits in the Member ORG where the undertaking was established ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
