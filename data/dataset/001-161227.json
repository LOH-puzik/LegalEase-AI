MONTENEGRO", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Jon Fridrik Kj\u00f8lbro;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Paul Lemmens;St\u00e9phanie Mourou-Vikstr\u00f6m;Georges Ravarani", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a LOC national , who was born in DATE and lives in ORG . She is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the Municipality of ORG issued a decision appointing a ORG ( ORG za povra\u0107aj i obe\u0161te\u0107enje , hereinafter \u201c the Commission \u201d ) . This decision was not confirmed by ORG and the remuneration of the members of the Commission was never specified . ORG functioned until DATE , when it was replaced by a new one . The applicant was a member of both Commissions .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant instituted proceedings against the GPE seeking compensation in the amount of ORG CARDINAL in respect of remuneration for her work in the ORG DATE and DATE , as she had not been paid during the said period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in ORG ruled against the applicant on the ground that the ORG had had no legitimacy during the specified time , given that the decision on its appointment had not been confirmed by ORG , and as the remuneration for the said period had never been defined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE upheld the first - instance judgment , essentially endorsing the reasons contained therein .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE overturned a firstinstance judgment issued in respect of CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s colleagues , and awarded him compensation in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of remuneration for his work in the same Commission in the same period , plus accompanying interest and the costs of the proceedings . In doing so the court held , in particular , that the Commission had had a temporary character by virtue of the law itself and that therefore the firstinstance court \u2019s conclusion that it had lacked legitimacy was wrong . Also section CARDINAL of ORG DATE specifically provided that if the ORG did not confirm a certain decision or the President of the Municipality did not submit it for confirmation , the decision would cease to be in force as of DATE when the ORG terminated its session . Therefore , it had to be considered that the ORG had ceased to operate when the decision on its appointment was not confirmed , that is on DATE in the given case . The court noted that ORG had also taken into account that no act defined remuneration of the members of the Commission . However , ORG held that , pursuant to CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG , members of ORG had the status of civil servants , and were therefore entitled to remuneration . In any event claimants should not suffer any detriment on account of the legislature \u2019s failure to define the exact amount of their remuneration .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provided that ORG would establish ORG within DATE as of the date when this Act entered into force . LAW ( CARDINAL ) further provided , inter alia , that members of the ORG had the status of civil servants .", "CARDINAL . This Act entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The said amendments introduced section ORG , which specified that the President of the Municipality could temporarily issue decisions falling within the ORG \u2019s competence , if the ORG could not convene or for some other reason it was impossible for it to work and the said decisions were of interest for exercising ORG rights and freedoms . The President of the GPE had to submit such a decision to the ORG for its confirmation as soon as the ORG could convene .", "CARDINAL . Section QUANTITY provides that the president of the GPE can temporarily issue decisions falling within the ORG \u2019s competence , if the ORG can not convene or for some other reason it is impossible for it to work , and the absence of these decisions would endanger lives or property of great value . The President of the GPE shall submit such a decision to the ORG for its confirmation at its first session . If the ORG does not confirm such a decision or the President does not submit it for confirmation , the decision shall cease to be in force ( prestaje da va\u017ei ) on DATE when the session of the ORG terminates .", "CARDINAL . This Act entered into force on DATE except for LAW V , including section DATE , which was to enter into force as of the next local elections , which took place in ORG on DATE . Until then the relevant provisions of the earlier Act , including section ORG , continued in force .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) in force at the time provided , inter alia , that an appeal on points of law against a second - instance decision would not be admissible in pecuniary matters unless the value of the claim exceeded ORG CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) provided that exceptionally to the previous provision , an appeal on points of law was always admissible in disputes \u201c for loss of earnings or other work - related income when these compensations were established or quashed for the first time \u201d ( zbog izgubljene zarade ili drugih prihoda po osnovu rada kada su te od\u0161tete prvi put odre\u0111ene ili ukinute ) .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL set out details as to employment - related disputes . Section CARDINAL provided in particular that an appeal on points of law was allowed only in disputes relating to employment , as well as continuation and termination thereof .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , taken together , provided that ORG , when deciding upon an appeal on points of law , could either overturn the second - instance decision in cases when the substantive law was misapplied , or quash it and order a re - trial when the facts were incompletely established due to a misapplication of substantive law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
