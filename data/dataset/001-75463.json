Unpaid tax was also a ground to impose a prohibition against leaving GPE under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(v ) of the PERSON on Sojourn of Aliens . Although this provision did not provide expressly for a confiscation of a foreign passport , if applied in conjunction with the relevant regulations , it clearly allowed such measure in respect of a person against whom there had been a decision prohibiting his departure from GPE .

Under the relevant fiscal law , renunciation of NORP nationality is not among the grounds on which an individual may be relieved from the obligation to pay tax liabilities .", "CARDINAL . In the law of several member states a possibility for imposing a ban on leaving one \u2019s country due to tax obligations is expressly provided for : GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . In GPE and GPE the legal provisions allowing restrictions on the right to leave one \u2019s country due to tax debts have now been abolished .", "CARDINAL . In most states the possibility to resort to a travel ban for unpaid taxes is not unconditional . In particular , in GPE , a passport application can be denied if there is a justified suspicion that the applicant was going to evade a tax obligation . In the GPE , the law states that a travel document can be refused or invalidated if there is good reason to believe that the person is neglecting his obligation to pay taxes . In GPE , a passport can be withdrawn or its issue refused to a citizen upon a court \u2019s or tax authority \u2019s request when the person avoids the enforcement of the decision , or obstructs it or there is reason to believe that he or she will do so ( an alien \u2019s freedom to leave the country can also be restricted ) . In GPE \u201c unfulfilled obligations established by a court \u201d can serve as grounds for a travel ban only if there is a serious risk that the person \u2019s travel abroad will render the fulfilment of the obligation impossible . In GPE , under ORG DATE , a debtor may be barred from leaving the country if that is essential for the enforcement of a court decision and seizure of property does not provide sufficient security ( a prohibition order can not be issued if , in view of the nature of the case and all of the circumstances involved , it would be a disproportionately severe measure and the order automatically ceases to have effect after DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . A further area in which countries resort to travel bans , is bankruptcy proceedings . The laws of several countries stipulate that a court may impose a prohibition against a debtor leaving the country in order to secure his presence before the court ( e.g. GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ) . Most member States\u2019 legal systems provide for prohibitions against leaving the country in respect of defendants in criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In common - law jurisdictions , travel bans may be imposed by way of injunction .", "DATE . In GPE , the tax authorities may seek from the courts a ORG injunction ( an order preventing the other party from disposing of assets outside the country ) , an injunction under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG to restrain the other party from leaving the jurisdiction ( \u201c ORG injunction \u201d ) or the writ of \u201c ne exeat regno \u201d , an ancient writ which has much the same effect .", "CARDINAL . The simple fact that the person concerned has failed to pay would not be enough to satisfy the criteria for an injunction . In order to obtain an injunction under s. CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) restraining someone from leaving the country , the claimant must persuade the court that it is \u201c necessary and convenient \u201d to grant the order , for example , that the other party has information which he is refusing to disclose and which , if he is allowed to leave GPE , he will never disclose . A writ of \u201c ne exeat regno \u201d may be issued if several conditions are satisfied , such as , inter alia , cause to believe that the other party \u2019s absence from the jurisdiction would materially prejudice the claimant in pursuing the action .", "CARDINAL . Because the orders above are interferences with the liberty of the subject , they should last no longer than necessary \u2013 e.g. until the other party has disclosed all the information that they were refusing to disclose . The orders can be discharged on grounds that one of the requisite conditions was not in fact fulfilled but also on \u2018 equitable\u2019 grounds .", "CARDINAL . While the right to travel abroad is recognised as an implicit constitutional right in national case law , the courts have also recognised restrictions , in particular where there are \u201c undischarged obligations \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In civil contexts , NORP courts , like LANGUAGE courts , may make use of ORG injunctions or ORG injunctions , as described above . ORG has held that such orders could be granted only in exceptional and compelling circumstances . Probable cause for believing that the defendant is about to absent himself from the jurisdiction with the intention of frustrating the administration of justice and/or an order of the court is a condition for granting an injunction . The injunction should not be imposed for punitive reasons . The injunction ought not to be granted where a lesser remedy would suffice and it should be interim in nature and limited to the shortest possible period of time . The defendant \u2019s right to travel should be out - balanced by those of the plaintiff and the proper and effective administration of justice .", "CARDINAL .

The preparatory work of paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL reveals that , before agreeing on the general formula , the drafters had attempted first to come up with an exhaustive list of all grounds for restriction .

In the context of the complaint procedure , in the case of PERSON Gonz\u00e1lez del R\u00edo v. GPE , ORG was called to examine the proportionality of the restriction on the applicant \u2019s freedom to leave his country imposed in judicial proceedings which had been delayed . It held as follows :", "\u201c The ORG considers that pending judicial proceedings may justify restrictions on an individual \u2019s right to leave his country .

In this case , the restriction on Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019 freedom to leave GPE has been in force for DATE , and the date of its termination remains uncertain .
