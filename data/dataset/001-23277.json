GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP and NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( GPE ) .", "In DATE , the applicant started a relationship with L. They began living together in ORG \u2019s flat as from DATE and planned to get married once the applicant would have obtained his divorce from his second wife . At DATE it was confirmed that PERSON was pregnant . In DATE the relationship between the applicant and PERSON broke down and they ceased co - habiting .", "On DATE , during PERSON \u2019s pregnancy , the applicant applied to ORG ( ORG ) to be granted a right of access . This application was rejected by a decision of ORG of DATE . On DATE L. gave birth to a daughter S.", "The applicant , on his own initiative , recognised his paternity while the mother first contested it . On DATE she acknowledged that the applicant was the natural father of her daughter .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG , acting as guardianship court ( Vormundschaftsgericht ) , for a decision granting him a right of access ( GPE ) to his daughter . He also applied for an interim injunction on his right of access . On DATE ORG dismissed this request on the ground that it could not decide before holding a hearing on this question . A hearing was held on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant renewed his request for an interim injunction . On DATE ORG again dismissed this request considering that the question of access could only be resolved by means of an expert opinion .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing in the presence of the parties , an expert and the applicant \u2019s former wife as a witness .", "On DATE ORG , relying inter alia on a psychological expert opinion of DATE , granted the applicant a right of access to his daughter every DATE in the LOC of ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr soziale ORG ) .", "On appeal of the child \u2019s mother , ORG ( ORG ) quashed this decision on DATE after having heard the applicant , the child \u2019s mother and a representative of ORG on DATE .", "Referring to Articles DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch - see the section of LAW below ) , ORG held that a child should have personal contact with the father since , as a general rule , maintaining personal contact to both parents favoured a healthy development of the child . However , access against the will of the mother must be denied where the best interests of the child warranted such a decision . In the present case , there was serious reason to believe that the animosity between the parents would be detrimental to the child . Unlike the expert , ORG found that granting the applicant a right of access would not help the parents to clarify their respective parental roles , to improve their relationship and to co - operate . In particular , the applicant \u2019s conduct vis - \u00e0 - vis the child \u2019s mother adversely affected the child . He was not willing or capable to respect the legitimate interests of the child \u2019s mother or the special situation of the child living with her mother . The applicant did not accept that the child \u2019s mother had put an end to their short relationship which had lasted from DATE . This was shown by the fact that he had been determined to obtain information about her pregnancy from her gynaecologist and to be informed about the address of the clinic where the child was to be born in order to be present at the child \u2019s birth . Moreover , prior to the child \u2019s birth , he introduced several court proceedings with a view to being granted a right of access and having his surname added to the child \u2019s surname . DATE after the child \u2019s birth , he applied again to be granted a right of access and requested that a coercive fine be imposed on the child \u2019s mother . Although the applicant could not be criticised for claiming a right of access , his conduct showed that he was seeking a de facto parental authority over the child . Against this background , ORG found that , if the applicant were granted a right of access , he would oppose any decision by the mother and conflict and numerous new court proceedings would be unavoidable . ORG concluded that , in these circumstances , the relationship between mother and child would continuously be disturbed . This would not be in the child \u2019s best interests .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) .", "On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG refused to entertain this complaint .", "On DATE , after the entry into force of the amended Law on Family Matters ( Reform zum Kindschaftsrecht - see the section of LAW below ) , the applicant applied again to ORG for a decision granting him a right of access to his daughter .", "On DATE ORG heard the parties and a social worker of GPE . The social worker stated that he had made a visit to the applicant \u2019s home where the latter lived with his DATE daughter PERSON According to the social worker , there was no indication that granting the father a right of access would be contrary to the interests of S. He found , however , that for reasons of practicability the strained relations between the parents should first improve .", "On DATE ORG appointed a psychological expert to assess whether granting the applicant a right of access would adversely affect the child \u2019s well - being .", "On DATE the expert informed the court that , due to his excessive workload , he was not in a position to commence his assessment before DATE .", "On DATE and DATE the applicant applied to ORG for provisional measures granting him a right of access to his daughter .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG complaining that ORG failed to take the required action . He further applied for an interim measure granting him a right of access to his daughter .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for interim measures considering that the unusually strong tensions existing between the parents made it necessary to await the expert opinion with a view to determining the question of access . According to ORG , to grant such a right provisionally would be more likely to be disadvantageous than advantageous to the child \u2019s well - being .", "Thereafter , the applicant unsuccessfully instituted various proceedings challenging the judge of ORG , PERSON , and , subsequently , the judges PERSON , NORP S. of the Hamm Court of Appeal ( GPE ) for bias . The applicant also challenged the psychological expert on the ground that he had refused to indicate whether or not he intended to reply to all the questions of ORG , including those which , in the applicant \u2019s opinion , were unlawful . Furthermore , the applicant contested the expert \u2019s impartiality alleging that , as the appointed court expert , he might be influenced by the well - known hostile attitude of judge PERSON towards men .", "In a letter of DATE the applicant informed ORG of his intention not to co - operate any further with the expert and applied for an immediate decision .", "On DATE ORG , sitting in a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint lodged on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant again requested ORG for an interim injunction granting him a right of access to his daughter .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the request .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application of DATE to be granted a right of access . In reaching the above decision , ORG had regard to its decision of DATE , according to which it was not in the best interests of S. to grant the applicant a right of access . Pursuant to LAW , as drafted by the amended LAW , this decision might be open to discussion should the circumstances on which the decision was based change . However , with a view to establishing the relevant new facts on this question , the court found to be dependent on the assistance of the psychological expert . Due to the applicant \u2019s refusal to co - operate with that expert , this question could not be resolved and the requested right of access had to be denied .", "The applicant appealed against the CARDINAL above decisions to ORG .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against these decisions .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against this decision with ORG and requested for interim measures .", "On DATE ORG , sitting in a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to entertain both the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint and his request for interim measures .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( PERSON ) to be informed of the child \u2019s whereabouts . On DATE he requested ORG to be granted a right of access . He also applied for an interim injunction . He stated that the previous court decisions were in breach of fundamental and human rights and had to be revised in the light of the quickly changing circumstances of the child . He alleged that the child \u2019s mother was a member of a radical feminist sect which professed the superiority of women over men and was said to perform strange rituals , including the killing of children . As soon as she had learned that she was expecting a healthy daughter , she gave up her feigned plan to get married and , with the assistance of NORP female civil servants and judges , deprived him of the common child .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s requests for reasons of competence . It considered that ORG was the competent court having regard to the residence of the child \u2019s mother .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision on the ground that the applicant had failed to request the transfer of the case to the competent district court .", "On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint lodged against this decision and dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for an interim injunction .", "The relevant provision of LAW ( ORG ) concerning custody and access for a child born in wedlock was worded as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
