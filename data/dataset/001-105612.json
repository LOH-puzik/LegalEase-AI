The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in GPE in DATE . He played for the NORP basketball team until , following his refusal to join ORG , he left GPE in DATE and lived in GPE and GPE . He moved to GPE in DATE , where he made a claim for asylum and was granted indefinite leave to remain . He was granted NORP nationality in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant and his CARDINAL eldest children travelled from GPE to GPE , via GPE . He was arrested and questioned in GPE by GPE intelligence officers , who released him after TIME , permitting him and his children to continue their journey to GPE , where they arrived on DATE . On DATE GPE soldiers , apparently acting on information provided by the NORP intelligence services , arrested the applicant at his sister \u2019s house in GPE . He was taken to GPE in a NORP military aircraft and then to the Sha\u2019aibah ORG in GPE , a detention centre run by NORP forces . He was held in internment there until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was held on the basis that his internment was necessary for imperative reasons of security in GPE . He was believed by the NORP authorities to have been personally responsible for recruiting terrorists outside GPE with a view to the commission of atrocities there ; for facilitating the travel into GPE of an identified terrorist explosives expert ; for conspiring with that explosives expert to conduct attacks with improvised explosive devices against ORG in the areas around GPE and GPE ; and for conspiring with the explosives expert and members of an NORP terrorist cell in the LOC to smuggle high - tech detonation equipment into GPE for use in attacks against ORG . No criminal charges were brought against him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s internment was initially authorised by the senior officer in the detention facility . Reviews were conducted DATE and DATE by ORG ( ORG ) . This comprised the senior officer in the detention facility and army legal and military personnel . Owing to the sensitivity of the intelligence material upon which the applicant \u2019s arrest and detention had been based , CARDINAL members of the ORG were permitted to examine it . Their recommendations were passed to the Commander of ORG ( LOC ) ( \u201c the Commander \u201d ) , who himself examined the intelligence file on the applicant and took the decision to continue the internment . DATE a DATE review was carried out by the Commander , on the basis of the recommendations of the ORG . DATE and DATE the decision to intern the applicant was taken by the ORG itself , which , during this period , included as members the Commander together with members of the legal , intelligence and other army staffs . There was no procedure for disclosure of evidence or for an oral hearing , but representations could be made by the internee in writing which were considered by the legal branch and put before the ORG for consideration . The CARDINAL Commanders who authorised the applicant \u2019s internment in DATE and DATE gave evidence to the domestic courts that there was a substantial weight of intelligence material indicating that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting the applicant of the matters alleged against him .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant had been detained for DATE , the internment fell to be reviewed by ORG ( ORG ) . This body included senior representatives of ORG , the NORP interim government and the ambassador for GPE . It met once and thereafter delegated powers to ORG , which comprised NORP representatives and officers from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG signed an order depriving the applicant of NORP citizenship , on the ground that it was conducive to the public good . The Secretary of ORG claimed , inter alia , that the applicant had connections with violent NORP groups , in GPE and elsewhere , and had been responsible for recruiting terrorists outside GPE and facilitating their travel and the smuggling of bomb parts into GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from internment on DATE and travelled to GPE . He appealed against the deprivation of his NORP citizenship . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal , having heard both open and closed evidence , during a hearing where the applicant was represented by special advocates ( see , further , NORP and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) . ORG held that , for reasons set out in detail in a closed judgment , it was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Secretary of ORG had proved that the applicant had facilitated the travel to GPE of a terrorist explosives expert and conspired with him to smuggle explosives into GPE and to conduct improvised explosive device attacks against ORG around GPE and GPE . The applicant did not appeal against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a judicial review claim in GPE , challenging the lawfulness of his continued detention and also the refusal of the Secretary of ORG to return him to GPE . The Secretary of ORG accepted that the applicant \u2019s detention within a NORP military facility brought him within the jurisdiction of GPE under LAW . He also accepted that the detention did not fall within any of the permitted cases set out in LAW . However , the Secretary of ORG contended that LAW did not apply to the applicant because his detention was authorised by ORG DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that , as a matter of international law , the effect of the ORG was to displace LAW . He also denied that his refusal to return the applicant to GPE was unreasonable . It was argued on behalf of the applicant that LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had no application since , inter alia , Resolution CARDINAL placed no obligation on GPE and/or since LAW placed an obligation on member GPE to protect human rights .", "CARDINAL . Both ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE and ORG in its judgment of DATE unanimously held that ORG CARDINAL explicitly authorised ORG to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in GPE , in accordance with the annexed letter from the GPE Secretary of ORG . By the practice of the member ORG , a ORG which acted under such an authority was treated as having agreed to carry out the ORG for the purposes of LAW and as being bound by it for the purposes of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . GPE obligation under LAW therefore took precedence over its obligations under the LAW . ORG also held that , under LAW of LAW DATE , since the applicant was detained in GPE , the law governing his claim for damages for false imprisonment was NORP law ( see NORP ( on the application of PERSON ) v. Secretary of ORG [ DATE ] DATE ( Admin ) ; [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Lord PERSON of GPE , Lord PERSON of PERSON , ORG of GPE , Lord ORG and Lord PERSON of ORG - under - Heywood : see PERSON ( on the application of PERSON ) ( ORG ) ( Appellant ) v. Secretary of ORG ) [ DATE ] ORG DATE ) . The Secretary of ORG raised a new argument before ORG , claiming that by virtue of ORG and DATE the detention of the applicant was attributable to ORG and was thus outside the scope of the Convention . Lord PERSON introduced the attribution issue as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It was common ground between the parties that the governing principle is that expressed by ORG in DATE ORG on ORG ... \u201d", "He referred to the ORG \u2019s reasoning in PERSON v. GPE and GPE v. GPE , GPE and GPE ( ( dec . ) [ ORG ] , nos . CARDINAL and GPE , DATE ) ( hereinafter \u201c Behrami and Saramati \u201d ) and to the factual situation in GPE at the relevant time and continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Against the factual background described above a number of questions must be asked in the present case . Were GPE forces placed at the disposal of the ORG ? Did the ORG exercise effective control over the conduct of GPE forces ? Is the specific conduct of the GPE forces in detaining the appellant to be attributed to the ORG rather than the GPE ? Did the ORG have effective command and control over the conduct of GPE forces when they detained the appellant ? Were the GPE forces part of a ORG peacekeeping force in GPE ? In my opinion the answer to all these questions is in the negative .", "CARDINAL . The ORG did not dispatch ORG to GPE . The CPA [ Coalition Provisional Authority ] was established by GPE , notably the GPE , not the ORG . When ORG became Occupying Powers in GPE they had no ORG mandate . Thus when the case of Mr PERSON reached the ORG [ of ORG ] as one of those considered in NORP ( PERSON and Others ) v. Secretary of ORG ) ( ORG intervening ) [ DATE ] UKHL CARDINAL , [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL the Secretary of ORG accepted that the GPE was liable under LAW for any ill - treatment Mr PERSON suffered , while unsuccessfully denying liability under LAW DATE . It has not , to my knowledge , been suggested that the treatment of detainees at FAC was attributable to the ORG rather than the GPE . Following ORG [ ORG ] DATE in DATE the role of the ORG was a limited one focused on humanitarian relief and reconstruction , a role strengthened but not fundamentally altered by UNSCR CARDINAL in DATE . By ORG , and again by UNSCR CARDINAL in DATE , the ORG gave ORG express authority to take steps to promote security and stability in GPE , but ( adopting the distinction formulated by ORG in paragraph CARDINAL of its judgment in ORG was not delegating its power by empowering the GPE to exercise its function but was authorising the GPE to carry out functions it could not perform itself . At no time did the GPE or the GPE disclaim responsibility for the conduct of their forces or the ORG accept it . It can not realistically be said that GPE and GPE forces were under the effective command and control of the ORG , or that GPE forces were under such command and control when they detained the appellant .", "CARDINAL . The analogy with the situation in GPE breaks down , in my opinion , at almost every point . The international security and civil presences in GPE were established at the express behest of the ORG and operated under its auspices , with UNMIK [ ORG in GPE ] a subsidiary organ of the ORG . ORG in GPE was not established at the behest of the ORG , was not mandated to operate under ORG auspices and was not a subsidiary organ of the ORG . There was no delegation of ORG power in GPE . It is quite true that duties to report were imposed in GPE as in GPE . But the ORG \u2019s proper concern for the protection of human rights and observance of humanitarian law called for no less , and it is CARDINAL thing to receive reports , another to exercise effective command and control . It does not seem to me significant that in each case the ORG reserved power to revoke its authority , since it could clearly do so whether or not it reserved power to do so .", "CARDINAL . I would resolve this first issue in favour of the appellant and against the Secretary of ORG . \u201d", "ORG observed in this connection :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... I agree with [ Lord PERSON ] that the analogy with the situation in GPE breaks down at almost every point . ORG made submissions to ORG in GPE v. GPE , GPE v. GPE , GPE and GPE ... concerning the respective roles of UNMIK [ ORG in GPE ] and ORG [ ORG - led ORG ] in clearing mines , which was the subject of the Behrami [ and ORG ] case . It did not deny that these were ORG operations for which the ORG might be responsible . It seems to me unlikely in the extreme that ORG would accept that the acts of the [ ORG ] were in any way attributable to the ORG . My noble and learned friend , Lord PERSON of ORG - under - Heywood , has put his finger on the essential distinction . The ORG \u2019s own role in GPE was completely different from its role in GPE . Its concern in GPE was for the protection of human rights and the observance of humanitarian law as well [ as ] to protect its own humanitarian operations there . It looked to others to restore the peace and security which had broken down in the aftermath of events for which those others were responsible . \u201d", "Lord PERSON similarly agreed with Lord PERSON on this issue ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Lord PERSON also distinguished the situation in GPE from that in GPE , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . To my mind it follows that any material distinction between the CARDINAL cases must be found ... in the very circumstances in which the [ ORG ] came to be authorised and mandated in the first place . The delegation to ORG [ ORG - led ORG ] of the ORG \u2019s function of maintaining security was , the ORG observed [ in PERSON and PERSON ] , \u2018 neither presumed nor implicit but rather prior and explicit in ORG . Resolution CARDINAL decided ( paragraph CARDINAL ) \u2018 on the deployment in GPE , under ORG auspices , of international civil and security ORG \u2013 the civil presence being UNMIK [ ORG in GPE ] , recognised by ORG in PERSON [ and ORG ] ( paragraph CARDINAL ) as \u2018 a subsidiary organ of the UN\u2019 ; the security presence being ORG . PERSON was , therefore , expressly formed under ORG auspices . Paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG \u2018 [ a]uthorise[d ] member ORG and relevant international organisations to establish the international security presence in GPE as set out in point CARDINAL of CARDINAL ... \u2019 . CARDINAL of FAC stated : \u2018 The international security presence with substantial ORG participation must be deployed under unified command and control and authorised to establish a safe environment for all people in GPE and to facilitate the safe return to their homes of all displaced persons and refugees.\u2019", "CARDINAL . Resolution CARDINAL , by contrast , was adopted on DATE during the GPE \u2019s and GPE \u2019s post - combat occupation of GPE and in effect gave recognition to those occupying forces as an existing security presence . ...", "...", "CARDINAL . Nor did the position change when Resolution CARDINAL was adopted on DATE , DATE before the end of the occupation and the transfer of authority from the CPA [ ORG ] to the interim government of GPE on DATE . ... Nothing either in the ORG [ CARDINAL ] itself or in the letters annexed suggested for a moment that the [ ORG ] had been under or was now being transferred to ORG authority and control . True , the [ ORG ] was acting throughout under LAW [ of ORG ] . But it does not follow that the ORG is therefore to be regarded as having assumed ultimate authority or control over the ORG . The precise meaning of the term \u2018 ultimate authority and control\u2019 I have found somewhat elusive . But it can not automatically vest or remain in the ORG every time there is an authorisation of ORG powers under LAW , else much of the analysis in Behrami [ and ORG ] would be mere surplusage . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON dissented on this point . He found that the legal basis on which the members of ORG ( ORG ) were operating in GPE could not be distinguished from that on which NORP forces in ORG were operating during the period of the applicant \u2019s internment . He explained his views as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . There is an obvious difference between the factual position in GPE that lay behind the Behrami [ and ORG ] case and the factual position in GPE that lies behind the present case . The forces making up ORG went into GPE , for the first time , as members of ORG and in terms of ORG . By contrast , ORG were in GPE and , indeed , in occupation of GPE , for DATE before ORG adopted Resolution CARDINAL , authorising the creation of the [ ORG ] , on DATE .", "...", "CARDINAL . It respectfully appears to me that the mere fact that Resolution CARDINAL was adopted before the forces making up ORG entered GPE was legally irrelevant to the issue in PERSON [ and ORG ] . What mattered was that LAW had been adopted before the NORP members of ORG detained Mr Saramati . So the Resolution regulated the legal position at the time of his detention . Equally , in the present case , the fact that the NORP and other ORG were in GPE long before Resolution CARDINAL was adopted is legally irrelevant for present purposes . What matters is that Resolution CARDINAL was adopted before the NORP forces detained the appellant and so it regulated the legal position at that time . As renewed , the provisions of that ORG have continued to do so ever since .", "...", "CARDINAL . If CARDINAL compares the terms of CARDINAL and Resolution CARDINAL , for present purposes there appears to be no relevant legal difference between the CARDINAL Forces . Of course , in the case of GPE , there was no civil administration and there were no bodies of troops already assembled in GPE whom ORG could authorise to assume the necessary responsibilities . In paragraph CARDINAL of Resolution CARDINAL the ORG accordingly decided \u2018 on the deployment in GPE , under ORG auspices , of international civil and security ORG . Because there were no suitable troops on the ground , in paragraph CARDINAL of Resolution CARDINAL the ORG had actually to authorise the establishing of the international security presence and then to authorise it to carry out various responsibilities .", "CARDINAL . By contrast , in DATE , in GPE there were already forces in place , especially NORP and NORP forces , whom ORG could authorise to assume the necessary responsibilities . So it did not need to authorise the establishment of the [ ORG ] . In paragraph CARDINAL the ORG simply authorised \u2018 a ORG under unified command to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq\u2019 \u2013 thereby proceeding on the basis that there would indeed be a ORG under unified command . In paragraph CARDINAL the ORG urged member ORG to contribute forces to the [ ORG ] . Absolutely crucially , however , in paragraph CARDINAL it spelled out the mandate which it was giving to the [ ORG ] . By \u2018 ORG the [ ORG ] to take the measures required to fulfil its \u2018 mandate\u2019 , the ORG was asserting and exercising control over the [ ORG ] and was prescribing the mission that it was to carry out . The authorisation and mandate were to apply to all members of the [ ORG ] \u2013 the NORP and NORP , of course , but also those from member GPE who responded to the ORG \u2019s call to contribute forces to the [ ORG ] . The intention must have been that all would be in the same legal position . This confirms DATE as I have already held , at paragraph DATE the fact that the NORP forces were in GPE before Resolution CARDINAL was adopted is irrelevant to their legal position under that ORG and , indeed , under LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second issue before ORG was whether the provisions of LAW were qualified by the legal regime established pursuant to ORG DATE and subsequent resolutions . On this point , ORG unanimously held that LAW gave primacy to resolutions of ORG , even in relation to human rights agreements . Lord PERSON , with whom the other ORG agreed , explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... while the Secretary of ORG contends that the LAW [ of ORG ] , and UNSCRs [ ORG ] CARDINAL ( DATE ) , DATE ) , CARDINAL ( DATE ) and DATE ( DATE ) , impose an obligation on the GPE to detain the appellant which prevails over the appellant \u2019s conflicting right under LAW of LAW , the appellant insists that the UNSCRs referred to , read in the light of the LAW , at most authorise the GPE to take action to detain him but do not oblige it to do so , with the result that no conflict arises and LAW of the LAW ] is not engaged .", "CARDINAL . There is an obvious attraction in the appellant \u2019s argument since , as appears from the summaries of UNSCRs CARDINAL and DATE given above in paragraphs CARDINAL , the Resolutions use the language of authorisation , not obligation , and the same usage is found in UNSCRs CARDINAL ( DATE ) and DATE ( DATE ) . In ordinary speech to authorise is to permit or allow or license , not to require or oblige . I am , however , persuaded that the appellant \u2019s argument is not sound , for CARDINAL main reasons .", "CARDINAL . First , it appears to me that during the period when the GPE was an ORG ( from the cessation of hostilities on DATE to the transfer of power to the NORP interim government on DATE ) it was obliged , in the area which it effectively occupied , to take necessary measures to protect the safety of the public and its own safety . [ Lord PERSON here referred to LAW , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ( IV ) relative to ORG in Time of War : for the text of these Articles , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of this judgment below . ]", "These CARDINAL Articles are designed to circumscribe the sanctions which may be applied to protected persons , and they have no direct application to the appellant , who is not a protected person . But they show plainly that there is a power to intern persons who are not protected persons , and it would seem to me that if the Occupying Power considers it necessary to detain a person who is judged to be a serious threat to the safety of the public or the Occupying Power there must be an obligation to detain such a person : see the decision of ORG in Armed Activities on the Territory of the GPE ( Democratic Republic of the GPE v. GPE ) [ DATE ] ICJ Reports CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL . This is a matter of some importance , since although the appellant was not detained during the period of the occupation , both the evidence and the language of UNSCR CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and the later Resolutions strongly suggest that the intention was to continue the pre - existing security regime and not to change it . There is not said to have been such an improvement in local security conditions as would have justified any relaxation .", "CARDINAL . There are , secondly , some situations in which ORG can adopt resolutions couched in mandatory terms . CARDINAL example is UNSCR CARDINAL ( DATE ) , considered by ORG ( with reference to an ORG regulation giving effect to it ) in GPE PERSON ve PERSON v. GPE [ [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VI ] ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL , which decided in paragraph CARDINAL that \u2018 all GPE shall impound all vessels , freight vehicles , rolling stock and aircraft in their territories ... \u2019 . Such provisions cause no difficulty in principle , since member ORG can comply with them within their own borders and are bound by LAW to comply . But language of this kind can not be used in relation to military or security operations overseas , since the ORG and ORG have no standing forces at their own disposal and have concluded no agreements under LAW of the LAW which entitle them to call on member GPE to provide them . Thus in practice ORG can do little more than give its authorisation to member GPE which are willing to conduct such tasks , and this is what ( as I understand ) it has done for DATE . Even in UNSCR CARDINAL ( DATE ) relating to GPE , when ( as I have concluded ) the operations were very clearly conducted under ORG auspices , the language of authorisation was used . There is , however , a strong and to my mind persuasive body of academic opinion which would treat LAW as applicable where conduct is authorised by ORG as where it is required : see , for example , ORG and PERSON ( eds . ) , Charter of ORG : Commentary and Documents , CARDINALrd edn . ( DATE ) , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; ORG ( DATE ) , PERSON . II , Part CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( DATE ) , pp . CARDINAL . The most recent and perhaps clearest opinion on the subject is that of GPE and GPE in PERSON ( ed . ) , The Charter of ORG : A Commentary , DATE . DATE ) , p. CARDINAL :", "\u2018 Such authorisations , however , create difficulties with respect to LAW . According to the latter provision , LAW and thus also GPE [ ORG ] Resolutions \u2013 override existing international law only in so far as they create \u201c obligations \u201d ( cf . GPE on LAW seq . ) . One could conclude that in case a ORG is not obliged but merely authorised to take action , it remains bound by its conventional obligations . Such a result , however , would not seem to correspond with ORG practice at least as regards authorisations of military action . These authorisations have not been opposed on the ground of conflicting treaty obligations , and if they could be opposed on this basis , the very idea of authorisations as a necessary substitute for direct action by the ORG would be compromised . Thus , the interpretation of LAW should be reconciled with that of LAW , and the prevalence over treaty obligations should be recognised for the authorisation of military action as well ( see ORG on Article CARDINAL MN CARDINAL ) . The same conclusion seems warranted with respect to authorisations of economic measures under Article CARDINAL . Otherwise , the Charter would not reach its goal of allowing the ORG to take the action it deems most appropriate to deal with threats to the peace \u2013 it would force the ORG to act either by way of binding measures or by way of recommendations , but would not permit intermediate forms of action . This would deprive the GPE of much of the flexibility it is supposed to enjoy . It seems therefore preferable to apply the rule of LAW to all action under ORG CARDINAL and DATE and not only to mandatory measures.\u2019", "This approach seems to me to give a purposive interpretation to LAW , in the context of its other provisions , and to reflect the practice of the ORG and member GPE as it has developed over DATE .", "CARDINAL . I am further of the opinion , thirdly , that in a situation such as the present \u2018 ORG in Article CARDINAL should not in any event be given a narrow , contract - based , meaning . The importance of maintaining peace and security in the world can scarcely be exaggerated , and that ( as evident from the Articles of the Charter quoted above ) is the mission of the ORG . Its involvement in GPE was directed to that end , following repeated determinations that the situation in GPE continued to constitute a threat to international peace and security . As is well known , a large majority of GPE chose not to contribute to ORG , but those which did ( including the GPE ) became bound by LAW and DATE to carry out the decisions of ORG in accordance with the LAW so as to achieve its lawful objectives . It is of course true that the GPE did not become specifically bound to detain the appellant in particular . But it was , I think , bound to exercise its power of detention where this was necessary for imperative reasons of security . It could not be said to be giving effect to the decisions of ORG if , in such a situation , it neglected to take steps which were open to it .", "CARDINAL . Emphasis has often been laid on the special character of LAW as a human rights instrument . But the reference in LAW to \u2018 any other international agreement\u2019 leaves no room for any excepted category , and such appears to be the consensus of learned opinion . The decision of ORG ( Questions of Interpretation and Application of the DATE LAW from the GPE incident at GPE ( NORP Arab GPE v. GPE ) [ DATE ] ICJ Reports CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , and ORG of ORG [ DATE ] ICJ Reports CARDINAL , DATE , paragraphs CARDINAL per Judge ad hoc Lauterpacht ) give no warrant for drawing any distinction save where an obligation is jus cogens and according to Judge PERSON it now seems to be generally recognised in practice that binding ORG decisions taken under LAW supersede all other treaty commitments ( The LAW of ORG : A Commentary , DATE . , ed PERSON , [ DATE , ] pp . DATE ) . \u201d", "Lord PERSON concluded on this issue :", "\u201c DATE . Thus there is a clash between on the one hand a power or duty to detain exercisable on the express authority of ORG and , on the other , a fundamental human right which the GPE has undertaken to secure to those ( like the appellant ) within its jurisdiction . How are these to be reconciled ? There is in my opinion only one way in which they can be reconciled : by ruling that the GPE may lawfully , where it is necessary for imperative reasons of security , exercise the power to detain authorised by ORG [ ORG ] CARDINAL and successive resolutions , but must ensure that the detainee \u2019s rights under LAW are not infringed to any greater extent than is inherent in such detention . I would resolve the second issue in this sense . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Baroness PERSON commenced by observing :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... There is no doubt that prolonged detention in the hands of the military is not permitted by the laws of GPE . Nor could it be permitted without derogation from our obligations under LAW . Article LAW provides that deprivation of liberty is only lawful in defined circumstances which do not include these . The drafters of the LAW had a choice between a general prohibition of \u2018 GPE detention , as provided in LAW , and a list of permitted grounds for detention . They deliberately chose the latter . They were well aware of PERSON \u2019s view that the internment even of enemy aliens in war time was \u2018 in the highest degree odious\u2019 . They would not have contemplated the indefinite detention without trial of NORP citizens in peacetime . I do not accept that this is less of a problem if people are suspected of very grave crimes . The graver the crime of which a person is suspected , the more difficult it will be for him to secure his release on the grounds that he is not a risk . The longer therefore he is likely to be incarcerated and the less substantial the evidence which will be relied upon to prove suspicion . These are the people most in need of the protection of the rule of law , rather than the small fry in whom the authorities will soon lose interest . \u201d", "ORG agreed with Lord PERSON that the Convention rights could be qualified by \u201c competing commitments under LAW \u201d , but continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . That is , however , as far as I would go . The right is qualified but not displaced . This is an important distinction , insufficiently explored in the all or nothing arguments with which we were presented . We can go no further than the ORG has implicitly required us to go in restoring peace and security to a troubled land . The right is qualified only to the extent required or authorised by the ORG . What remains of it thereafter must be observed . This may have both substantive and procedural consequences .", "CARDINAL . It is not clear to me how far ORG [ ORG ] Resolution CARDINAL went when it authorised the [ ORG ] to \u2018 take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in GPE , in accordance with the letters annexed to this Resolution expressing , inter alia , the NORP request for the continued presence of ORG and setting out its ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . The \u2018 broad range of ORG were listed by Secretary of ORG PERSON as including \u2018 combat operations against members of these groups [ seeking to influence GPE \u2019s political future through violence ] , internment where this is necessary for imperative reasons of security , and the continued search for and securing of weapons that threaten GPE \u2019s NORP . At the same time , the Secretary of ORG made clear the commitment of the forces which made up the ORG [ ORG ] to \u2018 act consistently with their obligations under the law of armed conflict , including LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP On what basis is it said that the detention of this particular appellant is consistent with our obligations under the law of armed conflict ? He is not a \u2018 protected person\u2019 under the Fourth Geneva Convention because he is one of our own citizens . Nor is the GPE any longer in belligerent occupation of any part of GPE . So resort must be had to some sort of post - conflict , post - occupation , analogous power to intern anyone where this is thought \u2018 necessary for imperative reasons of NORP . Even if ORG can be read in this way , it is not immediately obvious why the prolonged detention of this person in GPE is necessary , given that any problem he presents in GPE could be solved by repatriating him to this country and dealing with him here . If we stand back a little from the particular circumstances of this case , this is the response which is so often urged when NORP people are in trouble with the law in foreign countries , and in this case it is within the power of the NORP authorities to achieve it .", "CARDINAL . But that is not the way in which the argument has been conducted before us . Why else could Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON speak of \u2018 displacing or ORG in CARDINAL breath when clearly they mean very different things ? We have been concerned at a more abstract level with attribution to or authorisation by ORG . We have devoted little attention to the precise scope of the authorisation . There must still be room for argument about what precisely is covered by the ORG and whether it applies on the facts of this case . Quite how that is to be done remains for decision in the other proceedings . With that caveat , therefore , but otherwise in agreement with Lord PERSON , Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON , I would dismiss this appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON started his speech by observing :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Internment without trial is so antithetical to the rule of law as understood in a democratic society that recourse to it requires to be carefully scrutinised by the courts of that society . There are , regrettably , circumstances in which the threat to the necessary stability of the ORG is so great that in order to maintain that stability the use of internment is unavoidable . The Secretary of ORG \u2019s contention is that such circumstances exist now in GPE and have existed there since the conclusion of hostilities in DATE . If the intelligence concerning the danger posed by such persons is correct , \u2013 as to which your Lordships are not in a position to make any judgment and do not do so \u2013 they pose a real danger to stability and progress in GPE . If sufficient evidence can not be produced in criminal proceedings \u2013 which again the ORG [ of ORG ] has not been asked to and can not judge DATE such persons may have to be detained without trial . LAW permits the ordering of internment of protected persons \u2018 only if the security of the Detaining Power makes it absolutely ORG , and under LAW must consider that step necessary \u2018 for imperative reasons of NORP . Neither of these provisions applies directly to the appellant , who is not a protected person , but the degree of necessity which should exist before the Secretary of ORG detains persons in his position \u2013 if he has power to do so , as in my opinion he has DATE is substantially the same . I would only express the opinion that where a ORG can lawfully intern people , it is important that it adopt certain safeguards : the compilation of intelligence about such persons which is as accurate and reliable as possible , the regular review of the continuing need to detain each person and a system whereby that need and the underlying evidence can be checked and challenged by representatives on behalf of the detained persons , so far as is practicable and consistent with the needs of national security and the safety of other persons . \u201d", "He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the ORG did not go further than authorising the measures described in it , as distinct from imposing an obligation to carry them out , with the consequence that LAW [ of ORG ] did not apply to relieve GPE from observing the terms of LAW . This was an attractive and persuasively presented argument , but I am satisfied that it can not succeed . For the reasons set out in DATE of Lord PERSON \u2019s opinion I consider that Resolution CARDINAL did operate to impose an obligation upon GPE to carry out those measures . In particular , I am persuaded by ORG practice and the clear statements of authoritative academic opinion \u2013 recognised sources of international law \u2013 that expressions in ORG resolutions which appear on their face to confer no more than authority or power to carry out measures may take effect as imposing obligations , because of the fact that ORG have no standing forces at their own disposal and have concluded no agreements under LAW which would entitle them to call on member GPE to provide them .", "CARDINAL . I accordingly am of [ the ] opinion that GPE may lawfully , where it is necessary for imperative reasons of security , exercise the power to intern conferred by LAW . I would emphasise , however , that that power has to be exercised in such a way as to minimise the infringements of the detainee \u2019s rights under LAW , in particular by adopting and operating to the fullest practicable extent safeguards of the nature of those to which I referred in paragraph CARDINAL above . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

When an organ of a ORG is placed at the disposal of an international organisation , the organ may be fully seconded to that organisation . In this case the organ \u2019s conduct would clearly be attributable only to the receiving organisation ... LAW deals with the different situation in which the lent organ or agent still acts to a certain extent as organ of the lending ORG or as organ or agent of the lending organisation . This occurs for instance in the case of military contingents that a ORG placed at the disposal of ORG for a peacekeeping operation , since the ORG retains disciplinary powers and criminal jurisdiction over the members of the national contingent . In this situation the problem arises whether a specific conduct of the lent organ or agent has to be attributed to the receiving organisation or to the lending ORG or organisation .", "...", "CARDINAL . Practice relating to peacekeeping forces is particularly significant in the present context because of the control that the contributing ORG retains over disciplinary matters and criminal affairs .

Article CARDINAL does not say that the Charter prevails , but refers to obligations under the Charter . Apart from the rights and obligations in the LAW itself , this also covers duties based on binding decisions by ORG bodies . The most important case is that of LAW that obliges member GPE to accept and carry out resolutions of ORG that have been adopted LAW . Even if the primacy of ORG decisions under LAW is not expressly spelled out in the LAW , it has been widely accepted in practice as well as in doctrine . The question has sometimes been raised whether also [ Security ] Council resolutions adopted ultra vires prevail by virtue of LAW . Since obligations for member ORG can only derive out of such resolutions that are taken within the limits of its powers , decisions ultra vires do not give rise to any obligations to begin with . Hence no conflict exists . The issue is similar with regard to non - binding resolutions adopted by ORG organs , including ORG . These are not covered by LAW .", "...", "( b ) What does it mean for an obligation to prevail over another ?", "CARDINAL . What happens to the obligation over which LAW establishes precedence ? Most commentators agree that the question here is not of validity but of priority . The lower - ranking rule is merely set aside to the extent that it conflicts with the obligation under LAW . This was how Waldock saw the matter during the ILC [ ORG ] debates on DATE [ of LAW on LAW ] : \u2018 [ T]he very language of LAW makes it clear that it presumes the priority of the LAW , not the invalidity of treaties conflicting with it.\u2019", "CARDINAL . A small number of authors have received a more extensive view of the effects of LAW namely the invalidity of the conflicting treaty or obligation \u2013 on the basis of the view of the LAW as a \u2018 constitution\u2019 . A clear - cut answer to this question ( priority or invalidity ? ) can not be received from the text of LAW . Yet the word \u2018 PERSON does not grammatically imply that the lower - ranking provision would become automatically null and void , or even suspended . The ORG is merely prohibited from fulfilling an obligation arising under that other norm . Article CARDINAL says literally that in case of a conflict , the ORG in question should fulfil its obligation under the LAW and perform its duties under other agreements in as far as compatible with obligations under LAW . This also accords with the drafting materials of the LAW , which state that :", "\u2018 it would be enough that the conflict should arise from the carrying out of an obligation under the LAW . It is immaterial whether the conflict arises because of intrinsic inconsistency between the CARDINAL categories of obligations or as the result of the application of the provisions of the LAW under given circumstances.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The \u201c non - paper \u201d , prepared for the first ORG on DATE , stated by way of introduction :", "\u201c DATE has seen a significant change in the character of international military operations . They have developed from traditional peacekeeping operations under LAW of the UN Charter , through peacemaking operations under LAW , to a new type of operation in which military forces are acting in support of governments that need assistance to stabilise their countries or in support of the international administration of territory . In such operations , military forces may have to perform tasks which would normally be performed by national authorities , including detaining people in the context of both military operations and law enforcement .", "At the same time , the countries which are to be assisted frequently have difficulties fulfilling their human rights and humanitarian law obligations due to the internal problems . Normal modus operandi , including the transfer of detainees to local authorities , may therefore often not be possible as it may contradict the legal and political commitment of the troop - contributing countries . The handling of detainees thereby becomes a challenge in itself . If a sustainable solution to these challenges is not reached , it may have an impact on the ability of the military forces of other GPE to engage in certain types of operations . States therefore can not disregard these challenges when contributing to ongoing or future operations of this nature .", "The main challenge is a basic CARDINAL : how do troop - contributing GPE ensure that they act in accordance with their international obligations when handling detainees , including when transferring detainees to local authorities or to other troop - contributing countries ? Solving this challenge is not simple , as it involves addressing a number of complicated and contested legal issues as well as complicated practical and political aspects . ... \u201d", "The \u201c non - paper \u201d continued , under the heading \u201c The legal basis [ of detention ] \u201d :", "\u201c The legal basis for military forces to detain persons typically derives from the mandate of a given operation . The types of operations relevant for this non - paper are typically based on a Chapter VII resolution of ORG [ ORG ] . A ORG resolution may contain or refer to text on detention , and supplementary regulation may be found , for example , in standard operating procedures , rules of engagement and status - of - forces agreements , although the latter would also represent an agreement with the territorial ORG . The wording in these instruments on detention , however , is not always clear , if the issue is addressed at all .", "In these circumstances , the mandate to detain is often based on the traditional wording of UNSC resolutions giving a military force the mandate to \u2018 take all necessary measures\u2019 in order to fulfil the given task . When a ORG resolution is unclear or contains no text on the mandate to detain , the right to self - defence may contain an inherent yet limited right to detain . However , this may leave the question open as to the scope of the mandate , e.g. , what type of detention is possible in self - defence and whether it is possible only to detain persons for reasons of security or also to detain e.g. common criminals .", "There is therefore a need for ORG to address this issue and clearly establish the legal basis for the right of the force to detain in a given operation . A clear mandate on detention will improve the possibilities for soldiers on the ground to take the right decisions on detention matters and to avoid different interpretations on the understanding of an ambiguous ORG resolution . This need is further underlined by the fact that the right to detain might subsequently be challenged in court , and that officials / soldiers of troop - contributing GPE may be subject to prosecution for unlawful confinement under the grave breaches regime of LAW ( IV ) . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
