SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was accused of having committed CARDINAL criminal offences . The first charge regarded the applicant \u2019s involvement in the transport of QUANTITY of cocaine and the second charge concerned an amount of QUANTITY of cocaine found in his home . The third charge concerned a doping offence . The applicant denied the first CARDINAL charges but admitted the third . He was deprived of his liberty from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of ORG gave judgment . Regarding the first charge , ORG found that the applicant \u2019s involvement in DATE receiving narcotics for the purpose of storing and transferring them \u2013 did not correspond to what the applicant was charged with in the bill of indictment . The first offence had not therefore been made out . Regarding the second charge , ORG stated that there was not sufficient evidence to convict the applicant . He was convicted of a doping offence ( dopningsbrott ) and fined . He was thus acquitted by ORG on CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL charges .", "The Prosecutor appealed against the acquittals on the CARDINAL charges on DATE , i.e. DATE the ORG gave judgment . In his submissions , the wording of the bill of indictment was amended in regard to the first charge so as to cover applicant \u2019s involvement in the crime ( i.e. receiving narcotics for the purpose of storing and transferring them ) . Regarding the second charge , the Prosecutor called a new witness .", "The applicant was detained on DATE . He claims that after ORG acquittal , he had been working both in GPE and abroad . He alleges that , during this time , i.e. over DATE , he did not receive any summons to appear before ORG . His arrest thus came unexpectedly .", "On DATE , during the hearing at ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) , he was placed under formal arrest ( h\u00e4kte ) on the basis that he was suspected on reasonable grounds of an attempt to commit an aggravated narcotics offence and that there was a risk that he would run away or seek to escape prosecution or punishment . The applicant opposed his detention arguing that he had not been served with any summons to appear before ORG and that he had not failed to appear . In the judgment , which was pronounced DATE , ORG found that the applicant was guilty on both charges which had been the subject of the appeal and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . He alleges that it did not examine his defence counsel \u2019s objection that he had not had sufficient time to meet the applicant before the hearing .", "In the written appeal pleadings to ORG ) , the applicant argued that the required evidentiary standards in criminal cases had not been satisfied and that there was no evidence to support the charge that he had been involved in the transport of the narcotics . The only thing he had stated himself before ORG was that he had been supposed to store a package which he thought had contained hash or marijuana . Regarding the narcotics found in his home , he argued that he had not known about the narcotics and that they probably belonged to the person whose passport had been found next to them . He was represented by the same defence counsel throughout the proceedings .", "ORG refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "The applicant subsequently requested a re - opening of his case arguing that there had been a miscarriage of justice since he had been arrested ( anh\u00e5llen ) on DATE , over DATE after having been acquitted by ORG , and convicted DATE after without having had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence with his defence counsel . He relied on LAW ( b ) of the LAW . On DATE ORG rejected this request ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
