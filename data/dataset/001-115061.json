They were represented before the ORG by Mr M. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants arrived in GPE for the first time in DATE together with their CARDINAL daughters , born in DATE and DATE , respectively . They applied for asylum and submitted that they should be granted residence permits on humanitarian grounds . They claimed that they had fled from the war to GPE in DATE . In DATE they had returned and had been subjected to harassment by other villagers who had considered them traitors for fleeing . In addition , they claimed that the first applicant , who had run a small shop , had been harassed by the health department and other authorities .", "On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) rejected the application and held that the alleged harassment did not constitute grounds for asylum . ORG also noted that the applicants had failed to seek assistance from the domestic authorities before leaving GPE .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) which , on DATE , upheld ORG decision in full .", "During DATE and DATE , the applicants repeatedly applied to ORG for re - examination of their case due to the continuous deterioration of their physical and mental health . All these motions were rejected both by ORG and ORG .", "At some point during DATE the applicants left GPE and travelled to GPE and GPE to apply for asylum . However , they were transferred back in accordance with LAW .", "In DATE the applicants again applied for asylum . On DATE ORG rejected the application . ORG upheld the decision on DATE .", "On DATE the applicants turned again to ORG and applied for a re - examination of their case . They added that their family had spent DATE in GPE and that their oldest daughter and her children had been granted residence permits . They also referred to their deteriorating health , in particular the first applicant \u2019s poor mental health and his suicidal tendencies .", "On DATE ORG decided to stay the enforcement of the deportation order until further notice . However , on CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the application and decided that the enforcement of the deportation order should proceed .", "Upon appeal , ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) upheld the decision and , on CARDINAL DATE , ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "The applicants were registered as missing on DATE and the deportation order became time - barred on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the applicants applied for asylum again . They maintained their earlier story and added the following . The first applicant suffered from severe mental illness and had received voluntary psychiatric care . He had also been considered for mandatory psychiatric care in a closed ward . Furthermore , he suffered from a severe heart condition . He submitted CARDINAL medical certificates issued DATE from CARDINAL different psychiatric clinics .", "According to a certificate issued on DATE by ORG , a psychologist at ORG in ORG , the insulting treatment to which the first applicant and his family had been subjected in GPE had caused him trauma and long lasting psychological harm . Due to this he suffered from memory loss , difficulties with sleeping and concentrating , moments of absence , anxiety attacks and a deep sense of depression . He had also developed hallucinations urging him to commit suicide . At CARDINAL point he had tried to jump off a building , but had been stopped by a family member . He expressed fears of being left alone and not being able to resist the urge to commit suicide . This state was most probably aggravated by the uncertainty of his situation , not knowing whether he would be allowed to stay in GPE or not . His physical health had also been affected by his mental illness and there were reasons to believe that this had been a factor causing him to suffer a heart attack in DATE .", "According to another medical certificate , issued on DATE by ORG , senior physician and specialist in general medicine and general psychiatry at ORG hospital in GPE , the first applicant had tried to commit suicide on several occasions and could therefore never be left on his own . He suffered panic attacks , mostly at TIME , and therefore had trouble sleeping . In connection with the attacks , he had trouble communicating properly , even with his closest family . Heavy medication had not helped and his prognosis was considered negative .", "The second applicant suffered from diabetes and a skin disease . She submitted a medical certificate to this effect issued on DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application . It observed that the applicants had not submitted any new information regarding their need for protection and thus there was no need for it to make a new evaluation . It further considered that the medical certificates regarding the first applicant did not clearly indicate his mental state or what kind of care he needed . The certificates only showed that he suffered from mental illness , but not that it was life threatening . Furthermore , the ORG noted that country information showed that health care was available in GPE . The applicants\u2019 health problems were therefore not sufficient grounds to grant them asylum . Lastly , the ORG noted that CARDINAL of the applicants\u2019 daughters had been granted a permanent residence permit in GPE in DATE . However , it stressed that the general rule was that an application for residence permit on the grounds of family relations should be submitted before entering GPE . ORG held that no exception to this rule was applicable in the present case . It was not unreasonable to expect the applicants to file such an application from GPE .", "The applicants appealed against the decision and requested ORG to hold an oral hearing where they could submit oral evidence as to their deteriorating health .", "On DATE ORG rejected the motion for an oral hearing and requested the applicants to submit further written observations .", "The applicants claimed that ORG had not duly considered the fact that there was an imminent risk that the first applicant would commit suicide and that he was highly dependent on his older daughter for his mental well - being . They also added that the second applicant did not have the means or the ability to care of her husband alone if they were to return to GPE and GPE .", "On DATE ORG , by a majority , upheld the ORG \u2019s decision . It noted that the ORG allegations of persecution had been assessed by the domestic authorities in GPE on several occasions since they had first applied for asylum in DATE . Moreover , no new information had been submitted and therefore there was no reason to depart from the earlier assessments . Regarding the first applicant \u2019s health , the court found that his mental and physical state was not severe enough to constitute a sufficient ground for asylum . The court observed that his mental illness seemed to have developed only after arriving in GPE and also seemed to be connected to the pressure of going through the asylum proceedings . His state had not improved although he had received medication . In conclusion the court held that his illness was not life threatening and hence not serious enough to allow him to stay . Furthermore , it shared ORG assessment that the applicants could reasonably be expected to apply for residence permits from their home country .", "The presiding judge gave a dissenting opinion and considered that the first applicant \u2019s severe mental illness and his connection to his older daughter , who had a residence permit in GPE , constituted sufficient grounds for allowing him and his wife to stay . The presiding judge also pointed out that several attempts to enforce the applicants\u2019 deportation had failed , inter alia , due to the first applicant \u2019s state of health and , consequently , nothing indicated that future enforcement attempts would be more successful .", "The applicants appealed to ORG . They submitted a new medical certificate issued on DATE by PERSON , in which the progression of the first applicant \u2019s illness , his current state and acute suicidal tendencies were described in detail .", "ORG refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "In the meantime , on DATE , ORG granted the applicants\u2019 younger daughter , her husband and their CARDINAL children residence permits in GPE .", "On DATE the applicants requested the ORG to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG in order to stop their deportation to GPE .", "On DATE the President of the Section to which the case had been allocated granted the applicants\u2019 request for interim measures until further notice . On DATE , ORG , with reference to the ORG \u2019s decision , stayed the enforcement of the applicants\u2019 deportation order until further notice .", "Subsequently , the applicants again applied for a re - examination of their case before ORG , first on DATE and then on CARDINAL DATE . However , both motions were rejected .", "Before the ORG , the applicants submitted several medical certificates , issued DATE and DATE by CARDINAL different doctors , regarding the applicants\u2019 state of health .", "As regards the first applicant , the certificates stated , inter alia , that he was suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder and that the practical enforcement of the deportation order could endanger his life since mental pressure would strongly increase the risk of an immediate heart attack . According to a medical certificate issued in DATE , his health had further deteriorated . It also stated that the first applicant had not had any contact with psychiatric clinics before he came to GPE .", "As regards the second applicant \u2019s state of health , a certificate issued on DATE was submitted . It stated that she suffered from diabetes and anxiety related to the deportation , which had caused her trouble sleeping and feelings of depression .", "The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) . It defines the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "LAW , of LAW stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , a permit may nevertheless be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) as to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ) . During this assessment , special consideration should be given to , inter alia , the alien \u2019s state of health . In the preparatory works to this provision ( Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien \u2019s home country could constitute a reason for granting a residence permit .", "According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "Under LAW , LAW a , first paragraph , point CARDINAL of LAW a residence permit may be given to an alien who is a close relative of someone who is resident in or who has been granted a residence permit to settle in GPE , if he or she has been a member of the same household as that person and there exists a special relationship of dependence between the relatives that already existed in the country of origin .", "By virtue of LAW , LAW , of the LAW , an alien who wants a residence permit in GPE on account of family ties or serious relationships must have applied for and been granted such a permit before entering the country . An application for a residence permit may not , as a general rule , be approved after entry . However , exemptions from this rule can be made for example if the alien has strong ties to a person who is resident in GPE and it can not reasonably be required that he or she travel to another country to submit an application there ( LAW , LAW , second paragraph , point CARDINAL ) . As regards this exemption , the preparatory works to the provision ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL et seq . ) state that the main emphasis should be placed on the question of whether it is reasonable to require that the alien return to another country in order to submit an application there . Relevant elements , which may be favourable for the alien , may be whether he or she can be expected , after returning home , to encounter difficulties in obtaining a passport or exit permit and this is due to some form of harassment on the part of the authorities in the country of origin . It may also be whether the alien will be required to complete a long period of national service or service under unusually severe conditions . It may also be relevant whether the alien has to return to a country where there is no NORP foreign representation and where major practical difficulties and considerable costs are associated with travelling to a neighbouring country to submit the application there . Relevant elements , which may count against the alien , may be that he or she is staying in the country illegally , that their identity is unclear or if there are strong ties to the country of origin . An exemption may also be made if there are some other exceptional grounds ( LAW , LAW , second paragraph , point CARDINAL ) .", "The requirement that , in principle , residence permits for family members have to be granted before entry into GPE was introduced as CARDINAL of a number of measures aimed at reducing the possibilities of obtaining a residence permit by means of marriages or relationships of convenience . Subsequently , ORG and ORG have underlined on several occasions that the requirement that residence permits be obtained before entry into GPE is an important part of measures to maintain regulated immigration . Moreover , the preparatory works to LAW state that it is important that aliens staying in GPE illegally do not enjoy a better position than those who comply with decisions by the authorities to return to their country of origin in order to apply for a permit from there ( Government PERSON ) .", "ORG ) , an independent human rights research body set up to provide the NORP immigration authorities with relevant information has , in a note concerning health care in GPE , dated DATE , observed that extensive reforms have been made in the health care sector . Among other things , centres for psychiatric health care have been built , offering specialist treatment for patients suffering from mental ill - health . Persons suffering from mental health problems can seek help either at the nearest centre for psychiatric health , or at the social services . Persons with serious mental health problems are referred to hospital or to a psychiatric ward at a central hospital . As for heart disease , most problems can be treated in the country and medication for unstable heart disease is available there .", "According to ORG GPE DATE progress report , published on DATE , there has been some progress in the area of mental health . ORG accepted the application of the GPE Herzegovina ORG to set up the regional centre for cooperation and development in the area of mental health for LOC . The regional centre was operational . Both Entities adopted mental health strategies and new mental health centres were opened . However , establishment of community - based services , provision of aid to dependent persons and mental health care for children and young people needed further attention .", "According to ORG GPE DATE progress report , published on DATE , progress was reported in the area of mental health . The country amended ORG , improving the protection of human rights and dignity of persons with mental disorders as well as the legal protection of legally incapacitated adults . ORG in South- LOC in GPE became operational . However , further actions remained to be taken towards promoting inclusion of people with mental health problems and their empowerment . Community - based mental health services of high quality that focused on recovery needed further support ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
