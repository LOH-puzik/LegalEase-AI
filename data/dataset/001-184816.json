The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG , after having served a summons on the applicant to appear at the address that he had at that time in GPE , convicted the applicant of assault and sentenced him to CARDINAL dayfines of QUANTITY ( ORG ) each and allowed him to pay his fine in instalments in the light of his economic situation . ORG had , at the applicant \u2019s request , authorised Mr DATE at that time still a law student DATE to act as defence counsel under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the public prosecutor lodged appeals . The prosecutor \u2019s appeal was directed merely against the sentencing . Thereafter , the applicant moved to GPE to work as a chef in a hotel and communicated his new address to the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG withdrew the authorisation of PERSON to act as defence counsel , while at the same time rejecting the application lodged by PERSON for the applicant to be released from the obligation to appear in person at the appeal hearing . This decision was served on the applicant in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE ORG fixed the date for the oral hearing of the applicant \u2019s appeal to TIME on CARDINAL DATE . It decided to serve the summons on the applicant via public notification because the applicant had moved abroad . The summons was displayed on the court \u2019s noticeboard from DATE until CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON learned by telephone of ORG decision of DATE to overturn ORG decision in respect of his authorisation to act as counsel for the applicant and of the appeal hearing having been scheduled for TIME . He applied by fax for the hearing to be adjourned , citing the fact that he was going to be out of town DATE . He furthermore asked that documents from the case file \u2013 in particular the public prosecutor \u2019s appeal \u2013 be sent to him . The presiding judge ordered that a copy of that appeal and of the decision to serve the summons of the applicant by public notification be sent to the applicant \u2019s lawyer . This proved impossible , as the lawyer \u2019s fax machine had no receiving function . The lawyer was offered access to the file at the courthouse DATE at TIME ( that is to say immediately before the hearing ) , which he declined , stating that he would be out of town .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused , in a separate decision , an application lodged by the applicant \u2019s lawyer for the appeal hearing to be adjourned . It stated that the lawyer had waived his right to be summoned within the respective time - limit because he had known about the date of the appeal hearing ( as evidenced by his fax of DATE ) , and that the properly summoned applicant had failed to appear without providing any reason . Simultaneously , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal without an assessment of the merits , in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , because he had not appeared at the appeal hearing ( without any sufficient excuse , and despite having been summoned ) , nor had he been represented by a lawyer in a permissible manner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for the restoration of the status quo ante . It found that the requirements for the serving of a summons by means of public notification , as set out in LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , had been met . The applicant \u2019s lawyer had waived his right to be summoned , and his application for an adjournment had not relied on the failure to comply with the time - limit for serving a summons but had rather invoked scheduling problems , which he had not described in greater detail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that decision . It considered that the applicant had been properly summoned to the appeal hearing because the requirements for service by public notification , as set out in LAW , had been met . The summons to attend the hearing before ORG had been served on the applicant \u2019s previous address in GPE and he had lodged the appeal in question . As regards his interest in having ORG judgment reviewed , it had been his responsibility to ensure that it was possible for the summons to appear at the appeal hearing to be served in GPE . As a result of his move to GPE it had not been possible to serve the summons at his previous address in GPE . It had thus been acceptable for the summons to be served by public notification . There had been neither an obligation to undertake an attempt to serve the summons at the applicant \u2019s new address abroad prior to serving it via public notification nor one to notify him at that address that the summons had been served by public notification . The applicant had also not specifically authorised ( under the first sentence of Article LAW ) his lawyer to receive summonses ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Moreover , the applicant had not convincingly shown that he had been prevented through no fault of his own from appearing at the appeal hearing , as required by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , because the applicant \u2019s lawyer had not provided an affidavit to support his claim that he had advised the applicant , on CARDINAL DATE , that the latter did not need to attend the hearing because he had not been summoned . As his appearance in person had been ordered ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it had not been possible to carry out the appeal hearing in his absence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE as ill - founded , finding that the review of ORG judgment had not revealed any legal errors that had been detrimental to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant , without providing reasons ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following communication of the case and unsuccessful friendly settlement negotiations , on DATE the Government informed the ORG of their intention to resolve the issue raised by the application . They produced a unilateral declaration , in which they acknowledged violations of LAW and/or CARDINAL ( c ) , as well as LAW ( b ) and ( c ) of the LAW and offered to pay the applicant a sum to cover any pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage together with any costs and expenses . The ORG requested that the ORG strike out the application in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a letter to ORG DATE the applicant indicated that he was not satisfied with the terms of the unilateral declaration . The aim he pursued with the present application was a reopening of the criminal proceedings against him and a subsequent acquittal . He argued that , under domestic law , such a reopening could not be achieved if the ORG struck the case out of its list , but required a judgment finding a violation . Furthermore , the compensation offered was insufficient .", "CARDINAL . By a submission of CARDINAL DATE the Government confirmed that there was DATE and in fact , there still is \u2013 no case - law of the domestic courts regarding whether LAW CARDINAL of LAW , which provides for the reopening of criminal proceedings following a judgment of the ORG finding a violation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , also applies to violations acknowledged by the Government by way of a unilateral declaration . This question was for the domestic courts to assess . They acknowledged that the provision had , in practice , been construed narrowly ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-b", "6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
