The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The applicant \u2019s surname was \u201c PERSON \u201d before he formally changed it to \u201c GPE \u201d on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was a politician and a member of the opposition . On DATE ORG , a political block uniting a number of opposition political parties , held a demonstration in FAC in GPE . Earlier , ORG ( \u201c BCEA \u201d ) had refused to grant authorisation to hold the demonstration in FAC , suggesting instead that the demonstration be held in another location further from the city centre . However , contrary to the ORG \u2019s decision , the organisers of the demonstration refused to change their plans and decided to gather their followers in FAC .", "CARDINAL . Soon after the start of the demonstration , police units began arriving in the square with the aim of dispersing the crowd . It appears that the police and the crowd engaged in a series of violent clashes . According to the applicant , the police used excessive force . The applicant himself was beaten by the police in the square and taken to a police station .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with the administrative offence of obstructing the police and , on DATE , ORG sentenced him to CARDINAL days\u2019 \u201c administrative detention \u201d in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . At around the same time , the PERSON and ORG instituted criminal proceedings in respect of the ORG obstruction of the police . On CARDINAL DATE the case was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant , together with CARDINAL other persons , with obstructing state officials by the actual or threatened use of force , an offence under LAW of the former LAW , which was in force before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator issued an order for the applicant \u2019s detention on remand in connection with this criminal charge . Under the former Code of Criminal Procedure such a decision could be taken by an investigator , not a court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was substituted by a preventive measure prohibiting him from leaving his place of residence . He was therefore released from detention .", "CARDINAL . DATE the investigators interrogated a number of witnesses in connection with the case . It appears that no major investigative acts were carried out subsequently .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to suspend the investigation in the applicant \u2019s case because CARDINAL of the coaccused , ORG , had absconded and he could not be located or his testimony obtained . Moreover , it was noted that at that stage of the investigation a number of other \u201c accomplices to the offence \u201d had not been identified . The prosecutor found that , in the absence of ORG and other unidentifed accomplices , it was not possible to conclude the investigation and give a legal assessment of the acts of the co - accused , including the applicant . Therefore , the prosecutor decided to suspend the investigation until such time as ORG and other accomplices were found and brought before the investigating authorities .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he was not informed about the decision to suspend the proceedings and he only found out at a later , unspecified , date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a lawsuit with the NORP ORG complaining of the unlawfulness of the prosecutor \u2019s actions and requesting the court to discontinue the proceedings .

No procedural act had been carried out during that period . He pointed out that he remained under an obligation not to leave his place of residence and , as a result , could not obtain an international passport or travel abroad on personal business .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint and upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decision . In essence , it reiterated the prosecutor \u2019s reasons for suspending the proceedings and found them lawful . Its decision was silent as to the applicant \u2019s continued inability to leave his place of residence and obtain a passport . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision . Under the domestic rules of criminal procedure , ORG was the highest instance for appeals against procedural decisions of investigative authorities .", "CARDINAL . Following requests by the applicant to ORG to discontinue the proceedings , on DATE the criminal investigation was resumed . On DATE the prosecutor decided that the offence with which the applicant was charged under LAW of the former LAW was to be recharacterised under LAW of the new LAW , which had entered into force on DATE . Accordingly , the prosecutor issued a new indictment under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor of ORG discontinued the proceedings in respect of the applicant because , in accordance with LAW of the former LAW , the criminal charge against him had become time - barred DATE after the date of the commission of the alleged offence . The prosecutor noted that , although under the relevant provisions of the new Criminal Code the same charges would have become time - barred DATE from the date of the offence , these provisions could not be applied retroactively in the present case as they would aggravate the applicant \u2019s position . The prosecutor also lifted the preventive measure prohibiting the applicant from leaving his place of residence .", "CARDINAL .
