NORP The applicant , ORG , is a NORP limited liability company , which has its seat in GPE . The applicant company was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company runs the restaurant ORG ( ORG ) in the centre of GPE . On DATE , ORG ( Socialtj\u00e4nstn\u00e4mnden ) decided to revoke ORG \u2019s licence to serve alcoholic beverages on its premises . The decision was based partly on several reports from ORG regarding disorder and excessive serving of alcohol on the LOC and partly because the restaurant had served liquor by the bottle after TIME ( which was prohibited ) . Moreover , the applicant company had failed to report to the authorities that its parent company , which was also its majority owner , was subject to liquidation as well as to report changes in the ownership structure of this company .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision and asked to have its alcohol licence back . On DATE , ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE held an oral hearing in the case during which the CARDINAL shareholders of the applicant company and its parent company were heard as CARDINAL witnesses , CARDINAL at the request of the applicant . Both the shareholders and CARDINAL of the witnesses , the liquidator of the applicant \u2019s parent company , were heard about the circumstances relating to the liquidation and the applicant company \u2019s ownership structure . The court also had written evidence at its disposal , inter alia , the applicant company \u2019s register of shareholders from DATE and its DATE report from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the court partly granted the applicant company \u2019s appeal in that it repealed the revocation of the licence but gave the applicant company a warning instead . In its reasoning , the court stated that it was common ground between the parties that there had been changes in the ownership structure of the parent company and that this company had been liquidated . However , in the court \u2019s view , these circumstances were not reason enough to revoke ORG \u2019s licence to serve alcoholic beverages since the restaurant business was still run in the same way by the same persons . Turning to the issue of public disorder , the court noted that it was undisputed that disorder had occurred on CARDINAL different occasions and endorsed ORG view that this constituted grounds for revoking ORG \u2019s licence to serve alcoholic beverages . However , having regard to the fact that almost all of the incidents had occurred during student parties , and to the applicant company \u2019s assurance that such parties would never take place again , as well as the applicant company \u2019s implementation of new policy documents , it found specific reasons to believe that the applicant company had a genuine will to deal with the problems which had previously occurred and , consequently , that the intervention could be limited to a warning .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) of GPE which , on DATE , decided to grant leave to appeal . The applicant company , as well as ORG , requested that an oral hearing be held in the case . The applicant company asked to hear the CARDINAL shareholders previously heard before ORG and CARDINAL witnesses , CARDINAL of whom were to be heard in person before the court . CARDINAL of the witnesses , an advocate , had not been heard before ORG and he was to testify that there was no reason to revoke the applicant company \u2019s alcohol licence due to the changes in the ownership structure or the liquidation of the main shareholder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s request for an oral hearing as being unnecessary and invited the applicant company to make its concluding submissions in the case , at the latest on DATE . The applicant company was granted an extension of time - limit and finalised its submissions in writing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG repealed ORG judgment and ruled in favour of ORG . The judgment was based on the fact that changes in the ownership structure and the shareholder \u2019s liquidation had not been reported to the relevant authority . Additionally , it noted that a number of police reports indicated that repeated disruptions of public order had occurred , such as fighting and serving alcoholic beverages to young people and that people had been so intoxicated that the police had taken them into custody , including a person who was DATE at the time . In the court \u2019s view , it was an aggravating circumstance that the disruptions of public order were primarily related to student parties , involving mostly young people . Moreover , it was noted that a waitress , on DATE , had left a pitcher of liquor on a table for guests at the restaurant after TIME ORG , referring to the fact that the applicant company had previously received warnings for failing to respect the rules for serving alcoholic beverages , did not find any specific reasons to limit the intervention to a warning .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) and requested the court to hold an oral hearing . In response to a question by the court , the applicant company specified that it requested the oral hearing only if leave to appeal was granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case are laid down in LAW ( Alkohollagen , GPE ) . On DATE , this Act was replaced by a new Alcohol Act ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . Hereafter , reference is made to the older , now repealed , Act , which was in force at the time relevant to the present case .", "CARDINAL . An overriding principle of the LAW is restraint in connection to serving alcoholic beverages . In accordance with LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW , the sale of beverages falling under the LAW shall be conducted in such a manner that harmful effects are prevented as far as possible . Any person engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages shall ensure that order and sobriety prevail at the point of sale . Under LAW , LAW , of the LAW , the serving of alcoholic beverages shall be conducted with restraint and may not lead to inconvenience with respect to public order and sobriety . Under GPE guidelines for licences to serve alcoholic beverages , neither serving nor consumption of entire bottles of spirits ( helr\u00f6r ) is allowed after QUANTITY", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , a person to whom a licence has been granted shall notify the licensing authority in the event of any change in the activity significant for the supervision . Notice shall also be given of important changes of ownership . Notice shall be given in advance . If the circumstances giving rise to the duty of notification could not have been foreseen , notification shall instead be made without delay ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The municipality shall revoke a licence to serve alcoholic beverages if such inconveniences as referred to in LAW , section CARDINAL , occur more than occasionally ( LAW , section CARDINAL , point CARDINAL ) . The municipality shall also revoke a licence to serve alcoholic beverages if the licensee does not comply with the provision of the LAW applying to the service or licence , or with applicable provisions or conditions pursuant to LAW ( ibid , point CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Instead of revocation , a licence may be issued with a warning if , for special reasons , a warning is deemed sufficient ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . In accordance with the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , an example of such special reasons is that the licensee has taken appropriate measures to correct the circumstances so that it may be assumed that the business will in future be operated in accordance with the applicable provisions .", "CARDINAL . Appeal against a decision rendered by ORG under LAW lies to the administrative courts . However , in these cases leave to appeal is required for ORG to consider an appeal on the merits against a decision or judgment delivered by ORG a of ORG , ORG , hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Likewise , leave to appeal is required for ORG to consider on the merits an appeal against a decision or judgment delivered by ORG ( LAW of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW is worded as follows :", "\u201c The procedure shall be in writing .", "Where it may be assumed to be advantageous for the investigation or promote the expeditious determination of the case , the processing may include an oral hearing regarding certain issues .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to the DATE Act emphasise that an oral procedure can be advantageous for the investigation of a case in CARDINAL respects in particular . Firstly , such a hearing may be needed in order to examine a witness , expert or party or in cases where a party has difficulty expounding his or her claim in writing . Secondly , an oral hearing may be needed to clarify the positions taken by the parties in the case and perhaps eliminate unnecessary or meaningless points of dispute . In the latter case , the procedure is typically of a preparatory nature . Moreover , the oral form of procedure envisaged in the DATE Act is not to be seen as an alternative to the written form , but rather as a complement to that form ( see the Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to the DATE Act underlined , in connection with the provision in section QUANTITY concerning the right of a party to an oral hearing in certain cases , that while serious consideration should be given to the wishes of a party for such a hearing , the party could hardly be allowed to have a decisive influence in the matter . The question of whether a hearing is necessary should primarily be assessed in the light of the existing investigation of the case , but it should also be possible to accord significance to other factors , for example , if the case is very important for the party and a hearing would give him a better understanding of the importance of the decision to be given in the case . CARDINAL particular reason not to arrange an oral hearing could be that the case is of a trivial nature or that the costs of the hearing are high compared to the value of the object of dispute ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG has set aside a number of decisions on appeal and referred cases back to the administrative courts of appeal because of the lack of an oral hearing in the lower courts ( see , for example , R\u00c5 DATE ref . CARDINAL , R\u00c5 DATE note DATE , R\u00c5 DATE note CARDINAL , R\u00c5 DATE note CARDINAL and R\u00c5 DATE note CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
