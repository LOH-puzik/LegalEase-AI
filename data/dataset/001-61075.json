The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He is a journalist by profession and on DATE he published in the NORP DATE newspaper ORG an article about Mr PERSON Caselli , who was at that time ORG in GPE . The article was entitled \u201c PERSON , the judge with the white quiff \u201d and subtitled \u201c NORP schooling , communist militancy like his friend PERSON Are the charges against ORG the start of a new PERSON case ? \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the article the applicant , after referring to the proceedings brought by PERSON against PERSON , a very well - known NORP statesman accused of aiding and abetting the ORG ( appoggio esterno alla mafia ) who has in the meantime been acquitted at first instance , expressed himself as follows :", "\u201c In DATE PERSON has told an NORP newspaper that he fears he is to be eliminated .", "If I may be permitted to begin with a digression , I wonder why he was talking to a foreign paper rather than the NORP press . He \u2019s not the only one . It \u2019s getting to be an epidemic . During the same period the industrialist PERSON chose an NORP newspaper in which to say that GPE is his LOC . Even PERSON , when he feels like uttering threats or complaints , generally does so via the NORP papers . This might be a form of gratuitous snobbery . But it might also be a victimisation syndrome of the type \u2018 We \u2019re foreigners in our own country and are obliged to raise our voices abroad in order to make ourselves heard at home.\u2019", "That \u2019s what ORG is suggesting when he adds that he feels like an exile and the victim of a plot , but he does n\u2019t exactly know what kind of plot . Those who have seen him recently say that he \u2019s pale , his pointed ears are drooping and he \u2019s bent forward to the point of being hunchbacked . He \u2019s worried about his wife PERSON , who \u2019s been plunged in a kind of cataleptic trance since that DATE . That was DATE when the official notification that he was under investigation \u2013 a document running to CARDINAL typewritten pages \u2013 turned the most well known NORP politician into the number CARDINAL godfather of ORG . Now ORG is bewildered . He tries to understand but he ca n\u2019t . He thinks there must have been some sort of spur - of - the - moment conspiracy .", "But the antibody that \u2019s eating away at him has been there for some time . It \u2019s been cultured for DATE in precisely those religious environments that ORG likes best . While he was already dominating GPE in DATE PERSON , ORG in GPE , author of the CARDINAL pages which have annihilated him , was learning his lessons at the school of the PERSON brothers in GPE .", "PERSON was a fine , studious boy . GPE is full of people like that because it \u2019s a rainy city and the houses have no balconies to watch the street from , so there \u2019s nothing else for a boy to do but get his head down over his books . That \u2019s why the place specialises in the mass - production of intellectuals . From ORG to GPE , the Minister of Justice . It \u2019s a puritan brotherhood .", "The more PERSON progressed towards self - knowledge the heavier his complex about his father weighed on him . The father was a very worthy man but only the chauffeur of a captain of industry . While driving he breathed in the air of the bourgeoisie and then he blew it out again over his son . The boy decided that when he grew up he would pass over to the other side of the fence . No longer subservient like dad , but keeping the upper hand .", "At university , he drew close to the ORG [ ORG ] , the party which exalts the frustrated . When he was admitted to the ORG legal service he swore a threefold oath of obedience DATE to God , to the PERSON and to via PERSON [ formerly the headquarters of the ORG , now those of the PDS \u2013 ORG of the Left ] . And PERSON became the judge he has remained for DATE pious , stern and partisan .", "But he can not really be understood without a mention here of his alter ego PERSON , PERSON \u2019s twin brother . Both from GPE ; DATE ; both raised by the NORP teaching orders ; both NORP militants ; both judicial officers ; and a deep understanding between them : when PERSON , the head , calls , PERSON , the arm , responds .", "PERSON has always been CARDINAL step ahead of PERSON . In DATE he indicted for an attempted coup PERSON , a former member of the Resistance , but also an anti - communist . It was a typical political trial which led nowhere . Instead of facing a judicial inquiry , PERSON found that his career began to take off . In DATE he was elected as a NORP MP . And ever since then he has been the via PERSON shadow Minister of ORG . DATE he \u2019s the chairman of ORG \u2019s anti - Mafia committee , the great choreographer of the to - ing and fro - ing of the pentiti [ criminals - turned - informers ] and the ORG strongman .", "While PERSON was climbing the ladder , PERSON had turned into a handsome figure with the shock of prematurely white hair he \u2019s so proud of . If he goes away anywhere , even on a short trip , he always takes his hairdryer with him . During breaks in proceedings he pats his quiff into place on his forehead and pushes his hair over his ears . Afterwards , as you will have noticed on TV , he moves his head the bare minimum , so as not to ruin his handiwork .", "Vain \u2013 he \u2019s vain . When PERSON was a member of ORG , from DATE , his colleagues used to make fun of him , saying \u2018 Under his hair there \u2019s nothing there\u2019 . That \u2019s true up to a point , as a comment on his narcissism and his ideological blinkers . But it \u2019s not true as regards his intelligence , which can not be faulted . So far , as can be seen , there \u2019s nothing to suggest that DATE PERSON \u2019s and ORG \u2019s paths would cross .", "Apart from his spell at ORG , PERSON continued to live in GPE . He was a judge in the public eye and in the first line of the battle against terrorism . It was he who obtained the confession of PERSON , whose evidence as a witness for the prosecution devastated ORG .", "In the meantime , the ORG set in motion its strategy for gaining control of the public ORG offices of every city in GPE . That campaign is still going on , as the ORG has picked up the baton . The whole thing was the product of CARDINAL linked but very very simple ideas PERSON had . The first idea was that if the NORP could not manage to gain power through the ballot box , they could do so through the courts . There was no shortage of material . The NORP and the NORP were nothing but thieves and it would be easy to catch them out . The second idea was more brilliant than the first : the opening of a judicial investigation was sufficient to shatter people \u2019s careers ; there was no need to go to the trouble of a trial , it was enough to put someone in the pillory . And to do that it was necessary to control the entire network of public ORG offices .", "And that was the start of GPE . The FAC , GPE and others were immediately caught with their hands in the till and destroyed . But ORG was needed to complete the picture . More cunning than the rest , or not so greedy , the sly old NORP nearly always avoided getting caught up in corruption cases .", "It was at that precise moment that PERSON was getting ready to leave the rain of GPE for the sun of GPE . A campaign of unsubstantiated allegations saw off the incumbent public prosecutor PERSON , who crept away with his tail between his legs . And at DATE the handsome judge was able to take ORG \u2019s place and finally place ORG seal on the GPE prosecution service .", "Before he took up his new post PERSON was summoned to the PERSON [ the President \u2019s official residence ] . President PERSON , knowing the type , was concerned . When he had PERSON in front of him he said : \u2018 Do whatever you think is right , but be objective.\u2019", "Once in GPE his fate and ORG \u2019s , which had remained separate for DATE , became intertwined . DATE the senator - for - life was suddenly accused of belonging to the ORG . The file was an implausible rag - bag containing statements by pentiti , old and new documents and information given by the same old Buscetta [ a pentito ] to PERSON and the anti - Mafia committee , now used by PERSON as evidence in a kind of game of ping - pong between the CARDINAL twins . To cut a long story short , even the most long - lived brontosaurus in the ORG [ i.e. PERSON \u2013 the ORG ] was destroyed , thanks to the principle that an accusation is sufficient to destroy anyone .", "In DATE PERSON flew off to GPE , where he met PERSON . He offered the informer MONEY DATE to continue to cooperate . PERSON could still be useful to him during the investigation , even if the outcome was no longer of much importance . The result sought had already been achieved .", "What will happen next is already predictable . In CARDINAL to CARDINAL months\u2019 time the investigation will be closed . But ORG will not be able to resurrect his political career . What a stroke of luck . PERSON , on the other hand , will be portrayed as an objective judge whose duty obliged him to prosecute but who realised he had been in the wrong . He will become a hero . And that , if there is a God , cries out for vengeance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting on a complaint by PERSON , the judge responsible for preliminary investigations committed the applicant and the manager of ORG for trial in the Monza ORG . The applicant was accused of defamation through the medium of the press ( diffamazione a mezzo stampa ) , aggravated by the fact that the offence had been committed to the detriment of a civil servant in the performance of his official duties .", "CARDINAL . At the trial on DATE the civil party asked for the report on the evidence given by PERSON to the GPE judicial authorities and a copy of the NORP DATE newspaper ORG which that evidence had been published to be added to the file .", "The defence asked for CARDINAL press articles concerning PERSON professional relations with the pentito PERSON to be added to the file and for the complainant to be required to give evidence . In an order made on DATE ORG refused these requests on the grounds that the documents in question were not relevant to the object of the proceedings ( defamation ) and that there was no point taking evidence from PERSON in view of the tenor of the article written by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , applying LAW , LAW and CARDINAL and LAW of LAW and LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) , ORG sentenced the manager of ORG and the applicant to fines of CARDINAL and MONEY ( ITL ) respectively , payment of damages and costs in the sum of ITL CARDINAL , payment of the civil party \u2019s costs and publication of the judgment in ORG . In its reasoning ORG included the following considerations :", "\u201c ...", "The author of this article , taking as his theme the case against Senator PERSON , gave a biography of the complainant in terms which emphasised his cultural background and above all his ideological leanings \u2013 allegedly close to the ORG ( now the PDS ) DATE contending that these leanings had decisively influenced [ the complainant \u2019s ] professional activity to the extent of making him the instrument of a grand design of that party , namely to take control of the judicial organs , particularly the public ORG offices .", "Mr ORG stressed the long - standing friendship between the complainant and the MP PERSON , asserting that the latter acted as the head in a strategy where PERSON was the arm . He added to his summary biography phrases with a particularly striking literal meaning such as : \u2018 When he was admitted to ORG he swore a threefold oath of obedience \u2013 to God , to the PERSON and to via PERSON . And PERSON became the judge he has remained for DATE \u2013 pious , stern and partisan.\u2019", "He accused PERSON of having managed \u2018 the NORP investigation\u2019 in furtherance of a grand political design hatched by PERSON on behalf of the ORG / PDS , which was to break up by judicial process the dominant political class at the time , so that the favoured party could take power by non - electoral means .", "He suggested that the charges against Mr Andreotti , the last politician of any standing not to have been laid low by the \u2018 clean hands\u2019 [ mani pulite ] inquiries in progress , should be seen in the context of that exploitation of the investigation .", "...", "The defamatory nature of the article ... is absolutely manifest , given that the text categorically excluded the possibility that PERSON might be faithful to the deontological obligations of his duties as an officer in the ORG legal service and denied that he possessed the qualities of impartiality , independence , objectivity and probity which characterise the exercise of judicial functions , an activity which the complainant was even alleged to have used for political ends , according to the author of the article .", "In the present case exercise of the right to report current events can not be pleaded as an extenuating circumstance , Mr ORG not having adduced the slightest evidence in support of his very serious allegations . Nor can he rely on exercise of the right to comment on them \u2013 a right which would certainly be enjoyed by a journalist who , in reporting court proceedings , criticises this or that measure DATE given that the offending assertions in the article amount to nothing more than an unjustified attack on the complainant , which foully besmirched his honour and reputation . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . Relying on the freedom of the press , and in particular the right to report and comment on current events , he contended , among other arguments , that what he had written about Mr Caselli \u2019s political leanings was true and that the court could have verified that by agreeing to take evidence from the complainant himself ; that ORG were indeed friends ; and that it was likewise true that PERSON had used the help of the pentito Buscetta in the proceedings against ORG , and , as the representative of the ORG , had paid him sums of money , all pentiti being remunerated by ORG . Describing himself in addition as an opinion columnist ( opinionista ) , he asserted that he had not intended to give a biography of PERSON but rather to express his critical opinions , in a figurative and forceful way . More precisely , he had made critical judgments , which were admittedly more or less well founded and with which readers might or might not agree , but which were explicitly derived from the factual premise , namely ORG \u2019s political activity . Lastly , he demanded that evidence be taken from the complainant and from certain journalists and figures in NORP politics who , like PERSON , had been ORG militants . In particular , he asked for evidence to be taken from Mr PERSON and PERSON and for press articles on interviews in which the QUANTITY men had confirmed the complainant \u2019s active political militancy to be added to the file . In particular , in an interview published in the DATE newspaper ORG on DATE , extracts from which were quoted in the applicant \u2019s appeal , PERSON had stated , inter alia , that the complainant was a brave man of great integrity but that he was influenced by the cultural and political model of communism , that his relations with the former ORG had been very close and that he had later all but joined the party . In an interview given to another DATE newspaper , ORG , which published it on DATE , Mr PERSON had asserted that he had taken part in CARDINAL of political meetings with ORG among others during DATE in the GPE federation of the former ORG . He had gone on to say that although ORG , a man of integrity , had done good work against terrorism as an officer of the ORG legal service , he was heavily politicised and should therefore avoid speaking like a tribune of the people .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , ruling as follows :", "\u201c ... the statements noted in the charges ... are undeniably seriously damaging to the reputation of the injured party . They go further than casting doubt \u2013 as the charges say DATE on PERSON loyalty to the country \u2019s institutions , his faithfulness to the principle of legality , his objectivity and his independence ; they categorically deny that he possesses those qualities and even attribute to him , among other accusations , instances of conduct which constitute disciplinary and criminal offences . \u201d", "ORG held that it was evident that the article essentially referred to facts , some of which were not in the least defamatory and were therefore not relevant to the decision to be taken .", "\u201c In particular , the following elements are undeniably facts ( not judgments ) , and CARDINAL of the appeal pleadings ( from lawyer PERSON ) refers to them as such :", "( i ) PERSON political leanings ;", "( ii ) the friendship between Mr PERSON and MP PERSON ;", "( iii ) the information that as public prosecutor in GPE Mr Caselli used the statements of the criminal - turned - informer Buscetta in the investigation concerning Mr Andreotti , and the information that the same Buscetta , like other pentiti , is paid by the ORG .", "Those elements are facts and in itself merely stating them is not in the least defamatory ; they are therefore not relevant to the decision this ORG has to take . That seems quite obvious as regards the last CARDINAL pieces of information above , but is also true of the first ( PERSON political leanings ) , since the ORG guarantees not only freedom of thought and the freedom to express thoughts but also the freedom of association in political parties .", "It is therefore not relevant to try to ascertain what political beliefs PERSON holds and whether or not he expressed them in specific circumstances ( and at all events outside the judicial sphere and the performance of his duties ) since that information could not in any case be considered defamatory in itself ...", "There is therefore no basis for the request that the proceedings be reopened , firstly so that PERSON can be heard as a witness , and secondly to obtain the production of the press articles of PERSON and PERSON , but also so that witness evidence can be taken from them , once again on the subject of [ PERSON \u2019s ] political militancy or at any rate of [ his ] ... political participation in the ORG / PDS . First of all , that information , as has already been said , is barely touched upon in the article , and in the second place it can not in any event be regarded as damaging to the complainant \u2019s reputation and accordingly does not need to be verified . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Other facts imputed to the complainant were , on the contrary , undeniably defamatory . First of all , there was the oath of obedience , which , beyond its symbolic import , bore the precise accusation that PERSON had given a personal and lasting undertaking to \u201c obey \u201d , in the course of his duties , the law , his religious beliefs and \u201c the instructions of the leaders \u201d of a political party .", "ORG continued :", "\u201c The remainder of the article , which gives a highly defamatory account of Mr ORG \u2019s alleged obedience to ORG , confirms that the journalist was not expressing judgments or personal opinions but imputing specific conduct to PERSON .", "Further on the article asserts", "( i ) that PERSON is PERSON twin brother , ...", "( ii ) that the ORG ... set in motion a strategy of seizing control of all the public ORG offices in GPE by applying CARDINAL of the MP \u2019s ideas , the first being to gain power ... by using the judicial machine and the second to resort simply to opening a judicial investigation ... in order to destroy the careers [ of political opponents ] since there was no need to go to the trouble of a trial , it was enough to put someone in the pillory .", "It is in that context that the journalist referred to CARDINAL actions by PERSON : his request for a transfer to the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office and subsequent appointment to the post of public prosecutor there and his notification to Mr Andreotti that he faced prosecution for belonging to a ORG - type organisation .", "...", "The journalist ORG did not therefore express opinions or judgments but attributed to the complainant PERSON in a highly defamatory manner conduct and acts about which \u2013 and here we can only repeat what ORG said DATE he did not adduce a scrap of evidence ; he did not even seek to prove his case , as his lawyers argue that he was merely expressing opinions .", "... The journalist [ having ] attributed specific acts to public prosecutor PERSON without verifying his assertions in any way and in a totally gratuitous manner , his conduct can not be explained by errors or misunderstandings , but only as a deliberate act .", "That is confirmed by the literal content of the whole article , in which the person of PERSON is constantly and subtly denigrated , even though a few positive remarks are skilfully mixed in with the attacks . ...", "The content of the whole article shows that there was no unintentional fault on the defendant \u2019s part but that he was fully aware that he was damaging another \u2019s reputation and even that he intended to do so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment , ruling that it was quite correct both as regards the merits and from the procedural point of view .", "\u201c ...", "Contrary to what has been alleged , the requests for leave to adduce evidence filed by the defence were interpreted in accordance with their exact significance and probative value and were rightly refused because they were totally devoid of relevance to the decision .", "The appeal written and signed jointly by the defendant ORG and his lawyer Mr ORG contains a request for the proceedings to be reopened , with a view , firstly , to \u2018 taking witness evidence from the civil party\u2019 , in particular \u2018 about the forms and modalities of his militancy , or at least of his political participation in the activities of the ORG / PDS during the period when he was already a public prosecutor , and about all the other points which offended the complainant\u2019 . The absolutely vague and irrelevant nature of the request is manifest in the light of the tenor of the phrases used by PERSON ( in whose article the allusion to Mr PERSON \u2019s militancy is by no means limited , as Mr PERSON argued in the grounds of appeal , to the assertion that Mr PERSON associated himself with ORG while he was at university , an assertion which would , incidentally , not constitute an insult ) ; the article set out to give a detailed account of the forms taken by that militancy by imputing certain acts to PERSON with the aim of proving that his militancy existed . Consequently , either this point remains vague or the problem is resolved by trying to make the complainant admit the facts noted in the charges , with the result that the burden of proof is shifted away from [ Mr ORG and Mr GPE ] . ...", "Moreover , the \u2018 direct witnesses\u2019 , PERSON and PERSON , are mentioned in connection with the above point [ the forms taken by the complainant \u2019s militancy ] ; what has just been said about the vagueness and irrelevance of that point therefore applies equally to those persons . Furthermore , giving further details about facts of which they had direct knowledge would have had no bearing on the trial since these were assertions which the trial court did not consider offensive and to speak of this as exculpatory evidence is accordingly meaningless .", "Lastly , Mr PERSON \u2019s militancy within the ORG has nothing to do with the specific facts attributed to him , and therefore with his alleged oath of obedience to via PERSON ( to which , however , this ground of appeal makes no allusion ) , with the relations between PERSON and PERSON and above all with an alleged link with PERSON .", "Apart from the procedural aspect of the question , it should be stated at the outset that even the argument that the content of the article was not objectively offensive is absolutely devoid of foundation , as the judgment given by the trial court was justified in every respect as regards the offensive nature , for a man even more than for an officer of the ORG legal service , of imputations of specific facts implying a lack of personality , dignity , independent thought , coherence and moral honesty , and conduct signifying explicitly that there have been instances of dereliction of professional duty . ...", "The trial court \u2019s reasoning on the extenuating circumstances of the right to report current events and the right to comment on them is also correct , as evidenced by an appropriate statement of the reasons which was free of mistakes in law and errors of logic .", "No link can be established , and moreover no link was established by ORG , between the personality [ of PERSON ] and an alleged right to report current events exercised through the offensive imputation of facts which have not been proved to be true and play no informative role .", "The essential point in the judgment is its categorical exclusion of the idea that the article expressed a critical judgment , hence the rejection of the plea that the right to freedom of expression constituted an extenuating circumstance . And in fact it is precisely by virtue of this comparative parameter and of its accessory powers of cognition that this court must repeat that the reasons given [ by ORG ] are immune to criticism : the article is quite clearly a bare list of acts and conduct imputed to PERSON in which there can not be seen , even in veiled form , the slightest contribution to thought which might be regarded as a critical judgment , or even the attempt at irony which is said to be hidden in the elusive \u2018 caustic ORG referred to in the grounds of appeal . As ORG concluded , this case was not about respect for the limits of formal propriety .", "It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that , as it is impossible to speak of critical comment , there is no cause to expatiate about exercise of the right to comment , still less about the extenuating circumstance of gross negligence in the exercise of the right to comment or about the hypothetical exercise of that right .", "... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
