The applicant company is registered under NORP PERSON and is based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company exported organic bananas to LOC . In DATE it concluded a commission contract with CARDINAL NORP companies , agreeing that all legal disputes would be brought before the courts in GPE . The contract also included a clause that legal disputes be settled by an arbitration tribunal in GPE .", "CARDINAL .

The court also held that , even if the applicant company were to be put on a par with a domestic legal person , the non - litigation of the applicant company \u2019s case did not run counter to the general interest . Relying on a ruling of ORG ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , report BVerfGE CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) , it considered in this regard that even a domestic legal entity retained its right to exist under the legal order only if it was able to pursue its objectives by virtue of its own strength and means .", "CARDINAL .
