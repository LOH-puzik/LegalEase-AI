In Chapter XXV of LAW , freedom of expression is restricted in the interest of the rights and reputation of others . When deciding the limits of freedom of expression , the possibility of a public debate has to be guaranteed .", "[ The applicants ] claim that the statements are true and refer to the principle that they can not be held liable for true statements . It is undisputed that , before the newspaper coverage , [ the police ] had been informed by the liquidator of a reasonable suspicion of criminal acts by the company \u2019s board members , of which A was one . It is also clear that the information given by the liquidator was based on [ the accountancy firm \u2019s ] report of DATE . An email of CARDINAL DATE from [ the prosecutor ] to [ A \u2019s ] lawyer stated that the liquidator \u2019s report was being \u201c examined \u201d [ \u201c til sko\u00f0unar \u201d ] .

Here it has to be taken into account that in general the media are required to base coverage on thorough research of the facts . Taking this into account , and having regard to [ the absence of a formal decision by the police to investigate ] [ the company ] and its board members , including [ A ] , the court can not accept [ the applicant \u2019s ] arguments . No police investigation had been instigated against [ A ] , thus the statements \u201c Police investigate Assistant Professor \u201d and \u201c Assistant professor entangled in police investigation \u201d were factually wrong , but both statements did in fact have the same meaning . It was not unreasonably difficult to verify whether such an investigation had in fact been opened . The wording of the statements was of such a nature as to make the reader believe that [ A ] was a suspect in a police investigation because of his criminal and punishable acts . This damaged [ A \u2019s ] reputation . Therefore , the court has to agree with [ A ] that [ the applicants ] violated Article CARDINAL of the Penal Code No CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( Almenn Hegningarl\u00f6g ) by publishing the aforementioned statements .
