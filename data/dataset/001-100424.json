He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of rape . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention ( LAW , see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to suspend the remainder of his sentence , which he would have served fully on DATE , and his preventive detention on probation .", "The applicant was initially represented by counsel K .- B. By letter of CARDINAL DATE he requested ORG to appoint counsel PERSON , practising in GPE , to represent him in the proceedings , arguing that K .- B. was not qualified in respect of the subject - matter of the proceedings whereas counsel PERSON was specialised in execution of sentences and sexual offences .", "On DATE the presiding judge of ORG dismissed that request , arguing that the applicant was already represented by counsel and that there was no reason to appoint counsel who was not practising within the court 's judicial district .", "On DATE the presiding judge of ORG informed the applicant that counsel PERSON had withdrawn from the case and that it intended to appoint counsel PERSON , practising in GPE and specialised in criminal law , to represent him ( LAW , applied by analogy ; see Relevant domestic law below ) . The applicant was invited to either give grounds if he objected to that appointment , to propose a different counsel practising in GPE as officially appointed counsel or to mandate a new counsel .", "By letter dated DATE , counsel PERSON submitted a power of attorney and applied for access to the case - file and to be officially appointed as the applicant had insufficient means to afford a lawyer .", "Having received that letter , the presiding judge of ORG asked counsel PERSON by letter dated DATE whether he intended to act as the applicant 's mandated counsel ; otherwise , the court would appoint a lawyer practising in GPE . The presiding judge further refused PERSON access to the case - file because it was not sure whether the files would be available for the hearing scheduled on CARDINAL DATE if they were sent to GPE after having been returned by the expert .", "By a decision of DATE , the presiding judge of ORG dismissed the applicant 's fresh request to appoint counsel PERSON to represent him . He found that there was nothing to indicate that a firm relationship of trust had developed between them which would justify appointing PERSON despite the considerable additional costs involved .", "On DATE the presiding judge of ORG , having received no objections by counsel PERSON , appointed counsel PERSON to act for the applicant .", "On DATE ORG , in his submissions on the applicant 's appeal against the decision of DATE , took the view that the applicant 's appeal was well - founded as ORG should have appointed him counsel PERSON as he had requested . ORG considered that in cases in which the detainee , as in the present case , had proposed to appoint him defence counsel who met the professional requirements and was able to guarantee a proper conduct of the proceedings , the court had to appoint him the counsel he had chosen . This equally applied in cases in which the defendant had chosen a counsel who was not practising within the court 's judicial district . Weighing the interests involved , the interest in proximity was outweighed by the defendant 's interest in being defended by a counsel he particularly trusted in . The distance between GPE and GPE , having regard to the good traffic connections and modern means of communication , did not jeopardize a proper defence and conduct of the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against ORG decision of DATE refusing to appoint him a counsel not practising within the court 's judicial district as ill - founded .", "It agreed with ORG view that the applicant had to be represented by counsel in the proceedings at issue pursuant to LAW , applied by analogy , as the proceedings were complex , as the decision on the applicant 's preventive detention was of importance and as the applicant could not defend himself in person in the hearing in which an expert report on him had to be examined .", "However , unlike ORG , ORG considered that ORG had not been obliged to appoint the applicant counsel PERSON , who was not practising within its judicial district . The appointment of defence counsel named by the detainee required , as a rule , that he proposed a lawyer admitted to practise within the court 's judicial district ( LAW ; see Relevant domestic law below ) . This rule was adequate because defence counsel 's proximity to the court was essential in order to conduct a proper defence .", "It facilitated the conduct of the proceedings and counsel 's communication with his client in detention DATE for which modern methods of communication did not make a difference \u2013 and with the other parties to the proceedings . The lack of proximity was a significant ground not to appoint a lawyer chosen by the detainee for the purposes of LAW . Counsel PERSON resided QUANTITY away from the court and from the prison in which the applicant was detained .", "ORG further found that an external counsel could only be appointed in exceptional cases , in which there was a particular relationship of trust between him and the detainee . However , there was nothing to indicate and the applicant failed to substantiate that there was a firm relationship of confidence between him and counsel PERSON The applicant had never met in person counsel PERSON who had never previously defended him . The fact that counsel PERSON had applied for access to the case - file did not suffice to demonstrate such a relationship of trust . There was also nothing to indicate that counsel PERSON was more experienced in execution matters than counsel PERSON who had been appointed to represent the applicant .", "On DATE the presiding judge of ORG dismissed the applicant 's fresh request dated DATE , made in person , to appoint counsel PERSON to represent him in the proceedings concerning the execution of his sentence . Relying on LAW , applied by analogy , the court found that the applicant had already been appointed counsel PERSON for the proceedings at issue and that there were no apparent grounds to appoint him another counsel .", "On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "ORG disagreed with the applicant 's view that he was not represented by counsel in accordance with the requirements of a fair trial . It further rejected counsel PERSON 's argument that the court 's appointment of counsel PERSON was arbitrary in view of what was at stake in the proceedings , the applicant 's preventive detention .", "ORG expressly endorsed the reasons it had given in its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see above ) , in which it had already dismissed the applicant 's request to appoint counsel PERSON by a final decision . These reasons also applied if the applicant had to be understood now to have requested the appointment of counsel PERSON to a more limited extent , namely only in order to appeal against a decision taken on his challenges for bias . Having regard to the complexity of the proceedings , the applicant had been appointed counsel PERSON for the entire proceedings concerning his preventive detention . As ORG had dismissed the applicant 's request to be appointed counsel PERSON by its final decision of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant 's new request to be appointed counsel PERSON for the proceedings or for parts thereof was inadmissible .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against the decision of ORG of DATE . He complained about the failure to appoint him the counsel of his choice , PERSON , and argued that this had deprived him of an effective defence and had led to his prolonged detention beyond CARDINAL DATE when he had fully served his sentence .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint as it lacked prospects of success ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "ORG reiterated that the right of a defendant to a fair trial comprised the right , aimed at ensuring equality of arms , to defend himself by counsel of his own choosing . Therefore , if the requirements of LAW were met , the defendant should be appointed the lawyer he or she trusted in unless there were important grounds not to do so . However , a defendant could not claim to be represented by a counsel proposed by him in all circumstances .", "ORG found that the impugned decision of ORG of DATE complied with these constitutional requirements . In its thoroughly reasoned decision of CARDINAL DATE , to which the impugned decision had referred , ORG considered that a lawyer who did not practise within the court 's judicial district could only be appointed by the court if there was a special relationship of trust between that counsel and the applicant . It had not been arbitrary for ORG to refuse to appoint the lawyer not practising within the court '", "On DATE ORG , having regard to the report submitted by a psychiatric expert it had consulted , ordered that the applicant be placed in preventive detention pursuant to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "LAW lays down the circumstances in which a defendant must be represented by defence counsel . Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , the presiding judge shall appoint defence counsel on request or ex officio if the assistance of defence counsel appears necessary in view of the seriousness of the offence or in view of the factual or legal complexity of the proceedings or if it is evident that the defendant can not defend himself in person . The latter provision is applied by analogy , in particular , to proceedings under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW for review , before completion of the offender 's prison term , of whether the execution of a preventive detention order against him or her is still necessary in view of its objective to protect the public from a dangerous offender ( see LAW ) or shall be suspended on probation .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , in its version in force at the relevant time , provided that defence counsel to be appointed shall be chosen by the presiding judge , if possible , from the group of lawyers admitted to practice before a court within the court 's judicial district . The defendant is to be given the opportunity of naming an attorney - at - law within a time - limit to be specified . The presiding judge shall appoint defence counsel named by the defendant unless there are significant grounds for not doing so ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
