ORG The applicant , who is a NORP citizen , was born in DATE and registered in the birth register as a male , under the male NORP names of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG At DATE the applicant realised that she was unlike other boys and , by DATE , she understood that , although she had male external genitalia , she was psychologically of the female sex .", "In DATE she abandoned her male NORP names and assumed the female NORP name of PERSON , a change which she confirmed by deed poll ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in DATE . Since DATE she has been known under that name for all purposes , has dressed as a woman and has adopted a female role .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE the applicant , who had previously taken female hormones and had had an operation for breast augmentation involving implants , underwent gender reassignment surgery in a GPE hospital , to render the external anatomy nearer that of the female gender .", "A medical report dated DATE describes Miss PERSON as a pleasant young woman , states that she has lived a full life as a female , both psychologically and physically , since the surgery and records that a genital examination showed her to have the external genitalia and vagina of a female . As a post - operative female transsexual , she is able to have sexual intercourse with a man .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE the applicant was issued with a GPE passport as a female ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . From DATE she was a successful fashion model , featuring regularly in newspapers , magazines and advertisements .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE Miss PERSON and PERSON , an NORP national whom she had known for DATE , wished to marry each other .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG informed the applicant that such a marriage would be void as a matter of LANGUAGE law , because it would classify her as male notwithstanding her anatomical and psychological status . Her Member of ORG advised her in a letter of CARDINAL DATE that a change in the law would be required to enable her to marry . A reply on behalf of ORG , dated DATE , to a further enquiry by the applicant stated that she could not be granted a birth certificate showing her sex as female , since such a certificate records details as at the date of birth ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "In DATE - after the date of her application to the Commission - Miss PERSON and PERSON ceased to be engaged to be married , though they remained good friends .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant purported to marry a PERSON , at a ceremony conducted at a GPE synagogue . However , their relationship terminated on DATE of DATE .", "Following a petition filed by PERSON , who had been advised that this was her only means of obtaining financial relief , the marriage was , by decree nisi made by ORG on DATE , pronounced to have been by law void by reason of the parties not being respectively male and female ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . That decree was made final on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the GPE gender reassignment operations are permitted without legal formalities . The operations and treatment may be carried out under ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under LANGUAGE law a person is entitled to adopt such first names or surname as he or she wishes and to use these new names without any restrictions or formalities , except in connection with the practice of some professions where the use of the new names may be subject to certain formalities ( see , inter alia , GPE \u2019s ORG , CARDINALth ed . , vol . CARDINAL , paras . DATE ) . For the purposes of record and to obviate the doubt and confusion which a change of name is likely to involve , the person concerned very frequently makes a declaration in the form of a \" deed poll \" which may be enrolled with ORG .", "The new names are valid for purposes of legal identification and may be used in documents such as passports , driving licences , car registration books , national insurance cards , medical cards , tax codings and social security papers . The new names are also entered on the electoral roll .", "CARDINAL . ORG Civil status certificates or equivalent current identity documents are not in use or required in GPE . Where some form of identification is needed , this is normally met by the production of a driving licence or a passport . These and other identity documents may , according to the prevailing practice , be issued in the adopted names of the person in question with a minimum of formality . In the case of transsexuals , the documents are also issued so as to be in all respects consistent with the new identity . Thus , the practice is to allow the transsexual to have a current photograph in his or her passport and the prefix \" Mr \" , \" Mrs \" , \" Ms \" or \" Miss \" , as appropriate , before his or her adopted names .", "CARDINAL . ORG The system of civil registration of births , deaths and marriages was established by statute in GPE and GPE in DATE . Registration of births is at present governed by ORG \" the CARDINAL LAW \" ) , which requires that the birth of every child be registered by ORG for the area in which the child is born . The particulars to be entered are prescribed in regulations made under LAW .", "A birth certificate takes the form either of an authenticated copy of the entry in the register of births or of an extract from the register . A certificate of the latter kind , known as a \" short certificate of birth \" , is in a form prescribed and contains such particulars as are prescribed by regulations made under LAW , that is the name and surname , sex , date of birth and place of birth of the individual . It omits , notably , any particulars relating to parentage or adoption contained in the register .", "An entry in a birth register and the certificate derived therefrom are records of facts at the time of birth . Thus , in GPE and GPE the birth certificate constitutes a document revealing not current identity , but historical facts . The system is intended to provide accurate and authenticated evidence of the events themselves and also to enable the establishment of the connections of families for purposes related to succession , legitimate descent and distribution of property . The registration records also form the basis for a comprehensive range of vital statistics and constitute an integral and essential part of the statistical study of population and its growth , medical and fertility research and the like .", "CARDINAL . ORG The DATE LAW provides for the correction , by the registrar or superintendent registrar , of clerical errors , such as the incorrect statement or omission of DATE of the birth , and for the correction of factual errors ; however , in the latter case , an amendment can be made only if the error occurred when the birth was registered . The birth register may also , within DATE from the date of registration , be altered to give or change the name of a child .", "Statutory provision is made for the re - registration of the birth of a child who has been legitimated by the subsequent marriage of his parents . Thereafter birth certificates supplied concerning him take the form of a certified copy of the entry of re - registration ; no copy of the previous entry may be given except under the direction of ORG .", "Under LAW DATE , where a child is adopted , an entry ( not including the names of the natural parents ) will be made in a separate register known as LAW . In addition , the original entry in the register of births will be marked with the word \" Adopted \" . The Registrar General keeps books to make traceable the connection between the entries in the CARDINAL registers but these books are not accessible to the public , save on application by the adopted person himself or by order of a court . It is open to anyone to obtain a certified copy of the entry in LAW or a short certificate which contains no particulars relating to parentage .", "CARDINAL . ORG The criteria for determining the sex of the person to be registered are not laid down in the DATE Act nor in any of the regulations made under it . However , the practice of ORG is to use exclusively the biological criteria : chromosomal , gonadal and genital sex . The fact that it becomes evident later in life that the person \u2019s \" psychological sex \" is at variance with these biological criteria is not considered to imply that the initial entry was a factual error and , accordingly , any request to have the initial entry changed on this ground will be refused . Only in cases of a clerical error , or where the apparent and genital sex of the child was wrongly identified or in case of biological intersex , i.e. cases in which the biological criteria are not congruent , will a change of the initial entry be contemplated and it is necessary to adduce medical evidence that the initial entry was incorrect . However , no error is accepted to exist in the birth entry of a person who undergoes medical and surgical treatment to enable that person to assume the role of the opposite sex .", "CARDINAL . ORG Indexes are maintained of all entries in birth registers . It is open to any member of the public to search the indexes ( but not the registers themselves ) and obtain a certified copy of any such entry . However , identification of the index reference requires prior knowledge not only of the name under which the person concerned was registered , but also of the approximate date and place of birth and the registration district .", "CARDINAL . ORG The law does not require that the birth certificate be produced for any particular purpose , although a certificate may in practice be requested by certain institutions and employers .", "A birth certificate has in general to accompany a first application for a passport , but is not needed for its renewal or replacement or for an application for a driving licence . A birth certificate is also usually ( though not invariably ) required by insurance companies when issuing pension or annuity policies , but not for the issue of motor or household policies nor , as a rule , for the issue of a life insurance policy . It may also be required when enrolling at a university and when applying for employment , inter alia , with the Government . In the case of a religious marriage ceremony , the celebrant is not obliged nor is there any statutory power under LANGUAGE law to ask the parties to produce copies of their birth certificates ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In LANGUAGE law , marriage is defined as a voluntary union for life of CARDINAL man and CARDINAL woman to the exclusion of all others ( per Lord GPE in PERSON ( DATE ) Law Reports CARDINAL Probate and Divorce CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) . LAW DATE gives statutory effect to the common - law provision that a marriage is void ab initio if the parties are not respectively male and female .", "Under LAW of the same LAW , a marriage which is not consummated owing to the incapacity or wilful refusal of CARDINAL of the parties to consummate it , is voidable .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to the decision of ORG in PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] Probate Reports CARDINAL , sex , for the purpose of contracting a valid marriage , is to be determined by the chromosomal , gonadal and genital tests where these are congruent , and without regard to any operative intervention . The relevance of a birth certificate to the question whether a marriage is void only arises as a matter of evidence which goes to the proof of the identity and sex of the person whose birth it certifies . The entry in the birth register is prima facie evidence of the person \u2019s sex . It may , however , be rebutted if evidence of sufficient weight to the contrary is adduced .", "CARDINAL . ORG If , for the purpose of procuring a marriage or a certificate or licence for marriage , any person knowingly and wilfully makes a false oath or makes or signs a false declaration , notice or certificate required under LAW relating to marriage , he or she is guilty of an offence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . However , a person contracting a marriage abroad is not liable to prosecution under LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG The biological definition of sex laid down in PERSON v. PERSON has been followed by LANGUAGE courts and tribunals on a number of occasions and for purposes other than marriage .", "In CARDINAL case concerning prostitution , a male - to - female transsexual , who had undergone both hormone and surgical treatment , was nevertheless treated as a male by ORG for the purposes of CARDINAL of LAW DATE and section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE v. PERSON and Others [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . In CARDINAL cases concerning social security legislation , male - to - female transsexuals were considered by ORG Commissioner as males for the purposes of retirement age ; in the first case the person in question had only received hormone therapy , in the second she had involuntarily begun to develop female secondary characteristics at DATE , which developments were followed by surgery and adoption of a female social role DATE ( cases R ( P ) CARDINAL and R ( P ) CARDINAL in the DATE Volume of ORG ) . Lastly , in a case before an ORG a female - to - male transsexual , who had not undergone any sex - change treatment , was treated as a female by the ORG for the purposes of LAW DATE ; the person in question had sought and received employment in a position reserved for men under LAW , but was dismissed after discovery of her biological sex ( NORP v.
