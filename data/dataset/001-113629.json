The respondent Government were represented by their Deputy Agent , Ms L. GPE , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the public prosecutor ( officier van justitie ) submitted a request to ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE for a provisional court authorisation ( voorlopige machtiging : hereafter \u201c provisional order \u201d ) to have the applicant committed to a psychiatric hospital pursuant to ORG ( Wet bijzondere opnemingen in psychiatrische ziekenhuizen ; \u201c the LAW \u201d ) .

On DATE the public prosecutor lodged a request for an observation order with ORG . The request was accompanied by a new medical report dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request for the provisional order and instead issued an observation order valid until DATE . In respect of the latter , it held as follows :", "\u201c From the medical report and the clarification provided during the hearing by the physician treating the person concerned it appears that the situation is as follows :", "The person concerned is suffering from a paranoid delusional disorder within the framework of schizophrenia .", "There are serious reasons for believing that a disturbance of the mental faculties of the person concerned will lead her to pose the following danger to herself :", "The person concerned is , probably as a result of her paranoid delusion , very suspicious of her neighbours . The person concerned is said to cause noise disturbance at TIME . There is a danger that , through her bothersome behaviour , the person concerned will provoke aggression of others against herself .", "The committal to and stay in a psychiatric hospital of the person concerned is intended for examination whether she is suffering from a disturbance of the mental faculties and whether that disturbance will lead her to pose a danger to herself .", "The danger can not be averted through the intervention of persons or institutions outside a psychiatric hospital . The person concerned has not shown the necessary willingness to stay in a psychiatric hospital voluntarily . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was admitted to a psychiatric hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) with ORG against the issuing of the observation order . She submitted grounds of appeal including , as relevant to the case before the ORG , that in breach of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW she had not been heard by ORG before the observation order was issued and that , by providing that persons could be committed in order to determine whether they were of unsound mind , section CARDINAL sub h of the Act violated LAW , which allowed the detention of persons of unsound mind only after they had been determined actually to be of unsound mind .", "CARDINAL . NORP In parallel , the applicant started summary injunction proceedings ( kort geding ) before the Provisional Measures Judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of GPE , seeking the immediate suspension of her committal . On DATE the Provisional Measures Judge gave judgment dismissing the applicant \u2019s claims . The reasoning included the finding that the hearing of CARDINAL DATE had been focused on the deprivation of liberty and that the applicant had been informed of the likelihood that an observation order would be given ; a statement made by the applicant \u2019s representative to the effect that the judge had informed him by telephone that another hearing would take place was dismissed as unproven .", "CARDINAL . The applicant remained in hospital until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal inadmissible for lack of interest as the order in issue had already lapsed in the meantime . However , in view of the relevance of the legal questions raised by the grounds for the appeal , ORG nonetheless addressed the merits of a number of her grounds of appeal .", "CARDINAL . Its reasoning , obiter dictum , was as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG nonetheless considers it useful , in view of the importance of the legal questions arising from the points of appeal , to consider the following .", "CARDINAL . The observation order given by ORG in pursuance of section CARDINAL of ORG is grounded on ORG assessment of the state of the person concerned , which is in the following terms :", "[ etc . , see paragraph CARDINAL above ]", "CARDINAL . Point of appeal no . CARDINAL argues that section CARDINAL ) of ORG is incompatible with LAW ) of the LAW , because that provision only allows the detention of persons actually of unsound mind , whereas section CARDINAL ) of ORG provides for compulsory admission to determine whether there is an impairment of the mental faculties .", "CARDINAL . On this point , ORG takes the following view . It follows from the case - law of ORG cited in ... the advisory opinion of ORG that it is , in principle , permissible to deprive persons of unsound mind of their liberty if it has been reliably shown ( op deugdelijke wijze is aangetoond ) that the person concerned is of unsound mind . Nevertheless , the ORG has considered it acceptable that a person may briefly be detained in a psychiatric hospital involuntarily so that it can be determined whether he or she is suffering from a mental illness , but only in urgent cases or when the person concerned is detained in connection with his or her violent behaviour , the examination then having to take place immediately after the deprivation of liberty . In all other cases , an examination into the mental state must precede any deprivation of liberty . If however such an examination proves impossible because the person concerned refuses to submit to examination , review by a medical expert on the basis of the file may suffice , in the absence of which it can not be assumed that the person concerned is mentally ill .", "CARDINAL . An observation order within the meaning of section DATE of ORG is intended , according to the second paragraph of that provision , to determine whether there is a disturbance of the mental factulties and whether the disturbance causes the person concerned to pose a danger to him or herself . The order can be given if , as section CARDINALh(CARDINAL ) provides , there is serious reason to believe ( het ernstig vermoeden bestaat ) that he or she is suffering from a disturbance of his or her mental faculties ( stoornis van de geestvermogens ) which could lead him or her to pose a danger to him- or herself . Section CARDINALh(CARDINAL ) provides that the application for an observation order must be accompanied by a medical report as referred to in that provision , from which it appears that there is a case as referred to in section CARDINALh(CARDINAL ) . Taking this into account , ORG considers it acceptable under LAW to give an observation order only if on the basis of the medical report submitted it can be assumed , with sufficient certainty , that the person concerned is suffering from a disturbance of the mental faculties requiring further examination within the framework of the observation and there is serious reason to believe that that disturbance causes him or her to pose a danger to him or herself . To that extent , it is correctly argued that section DATE , in setting the condition that there is serious reason to believe that the mental disturbance should lead the person concerned to pose a danger to him- or herself , gives a wider description of the cases in which an observation order can be granted than is compatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . Nonetheless , and even assuming that the appeal on points of law were admissible , the point of appeal would not have led ORG to quash ORG judgment . ORG has in fact found , on the basis of the medical report submitted , that the person concerned is suffering from a paranoid delusional disorder within the framework of schizophrenia and that there is serious reason to believe that the person concerned , as a result of this disturbance of her mental faculties , displays noisome behaviour and thereby provokes the aggression of others against herself . In so finding , ORG has not applied section DATE of ORG in a way that is incompatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . Points of appeal CARDINAL and CARDINAL ... complain that ORG acted contrary to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG by deciding without hearing the person concerned and on the basis , additionally , of a new medical report which the person concerned has not been able to challenge . ORG has heard the person concerned on DATE , it is true , but that concerned the public prosecutor \u2019s application ... of DATE for a povisional order within the meaning of section CARDINAL of ORG . It appears that ORG then applied section CARDINAL of ORG , after which the public prosecutor lodged the application for an observation order which ORG accepted in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , which later application , according to the documents contained in the case file , was accompanied by a new medical report dated DATE . ORG does not allow a person concerned to be heard in advance , nor that a person concerned should waive in advance his or her right to be heard on an application for an order based on ORG that has yet to be submitted . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
