The applicant was born in DATE . When lodging his application , he was detained in GPE , GPE . He is presently living in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in PERSON . On DATE the ORG issued a warrant of arrest against the applicant on the ground that there was a strong suspicion that he had committed CARDINAL counts of robbery and CARDINAL count of robbery in connection with attempted murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant with attempted murder , aggravated robbery causing physical injury , and an offence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion to have Mr B. appointed as defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant \u2019s detention on remand be continued on the grounds that the strong suspicion that he had committed the crimes he was accused of persisted and that he was likely to abscond if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG admitted the indictment without modifications and decided to open the trial against the applicant and CARDINAL other accused . The trial started on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG confirmed the arrest warrant of DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to suspend the arrest warrant of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the trial had taken place on DATE with an average duration of TIME , a lay assessor fell ill . As the designated substitute lay assessor had withdrawn previously , also due to illness , the trial had to begin anew .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the arrest warrant . It found that irrespective of the delays occasioned by the FAC illness , the applicant \u2019s continued detention was proportionate given the serious nature of the crimes he was charged with .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial was reopened with CARDINAL substitute lay assessors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE upholding the arrest warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant alleged for the first time that he had been in LOC , in GPE , at the time of the offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to suspend the execution of the arrest warrant . It decided that investigations in GPE with regard to the applicant \u2019s alibi be conducted by way of letters rogatory .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following the applicant \u2019s appeal , refused to change its decision of DATE ( LOC ) and forwarded the appeal to ORG . According to ORG , the applicant \u2019s continued detention on remand was not disproportionate . It reasoned that , if the applicant were convicted , his sentence would exceed the length of the detention on remand so far , due to the serious nature of the crimes and the damages and injuries suffered by the victim . As to the length of the proceedings , ORG noted that there had been debates on whether to disjoin the applicant \u2019s case from the proceedings against his ORG co - accused , but the applicant had not seemed interested in speeding up the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to suspend the execution of the arrest warrant . On DATE ORG , following the applicant \u2019s appeal , confirmed its decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s further appeal and confirmed ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request to dismiss his court - appointed defence counsel from office , as there was no appearance that the said counsel had not fulfilled his duties . It also found that the loss of trust alleged by the applicant and his counsel had not been substantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was informed by ORG that the investigations in GPE with regard to the applicant \u2019s alibi by way of letters rogatory had not been carried out . The applicant stated that he would adduce CARDINAL defence witnesses , CARDINAL at each hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s motion for bias .", "CARDINAL . On DATE one of the CARDINAL alibi witnesses from GPE who had been summoned by ORG through diplomatic channels following the alibi of DATE , appeared and testified in court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to suspend the execution of the arrest warrant . It found that , if released , the applicant very likely would abscond , given the circumstances of his arrest and the sentence which he risked incurring if found guilty as charged . ORG noted that the applicant was residing illegally in GPE and that an expulsion order had been issued against him . It further observed that he had been about to abscond when he was arrested . Under these circumstances , the length of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was not disproportionate . ORG included a detailed account of the trial , explaining the continued conduct of the proceedings , which disclosed that on several occasions witnesses could not be questioned by the court because they either did not come to the hearing or made use of their right not to testify . Furthermore , the applicant and his co - accused had , often later than necessary , filed numerous motions for evidence to be taken . It observed that at the present time , it was not possible to disjoin the applicant \u2019s case from the cases of the other defendants , as they were accused of having committed the offences jointly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE . It found that the length of time spent in detention on remand alone did not justify releasing the applicant and that his continued detention was proportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to suspend the execution of the arrest warrant on the ground that contrary to his allegations , suspicion persisted that the applicant had committed the crimes he was accused of . It was still likely that he would abscond if released , given in particular the high prison sentence he risked incurring if found guilty according to the indictment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused to change its decision of CARDINAL DATE and forwarded the applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG . It noted that the applicant had caused some of the procedural delays himself by knowingly delaying the naming of defence witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and confirmed the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint against the decisions of ORG of DATE and of ORG of DATE with ORG . He argued that his continued detention on remand , given , inter alia , the excessive duration of the trial before ORG , was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG had been informed that another CARDINAL defence witnesses from GPE refused to appear in court . The translated protocols of their hearing , which had been conducted by way of letters rogatory by judges in GPE , were read out in court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG pronounced its judgment after having held an average of CARDINAL hearings per month with an average duration of CARDINAL and a half hours each . It convicted the applicant of aggravated robbery and dangerous bodily injury and acquitted him of attempted murder . It found that the applicant and his co - accused PERSON , who had both been masked and had been carrying weapons , had broken into PERSON \u2019s house and had robbed PERSON by use of force . It sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In fixing the length of the sentence , ORG took into consideration as a mitigating factor the inordinate length of his detention on remand and of the criminal proceedings . It refered in particular to the delay occasioned by the sickness of the lay assessors and the ensuing suspension of proceedings , and stated that this delay was not imputable to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to suspend the execution of the arrest warrant . It argued that the applicant had been sentenced to DATE imprisonment and that his detention on remand was not yet disproportionate as he had not yet served CARDINAL of his prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . It found that the danger that the applicant might abscond if released still persisted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged another complaint with ORG . He complained that ORG , in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , and ORG , in its decision of DATE , had refused to suspend the execution of the arrest warrant . In particular , the said courts had not taken the length of his detention on remand and of the criminal proceedings adequately into consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the reasoned judgment of ORG , comprising CARDINAL pages , was deposited with its registry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to suspend the execution of the arrest warrant against the applicant . On DATE the applicant was released from prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant substantiated his appeal on points of law . He argued , inter alia , that in its decision , ORG had not taken the length of the criminal proceedings adequately into account and had not specified the effects of this length on the sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG filed its observations on the applicant \u2019s appeal with ORG . On DATE ORG sent the case - files to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent the case - files and his own motions concerning the applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG .", "DATE . On DATE ORG , after a hearing , partly quashed the judgment of ORG in respect of the applicant \u2019s sentence and remitted the case to a different chamber of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the reasons of the judgment prepared on DATE , ORG found that the duty to proceed expeditiously guaranteed by LAW had been violated at least during DATE second trial by ORG . It stated that the judges rehearing the case would have to assess in detail the reasons and exact length of these delays as well as further delays contrary to the rule of law which had occurred afterwards . They would then have to fix explicitly the sentence which would have been adequate without the delays in the proceedings and the actual sentence as mitigated because of these delays , thereby precisely assessing the amount of compensation granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the arrest warrant against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened the new trial against the applicant . On DATE , after a total of CARDINAL hearings , it sentenced the applicant to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for the crimes of aggravated robbery and dangerous bodily injury he had already been finally convicted of . It suspended on probation the remainder of the applicant \u2019s sentence which he had not yet served in detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . In its reasons for fixing the said prison sentence , ORG found that , having regard to all factors aggravating and mitigating the applicant \u2019s guilt , it would have sentenced the applicant to nine years\u2019 imprisonment if the proceedings had been terminated within a reasonable time . However , the applicant \u2019s right under LAW to a hearing within a reasonable time had been violated in the proceedings against him , which necessitated the reduction of his sentence .", "CARDINAL . ORG argued in particular that in the criminal proceedings as a whole there had been a total delay of DATE and DATE which was imputable to the judicial authorities . In particular , it was attributable to them that the initial trial before ORG had to begin anew after DATE , because a lay assessor had fallen ill .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that in the second trial before ORG , there had been a total delay of DATE for which the judicial authorities were responsible . It listed in detail the exact periods in which the proceedings had not been conducted within a reasonable time in this respect . As the courts were understaffed , it had in fact not been possible to conduct the proceedings more expeditiously , but this was not the applicant \u2019s fault . However , the applicant himself had also caused considerable delays in these proceedings . He had alleged for the first time only on DATE that he had been in GPE at the time of the offence , and had subsequently named numerous defence witnesses resident in GPE in an attempt to establish his false alibi . The court found that the slow execution of the letters rogatory by the foreign authorities to verify the applicant \u2019s alibi was also imputable to the NORP judicial authorities . Despite this , the applicant \u2019s choice of the points in time and way of lodging motions for evidence to be taken had contributed significantly to the total duration of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG found that there had been a total delay of DATE in the proceedings before ORG which were imputable to the judicial authorities , notably ORG and ORG itself .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG observed that there had been a delay of DATE in the current retrial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the delays caused during the second trial before ORG , when the applicant had already been detained on remand for DATE , were of a particular gravity . These delays also violated LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently lodged an appeal on points of law against ORG judgment delivered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded . It reasoned in particular that in ORG findings concerning the specific delays in the proceedings there was merely a mistake for the benefit of the applicant . It argued that the illness of CARDINAL lay assessors in the first trial before ORG had caused an unavoidable interruption of the proceedings . The loss of time caused thereby could not be qualified as a delay within the meaning of LAW . Apart from that , ORG agreed with the periods of time determined by ORG in which the applicant \u2019s proceedings had not been conducted with the necessary diligence .", "CARDINAL . As regards the delays caused by the retrial in ORG after the remittal of the case , ORG stressed that it had been correct merely to take into consideration the actual delays imputable to the judicial authorities . The right to lodge an appeal on points of law served to protect the applicant \u2019s rights . The fact as such that ORG judgment had partly been quashed on appeal did not , therefore , necessitate treating the whole duration of the retrial as a delay within the meaning of LAW . Only in cases in which a lower court had made a significant error of law a different conclusion might be called for . However , even if the whole duration of the retrial before ORG were to be treated as a delay imputable to the judicial authorities within the meaning of LAW , the total reduction of the applicant \u2019s sentence , having regard to the brutality of his crime , would be adequate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( decision served on CARDINAL DATE ) ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint that he had not been adequately heard as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . He claimed that the length of his detention on remand and the length of the criminal proceedings against him had violated his rights guaranteed by LAW . The proceedings are currently pending in ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
