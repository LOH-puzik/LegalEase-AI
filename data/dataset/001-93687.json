Recommendation Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL of ORG to member states on the improvement of domestic remedies ( adopted by ORG on DATE at its CARDINALth Session ) , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c Remedies following a \u201c pilot \u201d judgment", "CARDINAL . When a judgment which points to structural or general deficiencies in national law or practice ( \u201c pilot case \u201d ) has been delivered and a large number of applications to the ORG concerning the same problem ( \u201c repetitive cases \u201d ) are pending or likely to be lodged , the respondent state should ensure that potential applicants have , where appropriate , an effective remedy allowing them to apply to a competent national authority , which may also apply to current applicants . Such a rapid and effective remedy would enable them to obtain redress at national level , in line with the principle of subsidiarity of the Convention system .", "CARDINAL . The introduction of such a domestic remedy could also significantly reduce the ORG \u2019s workload . While prompt execution of the pilot judgment remains essential for solving the structural problem and thus for preventing future applications on the same matter , there may exist a category of people who have already been affected by this problem prior to its resolution . The existence of a remedy aimed at providing redress at national level for this category of people might allow the ORG to invite them to have recourse to the new remedy and , if appropriate , declare their applications inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Several options with this objective are possible , depending , among other things , on the nature of the structural problem in question and on whether the person affected by this problem has applied to the ORG or not .", "CARDINAL . In particular , further to a pilot judgment in which a specific structural problem has been found , CARDINAL alternative might be to adopt an ad hoc approach , whereby the state concerned would assess the appropriateness of introducing a specific remedy or widening an existing remedy by legislation or by judicial interpretation .", "CARDINAL . Within the framework of this case - by - case examination , states might envisage , if this is deemed advisable , the possibility of reopening proceedings similar to those of a pilot case which has established a violation of the Convention , with a view to saving the ORG from dealing with these cases and where appropriate to providing speedier redress for the person concerned . The criteria laid out in Recommendation Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL of ORG might serve as a source of inspiration in this regard .", "CARDINAL . When specific remedies are set up following a pilot case , governments should speedily inform the ORG so that it can take them into account in its treatment of subsequent repetitive cases .", "CARDINAL . However , it would not be necessary or appropriate to create new remedies , or give existing remedies a certain retroactive effect , following every case in which a ORG judgment has identified a structural problem . In certain circumstances , it may be preferable to leave the cases to the examination of the ORG , particularly to avoid compelling the applicant to bear the further burden of having once again to exhaust domestic remedies , which , moreover , would not be in place until the adoption of legislative changes . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
