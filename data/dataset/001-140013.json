B. of the special police unit refused to take part in the re - enactment , stating that he would only be willing to do so in the presence of his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant was questioned yet again ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

The second applicant stated that the submissions of PERSON and D - n . of the special police unit were untenable and pointed out that in response to important questions they had answered that they either did not know or did not remember . In particular , they did not remember how they had broken the kitchen door and the kitchen table and thrown them into the lobby . Immediately after the events the first applicant found a broken table leg in the kitchen near the balcony window . The end of the table leg had blood on it . The first applicant put it on the balcony , where it remained to DATE . Hence , D - n . \u2019s statement that he had found a rubber truncheon on the refrigerator in the kitchen was untrue , as a rubber truncheon could not have been there . Not only had the regular police squad not entered the flat but by that time they had left , and the special unit officers were the first ones to enter the kitchen . The only baton that remained in the kitchen was the leg of the broken table , which D - n . must have used as he did not deny hitting PERSON PERSON with a baton . As the latter was standing to the left of D - n . , the police officer must have hit him on the head with the table leg , which would be consistent with the medical report stating that PERSON PERSON had sustained injuries on the left side of his head . The second applicant also requested an expert examination of the table leg .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant further contended that S. \u2019s submissions to the effect that while on the balcony Mr PERSON kept moving around and hitting his head and shoulders against the glass remaining in the window frames was equally untenable . Should that have been the case , PERSON PERSON would have slashed his neck lengthwise . However , the wound to his neck measured QUANTITY across and , in the second applicant \u2019s view , must have been caused by falling down . Although the police officers of the special unit no longer remembered how Mr PERSON had fallen on the floor with S. , in her view it followed from the materials of the case that Mr PERSON had fallen face down , and that was what had caused the wound . Furthermore , the officers failed to clarify how he had sustained multiple fractures of the ribs .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the second applicant alleged that a number of D - n . \u2019s statements had been false . In particular , Mr PERSON could not have thrown an iron at him , because the iron had been tied to the balcony door . When D - n . entered the kitchen , he could not have seen its floor covered in blood . Although the regular squad had hit Mr PERSON with rubber truncheons , the blood on the floor appeared only after the special unit officers had apprehended PERSON PERSON and put him there . Nor could it be true that PERSON PERSON , having been handcuffed , walked to the kitchen from the balcony by himself , as in that case it was unclear why the police officers had had to put him on the floor . Moreover , D - n . \u2019s submissions that he had entered the balcony through the broken window made no sense given that he could have used the door . Similarly , it was unlikely that he had not heard Mr PERSON calling the police for help , as his first call , made at TIME , had been heard even by those standing in the lobby . Therefore , it was untenable that D - n . , standing next to the kitchen door , had not heard the call made at TIME", "CARDINAL . As regards the organisation of the operation , the second applicant noted that D - n . had had no authority to storm the flat , especially given that emergency psychiatric assistance had already been called for by NORP , the Head of the Nagatinskiy PERSON . She pointed out that Mr PERSON had not been holding hostages or otherwise posing a danger to other people .

The wounds were complicated by profuse bleeding and led to PERSON death . The wound on the neck was caused by an object with multiple sharp cutting edges , which could have been a piece of glass . The piece of glass must have been fixed somehow and stayed in its place quite firmly and motionlessly . Such an injury was often observed when wounds were caused by the breaking of an entire window pane or glass door , when the main part of the window fell out but sharp shards on the edges remained firmly fixed to the frame . The multiple slash wounds were caused by fragments of broken glass . Although it was not possible to determine the sequence of the injuries , they were sustained within a short period of time shortly before PERSON PERSON \u2019s death .

The craniocerebral trauma was defined as a grave injury . However , since there were no symptoms of dislocation or compression of the brain , the essential areas of cerebral tissue were not damaged and there was no inflammation , the craniocerebral trauma alone could not have led to the death of Mr PERSON . The craniocerebral trauma was caused by multiple blows with hard blunt objects , which probably had a wide surface . However , it was not possible to determine exactly how it had been caused .", "( c ) Mr PERSON had closed fractures of the sixth right rib and of the DATE left ribs .

Such bruises and subcutaneous haemorrhages were classified as light injuries .", "CARDINAL . According to the report , the injuries were caused shortly before PERSON PERSON was admitted to hospital . His death was caused by the stab / slash wound to his neck , which affected the jugular vein , and multiple slash wounds which were complicated by profuse bleeding . Other injuries , such as craniocerebral trauma , complicated PERSON condition but did not directly cause his death . The neck wound was definitely caused by a fixed piece of glass . However , it was impossible to establish at which precise moment during PERSON apprehension it had been caused .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first applicant \u2019s question whether the injuries that led to PERSON death could have been caused as a result of his falling down , the forensic experts stated that , since the precise way in which the wound to the neck had been caused could not be established , they could not rule out such a possibility . Whereas the experts considered that at a certain moment a fixed shard of glass had been thrust against PERSON PERSON \u2019s neck , the shard might have been either in the window or door frame , or on the floor clamped between other objects .

The police officers had valid reasons to call the special police unit for assistance , since PERSON had actively resisted them and had wounded CARDINAL of them in the chest .

Therefore , the investigation was unable to establish with certainty the cause of death and had to take into account all the injuries . In particular , all the experts agreed that the neck wound had probably been caused by a glass shard . As PERSON was resisting the police from behind the balcony door in which there was broken glass , he probably sustained that wound when some of the police officers pulled him by the hand and he cut himself on a protruding glass shard .

Such an injury , regarded as grave and possibly the cause of PERSON PERSON \u2019s death , could not have been foreseen .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision of DATE further stated that the experts had not reached a unanimous conclusion concerning the cause of the craniocerebral trauma . Whereas some of the reports stated that it could have been caused as a result of Mr PERSON hitting his head against something or falling down , other reports concluded that it had probably been caused as a result of blows to the head . A definitive conclusion might have been reached following an additional examination of PERSON skull , but his relatives did not give their consent to exhumation and the investigator \u2019s request for exhumation was refused by the court . Therefore , there remained no further opportunities to clarify the cause of the injury , and the investigation still had certain doubts in that respect . Should the craniocerebral trauma have been caused as a result of PERSON falling onto protruding objects , no questions concerning the police ORG responsibility would arise . Should it have been caused by blows to the head , the investigation took the view that the police had had no intention of harming PERSON . That was confirmed by the fact that immediately after the storming of the flat , a doctor had been asked to provide him with medical assistance . From the witness statements it followed that the police had used rubber truncheons to knock the knife out of PERSON hands . It could not be ruled out that some of the blows had accidentally hit PERSON on the head . However , that would not have been intentional . In any event , any conclusions in that respect were of a probabilistic nature and could not be regarded as established facts , as the investigation had unresolvable doubts concerning the cause of the injury . Taking this into account , there was insufficient evidence to show that the police officers had committed an offence , and the investigation should therefore be closed .", "CARDINAL .
