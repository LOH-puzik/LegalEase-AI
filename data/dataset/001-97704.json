In a judgment dated CARDINAL DATE ( R ( Carson ) v.

Applying the principles he drew from the case - law of the ORG , the judge found that the pecuniary right that fell to be protected by LAW had to be defined by the domestic legislation that created it .

CARDINAL taken in isolation .", "CARDINAL . The matter nonetheless fell within the ambit of LAW No . CARDINAL and the judge therefore had to consider whether PERSON had suffered discrimination contrary to the provisions of LAW . The ORG initially contended that country of residence was not a prohibited ground of discrimination under LAW , but this objection was subsequently withdrawn . The judge , however , dismissed PERSON claim on the ground that she was not in a comparable position to pensioners in countries attracting uprating . The differing economic conditions in each country , including local social security provision and taxation , made it impossible simply to compare the amount in sterling received by pensioners . Moreover , even if the applicant could claim to be in an analogous position to a pensioner in GPE or a country where uprating was paid subject to a bilateral agreement , the difference in treatment could be justified .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed to ORG , which dismissed her appeal on DATE ( R ( Carson and PERSON ) v. Secretary of ORG for Work and Pensions [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) . For similar reasons to ORG , ORG ( PERSON , Laws and PERSON ) found that , since LAW No . CARDINAL conferred no right to acquire property , the failure to uprate PERSON pension gave rise to no violation of that provision taken alone .", "CARDINAL . As to the complaint under LAW in conjunction with LAW No . CARDINAL , ORG noted that the Secretary of ORG accepted that place of residence constituted a \u201c status \u201d for the purposes of the LAW . However , it found that the applicant was in a materially different position to those whom she contended were her comparators . In this connection it was significant that \u201c the scheme of the primary legislation is entirely geared to the impact on the pension of price inflation in the GPE \u201d . ORG continued :", "\u201c There is simply no inherent probability that price inflation in other countries where expatriate GPE pensioners might have made their home ( or , for that matter , any other economic factors ) will have a comparable effect on the value of the pension to such pensioners . They may do better , they may do worse . There will also , of course , be the impact of variable exchange rates . There will be , if I may be forgiven a jejune metaphor , swings and roundabouts . While I certainly do not suggest there are no principled arguments in favour of the DATE uprate being paid to those in Ms Carson \u2019s position , it seems to me inescapable that its being awarded across the board to all such pensioners would have random effects . A refusal by government to put in place a measure which would produce such effects ( which in the end is all that has happened here ) can not be said to stand in need of justification by reason if it is being compared with the clear and certain effects of the uprate for GPE - resident pensioners . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also considered , in the alternative , the question of justification and found that the \u201c true \u201d justification of the refusal to pay the uprate was that PERSON and those in her position \u201c had chosen to live in societies , more pointedly economies , outside GPE where the specific rationale for the uplift may by no means necessarily apply \u201d . ORG thus considered the decision to be objectively justified without reference to what they accepted would be the \u201c daunting cost \u201d of extending the uprate to those in PERSON position . Moreover , the cost implications were \u201c in the context of this case a legitimate factor going in justification for the Secretary of ORG \u2019s position \u201d , because to accept PERSON arguments would be to lead to a judicial interference in the political decision as to the deployment of public funds which was not mandated by LAW DATE , the jurisprudence of this ORG or by a \u201c legal imperative \u201d which was sufficiently pressing to justify confining and circumscribing the elected Government \u2019s macroeconomic policies .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed to ORG , relying on LAW No . CARDINAL read together with LAW . Her appeal was dismissed on DATE by a majority of CARDINAL ( R ( Carson and PERSON ) v. Secretary of ORG for Work and Pensions [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The majority ( Lords PERSON of GPE , PERSON , PERSON of PERSON and PERSON of Gestinghope ) accepted that a retirement pension fell within the scope of LAW No . CARDINAL and that LAW was thus applicable . They further assumed that a place of residence was a personal characteristic and amounted to \u201c any other status \u201d within the meaning of LAW , and was thus a prohibited ground of discrimination . However , because a person could choose where to live , less weighty grounds were required to justify a difference of treatment based on residence than one based on an inherent personal characteristic , such as race or sex .", "CARDINAL . The majority observed that in certain cases it was artificial to treat separately the questions , firstly , whether an individual complaining of discrimination was in an analogous position to a person treated more favourably and , secondly , whether the difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified . In the present case , the applicant was not in an analogous position to a pensioner resident in GPE or resident in a country with a bilateral agreement with GPE . GPE pension was CARDINAL element in an interconnected system of taxation and social security benefits , designed to provide a basic standard of living for the inhabitants of GPE . It was funded partly from the NICs of those currently in employment and their employers , and partly out of general taxation . The pension was not means - tested , but pensioners with a high income from other sources paid some of it back to the ORG in income tax . Those with low incomes might receive other benefits , such as income support . The provision for index - linking was intended to preserve the value of the pension in the light of economic conditions , such as the cost of living and the rate of inflation , within GPE . Quite different economic conditions applied in other countries : for example , in GPE , where PERSON lived , although there was virtually no social security , the cost of living was much lower , and the value of the rand had dropped in DATE compared to sterling .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , who gave one of the majority opinions , put the arguments as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The denial of a social security benefit to PERSON on the ground that she lives abroad can not possibly be equated with discrimination on grounds of race or sex . It is not a denial of respect for her as an individual . She was under no obligation to move to GPE . She did so voluntarily and no doubt for good reasons . But in doing so , she put herself outside the primary scope and purpose of the GPE social security system . Social security benefits are part of an intricate and interlocking system of social welfare which exists to ensure certain minimum standards of living for the people of this country . They are an expression of what has been called social solidarity or fraternit\u00e9 ; the duty of any community to help those of its members who are in need . But that duty is generally recognised to be national in character . It does not extend to the inhabitants of foreign countries . That is recognised in treaties such as the ORG [ ORG ( Minimum Standards ) Convention DATE ( Article CARDINAL ) and LAW .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , who appeared for PERSON , accepted the force of this argument . He agreed in reply that she could have no complaint if GPE had rigorously applied the principle that GPE social security is for GPE residents and paid no pensions whatever to people who had gone to live abroad . And he makes no complaint about the fact that she is not entitled to other social security benefits like jobseeker \u2019s allowance and income support . But he said that it was irrational to recognise that she had an entitlement to a pension by virtue of her contributions to ORG and then not to pay her the same pension as GPE residents who had made the same contributions .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL feature upon which PERSON seizes as the basis of her claim to equal treatment ( but only in respect of a pension ) is that she has paid the same ORG contributions . That is really the long and the short of her case . In my opinion , however , concentration on this single feature is an oversimplification of the comparison . The situation of the beneficiaries of GPE social security is , to quote ORG in PERSON v. GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL , CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL , \u2018 characterised by a corpus of rights and obligations of which it would be artificial to isolate CARDINAL specific PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP In effect PERSON argument is that because contributions are a necessary condition for the retirement pension paid to GPE residents , they ought to be a sufficient condition . No other matters , like whether one lives in GPE and participates in the rest of its arrangements for taxation and social security , ought to be taken into account . But that in my opinion is an obvious fallacy . ORG contributions have no exclusive link to retirement pensions , comparable with contributions to a private pension scheme . In fact the link is a rather tenuous CARDINAL . ORG contributions form a source of part of the revenue which pays for all social security benefits and ORG ( the rest comes from ordinary taxation ) . If payment of contributions is a sufficient condition for being entitled to a contributory benefit , PERSON should be entitled to all contributory benefits , like maternity benefit and jobseeker \u2019s allowance . But she does not suggest that she is .", "CARDINAL . The interlocking nature of the system makes it impossible to extract CARDINAL element for special treatment . The main reason for the provision of ORG pensions is the recognition that the majority of people of pensionable age will need the money . They are not means - tested , but that is only because means - testing is expensive and discourages take - up of the benefit even by people who need it . So ORG pensions are paid to everyone whether they have adequate income from other sources or not . On the other hand , they are subject to tax . So the ORG will recover part of the pension from people who have enough income to pay tax and thereby reduce the net cost of the pension . On the other hand , those people who are entirely destitute would be entitled to income support , a non - contributory benefit . So the net cost of paying a retirement pension to such people takes into account the fact that the pension will be set off against their claim to income support .", "CARDINAL . None of these interlocking features can be applied to a non - resident such as Ms Carson . She pays no GPE income tax , so the ORG would not be able to recover anything even if she had substantial additional income . ( Of course I do not suggest that this is the case ; I have no idea what other income she has , but there will be expatriate pensioners who do have other income . ) Likewise , if she were destitute , there would be no saving in income support . On the contrary , the pension would go to reduce the social security benefits ( if any ) to which she is entitled in her new country .", "ORG and private pensions", "CARDINAL . It is , I suppose , the words \u2018 insurance\u2019 and \u2018 ORG which suggest an analogy with a private pension scheme . But , from the point of view of the citizens who contribute , ORG contributions are little different from general taxation which disappears into the communal pot of the consolidated fund . The difference is only a matter of public accounting . And although retirement pensions are presently linked to contributions , there is no particular reason why they should be . In fact ( mainly because the present system severely disadvantages women who have spent time in the unremunerated work of caring for a family rather than earning a salary ) there are proposals for change . Contributory pensions may be replaced with a non - contributory \u2018 citizen \u2019s pension\u2019 payable to all inhabitants of this country of pensionable age . But there is no reason why this should mean any change in the collection of ORG contributions to fund the citizen \u2019s pension like all the other non - contributory benefits . On PERSON argument , however , a change to a non - contributory pension would make all the difference . Once the retirement pension was non - contributory , the foundation of her argument that she had \u2018 PERSON the right to equal treatment would disappear . But she would have paid exactly the same ORG contributions while she was working here and her contributions would have had as much ( or as little ) causal relationship to her pension entitlement as they have DATE .", "Parliamentary choice", "CARDINAL . For these reasons it seems to me that the position of a non - resident is materially and relevantly different from that of a GPE resident . I do not think , with all respect to my noble and learned friend , Lord PERSON , that the reasons are subtle and arcane . They are practical and fair . Furthermore , I think that this is very much a case in which ORG is entitled to decide whether the differences justify a difference in treatment . It can not be the law that GPE is prohibited from treating expatriate pensioners generously unless it treats them in precisely the same way as pensioners at home . Once it is accepted that the position of PERSON is relevantly different from that of a GPE resident and that she therefore can not claim equality of treatment , the amount ( if any ) which she receives must be a matter for ORG . It must be possible to recognise that her past contributions gave her a claim in equity to some pension without having to abandon the reasons why she can not claim to be treated equally . And in deciding what expatriate pensioners should be paid , ORG must be entitled to take into account competing claims on public funds . To say that the reason why expatriate pensioners are not paid the DATE increases is to save money is true but only in a trivial sense : every decision not to spend more on something is to save money to reduce taxes or spend it on something else .", "CARDINAL . I think it is unfortunate that the argument for the Secretary of ORG placed such emphasis upon such matters as the variations in rates of inflation in various countries which made it inappropriate to apply the same increase to pensioners resident abroad . It is unnecessary for the Secretary of ORG to try to justify the sums paid with such nice calculations . It distracts attention from the main argument . Once it is conceded , as PERSON accepts , that people resident outside the GPE are relevantly different and could be denied any pension at all , ORG does not have to justify to the courts the reasons why they are paid CARDINAL sum rather than another . Generosity does not have to have a logical explanation . It is enough for the Secretary of ORG to say that , all things considered , ORG considered the present system of payments to be a fair allocation of available resources .", "CARDINAL . The comparison with residents in treaty countries seems to me to fail for similar reasons . PERSON was able to point to government statements to the effect that there was no logical scheme in the arrangements with treaty countries . They represented whatever the GPE had from time to time been able to negotiate without placing itself at an undue economic disadvantage . But that seems to me an entirely rational basis for differences in treatment . The situation of a GPE expatriate pensioner who lives in a country which has been willing to enter into suitable reciprocal social security arrangements is relevantly different from that of a pensioner who lives in a country which has not . The treaty enables the government to improve the social security benefits of GPE nationals in the foreign country on terms which it considers to be favourable , or at least not unduly burdensome . It would be very strange if the government was prohibited from entering into such reciprocal arrangements with any country ( for example , as it has with the ORG [ ORG ] countries ) unless it paid the same benefits to all expatriates in every part of the world . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , dissenting , found that PERSON could properly be compared to other contributing pensioners living in GPE or other countries where their pensions were uprated . He continued :", "\u201c How persons spend their income and where they do so are matters for their own choice . Some may choose to live in a country where the cost of living is low or the exchange rate favourable , a course not uncommon in previous generations , which may or may not carry with it disadvantages , but that is a matter for their personal choice . The common factor for purposes of comparison is that all of the pensioners , in whichever country they may reside , have duly paid the contributions required to qualify for their pensions . If some of them are not paid pensions at the same rate as others , that in my opinion constitutes discrimination for the purposes of LAW", "Lord PERSON therefore considered that the appeal turned on the question of justification . He accepted that the courts should be slow to intervene in questions of macroeconomic policy . He further accepted that , had the Government put forward sufficient reasons of economic or ORG policy to justify the difference in treatment , he should have been properly ready to yield to its decision - making power in those fields . However , in the present case the difference in treatment was not justified : as ORG itself accepted , the reason all pensions were not uprated was simply to save money , and it was not fair to target the applicant and others in her position .", "CARDINAL . NORP NICs are payable by employees and the self - employed who earn income over a set limit and by employers in respect of employees earning over a set limit . It is also possible for individuals who are not liable to pay compulsory contributions , because for example they are resident outside GPE , to make voluntary contributions to protect the right to certain social security benefits . The amounts paid by employees and employers depend on income . In DATE ) , employees earning between ORG CARDINAL and GBP CARDINAL per week pay PERCENT of their income , with PERCENT paid by the employer . The basic rate for the self - employed is currently GBP CARDINAL per week and the voluntary contributions rate is GBP CARDINAL per week .", "CARDINAL . The social security benefits paid for from NICs include contribution - based jobseeker \u2019s allowance , incapacity benefit ( now replaced by employment and support allowance ) , maternity allowance , widow \u2019s benefit , bereavement benefit , retirement pensions of certain categories , child \u2019s special allowance and guardian \u2019s allowance . These benefits are financed on a \u201c pay as you go \u201d basis from NICs paid in DATE . If necessary , additional funding can be provided from money received in income tax and other forms of taxation , but this has not been necessary since DATE . NICs also partly pay for the cost of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The basic State pension is , in DATE , GBP CARDINAL per week . To qualify for a State pension , it is necessary to have reached State pension age and to have paid or been credited with ( or have a husband , wife or civil partner who has been paid or been credited with ) NICs for a sufficient number of \u201c qualifying years \u201d . GPE age is currently CARDINAL for men and CARDINAL for women . It will increase gradually for women from DATE , so that by DATE it will be CARDINAL for both sexes . At present , men need CARDINAL qualifying years by DATE to get a full basic State pension and women who reach DATE need DATE . LAW DATE reduced the number of DATE needed for a full basic State pension to CARDINAL for people who reach State pension age on or after DATE . A percentage of the full basic State pension is payable to an individual without the full number of qualifying years . To get the minimum basic State pension ( PERCENT ) it is normally necessary to have CARDINAL qualifying years .", "CARDINAL . Individuals resident in GPE who do not have sufficient qualifying DATE to entitle them to a ORG pension may be entitled to non - contributory welfare benefits , such as means - tested income support and housing benefit .", "CARDINAL . Under CARDINAL of ORG DATE , the Secretary of ORG is required to make an order DATE to increase the basic State pension to maintain its value \u201c in relation to the general level of prices obtaining in GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Although the basic State pension is payable to individuals resident outside GPE , non - residents are disqualified from receiving uprated pensions . Instead , unless or until they return to live in GPE , they continue to receive GPE at the DATE rate applicable in DATE in which they emigrated or , if they emigrated before reaching retirement age , at the rate applicable in DATE in which they attained retirement age . A non - resident who returns to GPE for a short period receives the uprated pension while in GPE , but , when he returns to his country of residence , the pension reverts to its previous amount .", "CARDINAL . The exception to this rule concerns individuals who move to ORG which have concluded a bilateral reciprocal social security agreement with GPE which provides for the pensions paid to qualifying individuals to be uprated in line with GPE inflation .", "CARDINAL . States enter into bilateral agreements to provide on a reciprocal basis for wider social security cover for workers and their families moving between the party countries than is available under national legislation alone . Each results from negotiations between GPE , taking into account the scope for reciprocity between the CARDINAL social security schemes . In all cases the agreement establishes the social security scheme which is to be applied to persons moving from CARDINAL country to work in the other . Generally , the scheme applicable is that of the country of employment . Whether a reciprocal social security agreement with another country is entered into depends on various factors , among them the numbers of people moving from CARDINAL country to the other , the benefits available under the other country \u2019s scheme , how far reciprocity is possible and the extent to which the advantages to be gained by an agreement outweigh the additional expenditure likely to be incurred by each ORG . Where an agreement is in place , the flow of funds may differ depending on the level of each country \u2019s benefits and the number of people going in each direction .", "CARDINAL . Of the bilateral agreements entered into by GPE which cover more than liability for contributions , nearly all cover retirement pensions and widow\u2019s / bereavement benefits . The majority also cover sickness , incapacity and maternity benefits . Some cover unemployment and child benefits . Where access to a benefit covered by the agreement is dependent on contributions , the agreement generally provides for aggregation of the contributions paid in each country . Each country then calculates a pro - rata pension based on contributions made in that country . Where access to a benefit depends on a period of residence , the agreement is likely to provide for residence in CARDINAL country to count as residence in the other . Where benefit is paid in CARDINAL country taking account of residence / contributions in the other , there is usually a provision for reimbursement of the former by the latter . Not all reciprocal agreements to which GPE is a party , therefore , involve the payment of pension uprating to GPE expatriates .", "CARDINAL . GPE has reciprocal social security agreements providing for pension uprating with all LOC ( GPE and with GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . Residents of the ORG countries and the countries listed above who qualify for a GPE pension receive the same level of uprating as GPE residents ; the uprating is based on the rate of inflation in GPE and no regard is paid to inflation in the country of residence .", "CARDINAL . All the above agreements were concluded DATE , and from DATE onwards the agreements were to fulfil earlier commitments made by ORG . Since DATE , the ORG \u2019s policy has been that future reciprocal agreements should normally be limited to resolving questions of liability for social security contributions . Agreements with GPE , GPE and GPE came into force in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively , but these did not require payment of uprated pensions . The agreement with GPE was terminated by GPE as from DATE , because of the refusal of GPE to pay uprated pensions to its pensioners living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . During the passage of the Pensions Bill through ORG in DATE , amendments tabled in both ORG , calling for uprating to be paid to all expatriate pensioners , were defeated by large majorities . According to the Government , it would cost MONEY ( MONEY ) to pay the backdated claims to uprating of all GPE pensioners resident abroad in \u201c frozen \u201d countries together with an ongoing DATE bill of MONEY ( PERCENT of the GBP MONEY spent in total by GPE in DATE on pensions ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the DATE ORG ( Minimum Standards ) Convention ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) provides that a benefit to which a protected person would otherwise be entitled in compliance with the DATE LAW ( including old - age benefit ) may be suspended , in whole or in part , by national law as long as the person concerned is absent from the territory of the ORG concerned . The above provision is echoed in DATE NORP Code of ORG and LAW ( f ) of the DATE ORG ( Revised ) .", "CARDINAL . Part IV of the DATE LAW concerning the Establishment of an International System for the Maintenance of Rights in ORG envisages that equal treatment of the nationals of the Contracting Parties in respect of social security rights , including the retention of benefits arising out of social security legislation whatever the movements the persons protected might undertake between GPE , may be secured by the conclusion of appropriate bilateral and multilateral agreements . Bilateral agreements are the most utilised method of coordination of social security laws and vary greatly in both personal and material scope . Some bilateral agreements cover only nationals of the Contracting Parties , while others apply to any person who has been covered by the social security systems of CARDINAL of the Contracting Parties . They sometimes cover both contributory and non - contributory benefits ; sometimes they are confined to contributory benefits only .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a ORG initiative to draw up a new framework agreement for the coordination of social security schemes within the member GPE , to enable in particular the export of benefits throughout ORG , was abandoned when it became clear that most countries preferred to maintain the present system of bilateral agreements ( see CM(CARDINAL)CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
