On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) remanded him in custody , relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question . It considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings , given the risk that he might tamper with evidence or go into hiding . As regards the latter , the court relied on the fact that he did not have his place of residence in GPE . It also stressed the severity of the anticipated prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the detention order , likewise his further appeals against decisions extending his detention and all his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him , were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the investigation , the applicant \u2019s detention was extended on DATE to DATE . ORG relied on the original grounds given for the applicant \u2019s detention . It also underlined that the applicant was a foreign national and therefore there was a risk of his absconding if released .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asserted that at the early stage of the investigation he had admitted to having committed the offence he had been charged with . He further submitted that he had agreed to cooperate with the authorities in order to have his future sentence mitigated .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The court noted , inter alia , that although the applicant pleaded guilty , his testimonies had not been fully coherent and contained a number of inconsistencies . It therefore considered that the conditions for the extraordinary mitigation of sentence had not been met in the case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , other co - accused and ORG appealed .", "The applicant \u2019s legal - aid counsel argued that the first - instance court had not mitigated the applicant \u2019s sentence as required by LAW of LAW , despite the fact that the applicant had cooperated with the authorities .

The applicant was kept in detention pending appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) heard the appeals .

It further considered the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicant to be reasonable . However , it found that the evidence examined by the first - instanceIt further ordered that the applicant \u2019s detention should continue until DATE . The court repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant \u2019s continued detention . In addition , it underlined the need to obtain a report from an expert in graphology .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant \u2019s legal - aid counsel argued , inter alia , that the trial court had erred in that it had not mitigated the applicant \u2019s sentence . The lawyer noted that the material in the case file clearly indicated that the applicant had cooperated with the authorities and therefore had complied with the requirements of LAW of LAW . Admittedly , the applicant had changed his pleadings after the judgment of DATE .

On DATE the ORG upheld the firstinstance judgment . It acknowledged that the applicant had given an account of his own wrongdoing . The court observed however that the remainder of his testimony , in particular in part regarding the responsibility of other co - accused had not been credible and had not been taken into consideration by the trial court . The appellate court concluded that the applicant \u2019s testimonies had not been wholly credible and therefore he was not entitled to an extraordinary mitigation of his sentence .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE the applicant \u2019s legal - aid lawyer informed ORG that he had not found any grounds for lodging a cassation appeal in the case .", "CARDINAL .
