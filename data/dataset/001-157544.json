The doctor was of the view that his very significant hearing loss made the use of a hearing aid for his right ear pointless .

On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant against a decision taken by ORG on DATE ( ORG . PERSON ) discontinuing an investigation against the staff of ORG who had allegedly put his life at risk by interrupting the medical treatment prescribed to him by the remand centre psychiatrist . It was established that the applicant \u2019s psychiatric treatment had been temporarily interrupted because he had been moved to a smaller remand centre where , for reasons unspecified in the decision , his treatment could not be continued . However , this did not amount to a criminal offence . It was further held that a hearing aid was not absolutely necessary for the applicant . His hearing impairment made his detention more difficult , but it did not render it impossible or too harsh on him .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG ( ORG PERSON ) informed the applicant that complaints he had lodged on DATE and CARDINAL DATE concerning the administration of his medication , adequacy of his medical care and failure to provide him with a hearing aid had been declared illfounded .

During a hearing on DATE the applicant stated that he was also claiming compensation for health damage he had sustained as a result of his irreversible hearing loss as well as the overall poor prison conditions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s claim concerned the period CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert opinion prepared by a laryngologist was submitted to the court . The doctor stated that there was no doubt as to the applicant \u2019s very significant hearing loss in his right ear , whereas an evaluation of the hearing loss in his left ear was more difficult and had not led to unequivocal results . The expert had regard to audiograms made on DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE and to a number of documents in the applicant \u2019s medical records . There were discrepancies between results of different audiograms , as the applicant had over that time been examined by various people and with various apparatus .

He emphasised that usage of a hearing aid had no influence on the possibility of further deterioration as it neither cured nor prevented hearing loss ; it only made the applicant \u2019s social functioning more comfortable .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s compensation claim , finding that there was no evidence to show that he had been attacked or ill - treated because of his bad hearing ; that the medical reports had certified that he could have some difficulties following conversations held in a noisy room between a number of people ; that his hearing was socially efficient ; that there was no evidence to show that it had deteriorated during and because of his detention ; that a hearing aid could assist him in everyday life but could not be regarded as treatment of his condition ; and that the refusals to provide him with a hearing aid at the public \u2019s expense did not result in the deterioration of his hearing , nor could be seen as humiliating or debasing treatment .", "The court had regard to the applicant \u2019s medical records , his correspondence with ORG , certain documents in the applicant \u2019s prison records , the laryngologist \u2019s opinion referred to above , and the testimony given by the prison laryngologist , PERSON , the psychologist , the psychiatrist , the laryngologists and CARDINAL other witnesses .", "The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL .
