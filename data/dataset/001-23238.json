CARDINAL , entitled PERSON sectes en GPE ( \u201c Sects in GPE \u201d ) and better known as ORG .", "In the report the parliamentarians acknowledged that it was difficult to define the word \u201c sect \u201d . On page CARDINAL they stated : \u201c The difficulty of defining the word \u201c sect \u201d , which will nevertheless be used in the rest of this report , led the ORG to consider a whole range of criteria , each of which could give rise to lengthy discussion . It has therefore preferred , at the risk of offending many people \u2019s susceptibilities or making an incomplete analysis of the real situation , to adopt the ordinary meaning that the public attributes to the word . \u201d", "Among the indicators \u201c from which it is possible to infer that there might be some truth in suspicions which lead people to describe as a sect a movement presenting itself as a religious movement \u201d the commission decided to adopt the criteria used by ORG ( Direction centrale des Renseignements G\u00e9n\u00e9raux ) , namely mental destabilisation , exorbitant financial demands , inducing people to sever their ties with their home environment , bodily harm , indoctrination of children , more or less antisocial views , prejudicing public order , numerous lawsuits , possible misuse of traditional financial channels and attempts to infiltrate public authorities .", "According to ORG , CARDINAL movements had been identified as fulfilling CARDINAL of its criteria of dangerousness . Those movements had been separately listed as \u201c sects \u201d . ORG Witnesses appear on the list , which was published as an integral part of the commission \u2019s report .", "The Gest / Guyard Report was widely circulated not only among public authorities ( government , civil service , local councillors , etc . ) but also among the public at large . A commercial version for the general public was published and distributed by a commercial company .", "However , after submitting their report , the members of ORG who had made up the first study group on sects undertook new activities with a view to broadening the investigations into sects .", "An ORG on Sects was set up by a decree of CARDINAL DATE . This body , answerable to the Prime Minister , was charged with studying the phenomenon of sects and making proposals to the Government for improving the means of combating them . It was replaced on DATE by ORG , which is empowered to report offences committed by sectarian movements to public prosecutors where they are capable of being categorised as criminal offences .", "On DATE a new resolution intended to broaden investigations was adopted by ORG . A new commission , chaired by Mr PERSON , the former rapporteur of the first commission , and with Mr PERSON as its rapporteur , was given DATE to carry out its inquiry . According to the report of proceedings in ORG on DATE , Mr PERSON said :", "\u201c If the work carried out by the commission of inquiry in DATE served a purpose , it was largely because the commission published a list of sectarian movements , giving it a degree of publicity which nobody dared to do for fear of being prosecuted . We accepted that responsibility collectively , irrespective of our political sympathies , and that helped to give the information wide circulation . I am pleased that ORG is the ORG \u2019s best - selling report . CARDINAL copies have had to be printed to meet the demand from members of the public who wanted to be informed . \u201d", "The new commission expressly confirmed that it was continuing the work carried out by the DATE commission . Its aim was to examine the financial , property and tax situation of sects as well as their business activities and their relations with business and financial circles . Its report was registered on DATE .", "Initially the commission sought help from ORG . Police investigators asked associations for important documents and sensitive information informally and even orally without giving details .

The applicant association sent a comprehensive reply to the commission by the appointed date , together with CARDINAL boxes of documents .", "The commission \u2019s report , entitled \u201c Sects and money \u201d , was published on DATE ; it is better known as ORG . In its conclusions the commission noted , in particular : \u201c The right to be different must also be protected . However , it is unacceptable for the exercise of that right to jeopardise certain principles , chief among which is the right to protection of the weakest members of society . ... The preservation of freedom of conscience can not be based on disregard for basic individual liberties \u2013 the freedom to come and go as we please , to own property and have the enjoyment of it , to keep ourselves fit and healthy , to be protected from abuses of power , to defend ourselves against damage to our pecuniary and non - pecuniary interests ... \u201d An annexe to the report contained information on the organisation , financial influence and economic network of CARDINAL associations representative of sectarian movements , including the applicant association .", "According to the applicant association , the commission \u2019s report contained numerous inaccurate and defamatory statements about ORG . For example , it was asserted that GPE \u2019s Witnesses were engaged in criminal activities amounting to tax evasion ( pages CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) .", "In a letter of DATE to the Speaker of ORG , the applicant association made a formal request for the parts of ORG that contained inaccuracies to be purely and simply deleted . It also sent the Speaker of ORG a file on ORG and their funding and ORG . The file contained documents analysing the allegations and the accusations disseminated in the parliamentary commission \u2019s report under the responsibility of ORG DATE accusations which the applicant association said were false . To date , the Speaker of ORG has not taken any action on either of those letters .", "The applicant association maintained that on the basis of the work carried out by the parliamentary commissions , the ORG had embarked on a policy of repression and oppression of the groups mentioned , in particular GPE \u2019s Witnesses , the largest of them . It submitted that the following measures taken by the ORG had formed part of that policy :", "( a ) On DATE the Minister of ORG had sent to ORG throughout the country a circular containing the list of \u201c dangerous sects \u201d that had been published in ORG , a list that had been supplied by ORG .

The commissions may hold hearings , which are public unless the decision is taken that they should be held in private .", "According to the applicant association , the decisions of parliamentary commissions of inquiry could not be challenged in the courts . Although their modus operandi was nowhere laid down , they had wide inquisitorial powers . They could arbitrarily decide to hold hearings in camera without any justification , and no appeal lay against such decisions . Evidence from doubtful sources could be gathered and even used against individuals or groups , who had no right to be heard in their own defence .

There was no national authority which could deal with such a complaint .", "The applicant association attributed the failure of its attempts to settle the case to the total immunity from legal proceedings enjoyed by parliamentary commissions .

It also included provisions placing restrictions on the establishment or advertising of sectarian groups ( clauses CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the bill ) .
