As the applicant feared that his land could be submerged in the waters of the dam , on DATE he initiated proceedings before ORG , and requested that this plot be registered in his name . He based his case on his father \u2019s uninterrupted possession for DATE .", "During the proceedings , the Magistrate \u2019s Court held DATE hearings . It conducted CARDINAL on - site inspections , namely on DATE and DATE , with the participation of engineers . The ORG further requested ORG to analyse the soil to determine whether or not the land in dispute was sandy . It also obtained CARDINAL reports from experts . As a result , the court decided that the land was made up of sandy soil . Recalling that private possession of sandy land was banned under NORP legislation , the court held that it was not possible to issue a title deed in the name of the applicant based on uninterrupted possession . Accordingly , on DATE the court dismissed the case . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of the first - instance court , finding its reasoning to have been in line with domestic law . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
