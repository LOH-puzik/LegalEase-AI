Questioning the seizure of property of persons who were demonstrably NORP simply on the basis of completely formal administrative details , such as that a document from DATE lacks a stamp or that the stamp is square instead of round , gives rise to misgivings about the train of thought of the judge involved . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the police started investigating the applicant and his counsel on suspicion of fraud .

Having found that access to the registers was restricted , the Deputy Director considered and rejected the possibility of using secret agents to acquire the documents in question and advised the police unit on how the ORG should proceed in the civil proceedings against the applicant , recommending that they manoeuvre the applicant into a situation where he would himself be obliged to establish his NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police suspended the investigation , stating that in civil proceedings the applicant was not obliged by LAW to disclose all relevant facts , but only those supporting his claims . They also stated that the applicant \u2019s counsel had not breached his duty under LAW to assert all important facts , because he was not obliged to assert facts favouring the opposing party . Thus , according to that decision , the applicant could not be regarded as having intentionally withheld certain information in a fraudulent attempt to recover the property by misleading the courts .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the decision that during their investigation the police tracked down enquiries the applicant \u2019s counsel had made with a number of archives and state institutions in order to find documents relevant for the civil proceedings . When questioning employees of those institutions , the police also noted the areas of interest of the applicant \u2019s counsel and the documents to which he had had access and had studied .

On DATE ORG allowed the appeal and quashed the order as unlawful , ordering the police to destroy all the records of the telephone communications . The court found :", "\u201c ... the ORG has the standing of defendant in a set of civil proceedings initiated by a client of the complainant [ that is , the applicant ] . It litigates with the claimant on an equal footing in such proceedings . To defend its interests there , it is equipped with staff and finances from the ORG budget . If criminal proceedings are brought simultaneously with these [ civil ] proceedings ... despite the fact that a reasonable suspicion of a crime , which is CARDINAL of the legal requirements for the initiation of any criminal proceedings , does not exist , there is a logical presumption that the ORG may at least attempt to improve its legal position in the civil proceedings by acquiring information through the prosecuting authorities and its other security agencies , or even attempt to deter the other litigant . Such conduct by the ORG is absolutely unacceptable in a NORP society and deserves to be condemned ... Although the criminal proceedings were finally rightfully suspended in the instant case , it remains alarming for the democratic development of the country that the suspension took place only after massive , and probably extremely expensive and entirely superfluous , criminal proceedings which should have never been initiated .", "...", "... the police decision to suspend the investigation was based on a purely legal conclusion that could have been arrived at without evidence consisting of CARDINAL pages ... including materials procured by means of legal assistance provided by third countries and information supplied by the intelligence service ...

Such legal services are provided free of charge . According to section DATE the ORG may intervene on behalf of and in the name of the ORG and alongside a municipality in such civil proceedings if the ORG has a legal interest in the outcome of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The Explanatory report to Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL stated that it was in the ORG \u2019s interest that the assets of municipalities were not diminished . It noted that municipalities often faced complicated judicial proceedings , for example under the Presidential Decrees , but that they did not have the necessary expert capacity to conduct such proceedings . Consequently , using the services of the ORG would be the only way for many municipalities to defend their property acquired from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that at the stage prior to the initiation of a criminal prosecution the police are obliged , on the basis of their own findings , criminal complaints , or suggestions from other persons and authorities which may lead to the conclusion that there exists suspicion that a criminal offence has been committed , to carry out all the necessary examinations and take the required measures to detect the facts that indicate the commission of a criminal offence and to find the offender ; they are also obliged to take the necessary measures to prevent criminal activities .", "CARDINAL .

The plenary of ORG found that the restitution laws could not be circumvented by civil actions for determination of ownership . Nor could the protection of ownership rights extinguished before DATE be triggered unless the restitution laws provided for redress in that respect .", "CARDINAL . In this decision ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal contesting the dismissal of his objection of bias in respect of a judge who had heard one of his civil actions . In his appeal the applicant alleged a violation of the right to a fair trial as a result of political pressure reflected , inter alia , by amendments to legislation , such as Act no . GPE , the revisiting of case - law by the domestic courts , public statements by politicians to the applicant \u2019s detriment , and the reporting duties imposed on courts by ORG .", "\u201c ORG has already held in several decisions on constitutional appeals by the same applicant ( for example ... ) that the activities of some politicians referred to by the applicant , be they verbal expressions to the media or other , aimed at creating a negative atmosphere around the legal actions of the applicant , or constituting direct attempts to interfere in these proceedings , were unacceptable in a system based on the rule of law .", "This is even more valid for the activities of ORG that ORG has had an opportunity to acquaint itself with from documents presented by the applicant ...
