ORG gave judgment on DATE . It ruled that the appeal was inadmissible in relation to the alleged incompatibility of LAW with the LAW , on the ground that this plea should have been raised by way of a public - law appeal ( recours de droit public ) and not by way of an appeal on points of law . It said :", "\" It is doubtful whether in an appeal on points of law ( recours en r\u00e9forme ) the appellant can rely on the incompatibility of LAW [ Swiss Civil Code ] with the rights secured in the ORG [ ORG ] . Admittedly , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , of the ORG [ ORG ] an appeal on points of law is admissible for violations of federal law , including international treaties concluded by the ORG . But by the second sentence of the above - cited provision , the right to enter a public - law appeal ( recours de droit public ) in respect of violations of ORG constitutional rights remains unaffected . According to the established case - law , the rights protected by the ORG and which the latter requires GPE to guarantee to its own nationals and others , are in the nature of constitutional rights : this close relationship between constitutional rights and the rights protected by the ORG makes it possible , from a procedural point of view , to treat violations of the Convention on the same footing as violations of a constitutional right within the meaning of section PERSON ) of the ORG .", "At all events , under LAW para . TIME . [ LAW ] ORG has a duty to apply the Acts passed by ORG and the decrees of that ORG which are of general application . It is thus under an obligation to follow this legislation without inquiring whether it is incompatible with the LAW . The ORG has made no change in this respect . It does not in any way alter the separation of powers between the legislature and the highest court as governed by domestic law , and accordingly does not confer on ORG any jurisdiction other than the one it hitherto enjoyed under LAW and LAW ( judgment of DATE , DATE , in NORP v. Attorney - General of St. Gall , unreported ) . It follows that the question whether LAW is compatible with the ORG lies outside the jurisdiction of ORG ; the appeal is therefore inadmissible on this point . \"", "For the rest , the ORG dismissed the appeal in the following terms :", "\" The cantonal court held that there was a causal relationship between the husband \u2019s adultery and the breakdown of the marriage . This is a finding of fact binding on ORG in an appeal on points of law ( section CARDINAL ) ORG ) . The appellant \u2019s behaviour played ... a decisive role in the breakdown , of which it was the sole cause . The wife was bewildered when her husband expressed his intention to divorce : she protested and expressed her affection for him . She only left the matrimonial home after being worn down by all that ORG had done to force her to go .", "The appellant \u2019s fault is of exceptional gravity . He pressed his mistress to marry him despite the shortness of their acquaintance and then DATE after the ceremony said he wanted a divorce without giving any valid explanation . By this capricious attitude he showed that he was making a mockery of the institution of marriage . He was not only offhand , but contemptuous and cruel . When his wife tried to maintain the marriage bonds by showing him her affection , he used the most despicable means to frustrate her efforts . Regardless of the duties imposed by the laws of marriage , he treated his wife as an object and , seeking only to bring about a break , he went so far as to commit adultery and provoke scenes during which he was rude and odious . The respondent has suffered greatly from this broken marriage : the compensation which the court of first instance granted her by approving the agreement on the ancillary effects of the divorce , bears witness that her sufferings went beyond what a wife can humanly be expected to bear .", "In view of the above , the cantonal court could , without violating federal law , reasonably take the view that a prohibition on remarriage for DATE was necessary . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG In a statement dated DATE , F and the woman with whom he was living stated that they intended to get married as soon as possible .", "The woman in question , who was still a party to a previous marriage , had commenced proceedings for divorce .

On CARDINAL DATE , the president of the GPE court allowed her application to have the waiting time ( d\u00e9lai de viduit\u00e9 - LAW ) reduced and gave her leave to remarry as from that date .", "CARDINAL .

ORG Although LAW recognises the right to divorce , the right to remarry after divorce can not be exercised in some cases until a certain time has elapsed . LAW provides in LAW , which came into force in DATE :", "\" When granting a divorce the court shall fix a period of not less than one and not DATE during which the party at fault shall not be entitled to remarry ; where the divorce is granted on the ground of adultery , this period may be extended to DATE .", "The period of judicial separation ordered by the court shall be included in this period . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The application of this provision has , however , been made more flexible by decisions of the courts . Thus , in the judgment of DATE in NORP v. X , ORG stated :", "\" [ The temporary prohibition of remarriage ] is criticised by legal writers ( cf . PERSON , note CARDINAL on Art . CARDINAL ORG and references ) , some of whom go so far as to suggest that the rule in LAW should be abandoned because its application gives rise to numerous inequalities and because it is easily evaded by marrying abroad ( NORP / PERSON , PERSON le divorce , CARDINALnd ed . , p. CARDINAL ) .", "As early as DATE , ORG noted that the penalty of a waiting period entailed a considerable restriction of individual freedom and of the right to marry guaranteed in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the LAW : it should not be imposed unless there had been a serious violation of essential conjugal duties and the courts should , therefore , exercise some restraint in applying LAW ( ORG [ Judgments of ORG ] CARDINAL II CARDINAL ; cf . ATF CARDINAL II CARDINAL , point CARDINAL of the reasons , and CARDINAL II CARDINAL ) .", "The interpretation of this provision must be brought into line with the whole body of case - law on divorce , which shows that the courts are tending to depart from rigorous theory and seeking to avoid unduly severe sanctions by having regard to the circumstances of the particular case . Thus adultery is no longer an absolute ground for divorce ( ORG CARDINAL II CARDINAL , point CARDINAL ( b ) of the reasons ) and the notion of the innocent spouse , within the meaning of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , does not exclude all fault ( ORG CARDINAL II CARDINAL , point CARDINAL of the reasons , and references ) . From this standpoint , even more restraint should be exercised in applying LAW . Courts should not impose a prohibition on remarriage unless the fault committed is of exceptional gravity and has also played a decisive role in the breakdown of the marriage . \" ( Judgments of ORG , vol . CARDINAL , part II , p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG on the partial reform of family law presented its report to ORG and Police , which had appointed ORG . It advocated repeal of LAW , relating to the waiting period :", "\" For DATE now a number of members of ORG have been disturbed by the application ( or more precisely , the non - application ) of LAW ( Petites questions PERSON et GPE , interpellation PERSON , ORG [ Revue de l\u2019\u00e9tat civil ] DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , CARDINAL ) . The issue has also been raised in the press ( PERSON of DATE , \u2018 PERSON hat , darf heiraten!\u2019 ) .", "What is the problem ? Under LAW the court must prohibit a spouse found to be at fault from remarrying for a given period . But disregard of this prohibition does not in any way affect the validity of a marriage entered into in spite of it ( PERSON , notes CARDINAL and CARDINAL on Art . ORG ) . Such a breach , however , can scarcely occur in GPE , where it would involve a serious dereliction of duty or even connivance on the part of the registrar of births , deaths and marriages . It can happen , on the other hand , that a spouse prohibited from remarrying goes abroad , preferably to GPE , to enter into a valid marriage there . On returning to GPE , he asks to have his marriage registered . In view of ORG and CARDINAL , this can not be refused . At most , cantonal provisions could render such conduct liable to a criminal sanction ; this is the case in the cantons of ORG and GPE only . It is understandable that a person can , in good faith , come to the conclusion that money and a journey abroad are all that is needed in order to evade a prohibition on remarriage .", "A means must be found of remedying the offensive aspects of this situation . This certainly can not be done by converting the prohibition on remarriage which is inherent in the waiting period into an impediment to marriage . In Articles CARDINAL et seq . the legislation provides for nullity of marriage only in very exceptional cases . Article CARDINAL para . QUANTITY Cst . would also preclude this solution . Nor can CARDINAL seriously contemplate a solution which would involve introducing serious criminal sanctions throughout GPE . If equality before the law is to be guaranteed , there is CARDINAL solution and that is to delete LAW CCS [ Swiss Civil Code ] . This is the solution proposed by ORG DATE , CARDINAL ) , who has given very convincing reasons . It was strongly supported by the Conference of cantonal authorities responsible for supervising civil status at its assembly on DATE ( see on this question the report by ORG , ORG DATE , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL ) . ORG unanimously supports this suggestion .", "It must be expressly stated that this proposal by the ORG is not intended to indicate any particular sympathy for behaviour contrary to the spirit of marriage . It is based on a recognition of the fact that ORG and CARDINAL \u2018 are not in accordance with the policy of the Constitution\u2019 ( ORG in RDS [ Revue de droit GPE ] DATE , I , CARDINAL ) . It is also clear that LAW will not have the effect of making spouses at fault think again and mend their ways ( ORG in JdT [ Journal des tribunaux ] DATE , I , CARDINAL ; PERSON in CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL(a ) ) . The ORG also wishes to point out that the inequalities noted do not only appear in the case of a possible marriage . They may become apparent during divorce proceedings , because the case - law on the application of LAW varies from GPE to GPE ; and in the case of divorce by consent , many spouses , even if at fault , agree to present their case in such a way that no waiting period is imposed ( PERSON in ORG [ Revue suisse de jurisprudence ] DATE , DATE ) \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG The same proposal was repeated by ORG , which considered the reform of divorce from DATE to DATE .", "After reform of the law on various subjects , the ORG concentrated its attention on the provisions relating to divorce . In DATE , it is due to adopt a PERSON which will be submitted to interested organisations and groups for comment . ORG will then draw up a PERSON to be laid before ORG . ORG will not be able to debate the PERSON before DATE , so that the new divorce law is not expected to come into force until DATE at the earliest ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["12"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
