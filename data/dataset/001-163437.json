The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , a town in LOC ( CARDINAL of the CARDINAL constituent ORG Herzegovina ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant declares himself as PERSON ( CARDINAL of the country \u2019s \u201c constituent peoples \u201d ) . He actively participates in the social and political life of the country . The applicant is a member of the ORG for GPE ( ORG ; \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and a founding member of ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . He has held several elected and appointed political positions in ORG . At the time of lodging his application to the ORG , the applicant was a member of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , as a candidate of ORG , the applicant submitted his candidacy for the DATE elections to the Presidency of GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ( \u201c GPE izborna PERSON i ORG \u201d ; \u201c the ORG \u201d ) rejected his candidacy . It explained that the applicant could not be elected to the Presidency from the territory of ORG considering that he declared affiliation with ORG . Pursuant to Article V of the LAW and LAW CARDINAL the presidential candidate from that Entity must be a NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for the reconsideration of that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s further appeal . It held that the applicant \u2019s candidacy was in contravention of the LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal relying on LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . On DATE ORG held that there had been no violation of that provision ( decision no . ORG DATE ) . The relevant part of the majority opinion reads as follows ( the translation has been provided by ORG ) :", "\u201c ... Therefore , the provision of LAW , including LAW , should be viewed in the light of the discretionary right of the ORG to impose certain restrictions when it comes to the exercise of individual rights . The said restrictions are justified by the specific nature of the internal order of GPE that was agreed upon by ORG and whose ultimate goal was the establishment of peace and dialogue between the opposing parties given that the said provision was intentionally incorporated into the LAW so that the members of the Presidency come from amongst NORP , NORP and NORP .", "There is no dispute that the provision of LAW , as well as the provision of LAW , have a restrictive character in that they restrict the rights of citizens , namely the candidacy of ORG and NORP from the territory of ORG and the NORP from the territory of ORG to stand for election as members of the Presidency of GPE .", "However , the purpose of those provisions is to strengthen the position of the constituent peoples in order to ensure that the Presidency is composed of the representatives from these CARDINAL constituent peoples . Taking into account the current situation in GPE , the restriction imposed ... is justified at this moment since there is a reasonable justification for such reasoning .", "Therefore , given the current situation in GPE and specific nature of its constitutional order as well as the current constitutional and statutory arrangements , the challenged decisions of ORG and ORG did not violate the appellants\u2019 rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to ORG and Article CARDINAL of LAW since the above - mentioned decisions are not arbitrary and are based on law . It means that they serve a legitimate aim , that they are reasonably justified and that they do not place an excessive burden on the appellants given that the restrictions imposed on the appellants\u2019 rights are proportionate to the objectives of the general community in terms of preservation of the established peace , continuation of dialogue , and consequently the creation of conditions for amending the above - mentioned provisions of LAW . \u201d", "The relevant part of the concurring opinion of Judge PERSON reads as follows :", "\u201c I agree that the special circumstances in which LAW was drafted and the needs of the time are capable of providing a rational and objective justification for treatment which would otherwise be discriminatory ... Like Judge PERSON in her separate dissenting opinions .... I regard the justification as being temporary rather than permanent , but I respectfully differ from Judge PERSON in thinking that the time has not yet arrived when the ORG will have completed its transition away from the special needs which dictated the unusual architecture of the ORG under LAW and LAW .", "However , I have another reason for joining the majority of ORG in this case . Until the time ( if it ever arrives ) when LAW is amended to remove the differential treatment of potential candidates for the Presidency , it seems to me that LAW leaves the drafters of LAW , ORG and the courts no choice . It is not constitutionally permissible for a PERSON or the interpretation or implementation of a PERSON to be directly incompatible with the express and unambiguous requirements of LAW . Had the appellants succeeded in their appeal , it would have left LAW with no effect whatever . It would have been otiose , reduced to empty words . In my view , ORG , required by LAW to \u2018 uphold this Constitution\u2019 , can not properly make a decision which makes an important part of the LAW wholly ineffective . I accept that there different parts of LAW appear to have conflicting values and objectives , but constitutions are never entirely coherent . They are always shaped by , and are a compromise between , conflicting values and objectives . The task of ORG under Article VI is to give effect to LAW , with all its inconsistencies , and make it as effective as possible in all the circumstances .", "For this reason , I would have dismissed this appeal as ill - founded even had I disagreed with the conclusion of the majority of ORG that there is an objective and rational justification for the difference of treatment . Whether justified or not , the difference is required by LAW . An international tribunal such as ORG might perhaps decide that the constitutional arrangements for electing members of the Presidency violate rights under LAW ( and nothing I write here should be taken to lend support to that suggestion under present conditions ) . Such a tribunal has no duty to uphold LAW . ORG has an express constitutional obligation to uphold the LAW , and in my opinion has no power to set aside parts of it , or make them ineffective , by relying on rights arising in an international instrument in preference to the express and unambiguous terms of the LAW itself . \u201d", "The relevant part of the dissenting opinion of Judge PERSON , joined by Judge PERSON , reads as follows :", "\u201c ... I respectfully differ from the conclusion that there is no violation of the appellant \u2019s rights guaranteed by LAW , its LAW because of an \u2018 objective and reasonable justification for differential treatment\u2019 .", "... I consider the exclusion of the candidate Mr. PERSON on the ORG \u2019s candidate list for the Presidency of GPE and GPE inconsistent with LAW No . CARDINAL and with LAW which guarantees equal right to stand for election and to be elected without unreasonable restrictions . Contrary to the statements of the majority ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , it seems to me that the current situation in GPE does not justify at this moment the differential treatment of the appellant \u2019s candidacy in relation to the candidacy of other candidates who are the NORP and are directly elected from the territory of ORG , nor it serves a legitimate aim , such as preservation of peace , continuation of dialogue or creation of conditions for amending the provisions of LAW and LAW . Although I think like judge PERSON in his separate concurring opinion under this decision that the State of ORG has not yet completed its transition , that it is still in a special situation requiring specific measures , I however consider that LAW architecture is evolving and has to adapt to the different stages of evolution in GPE The constitutional specificity of ORG consists of the multi - ethnic character of ORG and public institutions . The multi - ethnicity established by ORG has been precised by ORG in case U CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( Official Gazette of ORG , No . CARDINAL ) , stressing the equality of all constituent peoples in both entities and excluding in consequence the minority status of any constituent people in any entity .", "The coherence of this decision implies a multi - ethnic composition of the Presidency without territorial interference since the CARDINAL constituent peoples are precisely equal in the whole State territory of ORG ... It is the particular combination of ethnic and territorial structures which leads to unjustified discriminations since the territorial interference in presidential elections result to an ethnic separation materialized by the exclusion of the right to stand for election for all NORP living in the GPE and for all NORP and LOC living in PERSON . This combination is inconsistent with ORG goal of a multi - ethnic ORG and with the principle of equality of constituent peoples in both entities which only justifies that the NORP living in GPE and that the Bosniacs and the NORP living in PERSON do not benefit of the status of a minority .", "Therefore the only legitimate aim appropriated in the current situation in ORG consists of excluding the territorial criterion in presidential elections . Only such a solution could be a reasonable justification of differential treatment and would be consistent with the requirements of LAW No . CARDINAL that any right set forth by law shall be secured without discrimination on any ground and of LAW . In other terms , the differential treatment challenged by the appeal is not justified in an objective or in a proportionate manner .", "I also differ from the opinion expressed by judge PERSON in his point CARDINAL . Indeed , ORG and its Additional Protocols have at least the same rank as LAW The Constitutional Court stated that LAW was adopted as FAC to FAC . It follows that there can not be a conflict and possibility of dispute between that LAW of ORG which form a legal unity . This implies that the ORG grants the same importance to FAC and its annexes and thus that in case of conflict of norms , the case may only be resolved through a method of systematic interpretation . Furthermore the provisions of Articles II.CARDINAL , GPE and LAW place the compliance with the human rights and LAW among the basic pillars of the constitutional order in GPE and GPE which have priority over any other law and can not be restricted even by a constitutional revision .", "ORG in its role of upholding LAW has to take account of all these elements as well as of legal evolutions in order to guarantee concrete and effective rights . LAW V.CARDINAL has to be read in light of Articles II and X of the LAW and of LAW No . CARDINAL . ORG can not , of course , replace or modify the present LAW but it can request the ORG to harmonize the text with the requirements of ORG \u2019s international obligations . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again submitted his candidacy to the ORG . On DATE it was rejected for the same reasons as before ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P12"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P12-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
