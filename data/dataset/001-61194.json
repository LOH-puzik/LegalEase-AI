The applicant , born in DATE , was a NORP national at the time of the events complained of . He subsequently obtained NORP nationality .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is the father of PERSON , born out of wedlock on DATE . In a document dated DATE , he acknowledged paternity of the unborn child , and in a further document , dated DATE , he acknowledged paternity and undertook to pay maintenance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant met the child 's mother , PERSON , in DATE and in DATE he moved into her flat , where they lived together until DATE or , as stated by the applicant , until DATE . In any event , the applicant continued to visit the child and her mother until DATE , and DATE and DATE he regularly fetched PERSON for visits . From DATE , PERSON prohibited any contact between the applicant and the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a decision granting him a right of access to his daughter on DATE from TIME as well as on Boxing Day and GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having regard to the statements made by the parties and ORG and having considered evidence obtained from several witnesses , dismissed the applicant 's request .", "CARDINAL . The court , referring to LAW , observed that the mother , as the person having custody , determined the father 's right of access to the child and that the guardianship court could only grant the father a right of access if this was in the child 's best interests . The court found as follows :", "\u201c The ORG is convinced that the petitioner 's wish for [ PERSON ] to visit him is motivated by attachment to his child and genuine affection for her . It nonetheless takes the view that personal contact with her father is not in the child 's best interests , since her mother dislikes her father so deeply and opposes all contact so fiercely that any visits ordered by the court would take place in a tense , emotionally charged atmosphere which would probably be extremely harmful to the child .", "The ORG can discern no special circumstances which , given the strong differences between the parents , might make personal contact with her father appear beneficial for [ PERSON ] ... The relationship which developed between [ PERSON ] and her father in the period from her birth to her father 's moving out \u2013 that is , approximately one year and DATE is probably not of such fundamental importance that the risk of seriously upsetting the child by resuming contact opposed by her mother is worth taking . The staff who looked after [ PERSON ] at DATE nursery , and who were questioned as witnesses , stated that she displayed DATE or at least no serious and lasting DATE behavioural abnormalities when she was parted from her father and contact between them ceased , and that she is a balanced , cheerful and outgoing child . The evidence does not therefore confirm her father 's claim that she missed him and frequently asked about him after their contact at DATE nursery ceased .", "It has not therefore been shown that the conditions laid down in LAW have been met , and the ORG is accordingly obliged to dismiss the father 's request . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered a psychological expert opinion on the question whether contact with the applicant was in PERSON 's interests . On DATE , following a first conversation with the expert , the applicant challenged her for bias . He also requested that another expert be appointed on the ground that the scientific approach adopted did not reflect the latest state of research . On DATE ORG refused the applicant 's request , finding that , taking into account the expert 's explanations of CARDINAL DATE , there were no reasons to doubt her impartiality or her capabilities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to progress with the proceedings . He also applied for a provisional order granting him a right of access to PERSON during TIME DATE and prohibiting her mother from obstructing such contact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for a provisional order granting access . ORG found that there was no urgency and that the applicant could be expected to await the outcome of the main proceedings . Furthermore , such an order would anticipate the possible terms of a final decision . Should a provisional order be issued and the request be eventually dismissed in the main proceedings , the disadvantages for the child would be more serious than those for the applicant in continuing with the prevailing situation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In her opinion dated DATE , the expert noted that she had visited the applicant 's family in DATE and again heard the applicant , the child 's mother and the child on several occasions DATE and DATE . As regards her meetings with PERSON , the expert explained that in the course of various games she had explored her feelings concerning persons and situations and concerning the applicant . They had also looked at a family photo album and PERSON had avoided looking at the more recent photographs . This reaction showed that PERSON had repressed the memories of her father . The expert reached the conclusion that a right of access without prior conversations to overcome the conflicts between the parents was not in the child 's interests .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , noting that ORG had omitted to hear the child , enquired of the expert whether hearing the child in court on the issue of her relationship with her father would place a psychological strain on her .", "CARDINAL . In her reply of CARDINAL DATE , the expert indicated that she had not directly asked the child about her father . She had expected that PERSON would react spontaneously in the course of the meetings and express her feelings towards him . In the expert 's view , the fact that PERSON had not mentioned her father was certainly relevant . The expert further referred to the last meeting , when they had glanced through a family photo album and she had asked PERSON about whether she still knew her father . On both occasions , she had appeared to repress her memories concerning him . The risk inherent in questioning her about whether she wished to see her father was that , in this conflict between the parents , the child might have the impression that her statements were decisive . Such a situation could provoke serious feelings of guilt .", "CARDINAL . At a court hearing on DATE , the applicant and the child 's mother entered into an agreement . Under the terms of this agreement , the applicant declared that he would refrain from instituting any court proceedings , making any enquiries about the mother 's personal circumstances and exercising his right of custody obtained under NORP law on condition that they underwent parental therapy . The proceedings were suspended until the termination of this therapy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the proceedings be resumed as the child 's mother had not approved the CARDINAL institutions for family therapy proposed by the applicant and had failed to react to his suggestion that she should make a proposal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal , finding as follows :", "\u201c Personal contact with a child born out of wedlock is intended to allow a father to satisfy himself as to the child 's welfare and development and preserve the natural ties existing between them . It is not therefore the purpose of granting access , but the legal conditions for doing so , which differ : while a parent who does not have custody of a child born in wedlock is entitled to access under LAW [ of LAW ] , LAW of the Code ] does not grant a right of access to the father of a child born out of wedlock . Rather , the law leaves it up to the person having custody , as a rule the mother , to determine whether , and to what extent , the father should be able to spend time with his child . However , the guardianship court may decide that the father is entitled to access if this is in the child 's best interests . The main reason for the weaker legal position of the father of a child born out of wedlock is his different social position . After ORG decisions of DATE and DATE , the constitutionality of Article DATE can no longer be seriously doubted . For considerations of legal policy , a reform of the law on children born out of wedlock is even more urgently necessary . In the meantime , the courts are bound by Article CARDINAL .", "Under that provision , the guardianship court decides to grant a father access to a child born out of wedlock if this is beneficial for the child 's welfare . It is not enough for such contact to be consistent with , or not contrary to , the child 's interests , it must serve those interests and promote them . This interpretation justifies the assumption that fathers should generally be granted access to their children because this enables the latter to develop as normally as possible and helps them to form a clear image of themselves and their origin . It is in fact important for children not simply to have a fantasy picture of their fathers , but to be able to form a personal , realistic picture .", "Whether contact with the father is conducive to the child 's well - being depends initially on the father 's motives for seeking it . ORG is convinced that the father in this case is motivated by attachment to [ PERSON ] and genuine affection for her . Even when a father acts from responsible motives , however , the court is not necessarily obliged to grant him access if there are serious tensions between the parents , these are communicated to the child , and there is reason to fear that every meeting with the father will interfere with the child 's further undisturbed development in the residual family provided by the mother ...", "In view of the findings in the [ psychological expert ] report referred to above , it must be assumed that this would happen in the instant case . If the father were granted access to [ PERSON ] in present circumstances , she would have to shuttle between hostile camps , which should not be asked of her .", "If DATE as in this case \u2013 there is a danger that differences between parents may affect a child , then special circumstances are needed to justify the assumption that contact with the father will nevertheless have permanently beneficial effects on the child 's development or well - being ... However , no such circumstances can be discerned here . It is true that , for DATE of her life , [ PERSON ] grew up with both father and mother , but this period was not conflict - free . The disagreements and sometimes open aggression between her parents \u2013 in other words , the family violence she witnessed \u2013 have certainly left their mark on her , even if she can no longer recall them spontaneously . As the psychological report indicates , she has also repressed her old ties with her father \u2013 a fact reflected in the care she takes to avoid talking about him . In view of all this , the report finds that she does not suffer as a result of the present situation .", "The ORG can rely fully on the report , which has no apparent defects and is not invalidated by the fact that the father sees the situation differently .", "In finding that therapy had not enabled the parents to put their former conflicts behind them , thus making it possible for [ PERSON ] to have access to both of them , the ORG did not have to decide who was to blame for this ... The decisive factor is always the child 's point of view . As already pointed out , however , the situation in this case is such that the parents must first initiate dialogue with each other . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG finally considered that exceptionally it had not been required to hear the child , since questioning her about her relationship with her father would have placed a psychological strain on her . In this connection , the court referred to the expert 's supplementary report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional complaint with ORG , complaining that the refusal of access to his daughter infringed his parental rights and amounted to discrimination , and alleging that the taking of expert evidence had been unfair . ORG acknowledged receipt on DATE .", "By a letter of DATE , the applicant asked ORG about the state of the proceedings and urged a speedy decision . On DATE the Constitutional Court informed him that in a similar case which had been registered at an earlier date a decision was envisaged for DATE .", "On DATE the applicant sent a letter to the President of ORG complaining that the examination of his constitutional complaint had been postponed until DATE . In her reply of CARDINAL DATE the judge dealing with the applicant 's case informed him that , owing to the heavy workload of ORG in DATE , it had not been possible to take a decision . A decision was envisaged in DATE . Having regard to the importance of the subject matter , such a decision required careful preparation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to entertain the applicant 's constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL ) , which came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Pursuant to LAW , as amended , the parents of a minor child born out of wedlock jointly exercise custody if they make a declaration to that effect ( declaration on joint custody ) or if they marry .

Moreover , the parents must not do anything that would harm the child 's relationship with the other parent or seriously interfere with the child 's upbringing . The family courts can determine the scope of the right of access and prescribe more specific rules for its exercise , also with regard to third parties ; they may also order the parties to fulfil their obligations towards the child . The family courts can , however , restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child 's welfare . A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if the child 's well - being would otherwise be endangered .
