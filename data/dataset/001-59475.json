On DATE , the applicant , whilst driving under the influence of drink , knocked down a cyclist who was fatally injured . After hitting the cyclist , the applicant drove off without stopping to give assistance and only gave himself up to the police TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the St. ORG ( Bezirkshauptmannschaft ) , finding the applicant guilty of a number of road traffic offences , ordered him to pay a fine of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) with CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in default . This sentence included a fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL with CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in default imposed for driving under the influence of drink , contrary to sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(a ) of FAC DATE ( Stra\u00dfenverkehrsordnung ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) convicted the applicant under LAW of LAW ) of causing death by negligence \u201c after allowing himself ... to become intoxicated ... through the consumption of alcohol , but not to an extent which GPE ] his responsibility ... \u201d , and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) on DATE . The applicant argued that , in the light of the ORG \u2019s PERSON v. GPE judgment ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-C ) , the decision of ORG should be quashed . ORG recognised that the double conviction violated LAW CARDINAL to the LAW . However , it found that , in spite of the PERSON case , NORP law remained unchanged . It distinguished the PERSON judgment on the ground that in that case the administrative proceedings had been after the criminal proceedings , whereas in the present case , the order was reversed . ORG explained that the double punishment was possible because there was no provision of NORP law which provided for a principle of \u201c subsidiarity \u201d between the administrative and the criminal proceedings in the present circumstances . It concluded that this could not hinder the criminal proceedings which had a much wider scope . The applicant \u2019s conviction was therefore upheld .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment imposed on the applicant was reduced to DATE by virtue of the Federal President \u2019s prerogative of pardons .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE provides that it is an offence for a person to drive a vehicle if the proportion of alcohol in his blood or breath is equal to or QUANTITY respectively .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , so far as relevant , provided at the material time , that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) It shall be an administrative offence ( PERSON ) , punishable with a fine of not less than ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and not more than ATS CARDINAL,CARDINAL or , in default of payment with CARDINAL to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , for any person :", "( a ) to drive a vehicle when under the influence of drink ...", "( CARDINAL ) An administrative offence is not committed where : ...", "( c ) facts constituting an offence under sub - sections ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) also constitute an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the [ ordinary ] courts ... . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG had to examine the constitutionality of LAW subsection ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , by virtue of which the administrative offence of driving under the influence of drink was not subsidiary to an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the courts .", "ORG noted that it was not contrary to LAW if a single act constituted more than one offence . This was a feature common to the criminal law of many NORP countries . However , it was also accepted in criminal law doctrine that sometimes a single act only appeared to constitute CARDINAL offence , whereas interpretation showed that one offence entirely covered the wrong contained in the other so that there was no need for further punishment . Thus , LAW prohibited the trial and punishment of someone for different offences if interpretation showed that one excluded the application of the other . Where , as in the present case , the law explicitly provided that one offence was not subsidiary to another , it had to be guided by LAW . The ORG \u2019s Gradinger judgment of DATE had shown that there was a breach of this Article if an essential aspect of an offence , which had already been tried by the courts , was tried again by the administrative authorities .", "Section CARDINAL subsections ( CARDINAL)(a ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , taken together , meant that the criminal administrative offence of drunken driving could be prosecuted even when an offence falling within the competence of the normal criminal courts was also apparent . According to the criminal courts\u2019 constant case - law under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( cited below ) , drunken driving was also an essential aspect of certain offences tried by these courts . Insofar as LAW ( CARDINAL ) of FAC limited the subsidiarity of administrative offences to those enumerated in subsections ( CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) of section CARDINAL , thus excluding subsidiarity for the offence of drunken driving contained in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(a ) , it violated LAW .", "CARDINAL .
