The applicants or their predecessors in title ( hereinafter \u201c the applicants \u201d ) owned CARDINAL plots of land of varying sizes . The applicants were notified that their land had been made subject to CARDINAL declarations by the Governor General dated CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE , stating that the land would be expropriated for a public purpose . The intended public purpose was the building of the GPE . The said plots were numbered LAW ( CARDINAL sq.m ) , Plot CARDINAL ( CARDINAL sq.m ) , Plot CARDINAL ( CARDINAL,CARDINAL sq.m ) and Plot CARDINAL ( CARDINAL sq.m ) .", "CARDINAL . Following notices to treat of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively , the applicants were offered MONEY ( ( ORG ) - MONEY ( ORG ) ) for Plot CARDINAL , MTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) for Plot CARDINAL , MTL CARDINAL ( approximately FAC , CARDINAL ) for Plot CARDINAL , and ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) for Plot CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants refused the above - mentioned offers in respect of Plots CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE and submitted their counteroffers . According to the Government , the applicants accepted the offer in respect of Plot CARDINAL ; however , the applicants contested this . Subsequently , the Commissioner of Lands ( CoL ) was required to institute proceedings before ORG ) ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law below \u201d ) . Although no such proceedings ensued , the ORG gave possession of the CARDINAL plots of land to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants unsuccessfully requested the ORG to initiate proceedings a number of times ; however , the latter did not do so , insisting that he wanted further information in relation to the ORG ownership title . The law at the relevant time did not provide for a procedure which would allow the applicants to initiate proceedings for compensation . The initiation of compensation proceedings was an action which could be undertaken only by the authorities , and to which no time - limit applied . However , in DATE it had been confirmed that the ordinary courts had the competence , upon a request made by persons in a similar position to the applicants , to set a time - limit for the performance of that obligation , by virtue of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Thus , on DATE the applicants lodged ordinary civil proceedings , requesting the court to order the ORG to initiate the necessary proceedings within an established time frame .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the ORG request , and ordered the ORG to initiate proceedings before the ORG within DATE . It noted that the relevant notices to treat had been issued to all the owners concerned who at the time were still alive . Moreover , it was incumbent on the ORG to establish the identity of the owners of the land and to ensure that they were notified and that the relevant proceedings were pursued properly . No appeal having been lodged , the judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG instituted compensation proceedings in respect of CARDINAL of the plots of land in question ( Plots CARDINAL and DATE ) . These proceedings are still pending , as they were suspended sine die , pending the outcome of the constitutional proceedings mentioned below .", "CARDINAL . Compensation proceedings in relation to ORG and CARDINAL had not been initiated by the time the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings . However , pending the constitutional proceedings , on DATE , a schedule of deposit was filed in court , in relation to LAW , consisting of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) covering the price of the land and MTL MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) as damages for the delay in payment .", "CARDINAL . By DATE , only a portion of the CARDINAL plots of land had been used , the remaining portion remaining unused but earmarked for future expansion . More precisely , most of Plot CARDINAL is currently being developed as a stacking area for containers for the purposes of the GPE , the remaining QUANTITY m forming part of an area of land conceded on lease by ORG Plot CARDINAL ( consisting of a farmhouse and adjacent rural structures ) and Plot CARDINAL are outside the GPE zone , and are currently in their original state but may be earmarked for future expansion . Plot CARDINAL is almost entirely within the GPE zone and has been used for that purpose , including the building of roads , except for a piece of land measuring CARDINAL sq.m , which is outside the GPE zone and is currently in its original state but may be earmarked for future expansion .", "CARDINAL . In consequence , the applicants , who remain uncompensated to date , instituted CARDINAL sets of constitutional proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants instituted proceedings in relation to the taking of Plots CARDINAL and DATE , complaining under LAW lack of access to court ; a lack of a fair hearing within a reasonable time ( in respect of DATE before the proceedings started and in respect of the current pending proceedings before the LAB ) , before an independent and impartial tribunal , the latter in that they considered that the ORG \u2019s constitution did not fulfil the said requirements . They further complained under LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW about the lack of adequate compensation in relation to the taking ; in particular , they noted that the law as it stood referred to values applicable at the time of taking . At the final stages of oral submissions they further argued that the taking had not been carried out in the public interest as it had been given to a commercial entity and that the unused land was to be returned according to the PERSON jurisprudence ( see relevant domestic law and practice below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction found a violation of LAW , in that the applicants had been denied access to court . Indeed , it was only the ORG who could institute proceedings according to domestic law . The fact that recently the law had been applied to allow the applicants to take up proceedings requesting a court to order the latter to act within a time - limit did not detract from the fact that it ultimately remained the duty of the ORG to take up these proceedings , and the affected individuals had no obligation to solicit such an action . Moreover , even in the event that ownership of land was at issue , it referred to ORG earlier reasoning in this respect ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and , moreover , considered that the ORG could have instituted proceedings by means of a curator . It awarded them LAW by way of damages and dismissed the remainder of their claims . It held that the taking of the CARDINAL plots of land which were being used for the GPE had been in the public interest , the latter being an important economic venture for the country . The fact that it was later privatised did not take away the element of public interest , despite the fact that the deed of expropriation had not yet been finalised . Moreover , the CARDINAL of the CARDINAL plots which was outside the GPE zone which had remained unused could have been used for future development . It failed to take cognisance of the complaint regarding compensation , holding that this had not yet been determined by the LAB . As to the complaint about the length of the proceedings , namely DATE for the ORG to initiate proceedings , the court held that apart from the fact that this had been related to the previous complaint under LAW , the provision referred to proceedings which had already begun and had taken an unreasonable time to be finally decided ; therefore it was not applicable in the present case which was still pending . Lastly , since the law had been changed , the composition of the ORG clearly satisfied the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG reversed the said judgment in part . It confirmed that there had been a violation of LAW in so far as the applicants had been deprived of access to a court but only from the period starting on DATE , the date when GPE introduced the right of individual petition . It also considered that there had been a violation of the reasonable time principle DATE and DATE , the date when the compensation proceedings were initiated . It had regard however to the fact that the applicants were also to blame for not having taken up the civil remedy available to solicit the ORG earlier than they had done . Moreover , no proof had been supplied that the proceedings currently pending before the LAB were not satisfying the reasonable time requirement .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further found a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . Holding that the public interest had to persist from DATE of the taking to the date of the conclusion of the act of expropriation , it considered that even the land which had remained unused had been taken for such a purpose , since the GPE could reasonably expand to cover such land . Moreover , the privatisation of the GPE did not detract from the public interest involved . The court further confirmed that it was not in a position to consider the amount of compensation which had yet to be decided by the ORG . However , the fact that the process of expropriation had taken DATE had caused the applicants to suffer a disproportionate burden , constituting a violation of the applicants\u2019 property rights .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court reduced the amount of compensation to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , covering moral damage in relation to the said violations and confirmed the rejection of the remaining complaints .", "CARDINAL . NORP In parallel , in DATE the applicants instituted proceedings in relation to the taking of Plots CARDINAL and CARDINAL , with identical complaints to those in case no . MONEY ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction found a violation of LAW , in that the applicants had been denied access to court , and rejected the remaining complaints on the same ground of the judgment in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It added however that the present case was a more serious breach of the applicants\u2019 right of access to court , as the ORG had failed to institute proceedings even after he was ordered to do so by a court . It thus awarded the applicants LAW by way of damages .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG reversed the said judgment in part . It held that the findings of ORG in its judgment in case no . CARDINAL , applied in the same way in this case , except for the fact that the violation of the reasonable time principle was in respect of the period from DATE to the date of this judgment , since the ORG had not yet instituted the relevant proceedings . It awarded the applicants LAW in moral damage .", "CARDINAL . Shortly before and during the constitutional proceedings certain developments took place . Domestic jurisprudence developed by means of the PERSON case ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) ; and the ORG announced the privatisation of the GPE , by conceding it on a long - term lease ( of DATE at the price of MONEY ( ORG ) per year , to be augmented over DATE to reach a maximum of ORG CARDINAL per year ) ; the jurisprudence in the PERSON case was overturned ; and , in DATE the law was amended to provide a procedure for an individual to initiate compensation proceedings before the ORG in relation to new and recent expropriations .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE the ORG informed the LAB of the outcome of the constitutional proceedings . However , neither the applicants nor their lawyers were present at that hearing ; nor were they present at the subsequent CARDINAL hearings .

In PERSON vs PERSON u l - Kummissarju ta l - Artijiet ( Rikors Nru DATE , DATE ) ORG held , after giving an overview of the applicable principles under LAW to the LAW , that whenever the process by which an individual is divested of his property is not concluded , the interference therefore remains CARDINAL of control of use , the ORG has the obligation to release the property to its rightful owners as soon as it transpires that there no longer exist grounds on which the ORG had originally , validly and justifiably taken the measure by which the owner \u2019s use was restricted . It was for the Government to prove that both at the time of the Governor \u2019s declaration and throughout the proceedings until the transfer of the property concluding the expropriation there existed a public interest for the taking of the property .", "CARDINAL . In this case the evidence revealed that for DATE the competent authorities had actively considered releasing the property to its rightful owners , as it was no longer needed for the purposes for which it had originally been taken . Moreover , DATE had passed since the date of the declaration and the present application , and thus the lack of public interest was evident . ORG noted that a general interest had indeed existed at the time of the declaration . However , it subsequently emerged that PERSON property would not have been used for that purpose and therefore the ORG should have returned the said property . Failure to comply with this latter obligation amounted to a breach of the applicants\u2019 property rights under the LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
