This process may DATE but it is impossible to determine the exact number of DATE .", "D. It appears from the medical file that on DATE at TIME GPE GPE fell down in the hospital \u2019s lavatory ; taking into account the abovementioned circumstances concerning the spleen rupture and acute internal bleeding , the spleen rupture could not have been caused by DATE in the hospital \u2019s lavatory . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE PERSON had been very ill : he had lost a lot of weight and staggered when walking , so they had to accompany him to the toilets .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the experts conducting the panel forensic medical examination produced their opinion . According to its conclusions , it had been possible for the doctors of the military unit not to discover the injuries which led to GPE PERSON \u2019s death since there were no visible traces of injuries on the surface of the skin . The enlarged spleen might have been caused by malaria and the injury sustained by PERSON might have brought about the sub - capsular bleeding which later led to a ruptured spleen and acute internal bleeding . Referring to the fact that no malaria agents were discovered in GPE PERSON \u2019s blood sample by the parasitological examination of CARDINAL DATE , the experts attributed this to the fact that agents could be detected at the stage of the disease when the sick person experiences shivering and fever accompanied by high temperature . The opinion lastly stated that , given that no malaria agents had been discovered , not specific but symptomatic treatment had to be prescribed , and in fact had been provided in full .", "CARDINAL . On DATE serviceman PERSON was questioned again and stated that both PERSON and serviceman PERSON had denied having been beaten or sworn at during their first visit to officer ORG \u2019s office . When he and PERSON visited the office TIME , officer ORG had said to him \u201c Why did you enter ? You go out , you have received your punishment \u201d .

On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG of GPE , arguing in detail that his son had died as a result of a beating by officers PERSON , GPE , GPE and another officer , PERSON , as well as the failure of the doctors of the military unit , LOC and ORG , to provide medical assistance .

PERSON had been next to enter that office , alone , and TIME he had been so unwell in bed that he was not able to return to officer ORG \u2019s office . The applicant alleged that the beating which resulted in GPE PERSON \u2019s ruptured spleen and subsequent death had taken place at that moment . He further claimed that the doctors had intentionally refused to provide medical assistance and to transfer GPE GPE to hospital in order to cover up the abuse . The applicant requested ORG to identify those responsible for his son \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE investigator PERSON decided to order an additional forensic medical examination . In addition to the questions asked earlier , the experts were requested to determine whether the military unit and the hospital doctors could have detected the spleen enlargement and what they were supposed to do if it had been detected , as well as whether GPE PERSON \u2019s spleen could have ruptured earlier and been followed by slow bleeding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the forensic medical experts produced an additional opinion . According to its conclusions , since on DATE PERSON had not complained of abdominal pains , the doctors of the military unit had no reason to suspect malaria and diagnosed his condition as an acute respiratory illness . The opinion further stated that usually a doctor was obliged to deliver a diagnosis after having carefully examined the patient . PERSON medical file contained his complaints but no indication of results of any such examination . If on DATE GPE PERSON \u2019s spleen had already been enlarged , it would have been possible to detect this through palpation and to transfer him to hospital . The same was possible at the hospital . As regards the sub - capsular rupture of the spleen , it was almost impossible to detect . Had the spleen rupture been detected and the spleen removed by surgery , PERSON \u2019s life could have been saved . Lastly , the injuries discovered by the post - mortem examination were not detected by the doctors since there were no visible traces of injuries on the outer part of the skin .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a serviceman , ORG , who had been undergoing treatment at the hospital when PERSON was admitted , was questioned .

He confirmed that PERSON had already been ill with malaria when he sustained the old bruises in the area of the left side of the abdomen . He stated that the fact that PERSON was ill might have accelerated the transformation of the sub - capsular rupture into a full rupture and internal bleeding . However , even a healthy spleen could suffer a sub - capsular rupture from a blow , later leading to a full rupture . The transformation of the sub - capsular rupture into full rupture could happen with or without external influence . The expert lastly confirmed that the new bruises found on PERSON body and the abrasion to the left side of his forehead could have been caused by his falling on the hospital floor not long before his death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE serviceman PERSON was questioned again and confirmed that no sound of blows or other loud noise could be heard when he had waited for PERSON outside the office . Later he had heard rumours that GPE GPE had been beaten by officers PERSON and ORG G.M. further explained that he had inquired with PERSON and serviceman PERSON whether they had been beaten , because officer ORG had hit him a few times while in the office .

He was further asked to explain as to why he had refused to visit PERSON after being called by the latter \u2019s fellow serviceman .", "CARDINAL . Hospital doctor GPE stated that it was he who had initially diagnosed GPE GPE as having malaria , because of the symptoms and the fact that he was serving in a malaria hotbed . PERSON had not told him , except on DATE he died , that he had been beaten or that he had fallen , and since there were no symptoms he did not put such questions to the patient . However , on DATE , when he rushed to provide medical aid to GPE GPE , the latter , when asked what had happened , told him \u201c I have pain in my belly , I feel very ill , I fell not long ago in the ward \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
