The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE on suspicion of homicide . On DATE the ORG ( FAC ) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for DATE in view of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed homicide . It further held that the likelihood that he would be given a heavy sentence justified his detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . It relied on the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offence in question and the likelihood of a heavy sentence being imposed on the applicant . In addition , it had regard to the need to obtain expert evidence and a psychiatric examination of the suspects .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .

Furthermore , it relied on the severity of the likely sentence and the need to obtain further expert evidence . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , reiterating the grounds previously given . It appears that his detention was subsequently prolonged on an unspecified later date .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant was charged with CARDINAL counts of homicide and armed robbery . There were CARDINAL other defendants in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until DATE .

It further held that the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was the only measure which could secure the proper conduct of the proceedings . Lastly , when extending the applicant \u2019s detention , ORG had regard to its caseload .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted ORG application and prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . It noted that the period of the applicant \u2019s detention had reached the CARDINAL statutory time - limit ( Article QUANTITY of LAW ) and criticised the trial court for not having indicated any particular circumstances which would justify the prolongation beyond the statutory time - limit . However , it held that the prolongation was justified on account of other significant obstacles to progress in the proceedings , namely the fact that one of the defendants had failed to appear at the hearing which had led to the adjournment of the trial . ORG also noted that although the bill of indictment had been filed on DATE , the trial court listed the first hearing only for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention was subsequently prolonged on DATE ( until DATE ) , on DATE ( until DATE ) and on DATE ( until DATE ) .

On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until DATE . The applicant \u2019s detention was subsequently prolonged on DATE ( until DATE ) , on DATE ( until DATE ) and on DATE ( until DATE ) . In all those decisions , ORG relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question and the likelihood of a heavy sentence being imposed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision of DATE to prolong his detention . He argued , in particular , that ORG had failed to explain why other non - custodial measures were considered insufficient in his case . On DATE ORG upheld the contested decision . It agreed with the applicant that the reasons given by ORG were very brief and general . However , referring to LAW , it held that the applicant \u2019s continued detention served the public interest of protecting society , given that the applicant had been charged with the homicide of QUANTITY women , having first cruelly treated them .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE upholding the decision of CARDINAL DATE on the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention , ORG held that his continued detention on the basis of LAW remained valid . Having regard to the nature of the alleged offences , it held that LAW established a presumption to the effect that the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on an accused might induce him to obstruct the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having examined the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE on prolongation of his detention , ordered the applicant \u2019s release under police supervision . It also imposed a ban on leaving the country . ORG had regard to the excessive length of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand and the fact that the process of hearing evidence was very advanced . In those circumstances , it was not necessary to prolong further the applicant \u2019s detention . ORG also noted that despite the significant length of the applicant \u2019s detention , ORG had failed to ensure the diligent conduct of the trial and , in particular , had not held hearings at reasonable intervals . Furthermore , it observed that the reasons for the continued detention as given by ORG in its decision of DATE were very terse . The applicant was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
