According to the record of the police investigation , he did not request the assistance of a public defence counsel . On DATE ORG , apparently of its own motion , appointed the lawyer PERSON as public defence counsel for the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with another incident of aggravated drunken driving and driving without a driver \u2019s licence . According to the record of the police investigation , he stated that he wished the lawyer PERSON to be appointed as public defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant was charged with yet another incident of aggravated drunken driving and driving without a driver \u2019s licence .

According to the prosecutor \u2019s application , the applicant wished to have S. as public defence counsel . At the subsequent hearing , the lawyer PERSON replaced , with ORG permission , PERSON as public defence counsel . According to the TIME from the hearing , the applicant requested that PERSON , a NORP lawyer who had previously assisted him and who knew NORP , should be appointed as his public defence counsel , whereupon the judge informed him that he should give reasons for his request in writing .

On DATE the applicant was charged with attempted aggravated assault and possessing a knife in a public place .", "CARDINAL . When scheduling the main hearing , ORG had telephone contact with the applicant who reiterated his request to have PERSON appointed as his public defence counsel . The court asked the applicant to contact PERSON in the matter .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG the applicant apparently lodged some submissions independently of counsel PERSON It appears that these submissions were all in NORP , the applicant invoking his right under LAW ( PERSON spr\u00e5kkonventionen ) to submit pleadings in his mother tongue . All the written submissions were translated into NORP and entered into the case - file .", "CARDINAL . At the main hearing on DATE the applicant was assisted by PERSON as public defence counsel . Neither the minutes of the hearing nor the judgment delivered in the case contains any indication that the applicant at that time expressed a wish to have his public defence counsel replaced . In addition to counsel \u2019s oral submissions , the applicant defended himself orally in NORP via a court - appointed interpreter . He denied some of the offences he was charged with , confessed some and declared that he neither confessed nor denied the remainder of the charges .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was convicted on all the above - mentioned counts and sentenced to DATE and DATE in prison . He was also ordered to pay MONEY ( SEK ) of the total litigation costs in the case . These included H. \u2019s fees which amounted to SEK CARDINAL for , inter alia , TIME of work . The remainder of the costs was borne by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the judgment in respect of the charges he had denied . The prosecution also appealed , seeking a more severe sentence . The prosecution stated that the applicant was in great need of public counsel for his defence , although he clearly did not wish to be represented by H.", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the proceedings before ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) for LOC , the applicant requested that counsel PERSON be replaced by S. The applicant reiterated that he had previously been assisted by PERSON and that he was able to communicate with him in NORP . S. had declared that he was willing to assist the applicant as public defence counsel .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG ( H\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the applicant leave to appeal against ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . As in the proceedings before ORG , the applicant apparently lodged some submissions in NORP before the appellate court , all of which were translated into NORP and entered into the case - file .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal heard the case on CARDINAL DATE . PERSON attended the hearing as the applicant \u2019s counsel . There is no indication in the minutes of the hearing that the applicant opposed PERSON \u2019s presence . Having heard H. \u2019s oral pleadings , ORG gave the applicant the floor via a court - appointed interpreter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence . It also decided that the litigation costs in the appeal proceedings \u2013 including PERSON \u2019s fees of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL \u2013 should be paid by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The references made in the following pertain to chapter QUANTITY of LAW ( R\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ; hereinafter \u201c the Code \u201d ) , if not otherwise indicated .", "CARDINAL . The suspect may conduct the defence on his or her own ( section CARDINAL ) or with the assistance of a defence counsel ( section CARDINAL ) who , as a main rule , is appointed by the suspect ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . A defence counsel so appointed is referred to as private defence counsel , as opposed to CARDINAL appointed by a court who is referred to as public defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . Public defence counsel is to be appointed for a person who is arrested or in detention , if he or she so requests . Upon request , such counsel will also be appointed for a person suspected of an offence for which the statutory penalty is imprisonment for DATE ( section CARDINAL a , subsection CARDINAL ) . In addition , public defence counsel must be appointed under either of the following circumstances : ( CARDINAL ) if the suspect is in need of counsel due to the criminal investigation , ( CARDINAL ) if there is such a need on account of it being uncertain which penalty will be imposed and there is reason to impose a penalty other than a fine or a conditional sentence or a combination of those penalties , or ( CARDINAL ) there are other special reasons relating to the suspect \u2019s personal situation or the subject matter of the case ( section CARDINAL a , subsection CARDINAL ) . However , if the suspect has already appointed defence counsel , no additional public counsel is to be appointed ( section CARDINAL a , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The court considers the question of appointing public defence counsel if such appointment has been requested or it finds cause therefor of its own motion ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . A request for the appointment of public defence counsel may be made by the suspect or the public prosecutor responsible for the pre - trial investigation . In deciding this issue , the starting - point for the court is whether there is a need for counsel considering the character of the matter at stake . According to the preparatory documents to the legislation ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , there may not be any consideration of the suspect \u2019s economic situation in this context .", "CARDINAL . The suspect has a certain influence on the appointment of public defence counsel . Thus , the person suggested by the suspect is to be appointed if he or she is competent and the appointment would not cause a considerable increase in the costs or there are other special reasons against that appointment ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . According to the preparatory documents ( Nytt juridiskt arkiv ( NJA ) II DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , it is important that the suspect has confidence in the person assisting him or her . Somebody else than the person suggested should be appointed only if the above - mentioned reasons are at hand . There is no right to have public defence counsel who speaks the suspect \u2019s mother tongue , but such considerations may be taken into account . Otherwise , the matter of language is solved by using interpreters paid out of public funds .", "CARDINAL . The appointment of public defence counsel may be revoked if there is no longer a need for such counsel or if there is some other justifiable reason . If the suspect authorises another person than the publicly appointed counsel to conduct his or her defence , the appointment is to be revoked , unless this would cause considerable inconvenience ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A publicly appointed counsel may also be replaced ; such a replacement , however , has to be supported by justifiable reasons ( see NJA II DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . There are some examples in case - law of how this issue has been dealt with by the courts .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL case ( NJA DATE , p. CARDINAL ) ORG allowed that public defence counsel be replaced on the ground that special importance had to be attached to a lack in the defendant \u2019s confidence in his counsel when there was a risk of long - term imprisonment and there could be differing opinions as to what evidence should be presented to the court . ORG had sentenced the defendant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for , inter alia , an aggravated narcotics offence .", "CARDINAL . Another case ( NJA DATE , p. CARDINAL ) concerned an accused who , pleading not guilty , had been sentenced for murder to life imprisonment . ORG stated that in such a case , where the accused had no confidence in his public defence counsel , he should be allowed to have that counsel replaced .", "CARDINAL . In a third case ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tterna ( ORG ) CARDINAL ) a NORP national was suspected of murder . ORG did not allow the replacement of his public defence counsel in favour of someone who was able to speak NORP .", "CARDINAL . Private defence counsel is paid for by the suspect . If the suspect is acquitted , the costs of the defence are normally reimbursed . Public defence counsel , however , is paid out of public funds ( Section CARDINAL a ) . LAW of the LAW regulates who will eventually bear counsel \u2019s costs in such a case . Normally , if the suspect is convicted , he or she will have to pay the costs of the defence , in whole or in part , depending on his or her economic situation . If the suspect is acquitted , the ORG will bear the costs , as with the costs of private defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . A decision by a ORG to refuse a request for the appointment of public defence counsel , or a decision to appoint another counsel than the CARDINAL suggested by the suspect , may be appealed against to a ORG and further to ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
