On DATE the applicant , at that time an employee of the GPE agricultural land commission ( \u201c the land commission \u201d ) , was questioned on suspicion of abuse of office . She was suspected , inter alia , of attempting to impede the adoption of amendments to a land redistribution plan adversely affecting plots of agricultural land previously restored to her husband , a member of ORG at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings were instituted soon afterwards , on DATE . On DATE the applicant was charged with CARDINAL offences \u2013 one committed in DATE and the other CARDINAL in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the case was placed on a special register in ORG , apparently because it was considered to have a corruption element .", "CARDINAL . The investigation of the case against the applicant continued until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE regional public prosecutor \u2019s office terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant . It was concluded that the applicant \u2019s actions relating to the events of DATE did not constitute a crime and that it had not been proved that the applicant had been party to the offence in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE , following an internal review of cases ordered by ORG , a prosecutor from the GPE appellate public prosecutor \u2019s office quashed the decision of DATE and ordered the resumption of the criminal proceedings against the applicant , on the ground that the investigation had been incomplete and that the conclusions reached did not correspond to the evidence collected . In particular , it was noted that a key witness \u2013 the chairman of the land commission who had established breaches of duty on the part of the applicant \u2013 had not been questioned and that the applicant should have been questioned again in relation to CARDINAL of the charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was presented with modified charges , consisting of CARDINAL counts of abuse of office and CARDINAL count of drawing up a false document in an official capacity . On DATE , the criminal proceedings in respect of the offence committed in DATE were terminated , as it had not been proved that the applicant had been a party to the offence , and as the prosecution had now become time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant and gave her a suspended sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG acquitted the applicant on one of the counts of abuse of office and upheld the conviction on the remaining counts . It reduced the applicant \u2019s sentence to a suspended term of DATE imprisonment . That judgment was upheld by ORG in a final judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , relying on the termination of the criminal proceedings against her of DATE , brought an action for damages under the ORG and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) against the prosecuting authorities for unlawful prosecution .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that on DATE her representative in the domestic proceedings was told by a prosecutor at the GPE regional public prosecutor \u2019s office that bringing an action under the ORG could have unfavourable consequences for the applicant . On an unspecified date in DATE the same prosecutor told the applicant \u2019s representative that she had made a mistake in pursuing the proceedings for damages against the advice given on DATE , as the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been resumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative sent an open letter through the NORP media to ORG office , averring that the prosecution authorities had resumed the proceedings against the applicant in retaliation for the proceedings for damages she had brought against the ORG . CARDINAL other case similar to that of the applicant was reported by the media .", "CARDINAL . In a newspaper publication ORG denied the allegations made in the letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a newspaper published on DATE a spokesperson for the GPE appellate public prosecutor \u2019s office was quoted as stating that it was against the interests of the prosecuting authorities to allow claims engaging the ORG \u2019s responsibility , as this adversely affected the NORP taxpayer . Also , ORG was quoted as stating that there was cause for concern , in that the lack of criteria for the resumption of criminal proceedings left scope for abuse of process . Further , in a newspaper published on DATE the applicant gave her account of the events stating she was innocent .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s action for damages . The court held that because criminal proceedings were pending against the applicant her action had been brought prematurely . As to the period before the proceedings were terminated , the ORG found that in view of their resumption in DATE the proceedings up to that moment could not be considered unlawful , nor had the ORG \u2019s responsibility been engaged in that respect .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . In a judgment of DATE ORG found against her . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for the proceedings to be stayed until the resumed criminal proceedings against her had ended , reasoning that this was irrelevant to the outcome of her civil action for damages , which was grounded on her claim that the criminal proceedings had been terminated . In the absence of a final act terminating those proceedings the action for damages could not be upheld .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment in part . It allowed the applicant \u2019s action in so far as the criminal proceedings relating to the DATE offence , which had been terminated , were concerned ( see paragraph CARDINAL above , in fine ) and awarded her MONEY ( ORG ) . The court reasoned that the applicant \u2019s right to compensation arose on the date of the second termination of those proceedings on DATE and not from the termination on DATE . It subscribed to the lower court \u2019s conclusions in respect of the charges related to the offences committed in DATE , namely that there had been no final act terminating the criminal proceedings against the applicant given that the proceedings had been resumed .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE a draft law proposing , inter alia , an amendment of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE Code setting a DATE term for resuming previously discontinued criminal proceedings was rejected by the NORP parliament .
