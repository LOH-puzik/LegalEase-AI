He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON ( GPE ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE in the course of a judicial investigation opened in respect of the applicant , who was suspected of having sexually abused his daughter PERSON , the investigating judge at ORG ( ORG ) took evidence from Miss PERSON in the presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer for TIME . In the course of that interview , the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked PERSON numerous questions .", "In an indictment ( PERSON ) of CARDINAL DATE the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s department committed the applicant for trial before ORG ( Landgericht ) for acts of sexual abuse committed from DATE on his daughter , who was born in DATE . The indictment mentioned CARDINAL witnesses including an expert .", "On DATE ORG issued a warrant for the applicant \u2019s arrest ( PERSON ) on the same grounds and he was taken into custody in FAC that DATE .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE after a DATE trial ORG sentenced the applicant to eight years\u2019 imprisonment for CARDINAL counts of indecently assaulting a child ( sexueller PERSON Kind ) , CARDINAL counts of indecent assault on a child by a person having authority over her ( sexueller PERSON ) , and CARDINAL counts of having sexual relations within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity ( ORG ) .", "During the trial the ORG heard evidence from Miss PERSON , and the applicant \u2019s lawyer was allowed to cross - examine her .", "On DATE , on an appeal by the applicant , ORG ( ORG ) set aside the above judgment on the ground that proceedings had been time - barred in respect of some of the offences , which could not be regarded as continuing ones . It remitted the case to another criminal division of ORG .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office provided particulars and supporting evidence for each of the charges against the applicant . The indictments mentioned CARDINAL witnesses , CARDINAL of whom were psychologists and doctors cited as experts .", "On DATE the prosecuting authorities withdrew their indictment of CARDINAL DATE .", "In a decision of DATE ORG stated that the current proceedings related solely to the charges contained in the indictment of DATE .", "In a judgment of DATE , after a DATE trial , the fifteenth grand criminal chamber of ORG sentenced the applicant to seven years\u2019 imprisonment for CARDINAL counts of indecently assaulting a child combined with indecent assault on a child by a person having authority over her and having sexual relations within the prohibited degrees , CARDINAL counts of indecent assault on a child by a person having authority over her , CARDINAL of which involved sexual relations within the prohibited degrees , and CARDINAL counts of having sexual relations within the prohibited degrees , in accordance with Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "During the trial the ORG heard numerous witnesses and experts , including doctors and psychologists who had treated Miss PERSON , who had required constant psychotherapy , had had several spells in a private clinic and had twice attempted suicide .", "The ORG also heard the applicant and Miss PERSON , taking evidence from the latter for DATE during which the applicant was not present but his lawyer was , although the lawyer was not able to question her . When the applicant \u2019s lawyer and the applicant himself announced that they intended to ask Miss PERSON numerous questions , she stated that she was no longer in a fit state to be questioned owing to her poor state of health , as confirmed by a medical certificate . She relied on her right to refuse to give evidence ( PERSON ) under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( Strafprozessordnung \u2013 see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) .", "The applicant \u2019s lawyer then applied for ORG to order the discontinuance of the proceedings ( Einstellung des PERSON ) on the ground that his not being able to question Miss PERSON at the trial constituted a breach of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) and LAW and DATE ( d ) of the ORG . ORG rejected his application .", "In its judgment ORG described in detail the sexual abuse to which Miss PERSON had been repeatedly subjected by the applicant since DATE .", "The ORG then conducted a highly detailed analysis of the credibility of the evidence taken at the hearing , particularly the statements by the applicant and Miss PERSON Among other things , it thoroughly examined Miss PERSON \u2019s conduct and motives , noting the consistency of her statements , which were supported by a large body of evidence ; it also refuted the applicant \u2019s arguments that her therapists had had a harmful influence .", "ORG pointed out ( on p. CARDINAL of the judgment ) that on DATE Miss PERSON had been interviewed for TIME by the investigating judge at ORG . In the course of that interview she had had to answer numerous questions from the judge and the applicant \u2019s lawyer . The ORG noted what an ordeal it had been for Miss PERSON to describe in detail the abuse to which she had been subjected and how that had revived strong feelings of inner turmoil because she had had to relive the abuse again and again as she described it ( \u201c w\u00fchlten PERSON innerlich PERSON , MONEY wieder w\u00e4hrend der Schilderungen ihren GPE durchleben musste \u201d ) .", "The ORG emphasised once more how difficult it was for Miss PERSON to describe the traumatic events she had undergone and noted that \u201c every time , including the last occasion at the trial , it was only through a superhuman effort of will that she [ had been ] able to describe painful details and memories \u201d ( \u201c die f\u00fcr sie schmerzlichen Details and Erinnerungen vermochte sie stets , zuletzt in der GPE , PERSON gr\u00f6sster innerer PERSON mitzuteilen \u201d ) .", "ORG added :", "\u201c In the light of her psychosomatic illness , as described above , and the serious post - traumatic effects she has suffered , it is understandable that Miss PERSON was not in a state to relive the events of her abuse during the trial without being affected . During her evidence the court was able to observe just how very sensitive the witness still is DATE when she has to describe details of her sexual abuse , which she is still not in a position to do without suffering harm . This was particularly so when she had to give details about her own feelings during the sexual assaults by the defendant because at those points she was almost overwhelmed by the strength of the feelings of guilt and shame that she still experiences DATE . In that connection the ORG was not able to discern any of the artfulness or glibness attributed to her by the defence . \u201d", "( \u201c LOC ihrer oben geschilderten psychosomatischen FAC gravierenden PERSON wird auch erkl\u00e4rlich , dass QUANTITY letzlich nicht in der Lage war , in der ORG erneut ihre PERSON folgenlos zu durchleben . Die ORG vermochte anl\u00e4sslich ihrer Vernehmung einen Eindruck zu gewinnen , wie empfindsam die LOC reagiert , wenn sie PERSON \u00fcber den sexuellen Missbrauch schildern soll , wozu sie immer noch nicht ohne GPE in der PERSON ist . Als besonders gravierend stellte sich der ORG in sie dar , wenn sie Angaben zu eigenen ORG w\u00e4hrend der sexuellen ORG t\u00e4tigen sollte , da sie in diesen PERSON ihrer ORG , die sie wegen ihrer LOC , nahezu erdr\u00fcckt wurde . PERSON attestierte PERSON , vermochet die Kammer insoweit nicht zu erkennen \u201d ) .", "ORG held that the applicant had acted deliberately and that he was aware of his guilt because he had constantly attempted , by means of threats , to enjoin his daughter to say nothing .", "By way of extenuating circumstances , the ORG took account of the fact that the applicant had had no previous convictions , that he had worked hard in his job to provide for his family and that the criminal proceedings and his pre - trial detention had lasted a long time .", "As aggravating circumstances , on the other hand , the ORG had regard to the length and the nature of the abuse to which the applicant had subjected his daughter since DATE and the \u201c high intensity of each separate instance \u201d ( die hohe GPE der Einzelf\u00e4lle ) which had steadily increased over DATE . The ORG emphasised that the applicant had shamelessly ( in schamloser Weise ) and brutally ( grob ) exploited his daughter \u2019s natural desire for paternal affection and transformed these abuses into a commonplace event . He had degraded his daughter to the level of a sex object constantly at his disposal , thus inhibiting her normal sexual development . As regards the various offences , the ORG noted that the applicant had abused his daughter pitilessly and selfishly , forcing her into particularly humiliating sexual practices to keep her submissive while she tried in vain to escape from his hold over her through bulimia and vomiting crises . Despite his daughter \u2019s subsequent attempts to distance herself from him and live an independent life , he had continued to pursue her relentlessly and had even involved her in relations that he and his wife had had with a couple who engaged in partner - swapping .", "ORG decided on the length of the applicant \u2019s sentence in the light of all of the above circumstances and the serious traumas experienced by Miss PERSON for whom psychological assistance will remain essential for an indefinite period .", "On DATE , on appeal by the applicant , ORG varied the verdict , finding the applicant guilty of CARDINAL counts of indecently assaulting a child , CARDINAL counts of indecent assault on a child by a person having authority over her , including sexual relations within the prohibited degrees , and CARDINAL counts of having sexual relations within the prohibited degrees , but did not alter the length of the sentence . ORG also rejected the applicant \u2019s application for the proceedings to be discontinued for a procedural defect resulting from a breach of LAW , on the ground that , in the indictment of CARDINAL DATE , containing the charges on which the applicant stood trial , the prosecution had sufficiently substantiated the facts referred to in its indictment of CARDINAL DATE , and that the applicant \u2019s consent would only have been required if the prosecution had brought additional charges at his trial .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , sitting as a CARDINAL - member panel , decided to dismiss the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "The first sentence of LAW states that the president of the court must authorise the prosecution , the defendant and the defendant \u2019s lawyer to examine respectively the defendant , the witnesses and the experts .", "Under the second and third sentences of LAW , the court may hear witnesses in the absence of the defendant if there is a serious risk of grave detriment to the witness \u2019s health ( \u201c wenn die dringende Gefahr eines schwerwiegenden GPE f\u00fcr [ die ] Gesundheit [ des ORG ] besteht \u201d ) . As soon as the defendant is present at the hearing again , the president must inform the defendant of the main content of the evidence given in his absence ( \u201c von dem wesentlichen Inhalt dessen zu unterrichten , was w\u00e4hrend seiner GPE ausgesagt oder sonst verhandelt worden ist \u201d ) .", "LAW authorises the defendant \u2019s relations in the direct line , inter alios , to refuse to give evidence .", "The second sentence of LAW provides that persons who have waived their right to refuse to give evidence may change their mind while in the witness stand and exercise this right again .", "According to the established case - law of ORG , this restriction of the rights of the defence must be taken into account by the relevant court when assessing the evidence . Thus it should be considered , in particular , to what extent the witness \u2019s statements are corroborated or called into question by the other evidence and how significant they are ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
