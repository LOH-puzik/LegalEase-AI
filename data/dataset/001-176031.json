According to NORP law , service pensions are not related to social insurance contributions but are paid from the ORG budget to individuals because of their merits or for service to the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . State officials who are entitled to service pensions are also insured by the mandatory State social insurance scheme and are entitled to other types of welfare benefit , save in exceptional cases provided by law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

According to the law \u2019s preamble , the ORG budget deficit had been constantly increasing because of the economic crisis of that time and measures were needed to stabilise it ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . LAW set down rules for recalculating various welfare benefits , such as retirement pensions , disability benefits , maternity and paternity benefits , sickness benefits , unemployment benefits and service pensions , among others ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . An explanatory report appended to LAW stated that the economic crisis had led to numerous legal acts being amended in an attempt to stabilise the ORG budget deficit \u2013 civil ORG salaries had been reduced and there had been changes in tax law . However , further measures were considered necessary to address the crisis . The explanatory report referred to the work plan of the Government , which had set down the guidelines for addressing the economic slowdown in the face of the global financial crisis ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It also referred to several ORG rulings adopted in DATE , which had held that individuals entitled to certain welfare benefits had a legitimate expectation that they would continue to receive them ; however , in the face of an exceptional situation , when the ORG was unable to acquire sufficient funds to continue the payment of welfare benefits , they could be temporarily reduced to the extent necessary to ensure the protection of constitutional values and the balance between the interests of individuals and those of society .", "CARDINAL . NORP In line with LAW , service pensions were reduced by PERCENT , depending on their size , but the final amount after the recalculation could not be below LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG issued a ruling which examined the compliance , inter alia , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) with LAW . It reiterated that the ORG was justified in introducing temporary reductions in various welfare benefits when faced with an economic crisis , as long as those reductions respected the constitutional principles of the rule of law and non - discrimination , among others . ORG concluded that LAW was in compliance with LAW because it had provided that service pensions could not be reduced by PERCENT , which could not be considered as \u201c significant \u201d . The absence of a compensation mechanism for service pensions reduced in line with LAW had therefore not breached LAW ( see the relevant excerpts in paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The ruling was published in ORG and entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the different expiry dates for reductions in service pensions and other welfare benefits in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were compatible with the LAW in view of the \u201c different nature and character \u201d of service pensions compared with other benefits ( see the relevant excerpts in paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .
