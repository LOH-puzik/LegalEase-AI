They are all NORP nationals , represented by PERSON and PERSON PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The Soviet LAW of DATE ( \u201c the Act of DATE \u201d ) provided that NORP nationals who had suffered various forms of political persecution on the territory of the former GPE DATE and DATE , as well as their first - generation heirs , could claim compensation for non - pecuniary damage . In particular , LAW read as follows :", "\u201c A person who has been recognised as a victim of political repression on account of having been subjected to deprivation of liberty , resettlement , exile , forceful placement in a special place of residence or a psychiatric hospital , or who died as a result of such repression , or this victim \u2019s first - generation heir , shall receive monetary compensation , the amount and procedures for payment of which shall be established by law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Despite the general undertaking contained in section CARDINAL in fine of the LAW DATE , ORG did not enact legislation defining the amount and procedures for payment of the relevant compensation .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON and PERSON , the ORG found a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL on account of the respondent ORG \u2019s failure to undertake the necessary measures to ensure the effective exercise of the applicants\u2019 right to receive monetary compensation for non - pecuniary damage under section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE ( see PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , no . MONEY , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Applying LAW , the ORG stated that , since the finding of a violation under LAW No . CARDINAL concerned a large number of people and reflected a structural problem , it was urgent to undertake the necessary legislative , administrative and budgetary measures at the domestic level in order that victims of NORP political repression , who were targeted by LAW , could effectively benefit from the right to receive compensation under that section ( see PERSON and PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . Applying Article CARDINAL of the Convention , the ORG also held that if the necessary measures ( legislative and other ) were still lacking DATE after the date on which the judgment became final , the respondent ORG would have to pay each of the CARDINAL applicants , in accordance with LAW , MONEY ( ORG ) in respect of non - pecuniary damage ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As the necessary general measures were not implemented by the respondent ORG within the above - mentioned time - limit of DATE , each of the CARDINAL applicants in that case duly received ORG CARDINAL from the respondent ORG , as indicated by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . For the purposes of implementing the general measures indicated by ORG under LAW in its judgment of DATE , in DATE the ORG of GPE introduced draft amendments to LAW DATE and LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government submitted the above - mentioned draft amendments to ORG see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the amendments were adopted , with certain modifications , by ORG . They entered into force on DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the LAW of DATE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Thus , under the new LAW \u00a7 DATE of LAW , victims of NORP political repression or their first - generation heirs had until DATE to lodge applications with ORG for monetary compensation under LAW DATE . The new provisions of the LAW also provided for various additional procedures for the lodging of such applications , their examination by ORG and subsequent appellate proceedings before ORG , the latter acting as the final level of jurisdiction in such matters .", "CARDINAL . As to the amount(s ) of compensation payable under LAW of DATE , they were not fixed by any of the abovementioned legislative amendments . Instead , a new subsection ( CARDINAL ) was added to section CARDINAL of the Act , stating that the relevant domestic court had the competence to determine an appropriate amount of compensation in each case , having regard to the particular factual circumstances :", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL )", "\u201c The amount of compensation shall be determined by the court on the basis of the gravity of the form of coercion in question ... [ deprivation of liberty , resettlement , exile , forceful placement in a special place of residence or a psychiatric hospital or death ] , as well as the age and health of the repressed person or his / her first - generation heir , and other objective factors . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As confirmed by the official statistics issued by ORG on DATE , within DATE of the entry into force of the above - mentioned legislative amendments , CARDINAL applications for monetary compensation under LAW DATE were lodged with ORG , out of which CARDINAL cases were decided . The compensation awards in the cases examined varied from CARDINAL to CARDINAL NORP Laris ( ( GEL ) \u2013 EUR DATE and LAW respectively ) , the maximum amount having been awarded only to the first - generation heirs of victims of repression who had been executed by GPE .", "CARDINAL . All CARDINAL applicants ( see the appendix below ) are first - generation heirs of victims of NORP political repression . In DATE , after the entry into force of the LAW of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , they lodged applications with ORG for monetary compensation under LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Thus , the first applicant requested GEL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . She referred , amongst other circumstances , to her age ( she was DATE ) , poor state of health and , most importantly , to the fact that her father had been recognised , by a court decision of CARDINAL DATE , as a victim of NORP repression on account of his arbitrary conviction by a NORP military tribunal for proffering anti - NORP statements and his consequent execution by a firing squad in DATE .", "CARDINAL . As to the second , third and fourth applicants , who are siblings , they jointly requested GEL MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The applicants submitted that their father had been recognised as a victim of political repression in DATE on account of his arbitrary conviction in DATE by a NORP military tribunal for high treason ; their father had first been sentenced to DATE imprisonment but had been pardoned and released from detention in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG , in the context of CARDINAL separate and unrelated sets of proceedings , allowed the ORG claims in part . On CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld those decisions on appeal . The first applicant was granted compensation of GEL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) , whilst the second , third and fourth applicants were jointly awarded the sum of GEL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The reasons given by the domestic courts in their decisions were similar in both sets of proceedings . Thus , at first instance , ORG , taking into account the relevant domestic provisions as well as the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON and PERSON ( cited above ) , noted that the amount of compensation payable under section QUANTITY of the Act of DATE had not been fixed by law but , on the contrary , had been left to be determined by the relevant court on the basis of the particular circumstances of each individual case . On the other hand , since it was impossible to assess all the suffering , injustice and harm caused by the various drastic forms of NORP political repression , any such amount of compensation could only be , by its very nature , symbolic . No monetary compensation could ever serve as sufficient non - pecuniary relief . More important in this regard was the fact that ORG had acknowledged the historical injustice as such . The court added that the respondent ORG had fully complied with the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE by introducing legislative amendments aimed at filling \u201c the legislative vacuum \u201d which had been criticised by ORG .", "CARDINAL . As to the appellate proceedings , ORG , in reply to the applicants\u2019 argument that the domestic awards were derisory and disproportionate in comparison with the sums awarded by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON and PERSON ( cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , stated that the domestic courts retained a broad discretionary power to determine amounts of compensation . The appellate court pointed out that the ORG itself had acknowledged that the respondent ORG should remain free to choose , subject to supervision by ORG , the general and/or , if appropriate , individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by ORG ( ibid . \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ; the ORG had not indicated to the respondent ORG any specific amount of compensation to be paid under LAW of DATE . The appellate court also stated that , although the amount of compensation should not be less than the minimum wage in GPE ( some EUR CARDINAL ) , the ORG \u2019s budgetary capacities and the overall number of victims of NORP political repression ( CARDINAL of people ) should also be taken into account when determining the award .", "CARDINAL . For the purposes of further implementation of the general measures indicated by ORG in its judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON and PERSON ( cited above ) , a second wave of legislative measures was initiated by the respondent ORG on DATE . Notably , on the latter date ORG made a number of significant amendments to LAW DATE and LAW , which came into force on DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the Amendments of DATE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the amended section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act of DATE determined the range of compensation payable to victims of NORP political repression . Thus , the minimum amount payable under the law was fixed at GEL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) , whilst the maximum amount within the range was set at GEL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The provision further specified that the exact amount payable as compensation should be determined by a domestic court within the above - mentioned range in the light of the particular circumstances of each case , such as the gravity or the type of persecution in question , the age and health of the claimant \u2013 the victim of NORP political repression or of his or her first - generation heir DATE and other relevant factors .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in order to assist those victims of NORP political repression whose claims had already been decided under the preceding version of section ORG ) of the Act of DATE , the Amendments of CARDINAL DATE provided that the legislation would have retroactive effect . In particular , they stated that those victims of NORP political repression , or their first - generation heirs , who had already been awarded compensation by ORG in amounts falling below the minimum threshold set by the new section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( compare paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) were entitled to re - apply to a court for a fresh assessment of the particular circumstances of their case , determination of the amount of compensation payable under the amended section ORG ) and , if applicable , payment of the difference between the new amount thus determined and the previous award .", "CARDINAL . The LAW of DATE further re - worded LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to state that together with ORG , which maintained jurisdiction to hear claims from victims of NORP political repression or their first - generation heirs residing in the east of GPE , ORG was vested with jurisdiction to hear claims emanating from claimants residing in the west of the country .", "CARDINAL . During their CARDINAL meeting held on DATE , in the context of their supervision of the execution of the ORG judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON and PERSON ( cited above ) , ORG adopted a decision , which reads as follows :", "\u201c The Deputies ,", "CARDINAL . took note with satisfaction that the just satisfaction as well as the default interest due have been paid to the applicants ;", "CARDINAL . took note with interest of the preliminary action plan which has been submitted by the NORP authorities according to which a draft law has been prepared which will be submitted to the ORG in DATE ;", "CARDINAL . invited the NORP authorities to submit to them a consolidated action plan for their FAC meeting ( DATE ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
