AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses (domestic proceedings) - claim dismissed", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is the mother of CARDINAL children : T. , born on DATE , and A. , born on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( NORP ) at FAC ) , pursuant to LAW ) , took ORG provisionally into their care . It noted that on TIME , the applicant , who delivers newspapers , had come back late from work and her children had been at home without supervision for TIME . The applicant \u2019s neighbour , who had seen T. alone in the garden at TIME , had contacted ORG . ORG placed the children with a socio - pedagogical facility in GPE for an evaluation of their development .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested the formal transfer of the custody of the children to it before ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) . ORG , relying on LAW , claimed that the living conditions of the children were chaotic . It did not submit a formal statement of reasons , but promised to do so later .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , assisted by counsel , requested ORG to order ORG to return T. and A. to her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected ORG request and ordered that T. and A. be promptly returned to their mother \u2019s custody . ORG found that the removal of the children from their mother was unlawful , as ORG had failed to submit a formal statement of reasons giving arguments in support of the children \u2019s removal and the transfer of their custody . The court observed that , without such a statement , it could not take the evidence necessary to verify whether ORG request was well - founded . Consequently , the court was not in a position to decide on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appealed and refused to give ORG back to their mother . On DATE it supplemented its appeal arguing that the applicant was incapable of bringing up T. and A. It submitted that on the early morning of CARDINAL DATE the children had been at home alone . T. was wandering about in the garden alone at QUANTITY , wearing only pyjamas . In support of its arguments , ORG filed , inter alia , a fax of the PERSON rural police ( PERSON ) of DATE , certificates of CARDINAL DATE concerning the children \u2019s condition of health issued by a medical officer ( ORG ) , and the transcripts of the statements of the applicant \u2019s neighbour before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( PERSON ) quashed ORG decision and remitted the case back to ORG , instructing the latter to take a new decision after having supplemented its proceedings ( PERSON ) . ORG found that , taking the ex officio character of the custody proceedings ( GPE ) into account , it had been for ORG to investigate the facts sufficiently in order to reach a decision . In particular ORG should have been given the opportunity to correct its procedural mistake by submitting a formal statement of reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE socio - pedagogical centre ( Sozialp\u00e4dagogisches Zentrum ) submitted a report to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was heard with regard to the events of DATE . She submitted that on TIME , she had suffered from a migraine attack and therefore had been unable to return home in time . Normally she returned before her DATE son , PERSON , who also lived with her , left for work . That day she had unsuccessfully tried to contact a friend of hers to look after her children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard the father of T. and A. , who did not live with them . He was opposed to the transfer of custody to ORG as he considered that the applicant took care of the children satisfactorily . He himself was not in a position to take care of them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again dismissed ORG request for the transfer of custody but ordered the applicant to undergo family therapy together with her children and their father . It instructed ORG to ensure that the applicant complied with this condition . In refusing the transfer of custody , ORG relied , inter alia , on the public health officer \u2019s certificates according to which ORG had been in a good physical and psychological state , as well as T. , although the medical officer had also found a retardation in the latter \u2019s linguistic skills and striking deficiencies in his social behaviour . The applicant \u2019s approach to her children was positive in general . According to ORG , there existed no danger that the incident of DATE could recur , because CARDINAL persons , PERSON and PERSON , had accepted to look after PERSON and NORP in case the applicant should come home late from work .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that , under sections CARDINAL a and CARDINAL a of LAW , the right of custody may only be withdrawn if the child \u2019s well - being was endangered and if this was substantiated by compelling arguments . The court noted that the living conditions at the applicant \u2019s place were below average . Nevertheless the children \u2019s well - being was not in danger . The incident which led to the taking away of T. and A. was a unique one and the applicant cared sufficiently for her children , having regard both to their psychological and physical well - being . Moreover the applicant still breast - fed NORP The court concluded that the requested transfer of custody was not justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appealed . The ORG argued , inter alia , that PERSON , a former life - companion of the applicant , was unsuitable to look after the children and that PERSON had informed ORG that she had never promised the applicant to look after the children nor was she prepared to do so .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the appeal proceedings , ORG submitted further evidence , namely a report dated DATE with several annexes . Furthermore , ORG obtained several court files all concerning the applicant : CARDINAL file concerning custody proceedings relating to her son NORP , CARDINAL concerning criminal proceedings against GPE and the applicant for ill treatment of her son NORP , and CARDINAL concerning eviction proceedings against the applicant . This evidence was not communicated to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the appeal and transferred custody of the applicant \u2019s children to ORG , pursuant to section CARDINAL a of LAW . ORG found that the taking of evidence by the court of first instance had been incomplete . Since the courts had the obligation to safeguard the well - being of the children , it was necessary to decide not merely on the basis of the evidence which existed at first instance but to take into account all subsequent developments and , if necessary , to re - assess the evidence or to supplement the investigations .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the evidence meanwhile obtained , ORG found that the well - being of ORG would not be safeguarded if they were to stay with their mother . The children \u2019s living conditions were desolate and chaotic ; the applicant was apparently not willing to co - operate with ORG and she did not make any efforts to undergo therapy , together with the children , as had been ordered by ORG in its decision of DATE . Moreover , T. and A. no longer stayed with the applicant but with her \u201c ex - companion \u201d , as the applicant was due to be evicted from her apartment on DATE . As from CARDINAL DATE the applicant had rented a house in PERSON . According to information obtained from the owner , the house was extremely desolate and hardly fit for habitation . On a visit to PERSON by a staff member of ORG on DATE , the applicant had not permitted the official to enter her home on the grounds of desolate living conditions and the decrepit state of the building . She did not disclose the identity of the friend with whom she had placed the CARDINAL children T. and A. in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that the applicant \u2019s elder sons , NORP and PERSON , had been placed in a children \u2019s home from DATE as the applicant had not taken adequate care of them . After returning to the applicant , NORP had been subject to systematic and repeated abuse by GPE , the applicant \u2019s then companion , who had DATE beaten NORP and had treated him in a degrading manner . In DATE NORP had been committed to hospital because of injuries inflicted on him by ORG criminal proceedings against the applicant and GPE for abuse of minors had been instituted . In DATE ORG had been convicted of this offence and sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant had been acquitted . At the same time , custody of NORP had been transferred to ORG . He was no longer living with the applicant . In ORG view these events , even though the applicant had been acquitted of the criminal charges , showed that she was incapable of effectively caring for her children . Having regard to the abuse and suffering of NORP , it was implausible that she had not noticed anything .", "CARDINAL . ORG also considered that , having regard to the retardation in ORG development and the deficiencies in his social behaviour , there was no guarantee that either he or his brother PERSON would develop normally if they were to remain with their mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) rejected the applicant \u2019s extraordinary appeal on points of law ( au\u00dferordentlicher Revisionsrekurs ) on the ground that the case did not involve questions of law of fundamental importance .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) , the competent ORG shall apply for court orders regarding questions of custody which are necessary in order to ensure a child \u2019s well - being . In case of imminent danger , ORG shall also make the necessary provisional arrangements concerning care and custody until the competent court has decided .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL a of LAW , the competent court shall transfer custody to ORG , even against the wish of the parents , if the well - being of a child is at risk and it is necessary to remove the child from his or her habitual environment , unless the child can be placed with a relative or other qualified persons close to the child ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
