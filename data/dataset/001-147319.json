Trebec , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG Attorney .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the events at issue , the applicant company was acting as a forwarding agent and customs broker for import - export transit operations . In that capacity , it was liable for the payment of customs debts if they were incurred . In DATE , the company carried out a transit procedure for the importation of goods supposedly destined for GPE ; however , in reality the goods never reached their destination , but were placed on the NORP market . The operation formed part of a wider fraud involving CARDINAL customs official , GPE , and a number of other persons . Once the fraud had been detected , the customs debt incurred as a result of the fact that the goods had not left the national territory was imposed on the applicant company as the principal actor in the transit procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant company paid CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL NORP tolars ( SIT ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) and on DATE it paid SIT CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( approximately ORG MONEY ) . Although it was not disputed by the authorities that the applicant company was the victim of fraudulent activities by third parties , it could not relieve itself of that liability .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company challenged its liability for the payment of the debt . ORG dismissed its challenge , finding that although it was not the applicant company \u2019s fault that the goods in question had been unlawfully removed from customs supervision , as the principal actor it was nevertheless liable for the payment of the customs debt . Moreover , ORG noted that any unlawful activity on the part of customs officials bore no relation to the applicant company \u2019s duty to pay the debt . ORG subsequently dismissed an administrative action lodged by the applicant company . ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company , upholding the position of the lower instances that , by acting as the principal company in the transit procedure , the applicant company had assumed the risk of having to pay customs debt . ORG refused to accept the applicant company \u2019s constitutional complaint for consideration .", "CARDINAL . NORP In their submissions the Government noted that in DATE the applicant company had instituted commercial proceedings before ORG against GPE and GPE seeking compensation for the customs payment ( SIT CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , together with statutory default interest and costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The Government further explained that on CARDINAL DATE the ORG had found in favour of the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . GPE and GPE lodged an appeal . Thus , when the application was lodged before ORG on DATE , the proceedings were pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE , which then became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE lodged a motion for the protection of legality against the judgment of DATE with ORG , which did not accept to file a request for the protection of legality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE enforced the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and paid the applicant company ORG CARDINAL ( SIT CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In its application to the ORG the applicant company did not mention the commercial proceedings or the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which had been enforced . In its later submissions , it expressed its wish to maintain the application ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
