ORG , since he was never really around him because he was not allowed to see him . Moreover , the few times when they had actually met had been in the presence of the bailiff or of the staff at the child \u2019s school . His constant attempts to see ORG .

ORG had been psychologically traumatised by the separation from his brother , and that he was convinced that this separation had been caused by his father , who also wanted to separate him from his mother ; at the same time , in the process of enforcing his rights of contact with the bailiff \u2019s aid , the father had threatened the child that he would take him with the help of the police if he did not voluntarily come with him ; there was evidence in the file ( testimonial and expert psychologist opinions ) stating that ORG . ORG suffered from anxiety attacks , nightmares and nocturnal enuresis , on account of his fear of being separated from his mother , and owing to the perceived threat that he would be kidnapped . From that perspective , the judge considered that the child needed a more stable environment , and that he was developing well in the ambience created by his mother and his maternal grandparents .", "CARDINAL .
