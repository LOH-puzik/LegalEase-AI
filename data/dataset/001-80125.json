The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Riihim\u00e4ki .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was the Administrative Director and a deputy board member in a company initially called ORG , later ORG ( henceforward ORG ) . It bought , sold and rented out computers . It was declared bankrupt on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In ORG , the public prosecutor charged the applicant with inter alia debtor dishonesty on the grounds that he allegedly had participated , while the company was already in serious financial difficulty , in arranging for the company to be bought essentially with its own money by another company . It was alleged that the applicant put together this plan with CARDINAL other persons , NORP and PERSON , CARDINAL of whom owned the purchasing company , and that the purpose of the purchase , which made no commercial sense , was to divert money away from the debtors of ORG . The indictment concerning count CARDINAL read :", "\u201c On DATE ORG bank account contained MONEY [ ORG ] . Before , the balance was ORG CARDINAL . For the return sale and the onward sale of the information technology equipment and the leases mentioned in count CARDINAL , ORG IS ORG credited PERSON 's account with ORG .", "According to a mutual agreement between [ NORP , the applicant and PERSON ] , [ PERSON ] , on behalf of PERSON , immediately after ORG IS ORG had sold the worthless ORG shares for ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to PERSON , owned by [ PERSON ] , withdrew money from ORG bank account leaving ORG CARDINAL .", "The sale by ORG IS ORG of the ORG shares to PERSON was actually financed by funds belonging to ORG itself . [ PERSON ] , on behalf of ORG , lent ORG CARDINAL to the insolvent PERSON ... . Those moneys were used in order to pay for the ORG shares .", "The transfer in the bookkeeping accounts of the information technology equipment ... from ORG back to ORG IS PERSON was a condition for the purchase of the ORG shares . Accordingly , on DATE , by the joint measures of [ NORP , the applicant and PERSON ] , ORG CARDINAL was withdrawn to the detriment of ORG debtors leaving a balance in the account of ORG . Of that amount , ORG CARDINAL was withdrawn to the benefit of ORG IS ORG and the remaining over FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the benefit of [ PERSON ] . This took place in accordance with an agreement made by him , [ NORP ] and [ the applicant . ] There were no acceptable reasons for the withdrawals .", "The mutual understanding between [ the CARDINAL men ] had risen before and in connection with the purchase . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while convicting the applicant of CARDINAL counts of an accounting offence and sentencing him to a suspended term of DATE imprisonment , ORG rejected the charge of debtor dishonesty on count CARDINAL , on the grounds that it had not been shown that there had existed an agreed plan or that the applicant had been aware of the origin of the money used for the purchase . PERSON , who in the pre - trial investigation had testified that there had been such a plan , had retracted his statement in ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor appealed , charging the applicant again with debtor dishonesty . There was an oral hearing , in which however count no . CARDINAL was not addressed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of its own motion convicted the applicant of aiding and abetting debtor dishonesty and imposed on him a suspended term of a total of DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . It found that it was undisputed that NORP had been the chairman of ORG board of directors and the applicant a deputy board member , authorised to act on behalf of the company and the administrative director until DATE , when PERSON had become a board member . NORP who on behalf of ORG IS ORG signed the documents relating to the sale of the ICC / Cedro Oy shares was a board member in the first - mentioned company , of which the applicant was also a board member . It was further undisputed that PERSON stated in the pre - trial investigation that during the negotiations with the applicant it had become apparent to him that it would be his job to close down the companies in question . On DATE ORG IS ORG bought back the information technology equipment ( which it had sold earlier ) . As a result , ORG bank account contained a balance of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL on DATE . Following this , PERSON withdrew the said ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL from the account . Of that amount , PERSON borrowed ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL without surety . It never repaid the loan ( ORG judgment pages CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Contrary to ORG , ORG held that it had been clearly shown that the applicant , given his position in the company at the time of the offence under count CARDINAL , his training and experience , and the fact that he had taken an active part in the transactions , had known about the financial difficulties in DATE at the latest ( page CARDINAL ) . Further , it had been clearly shown , having regard to the pre - trial statements of NORP , PERSON and the applicant and other evidence , that the CARDINAL of them had planned the transaction together . However , the applicant did not , in ORG view , hold a significant enough position of power in ORG to be convicted as a principal offender . As he had furthered the act of NORP and PERSON , he was guilty of having aided and abetted that act .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal . On DATE it rejected his extraordinary appeal .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL , Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , of LAW , in force at the relevant time , provided that a person who , during or before the commission of an offence by someone else , intentionally furthers the act through advice , action or exhortation , shall be convicted of aiding and abetting the principal offence . The sentence imposed on the person who aids and abets shall be reduced to CARDINAL of the maximum penalty prescribed for the principal offence .", "CARDINAL . The present case was commenced and therefore also concluded under the then provisions on criminal procedure in LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) . The rule according to which an accused might not be convicted of an offence other than the one with which he or she had been charged was not included in the legislation until the coming into force on DATE of LAW ( laki oikeudenk\u00e4ynnist\u00e4 rikosasioissa , lagen om r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ng i brottm\u00e5l ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The rule was however established through case - law and it was codified upon the enactment of LAW .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW provides that the court may only pass a sentence for an act for which a punishment has been requested . The court is not bound by the heading or the reference to the applicable provision in the indictment . The court is however bound by the conduct described in the indictment . The prosecutor is under an obligation to define the alleged offence and the accused must be provided with an opportunity to defend himself or herself within the limits of the indictment .", "CARDINAL . Chapter DATE , Article CARDINAL , of LAW in force at the relevant time ( Act no . ORG ) required ORG to hold an oral hearing when it was needed . An oral hearing could be limited to only a part of the appeal . Article CARDINAL provided that ORG could not , on the basis of a reassessment of evidence , change ORG judgment in respect of a charge without holding an oral hearing unless the sentence was only a fine or the oral hearing was , particularly in view of the legal protection of the defendant , manifestly unnecessary .", "According to ORG precedent ( Year Book CARDINAL II CARDINAL ) on the application of LAW , LAW , ORG should not have altered ORG acquittal following a reassessment of the evidence without holding an oral hearing , as a hearing was not to be considered clearly unnecessary , having regard in particular to the fact that the defendant had contested the charge . ORG had imposed a term of imprisonment on the accused .", "CARDINAL . According to the terms of the reservation made by GPE in accordance with LAW , as in force at the relevant time , GPE could not guarantee a right to an oral hearing insofar as NORP laws at the time of the events in issue did not provide such a right . This applied , inter alia , to proceedings which were held before ORG .", "LAW , LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , of LAW reads in relevant part :", "\u201c Leave to appeal may be granted only if it is important to bring the case before ORG for a decision with regard to the application of the law in other , similar cases or because of the uniformity of legal practice ; if there is a special reason for this because of a procedural or other error that has been made in the case on the basis of which the judgment is to be reversed or annulled ; or if there is another important reason for granting leave to appeal . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
