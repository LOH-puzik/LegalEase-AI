SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr B. G\u00e4rde , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant obtained his medical licence in DATE and , since DATE , he has had his own private practice .", "On DATE ORG , unit for regional supervision ( PERSON , GPE tillsynsenheten \u2013 hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in GPE reported the applicant to ORG ( H\u00e4lso- och sjukv\u00e5rdens ansvarsn\u00e4mnd \u2013 hereafter \u201c the Board \u201d ) and requested that his medical licence should be revoked or , in the alternative , that he should be subjected to a disciplinary sanction . It claimed that the documentation of his contact with patients was incomplete and that he had written medical certificates on uncertain medical bases and without having carried out thorough examinations . It had examined CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s patient records and had found reason to criticise the procedure in CARDINAL of these . It therefore considered that he had not provided his patients with such professional and thorough care as was required by LAW p\u00e5 h\u00e4lso- och sjukv\u00e5rdens omr\u00e5de , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) .", "The applicant contested the revocation of his medical licence , as he did not consider that he had been negligent in the exercise of his profession . However , he recognised that there was cause to criticise his documentation of contact with patients . Thus , in this respect , he left it to the ORG to decide whether he should be given a disciplinary sanction .", "On DATE ORG decided to revoke the applicant \u2019s medical licence . It first noted that , on CARDINAL previous occasions in DATE , ORG had criticised the applicant \u2019s treatment methods as it had found that he did not follow recognised , conventional methods ( \u201c vetenskap och bepr\u00f6vad erfarenhet \u201d ) . As concerned the current CARDINAL cases where ORG had found cause for criticism , ORG considered them one at a time and found that each of them justified disciplinary sanctions . Moreover , in the ORG \u2019s view , the applicant \u2019s medical records of patients were very deficient and both the diagnoses and treatment of the patients had been made on the basis of insufficient examinations and tests . It further noted that in CARDINAL of the cases the applicant had repeatedly prescribed medication which was addictive ( sleeping pills ) to a man who clearly abused medication . Therefore , in conclusion , the ORG found that it was evident that the applicant \u2019s working methods were in sharp contrast to recognised , conventional methods and treatment within medicine and that his patient records were very deficient . Since he had shown such serious incompetence as a doctor , his medical licence had to be revoked .", "The ORG \u2019s decision was immediately enforceable . Thus , since the applicant was no longer authorised to work at his private practice , he appealed against the decision to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE and also requested that it should not be enforceable until the court had examined his case . As from this stage of the proceedings , the applicant was represented by legal counsel .", "On DATE ORG rejected the request . It considered that , on the basis of what had appeared from the case so far , there was no reason to stay the enforcement of the ORG \u2019s decision while the case was pending before it .", "The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , maintaining his request for interim measures . On DATE the court refused leave to appeal as did ORG ( ORG ) , on DATE , upon further appeal .", "As the applicant was deprived of his livelihood , he renewed his request for interim measures to retain his medical licence while the appeal was pending before ORG . On DATE the court rejected the request and , upon appeal , ORG and ORG refused leave to appeal on DATE and DATE , respectively .", "On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG repealed the ORG \u2019s decision to revoke the applicant \u2019s licence but gave him a formal warning . It found that he had shown serious flaws in performing his professional duties but that , when making an overall assessment , these flaws were not of such a serious nature that his medical licence should be revoked . However , these failings were neither excusable nor negligible , for which reason he should receive a disciplinary sanction in the form of a formal warning . Consequently , the applicant \u2019s medical licence was returned to him and he could take up his work at his private practice again .", "Both the applicant and ORG appealed against the judgment to ORG . The applicant requested that the formal warning should be removed whereas the ORG demanded that the ORG \u2019s decision be upheld and the applicant \u2019s medical licence be withdrawn .", "On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment in full .", "ORG and the applicant both appealed against the judgment to ORG , maintaining their respective claims .", "On DATE ORG repealed the lower courts\u2019 judgments and upheld the decision of the ORG to revoke the applicant \u2019s medical licence . It noted that he had made diagnoses without sufficient medical support and without considering other potential diagnoses . His treatments had not followed recognised , conventional methods and they had not been without risk for the patients . The court found that the lack of proper diagnoses and treatment had been systematic and deliberate and had remained unchanged despite previous criticism by ORG . It concluded that the applicant had shown such serious incompetence as a doctor that his medical licence had to be revoked .", "In the meantime , in DATE , the applicant , represented by the same legal counsel as before the administrative courts , sued ORG , through the Chancellor of Justice ( NORP ) , for compensation because of the immediate revocation of his medical licence by ORG . He alleged that it had caused him substantial losses not to be able to work for DATE and he claimed compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage as well as for his costs in the national proceedings , in total FAC ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . In his submissions , he claimed that the immediate revocation of his medical licence by ORG was in violation of LAW for several reasons , inter alia , that the ORG could not be considered an independent court and that , consequently , he had been deprived of access to a court before his licence was revoked . Moreover , the proceedings had not been fair , there had been no equality of arms and he had not been presumed innocent .", "The Chancellor of ORG contested the claim . He accepted that LAW was applicable to the case but considered that the Board did fulfil the requirement of an independent court . However , he submitted that , even if this was not the case , the immediate decision by ORG had not breached LAW . In his view , the proceedings before the national courts had been fair and impartial .", "On DATE ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . In so far as concerned the applicant \u2019s complaints relating to the Convention , the ORG made the following assessment . On the issue of whether or not the ORG could be considered an independent court , it noted that ORG was an impartial body , established by law , and whose work was regulated by law , inter alia , by parts of the Code on Judicial Procedure ( ORG ) and LAW ( ORG , CARDINAL ) . This ensured that the rule of law was adhered to . Moreover , its chairman had to be a permanent judge and the CARDINAL other members had to have special knowledge in medicine and health care . ORG concluded that the ORG could be considered an independent court which had had jurisdiction to decide to revoke the applicant \u2019s medical licence . The court also observed that the applicant had had his case reviewed by a further CARDINAL judicial instances , including for his request for interim measures . He had consequently had access to court . In this respect , the court noted that the provision allowing ORG to revoke immediately a medical licence was a protective measure to ensure the safety and health of patients . As concerned the fairness of the proceedings , the court treated each of the applicant \u2019s specific complaints but concluded that he had been afforded full equality of arms during the entire proceedings and that there were no indications of a violation of LAW . In relation to his complaint under LAW , the court pointed out that it only related to criminal proceedings and thus was not applicable in the instant case . The court furthermore considered whether the revocation had been proportional to the aim pursued , namely to protect patients from harm and ensure the safety of their health , and found that this had indeed been a proportional measure . Lastly , ORG examined whether the applicant could be granted compensation under LAW ( Skadest\u00e5ndslagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) but concluded that there were no grounds for such compensation .", "The applicant did not appeal against the judgment although he could have appealed to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) and further to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) . Both appellate courts required leave to appeal before considering a case on the merits .", "LAW deals with the civil liability of the ORG . According to LAW of that chapter , acts or omissions by a public authority may give rise to an entitlement to compensation in the event of fault of negligence .", "An individual who wants to claim compensation from the ORG may proceed in either of CARDINAL different ways : He or she may either petition the Chancellor of ORG in accordance with LAW on ORG against the State ( F\u00f6rordningen om handl\u00e4ggning av skadest\u00e5ndsanspr\u00e5k mot staten , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , or bring a civil action against the ORG before a district court , with the possibility to appeal to a court of appeal and ORG . No appeal lies against a decision of the Chancellor of ORG . However , if the claim is rejected , the claimant still has the possibility to institute civil proceedings before the courts . In such proceedings , the ORG is represented by the Chancellor of ORG ( LAW [ GPE med instruktion f\u00f6r NORP , DATE ] ) .", "In a judgment of DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) ORG dealt with a claim for damages brought by an individual against the NORP State , inter alia , on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW . The case concerned the excessive length of the criminal proceedings and ORG held that the plaintiff \u2019s right under LAW to have the criminal charges against him determined within a reasonable time had been violated . Based on this finding , and with reference , inter alia , to ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention and the ORG \u2019s case - law under these provisions , in particular the case of GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXI ) , ORG concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation under NORP law for both pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage . With respect to the level of compensation for non - pecuniary damage , ORG took note of the criteria established in the ORG \u2019s case - law stating that the ORG \u2019s practice constituted a natural point of departure in this regard .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the principle concerning a right to damages established in the above - mentioned case of DATE also applied with regard to the rights contained in LAW . ORG stated that the plaintiff \u2019s right to damages on account of a violation of Article CARDINAL should be assessed in the first place under LAW ( LAW no . CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) and LAW and Other Coercive Measures ( NORP om ers\u00e4ttning vid frihetsber\u00f6vanden och andra tv\u00e5ngs\u00e5tg\u00e4rder , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . To the extent necessary , the relevant provisions of domestic law should be interpreted in accordance with the LAW . If GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW could not be met by such an interpretation , the domestic courts should award compensation without the support of specific legal provisions . As concerned the determination of the level of compensation , ORG repeated that the ORG \u2019s case - law was a natural point of departure but also noted that account must be taken of the fact that different national conditions may lead to variations from CARDINAL country to another in what should be regarded as a reasonable level of compensation .", "In a judgment of DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to respect for their private life under LAW had been violated on the basis that a police decision on a medical examination of some of them had not been \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d . Having found that compensation for the violation could not be awarded directly on the basis of LAW , ORG held that there was no reason to limit the scope of application of the principle established in the above - mentioned cases of DATE and CARDINAL September CARDINAL to violations of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . In view of this and with reference to , inter alia , LAW and the ORG \u2019s case - law under these ORG , ORG concluded that the plaintiffs should be awarded non - pecuniary damage for the violation of LAW . With regard to the levels of compensation , ORG concluded that they should not be too far removed from the levels which applied when awarding damages under LAW . Generally speaking these levels should , however , be compatible with the case - law of the Court . In the same case , ORG had also concluded , in a judgment dated DATE , that there had been a violation of Article CARDINAL and that an award for non - pecuniary damage should be made on the basis of the principle established in the case of DATE .", "A further ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) concerned a claim for damages against the NORP State on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW relating to the suicide of the LAW father while in detention . ORG concluded that the case revealed no violation of LAW . However , in its reasoning leading to this conclusion , ORG noted , inter alia , that according to the ORG \u2019s case - law there was a right to an effective remedy under LAW connected to the ORG \u2019s duty under the ORG to take measures to protect the lives of individuals in custody or who were otherwise deprived of their liberty , which should , in principle , include a possibility of obtaining compensation for damage . ORG referred in particular to the judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL ) .", "In DATE the ORG decided to set up a working group on tort liability and the ORG to study the current legal situation . In DATE the working group submitted its report ( PERSON , ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) to the Government . In the report it is proposed that LAW be amended in order to allow natural and legal persons to obtain damages from the ORG or a municipality for violations of the LAW . Such an action against public authorities would be examined by a general court which would need first to establish that a right provided by the ORG has been violated . The aim of the proposal is to provide a legal basis for granting non - pecuniary damage arising from disregard of the LAW and to fulfil , together with the other already existing legal remedies , GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW .", "In his comments on the above report , the Chancellor of ORG , on DATE , stated that , since the autumn of DATE following ORG case - law developments ( as set out above ) , he had dealt with a large number of requests from individuals for compensation on the basis of violations of the Convention . He estimated that he had dealt with CARDINAL cases over DATE . During this time he had also represented the NORP State in a number of cases before the civil courts concerning alleged violations of the Convention . A majority of the cases that he had dealt with had concerned non - pecuniary damage for excessive length of proceedings under LAW . Since DATE , he had received CARDINAL such complaints and in CARDINAL of them , he had found a violation and granted compensation . The level of compensation for non - pecuniary damage had been determined with reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law and varied CARDINAL and SEK CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and LAW ) . Furthermore , the Chancellor of ORG had dealt with a substantial number of cases ( CARDINAL ) concerning the registration of individuals in the register of ORG . These cases had concerned one or more of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Convention . There had also been other individual cases relating to alleged violations of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , among others ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
