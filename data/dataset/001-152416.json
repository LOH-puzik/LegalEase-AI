The head of \u201c Cleanliness \u201d ORG refused to give consent on DATE . The mayor issued a decision on DATE in which he refused to provide the applicant with access to the information she sought . The mayor referred to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) of ORG , which at the time listed the absence of a third interested party \u2019s explicit written consent for the provision of information among the grounds for refusal to grant access to information .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought court proceedings against the decision of the mayor refusing access to the information . ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim on DATE , finding that the information sought did not affect the rights of \u201c Cleanliness \u201d ORG and therefore section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) was not applicable .

NORP The mayor sought the explicit consent to that effect of the head of the public utilities company concerned , \u201c Titan Sever \u201d OOD , considering once again that that was a statutory condition under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the head of \u201c ORG \u201d OOD refused to give consent .

The applicant brought court proceedings against the decision of the mayor refusing access to the information . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim and overturned the mayor \u2019s refusal to provide the information sought .
