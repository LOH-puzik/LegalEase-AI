CARDINAL/CARDINAL in order to identify the ORG terrorists who were the perpetrators of the murders . The investigation progressed very slowly , as the terrorists who had executed the applicant \u2019s husband were very mobile and often hid in neighbouring countries .

The Prosecutor and the doctor drew up a report in which they recorded that each of the CARDINAL men had been killed by a single gun shot to the head and that the bullets had exited the bodies . Rigor mortis had not yet set in at the time of the examination , and therefore it was estimated that the victims had been dead for TIME .

In DATE it was not the practice of the court to draw up a release document ; such a practice was not introduced until DATE . Personal belongings such as belts , money , watches , rings , etc . , were returned to the detainees before they were brought before the judge at the court building .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the witness went to the ORG building for unrelated business . After completing that business , and as he was about to leave CARDINAL or TIME , he saw PERSON and PERSON being brought into the court by CARDINAL or CARDINAL policemen . He and PERSON saw each other and exchanged looks in greeting . When the witness left the building he saw PERSON , the elder brother of PERSON , who was waiting outside the gate , and he told him that he had just seen his brother and GPE being taken into the court building .", "CARDINAL . Family members waiting for detainees were a familiar sight outside the ORG building . Family members would start waiting there for the release of their relatives as soon as they had been detained , because once a person was detained it was not possible to know when he or she would be released ; the maximum period of detention before a suspect had to be brought before a judge was DATE at that time .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE , PERSON telephoned the witness and told him that neither his brother nor PERSON had emerged from the court building . Mr Ay asked the witness if he had any information as to whether the CARDINAL detainees had been released or been taken back to the police station . The following morning the witness spoke to the Chief Public Prosecutor PERSON . Mr PERSON confirmed that the judge had ordered the release of the CARDINAL detainees . When informed that the CARDINAL detainees had never made it to the court \u2019s door , the Prosecutor told the witness that they had perhaps joined the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Registry office of ORG was located in the basement of the court building , next to the exit door used by police officers to bring detainees in and out . At DATE , officials working at the registry told the witness that PERSON and PERSON had been led away through that door . The witness did not convey this information to anyone else because he feared for the lives of the sources of this information .", "CARDINAL . This witness is also an advocate practising in ORG . He was acting for PERSON at the time of the events giving rise to the present application . When his client was taken into detention in DATE , the witness was not allowed to see him . This was because the legislation in force at the time prevented detainees , who were arrested for an offence falling within the jurisdiction of ORG , to have access to their lawyers . The witness would also not be informed as to when GPE would be brought before a judge , although he knew that this would happen within DATE , the maximum period of detention at the time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the witness was in the ORG building to represent a number of other clients at their trials . He did not come across PERSON in the building but was told at a later stage by a court official that GPE had been there on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The witness was informed on DATE that GPE had been brought before a judge who had ordered his release but he had not been seen leaving the building . The witness then went to speak to Chief Public Prosecutor PERSON . Mr PERSON told him that GPE had been released and that he had probably joined the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The witness was ORG of ORG at the time of the events . He remembered that PERSON was being investigated for membership of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . It was not the practice at the time of the events to draw up release documents . Sometimes a detainee , whose release was ordered by a prosecutor or judge , was escorted by police officers to a safe place and released from there . Otherwise a detainee was simply released outside the court building . In any event , detainees were not allowed to wander around freely inside the court building .", "CARDINAL . It would have been possible for him , as a Public Prosecutor , to find out the identities of the police officers who had accompanied PERSON to the court building on DATE . However , he could not remember whether or not he had done this and whether he had subsequently questioned these police officers . He thought that he might have done so . In any event , he would not have recorded the identities of these police officers or what they had said to him in a document , in order not to jeopardise the police ORG safety . Furthermore , the account of the police officers who had escorted PERSON to the court building would not have been important to the investigation .", "ORG . The opinions expressed in the document which he had drawn up on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been based on the investigations . They were not based on subjective opinion . The witness believed that PERSON and PERSON had been ORG members . PERSON was probably killed by ORG members because he had left the organisation . Perhaps he was killed because he had the same surname as ORG , who had also been killed in similar circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Neither the fact that the release of PERSON and his wife had been ordered by the judge for lack of evidence , nor the fact that neither GPE nor PERSON had ever been convicted of an offence involving the ORG , had a bearing on the NORP opinion that GPE and his wife were ORG members . The acquittal of PERSON on charges of aiding and abetting ORG members was the personal opinion of the trial court judge . That acquittal did not mean that she was not involved in ORG activities .", "CARDINAL . The witness denied having been approached by family members of the deceased men ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and he did not remember whether he had met with advocates Sezgin GPE and PERSON and discussed the disappearance of PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . His office would sometimes receive intelligence indicating that certain civil servants had been in contact with members of the ORG . In such circumstances , and when he was unable to obtain any evidence to indict such civil servants , he would ensure their transfer to other cities .", "CARDINAL . The witness still held the opinion that PERSON had been killed by members of the ORG so that a complaint could be lodged against GPE to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The witness was ORG of the town of Bismil at the time of the events . The bodies were found in an area under his jurisdiction and he participated in the examination of the bodies on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . He did not deem it necessary to carry out a full autopsy in order to establish the circumstances leading up to the killings ; the cause of death was established and that was sufficient . The way the killings had been carried out \u2013 in particular , the single gun shot to the head and the bodies being dumped at a roadside \u2013 led the witness to form the opinion that the perpetrators of the killings were members of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Prosecutors would investigate a killing regardless of whether or not there had been an official request by a relative of the deceased person . During his time in ORG there had been a significant number of killings in the area and each of these killings had been investigated by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . The witness is a Public Prosecutor and was appointed to ORG in DATE . From DATE he carried out the investigation into the killing of the applicant \u2019s husband and the other QUANTITY persons . He inherited CARDINAL similar cases from his predecessor .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a document which he signed on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the witness recorded that PERSON had been killed by members of the ORG . He explained that , in an investigation into a killing which had taken place in that area at that time , the starting point would be that the perpetrators were members of the ORG . Other possibilities would also be investigated if any evidence came to light which suggested otherwise . On DATE the witness decided that there was no evidence suggesting that the killings had been carried out by members of the ORG , and he sent the investigation file to the local prosecutor ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The witness was the chief of the anti - terrorist branch of ORG where the applicant , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and the others had been detained at the time of the events ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . When a person was detained , his or her personal belongings would be taken away from that person and he or she would be asked to sign a document to that effect . When the detainee is about to be brought before a judge , the belongings would be returned and the person would be asked to sign the same document . This was what had happened in the case of PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL police officers would have accompanied PERSON and PERSON to ORG on DATE . These police officers would not be the same as those who had questioned the detainees while in custody .", "CARDINAL . The witness had never been questioned by the authorities investigating the disappearance and the subsequent killing of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The witness is a police officer and was responsible for the detainees at ORG at the time of the events . He signed the document showing that personal belongings of PERSON were taken away and had then been returned to him ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . He did not remember who had accompanied PERSON and PERSON to ORG on DATE but it would be possible , by examining the documents at the place of detention , to determine the identities of these police officers .", "CARDINAL . The witness is a gendarme officer and was the deputy commander of ORG at the time of the events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in question a villager came to the station and explained that he had found CARDINAL bodies in the fields . He and his superior , together with a number of soldiers under their command , went to the scene , which was situated QUANTITY away from the station and QUANTITY from the main road . They checked the pulses of the CARDINAL men and established that they were dead .", "CARDINAL . When the witness reached the area where the bodies were found , he formed the opinion that it was the ORG who had killed the CARDINAL men , possibly because the ORG members had suspected that the CARDINAL men were working for the ORG authorities .", "CARDINAL . It would not have been possible to reach the spot where the bodies were buried by car ; only a tractor could have reached it . However , there were no tyre marks or foot prints near the scene . Similarly , there were no blood stains in the vicinity . The witness did not have any idea whether the CARDINAL men had been killed on the spot where their bodies were found . If the men had been shot there , the shooting would not have been heard from the station because it was too far away .", "CARDINAL . The only road to reach the site was the CARDINAL that ran between the town of PERSON and the city of GPE . This road was under constant surveillance by soldiers from his station . All vehicles and persons travelling on this road were searched .", "CARDINAL . His superior searched the bodies for any identification documents but , CARDINAL wedding rings , he did not find anything to identify the deceased men . They also asked for support teams , CARDINAL soldiers , to search the area for any evidence . None was found . They then informed the local prosecutor and handed the investigation over to him . His station continued to inform the investigating prosecutor DATE about any developments . He could not remember whether any inhabitants of villages in the vicinity had been questioned to establish whether they had seen or heard anything . If there had been any valuable information , it would have been mentioned .", "CARDINAL . The witness is a gendarme officer and was commander of ORG at the time of the events . The witness confirmed the sequence of events as described by his deputy PERSON above .", "CARDINAL . The witness was asked by ORG to establish whether the killings had political connotations ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He was not informed that the deceased men had disappeared after a judge had ordered their release . In the course of his investigation in DATE after the discovery of the bodies , the witness visited the scene where the bodies had been found and also spoke to the local people who might have been able to provide crucial information . The names of those he questioned were recorded in his DATE reports . He continued this investigation until he left his post later in DATE , but the investigation was continued by his successor .", "CARDINAL . The ropes used to tie the hands of the deceased men were cut from the bodies by the witness and the soldiers under his command and left at the scene . As , in the opinion of the witness , the ropes had no evidential value , he did not deem it crucial to take them and examine them . Similarly , there was no need to record in his report that he had asked for an additional CARDINAL soldiers to help search the site .", "CARDINAL . A car leaving ORG and going in the direction of the place where the bodies were found would have gone through CARDINAL check points ; CARDINAL was the check point just outside ORG and manned by police officers from ORG and the second was outside the ORG gendarme station , manned by the soldiers under his command .
