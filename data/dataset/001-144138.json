The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the father of CARDINAL children . His eldest daughter , born in DATE , is from a former relationship and lives with him . In DATE the applicant married his ( now ex-)wife , with whom he had CARDINAL more children , born in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his wife separated in DATE . The separation was pronounced by ORG of GPE ( Tribunal Civil de l\u2019Arrondissement de l\u2019Est Vaudois \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on DATE and the mother was given custody ( garde ) of the CARDINAL children , particularly in view of their young age ( the younger child was CARDINAL at the time of the decision ) . In turn , the applicant was granted extensive contact rights , which he had to exercise by agreement with his wife . He confirmed that since then his children usually stayed with him every DATE after school until TIME , and DATE , from DATE after school until TIME . Additionally , they spent CARDINAL of the school holidays \u2013 around DATE a year \u2013 with him . He calculated that that amounted to PERCENT of the time . His daughter from his former relationship resided with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed for divorce with ORG . After his wife \u2019s reply to the court on DATE , the couple submitted a joint petition for divorce on DATE . In addition , both parties applied for sole parental authority ( autorit\u00e9 parentale exclusive ) over and custody of the children .", "CARDINAL . In order to decide to whom parental authority should be awarded , ORG commissioned an expert opinion from the psychiatry and psychotherapy service for children and adolescents in the GPE of GPE . The expert \u2019s report , based on several interviews with the parents as well as with the children , was issued on DATE . It revealed that owing to major disagreements between their parents , both children were caught in conflicts of loyalty towards them , which they tried to resolve by wishing to divide their time equally between the parents . Furthermore , while the applicant wished for shared parental authority ( autorit\u00e9 parentale conjointe ) for the children , his wife opposed it . She justified her opposition by alleging that the applicant had attempted to pressure her and had made incessant requests regarding the children . She feared that he would use shared parental authority to increase his influence over the children in order to distance them from her . In this regard , she also mentioned that he had used inappropriate strategies to obtain custody of his eldest daughter , who was living with him , and had influenced the daughter negatively against her mother . However , the applicant \u2019s wife was largely in favour of the children maintaining contact with their father and supported his extensive contact rights . Regarding the applicant , the expert observed that while he acknowledged that he had regular contact with his children , he had also expressed the feeling that he was not accepted as the other parent and had been made to feel like a mere \u201c paying father \u201d . The expert also noted that the couple disagreed on many child - related issues , which had had a negative impact on the children . In view of the fact that the applicant \u2019s wife was a good mother and had shown her willingness to cooperate with the applicant , the expert recommended that parental authority be awarded to her and that the applicant be granted extensive contact rights . Furthermore , the youngest child had expressed the wish to stay close to his mother and the children were socially well integrated at their mother \u2019s place and at the local school .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contested the expert opinion and ORG therefore ordered a second one . On DATE the second expert , also specialised in child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy , confirmed the findings of the first expert . He based his findings on numerous documents received from ORG and the parents , as well as on various interviews conducted with all the family members . At the outset he observed that despite the fact that DATE had elapsed between the drawing up of the first and second expert reports , the applicant and his wife had maintained their conflict and had been unable to find any common ground for agreement regarding the children . Furthermore , they both had difficulties recognising each other \u2019s parenting abilities . Nevertheless , the expert acknowledged that both parents had good parenting skills and were able to create an adequate environment for their children . Owing to the ongoing tensions between them , however , the expert found that there was no common ground for shared parental authority and custody and that that would therefore not be in the best interests of the children , who were still caught in conflicts of loyalty towards their parents . The expert further recommended that the applicant should not be awarded sole parental authority over the children . In his view , the applicant still appeared to be very affected by the divorce proceedings . He had criticised the parenting skills of the children \u2019s mother on various occasions and had shown that he had difficulties in distinguishing his feelings towards her from those aroused by the separation from his children . Despite having exercised extensive contact rights with the full support of his wife , he still claimed that he sometimes felt like a mere \u201c paying parent \u201d . In that context , the expert also mentioned the inappropriate ways in which the applicant had obtained custody of his eldest daughter . The expert concluded that it was in the best interests of the children for the courts to award parental authority to the mother and to maintain the applicant \u2019s extensive contact rights . That solution would furthermore provide continuity for the children .", "CARDINAL . NORP Following that expert opinion , the applicant informed ORG by letter of DATE that he was withdrawing his application for parental authority and custody . At the subsequent hearing , ORG questioned various witnesses , who testified that the applicant was fully exercising his contact rights and was undertaking many activities with the children . They also stated that the GPE relationship had remained conflictual and that the applicant felt much more animosity towards his exwife than she did towards him . By a final judgment of DATE ORG pronounced the divorce of the parties and awarded parental authority over and custody of the children to the mother , while maintaining the applicant \u2019s previous extensive contact rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , the applicant lodged a \u201c partial appeal \u201d against ORG judgment with ORG of GPE ( le Tribunal Cantonal , chambre des recours , GPE - hereinafter \u201c the Appeal Court \u201d ) . He complained that the granting of parental authority to his ex - wife by ORG was not in accordance with ORG judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . He claimed that parental authority could not be withdrawn from a father who had , since the separation from his wife in DATE , extensively proved his parenting abilities . He reproached his ex - wife for behaving inappropriately towards the children in several respects and claimed that that was why he disagreed with the award of sole parental authority to her . Lastly , he stated that he no longer had the financial means to be represented by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ruling that under LAW of LAW ( hereinafter \u201c the Civil Code \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on divorce proceedings , parental authority could only be awarded to one of the parents . The maintenance of shared parental authority would require , under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , a joint request by both parents , and shared parenting could not be imposed on a parent who opposed it , such as the mother in the present case . ORG also found that despite the applicant \u2019s criticism of his ex - wife \u2019s parenting abilities , there were no grounds for changing the award of parental authority . Furthermore , such a solution would be contrary to the experts\u2019 findings . As provided for in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the judge \u2019s paramount consideration when deciding on parental authority was what was in the child \u2019s best interests . All relevant circumstances had to be taken into account , including any possible joint request by the parents for shared parental authority and , where possible , the children \u2019s views . In cases such as the present one , in which experts had recognised that both parents had good parenting abilities , a parent \u2019s willingness to cooperate with the other parent in the children \u2019s best interests was conclusive . As shown by the experts\u2019 opinions before ORG , it had been the mother in the present case who had shown fewer difficulties in cooperating with the father . ORG therefore upheld ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal to ORG , the applicant held that , owing to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and his wife \u2019s refusal to make a joint request , he had not been given the opportunity to apply to the domestic courts for shared parental authority . Referring to the case of PERSON ( cited above ) , he stated that every father should be able to apply to the domestic courts for shared parental authority , even if the mother was opposed to it , as that was in the children \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . It held that it was doubtful whether the applicant had sufficiently substantiated his appeal . Even assuming that he had done so , his case differed substantially from ORG ( cited above ) . First , while in PERSON the parents had not been married , in the present case the applicant was a divorced father . Second , NORP law not only provided that the applicant , like his ( ex-)wife , could apply for sole parental authority but both parents had also been treated equally . Unlike the NORP law regarding parents of children born out of wedlock , as established in ORG , LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) did not privilege one of the parents on the basis of his or her sex when awarding parental authority , and the mother had no right to veto the father \u2019s request in this regard . Under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the decision was based solely on the children \u2019s best interests . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s case could not be compared to ORG because there was no indication that he had been treated differently , when deciding on parental authority , from the children \u2019s mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted amendments to LAW provisions on parental authority , which will enter into force on CARDINAL July CARDINAL . Accordingly , shared parental authority will be the rule , independently of the GPE civil status . To continue with shared parental authority after divorce will hence no longer require a joint request by the parents . However , if the judge considers that it is in the child \u2019s best interests , parental authority can still be awarded to CARDINAL parent . The implementation provisions of this amendment to LAW further provide that in cases decided under ( former ) LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , where parental authority had been awarded to CARDINAL of the parents , the other parent or both together can apply to the child protection authority for shared parental authority . Moreover , the parent from whom parental authority had been withdrawn in the divorce proceedings may also apply to the court on his or her own motion if the divorce was finalised after DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
