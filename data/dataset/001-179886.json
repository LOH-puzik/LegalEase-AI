In DATE a large - scale criminal investigation was initiated against several persons for money laundering and fiscal fraud . On DATE the investigation was extended in respect of CARDINAL other persons , including the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Within the framework of the criminal investigation , on DATE several police officers carried out a search at the applicant \u2019s home . According to the search report , signed by the applicant and by her appointed lawyer without any objections , the search started at CARDINAL TIME and lasted until TIME", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately after the search and in accordance with the provisions of ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ( hereinafter RCCP , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , namely on the basis of an order to appear before the investigation body , the applicant was taken by police officers to the GPE police headquarters .", "CARDINAL . According to the record drawn up at the time , the enforcement of the order to appear was executed TIME and TIME , when the applicant arrived at the police station .", "CARDINAL . The order to appear had been issued by the prosecutor on DATE . It mentioned that", "\u201c In the interests of the investigation ongoing in the above - mentioned criminal file [ number ] concerning money laundering and fiscal fraud , the questioning of [ the applicant \u2019s name and identification data ] in her capacity of suspect is necessary .", "The criminal investigation bodies ( ... ) will bring the suspect to the police headquarters on DATE for the purpose of making a statement [ before the investigating authorities ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The documents on file show that TIME on DATE and TIME DATE , the investigating authorities , namely CARDINAL prosecutors and CARDINAL judicial police officers , conducted interviews in respect of CARDINAL witnesses and CARDINAL suspects and/or defendants in connection with the criminal investigation involving the applicant .", "CARDINAL . According to the register kept by the police to record third parties entering the police station on a DATE basis , the applicant \u2019s appointed lawyer , Mr R .- M.S. , entered the premises of the police headquarters at CARDINAL p.m. The applicant contended that up until that time , her lawyer had been prevented from joining her because he had not submitted a written mandate proving that he lawfully represented her ( see also paragraph CARDINAL in fine , below ) .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the file that during her stay in the police station , the applicant \u2019s phone conversations were tapped .", "CARDINAL . At an unspecified time before TIME , a prosecutor informed the applicant that she was a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation , and was to be charged with complicity in fiscal fraud ; the applicant was also informed of the rights and obligations she had in that capacity . When invited to give a statement , she refused , claiming that she was unwell and needed medical assistance .", "The TIME recording this interview do not mention the exact time of their drafting ; they are signed by the applicant , who confirmed having received a copy . Her lawyer does not appear to have been present .", "CARDINAL . The Government contended that the applicant \u2019s request for medical assistance had been part of her defence strategy , as proved , in their view , by the transcripts of a phone conversation she had had with a third party at CARDINAL p.m. , in which she was advised accordingly ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The same argument was backed , according to the Government , by the conclusions of the medical investigations , which attested to the fact that no urgent need for medical care had been identified in her case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . At TIME an ambulance was called to the police station . It arrived at TIME and provided medical care ( mainly intravenous infusion with minerals ) to the applicant until TIME , when she was taken to ORG . Accompanied by police officers , she arrived at the hospital at TIME , and was diagnosed with lipothymia . She remained in the hospital until TIME DATE and several medical examinations were performed during this time , following which vitamins , calcium and analgesics were administered . The diagnosis when the applicant left the hospital , accompanied by police officers , was neurovegetative dystonia and light hypokalemia .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that during the whole time she was in hospital she had been guarded by police officers , who had then escorted her back to the police headquarters .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant \u2019s questioning started . In the presence of her chosen lawyer , the applicant refused to give a statement on the grounds that she was very tired , having spent TIME in hospital . She also referred to the fact that neither she nor her lawyer had been given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the contents of the criminal case file in which she was a suspect .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , at TIME , the applicant was informed in the presence of her chosen lawyer that the prosecutor had decided to remand her in custody ( re\u0163inere ) for TIME .", "CARDINAL . Her lawyer lodged a complaint with the prosecutor against the decision to remand her in custody , as well as another complaint concerning her being unlawfully deprived of her liberty as of TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the first complaint , it is claimed that the order to appear became effective on DATE at TIME , and that the applicant was de facto remanded in custody as of TIME It is argued that the applicant \u2019s deprivation of liberty throughout that interval was unlawful and unjustified , aimed solely at obtaining statements from her under duress .", "CARDINAL . In the second complaint it is claimed that on DATE , as of CARDINAL p.m. when the search of her home ended , the applicant \u2019s liberty to move around was restricted , as proved by the fact that she had been accompanied by police officers not only to the police station but also to the hospital , where she had been taken under escort to obtain medical assistance . The applicant mentioned that her lawyer had not been allowed to accompany her or to assist her because he did not have a written mandate , even though the lack of such a document was objectively justified by the circumstances in which she had been taken to the police station .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor dismissed both complaints on DATE , holding that the measure to remand the applicant in custody was lawful , necessary and proportional to the gravity of the charge . He stated that the order to appear became effective after the house search had been performed , the presence of the applicant during the search being necessary in relation to its conduct and thus outside the limits of such an order . The prosecutor further considered that the time interval during which the applicant was under medical surveillance could not be included within TIME time - limit set out by LAW , as that was an incident excluding the responsibility of the investigating authorities . The limitation of her lawyer \u2019s access to the criminal file had been justified by the necessity to get to the truth and to obtain from the applicant a genuine statement , uninfluenced by those already given by the other suspects or witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , relying on testimonial , documentary and audio surveillance evidence , the prosecutor asked ORG to place the applicant in pre - trial detention ( arest preventiv ) for DATE as her release posed a threat to public order .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment delivered on DATE , ORG allowed the prosecutor \u2019s request and ordered the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . An appeal lodged against this was dismissed by ORG on DATE . Her pre - trial detention was extended for DATE by a decision of ORG issued on DATE , upheld on appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE after DATE of pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the proceedings on the merits are still pending .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that for DATE , she had been placed in a cell measuring QUANTITY , which she had shared with CARDINAL other detainees . She also complained about the poor conditions of hygiene , lack of ventilation and natural light . According to the applicant , the toilet was not separated from the living area by any partition , thus offering no privacy .", "CARDINAL . The Government provided information about the applicant \u2019s conditions of detention . They submitted that the applicant had been detained in a cell measuring QUANTITY , which she had occupied with CARDINAL or CARDINAL other detainees from CARDINAL to DATE . From DATE to the date of her release , the applicant had been placed in a room measuring CARDINAL sq m , along with CARDINAL others .", "CARDINAL . They stated that each cell had sanitary facilities such as a toilet and a shower , which were separated from the rest of the cell by a curtain . Both cells had access to natural and artificial light , as well as ventilation provided by a double - glazed window measuring QUANTITY ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
