BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , PERSON ( alias PERSON ) and Mr PERSON alias PERSON ) , have NORP and NORP nationality . They were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were born and lived in GPE until DATE , when the communist regime in GPE forced CARDINAL of ethnic NORP , among them the applicants , to emigrate .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before leaving , on DATE the applicants sold their CARDINAL - storey house in Dulovo to the local municipality . At the relevant time , a person willing to sell real estate could only do so through the intermediary of the local municipality . The price was fixed at MONEY ( \u201c BGL \u201d ) , in accordance with an evaluation made by an expert at the municipality . The applicants received that amount .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipality sold the house to CARDINAL individuals , PERSON and Mr N. The price was BGL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicants brought an action against the FAC municipality for a declaration that the DATE transaction between them was null and void as being contrary to the law or concluded in circumstances of urgent necessity and under obviously unfavourable terms .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicants brought another action against PERSON and Mr N. claiming that the contract of CARDINAL DATE between the FAC municipality as the seller and PERSON and Mr N. as the buyers was also null and void as being contrary to the law . On that basis the applicants asked the court to order the defendants to \u201c surrender the ownership and the possession \u201d over the disputed house . The proceedings in the above QUANTITY cases were joined on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment . It declared inadmissible , as having been submitted out of the relevant DATE statutory time - limit , the applicants ' claim that the DATE transaction had been concluded in circumstances of urgent necessity and under obviously unfavourable terms . It further rejected on the merits the applicants ' claims that the DATE and DATE transactions were null and void as being contrary to the law .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicants ' appeal , on DATE ORG upheld the lower court 's judgment . The applicants submitted a petition for review to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the lower courts ' judgments and declared with final effect the nullity of the DATE transaction between the applicants and the municipality . The transaction was null and void as it had been signed on behalf of the municipality by a person lacking the relevant power .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicants ' claim that the DATE transaction between the municipality and the third parties was also null and void , ORG found that the lower courts had not considered all relevant factors and referred this part of the case back to ORG . It also referred for renewed examination the applicants ' rei vindicatio claim , stating that it must be considered in the light of the outcome of the dispute about the validity of the DATE contract .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the renewed examination of the remainder of the case , the ORG found that the DATE contract was valid . It then went on to dismiss the applicants ' rei vindicatio claim stating :", "\u201c The binding directions given by ORG [ in its judgment of DATE ] appear to indicate that the outcome of the rei vindicatio claim depends on the outcome of the claim [ that the DATE contract was null and void ] . The latter claim must be dismissed as there are no defects in the DATE transaction . In this sense , the defendants PERSON and Mr N. are in possession of the disputed property on existing grounds . It follows that one of the conditions for a successful rei vindicatio \u2013 that the defendant holds the property without valid grounds \u2013 has not been established . As there exists a valid contract between the municipality and PERSON and Mr N. , it can not be considered that there is a lack of valid grounds . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted a petition for review ( cassation ) , claiming that they were entitled to recover the house from PERSON and Mr N.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the petition for review ( cassation ) , stating in the reasoning and operative parts of its judgment , that ORG conclusions had been correct . In the introductory part of its judgment , restating the procedure in the case , ORG mentioned that ORG had decided that the DATE contract was valid and \u201c PERSON and Mr N. were the owners of the property \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants sent complaints to the municipal authorities in Dulovo and other institutions . In reply , on DATE the mayor of PERSON advised them that following ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE declaring null and void the DATE contract , the applicants were considered its owners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought a fresh rei vindicatio action against PERSON , Mr N. and the FAC municipality , stating that they based their new action on grounds different from those raised in the previous proceedings . In particular , they did not claim that the DATE contract between the municipality and PERSON and Mr N. was null and void but that it had never had any effect in rem since , in accordance with the basic principles of property law , ownership could only be acquired by dealing with the owner . Since the DATE contract had been null and void ab initio , the FAC municipality had never become the owner of the disputed house and thus could not validly transfer the title thereto . The applicants stressed that the courts in the first proceedings had not dealt with this ground for restitution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the proceedings on the basis that the dispute was a res judicata . It referred in particular to the judgment of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed , stating that the previous proceedings had been limited to the issue whether or not the DATE transaction had been null and void . The courts had never dealt with the question who was the owner of the disputed property . Any other interpretation of the judgments in the previous proceedings was absurd , as it would run contrary to the basic principles of property law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal in private . The applicants ' ensuing appeal to ORG was also dismissed in private , on DATE . ORG stated :", "\u201c The parties to the [ previous ] proceedings and the current proceedings are the same ... The dispute [ in the previous proceedings ] concerned the ownership of the [ same house ] ... The grounds invoked were the nullity of the DATE transaction between the applicants and the municipality and , on that basis , the [ alleged ] nullity of the subsequent transaction [ of DATE ] between the municipality and [ PERSON and Mr N. ] .", "All matters have been decided and are res judicata ... \u201c", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicants requested the interpretation of ORG judgment on DATE , stating that it was unclear . In their submissions , they averred that the courts had delivered arbitrary decisions , bringing about an absurd situation . In particular , the applicants criticised the courts ' failure to explain on the basis of the relevant principles of property law who was the owner of the property and why .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the request . In the introductory part , the impugned judgment of DATE was described as having recognised that PERSON and Mr N. were the owners of the disputed house . ORG further stated that the judgment of DATE was clear in so far as it upheld ORG judgment of DATE . As regards the clarity of ORG judgment , it was not possible to engage in its interpretation as that would be tantamount to a re - examination of the case .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , as interpreted by the courts , a contract that is null and void as being contrary to the law is considered null and void ab initio . It is considered to have never produced any legal effect . Each party can seek from the other restitution of all it has given under the void contract .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW and the relevant judicial practice , a person who has bought a real estate from another does not become its owner if the seller 's title was not valid . In such cases , if the original owner seeks rei vindicatio from the last buyer even after a chain of transactions , the validity of the last buyer 's contract is immaterial as it does not produce effects in rem . ORG has applied this practice in cases of CARDINAL or more consecutive transfers where the first transaction was found to have been null and void ab initio and , therefore , none of the subsequent buyers could acquire title to the property , even if their contracts were valid . In such cases , each consecutive transaction is retrospectively considered as a sale of a real estate belonging to a third person ( see judgment no . DATE of CARDINAL in case no . ORG of ORG ) . The last buyer may only become the owner of the property through acquisitive prescription ( usucapion ) on the basis of undisturbed possession of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Where the owner has successfully recovered the property from the last buyer , the latter can seek from \u201c his \u201d seller recovery of the price paid .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of LAW and the relevant case - law , the plaintiff in rei vindicatio proceedings must prove CARDINAL elements : CARDINAL ) the validity of his title and CARDINAL ) the fact that there are no legal grounds for the defendant to hold the property . Valid grounds to hold the property may be rights in rem such as ownership or a right to use the property , contractual rights such as tenancy or a right to withhold possession until the payment of a debt and other concrete rights .", "CARDINAL . Judgments of the civil courts are binding on the parties , their successors , the courts and all other ORG organs ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Final judgments preclude any re - examination of the same dispute between the same parties ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code ) . They are not conclusive , however , in respect of disputes on the same subject between different parties or between the same parties on a different subject matter .", "CARDINAL . The issue determined in a court 's findings on the merits is a res judicata . In order to establish the content of the issue determined , regard must be had to the scope of the dispute and , therefore , to the court 's reasoning . In addition , certain decisive findings on elements directly determinative of the disputed right or obligation may also be seen as res judicata ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL-I , PERSON , CARDINAL - CARDINAL-I , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG to GPE or to ORG in DATE May - September CARDINAL provides for the restitution , under certain conditions , of property sold or transferred otherwise during the forced exodus of ORG . The law only applies in respect of persons who settled back in GPE before DATE . It does not exclude the application of the general rules of civil law in all other cases ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
