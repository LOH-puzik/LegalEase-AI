SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant was convicted by ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of having harassed a woman with whom he previously had been living and of threatening her new partner . He was given a suspended sentence and a fine . The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) where a hearing was held on DATE . In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the lower court 's judgment in full . On DATE ORG ( ORG domstolen ) refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with the ORG ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in which he complained under several Articles of the LAW that the criminal trial against him had been flawed in various ways . In particular , he claimed that he had never been informed of the charges against him in LANGUAGE , although he had requested this during the preliminary investigation , that the courts had not presumed him innocent , that the trial had been unfair since ORG had refused leave to appeal and that he had been punished without law as the courts had taken into account the possible motives of the people involved . On DATE the application was declared inadmissible by a ORG as being manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the applicant complained to the Chancellor of Justice ( NORP ) that the tape recordings from the oral hearing before ORG had been destroyed . He submitted that he needed the tape recordings in order to complain to the ORG and that the destruction of the tapes hindered him from effectively exercising this right in accordance with LAW . Moreover , he claimed that the time - limit of DATE \u201c after the final hearing \u201d for destroying the records according to NORP law was too short and not in accordance with GPE 's obligations under LAW , which afforded individuals a period of DATE to complain to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In its reply dated DATE , the Chancellor of ORG first observed that the tape recordings from ORG hearing on DATE had been destroyed at some point in DATE and the applicant had requested a copy of the recordings in DATE . It then noted that , according to the Ordinance on Cases and Matters before ORG ( f\u00f6rordning [ CARDINAL:CARDINAL ] om m\u00e5l och \u00e4renden i allm\u00e4n domstol ; hereafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , a person who requested a copy of a tape recording from a hearing had the right to obtain it and it was possible to have the copy as soon as the protocol from the hearing had been finalised . However , the tape recordings had to be kept for DATE following judgment in the case or , if the judgment was appealed against , until final judgment or decision had been rendered . In the applicant 's case , the Chancellor of ORG observed that ORG had not destroyed the tape recordings until after ORG had refused leave to appeal . Consequently , it had acted in accordance with the law . The Chancellor further considered that DATE time - limit imposed under NORP law could not be considered insufficient for an individual to obtain a copy of the tape recording if he or she wanted to complain to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant wrote a second letter to the Chancellor of ORG on DATE in which he repeated that he considered the time - limit for the destruction of tape recordings to be in conflict with GPE 's obligations under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention . However , in a letter dated DATE , the Chancellor of ORG referred to its previous letter and clarified that it did not consider that the relevant NORP legislation was in violation of GPE 's obligations under the Convention .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , LAW ( LANGUAGE , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) accounts which are given as evidence at a hearing shall be recorded on tape or , if the accounts can be assumed to be of importance to the case , written down .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Ordinance stipulated that , if someone requested information on the contents of a tape recording which had been made in accordance with LAW , LAW , he or she should be given a copy of that recording , unless the court considered that there were special reasons to furnish the person with a transcript instead . When a transcript was made , its accuracy had to be attested and a copy of the transcript should be included in the case file .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , according to section CARDINAL of the GPE , a tape recording had to be kept for DATE after the court ruled in the case . However , if the decision or judgment was appealed against , the tape recordings had to be kept until the case had been adjudicated through a domestic judgment or decision which had gained legal force ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
