NORP The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practicing in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was charged with indecent acts committed on a fiveyear old girl , following a report made by her mother on DATE . On DATE the ORG acquitted him of all charges , finding that there had been no evidence that he had committed an offence . The court noted that the girl \u2019s mother had testified before it that she had had a dispute with the applicant on the morning in question and had filed the complaint against him in revenge , and not because he had in fact committed any offence . She had also coached her daughter on how to testify in order to incriminate the applicant . However , the court noted that both mother and daughter had later withdrawn their statements .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . The court noted the discrepancies between the statements made on DATE by the child and her mother and the subsequent change to their statements . It also noted that a psychiatric report on the girl had shown that she was prone to adult influence , while the testimony given by the girl to the investigating authority had ended after a teacher assisting the girl had noted her difficulty in formulating phrases and logically explaining her thoughts , which had made the continuation of the interview pointless . Statements made by CARDINAL witnesses during the investigation had confirmed the girl \u2019s tendency to be influenced by adults , but the prosecutor had not asked for their presence at the court hearing and they had therefore not been able to be questioned about their statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and ordered a rehearing of the case by ORG . The reason for the rehearing was that the lower court had failed to directly examine all the relevant evidence , such as hearing from the victim , her representative and other witnesses , but rather had simply relied on the documents in the case file .", "CARDINAL . The victim and her mother were summoned to the hearing at ORG on DATE , but they did not appear . In the meantime , on DATE , the mother sent a letter to the court stating that she fully supported her statements and those made by her child during the investigation . She did not ask for the case to be tried in her absence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of the crime with which he had been charged . The applicant was absent from the hearing , even though he had been summoned to attend it . He claims that he never received the summons . A court - appointed defence lawyer was present .", "CARDINAL . The court did not hear any witnesses , including the girl and her mother . After the applicant \u2019s conviction , the mother wrote to ORG stating that she had never received a summons for the hearing of DATE and that she withdrew her declaration of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant claimed that the letter of DATE had been written by someone else , because the mother could not write in LANGUAGE script , yet the letter had been written in LANGUAGE script . No expert report to verify whether she had written the letter was ordered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer appointed by the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . In his appeal , the lawyer drew the court \u2019s attention to the reason for which ORG had sent the case for a rehearing on DATE , namely the failure of ORG to directly examine all the evidence . However , that court had allowed the same irregularity to occur in convicting the applicant . He also submitted that the absence of the victim , the mother and other witnesses , as well as the applicant , from the court hearing of DATE had prevented the defence from properly challenging the prosecutor \u2019s evidence . The prosecutor had simply read out the statements made by various individuals during the investigation , and the court had ignored the statements made by the mother and daughter before the first - instance court rejecting their previously made statements . The lawyer questioned the authorship of the letter of DATE . He finally relied on LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment adopted by the lower court , finding that it had fully examined the case . The court referred to the same evidence as that examined by ORG on DATE . The parties had been summoned but had failed to appear . However , their absence from the hearing had not prevented the court from continuing to examine the case . Moreover , the mother had signed a declaration in LANGUAGE script on DATE , which proved that she could write in that script and thus could have been the author of the letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was conditionally released from prison , DATE and DATE before the expiry of his prison term .", "CARDINAL . After communication of the present application to the respondent Government , on DATE ORG asked ORG to reopen the proceedings in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted that request . It found that ORG and ORG in their judgments of DATE and DATE respectively had breached the applicant \u2019s rights guaranteed under LAW , as well as under domestic law , by failing to directly examine witnesses and evidence before overturning the first - instance court \u2019s judgment . Moreover , they had examined the case in the applicant \u2019s absence despite the absence of evidence that he had been properly summoned and all reasonable measures had been taken to ensure his presence in court , and had done so in the absence of a clear waiver of the applicant \u2019s right to be heard by the courts . Moreover , ORG had failed to follow the indications made by ORG in its decision of DATE , which had been aimed precisely at ensuring the observance of procedural rules and at preserving the rights of the accused to a fair trial . The court therefore annulled the judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE and ordered a rehearing of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty as charged . In reaching this conclusion , the court heard the applicant and his lawyer , the victim and her mother , as well as a teacher and has examined the psychiatric report made on the victim \u2019s intellectual development . In view of the expiry of the limitation period for the offence he had committed , the court did not impose any sanction on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By the final judgment of ORG adopted on DATE , the applicant \u2019s appeal was declared inadmissible due to his failure to lodge it within the statutory time - limit of DATE from the date of adoption of the lower court \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law has been set out in NORP v. GPE ( nos . CARDINAL and QUANTITY \u00a7 DATE and DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a series of its judgments , ORG awarded compensation to persons whose cases had been communicated to the respondent Government and in which the latter acknowledged a violation of Convention rights ( see NORP v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; DATE and Others v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; Grosu and Others v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; and GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . In adopting these judgments , ORG expressly relied on the LAW as the legal basis for awarding compensation . The ORG accepted that that the amounts awarded had been consistent with those it had made in similar cases in respect of GPE and thus struck those cases out of its list of cases ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
