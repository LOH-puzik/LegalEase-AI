The dispute before the ORG , having this CARDINAL - fold subject , could not arise until all its constituent elements had come into existence .

The ICJ therefore found that there was not , so far as the date of the birth of the dispute was concerned , any bar to its jurisdiction . Referring to the terms of LAW of the court 's jurisdiction , the ICJ noted that the LAW did not proceed on the principle of excluding from the acceptance any given dispute , but proceeded in a positive manner on the basis of indicating the disputes which were included within that acceptance . The ICJ found :", "\u201c .... By its terms , the jurisdiction of the ORG is accepted ' over all disputes arising after DATE , with regard to situations or facts subsequent to DATE .

ORG thus drew a distinction between the situations or facts which constitute the source of the rights claimed by CARDINAL of the Parties and the situations or facts which are the source of the dispute . Only the latter are to be taken into account for the purpose of applying the LAW accepting the jurisdiction of the ORG . \u201d", "The ICJ went on to find that :", "\u201c ... it was only in DATE that such a controversy arose and the dispute relates both to the existence of a right of passage to go into the enclaved territories and to GPE 's failure to comply with obligations which , according to GPE , were binding upon it in this connection . It was from all of this that the dispute referred to the ORG arose ; it is with regard to all of this that the dispute exists . This whole , whatever may have been the earlier origin of CARDINAL of its parts , came into existence only after CARDINAL DATE .

In DATE and DATE the NORP legislature enacted legislation preventing new investigations into the so - called \u201c dirty - war \u201d and providing an amnesty for members of the security forces for related crimes .

A continuing violation is to be interpreted as an affirmation , after the entry into force of LAW , by act or by clear implication , of previous violations by ORG . ORG took note of the authors ' arguments concerning , first , the failure of the authorities to conduct an inquiry into the death of PERSON ( which was public knowledge ) and to prosecute those responsible - allegations which are not in fact challenged by ORG . These constitute violations of their rights and of the obligations of GPE under the LAW . Secondly , it was clear that in order to remedy this situation , the authors initiated judicial proceedings on DATE , i.e. within the limits of the CARDINAL-year statute of limitations , and these proceedings continued after the LAW and LAW entered into force for GPE . Contrary to the arguments of ORG , the ORG considered that the proceedings were prolonged , not because of a procedural error on the part of the authors , but because of a conflict of competence between authorities . Consequently , insofar as , according to the information provided by the authors , the alleged violations resulting from the failure to conduct an inquiry and prosecute the guilty parties have affected them since the entry into force of the LAW and LAW because the proceedings have not concluded to date , ORG considered that this part of the communication was admissible ratione temporis . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

As regards alleged deficiencies in the domestic criminal investigations into the disappearances in this case , the PERSON found that the allegations concerned judicial proceedings and thus independent facts which had taken place after the recognition of the PERSON 's jurisdiction .
