The appeal court reiterated that overcrowding coupled with inadequate living and sanitary conditions in a detention facility could give rise to degrading treatment in breach of a detainee \u2019s personal rights . The court condemned the practice of maintaining high rates of occupancy in detention facilities throughout the country and stressed that the minimum standard of CARDINAL m\u00b2 per person was to be reduced only in exceptional circumstances and for a short period of time . On the other hand , ORG observed that in the light of ORG established case - law , a trial court did not have a duty to award compensation for every infringement of a personal right . One of the main criteria in assessing whether or not to award compensation for a breach of a personal right was the degree of fault on the part of a respondent party . The court held that in relation to overcrowding , no fault could be attributed to the management of a particular detention facility since the management were not in a position to refuse new admissions even when the average capacity of a detention facility had already been exceeded . Considering the large scale of the problem in the country and the fact that the competent authorities had not acted with a particular intent to humiliate the plaintiff or in bad faith , the appeal court found that awarding compensation for a breach of personal rights on account of overcrowding and poor conditions of detention would contradict the universal sense of justice . Ultimately , the case was dismissed .", "CARDINAL .

It was reiterated that an act or omission was not unlawful , even though it might breach personal rights , as long as it was based on a valid legal provision . The court further noted that the plaintiff had the burden of proving the infringement or the risk of infringement while the respondent had the burden of proving that his acts or omissions were not unlawful .

ORG expressed its view as follows :", "\u201c In the opinion of ORG , the text of the impugned LAW and its interpretation in practice make this provision incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW . Overcrowding in prisons , resulting from the implementation of the impugned provision , may lead to inhuman treatment of prisoners .

If combined with additional aggravating circumstances , it might even be considered as torture . In that connection the court noted that already the minimum statutory standard of CARDINAL m\u00b2 per person was CARDINAL of the lowest in LOC .", "ORG further stressed that the provision in question was meant to be applied only in particularly justified cases , for example the occurrence of an engineering or building disaster in prison . Such a provision should not leave any doubt as to the definition of those permissible circumstances , the minimum size of the cell and maximum time when the new standards would apply . It should also lay down clear principles on how many times a detainee could be placed in conditions below the standard requirements and the precise procedural rules to be followed in such cases . In this connection , the court made a following remark :", "\u201c ORG does not exclude , however , a possibility of placing convicted persons on a temporary basis in cells , in which the space per person would be below CARDINAL m\u00b2 ( [ derived from ] LAW ) . [ Such possibility could occur ] in genuinely exceptional circumstances ( for example , a sudden increase of crime rate and the number of judgments imposing a prison sentence ) .

[ The necessary ] regulations can not [ be dubious ] as to the exceptional character of the situation [ in question ] , the maximum time in which a detainee can be placed in a cell with reduced space , the possibility and eventual principles and procedure regulating multiple placements in such cells . \u201d", "The court further observed that , conversely , in practice LAW gave a wide discretion to prison governors to decide what constituted \u201c particularly justified circumstances \u201d and in consequence condoned the permanent state of overcrowding in detention facilities . It allowed for the placement of detainees in a cell where the area was below the statutory size for an indefinite period of time and it did not set a minimum permissible area .", "ORG , taking into consideration \u201c the permanent overcrowding of the NORP detention facilities \u201d , ruled that the unconstitutional LAW should lose its binding force within DATE from the date of the publication of the judgment . ORG justified the delayed entry into force of its judgment by the need to undertake a series of measures to reorganise the whole penitentiary system in GPE in order to , ultimately , eliminate the problem of overcrowding . It was also noted that , in parallel , a reform of criminal policy was desired with the aim of achieving a wider implementation of preventive measures other than deprivation of liberty . The court observed that an immediate entry into force of its judgment would only aggravate the already existing pathological situation where , because of the lack of cell space in NORP prisons , many convicted persons could not serve their prison sentences . At the time when the judgment was passed , the problem concerned CARDINAL persons . To this end the court made the following observation :", "\u201c ORG has decided , on the basis of LAW , to postpone the date on which the impugned LAW will lose its binding force , taking into consideration the factual situation of the NORP penitentiary system , namely the permanent overcrowding in prisons and the lack of places for serving a prison sentence .", "The [ above ] decision ( ... ) results , not even , from the need to amend legal provisions but from the necessity to undertake numerous actions of organisational nature , in order to eliminate overcrowding in prisons . What also seems to be desired is shifting penal policy in the direction of wider use of non - isolation [ preventive ] measures .", "An imminent loss of binding force of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW would deepen the already existing pathological situation , in which many convicted persons can not serve their [ prison ] sentences because of the lack of space in prisons . This problem concerns currently over CARDINAL convicted persons . Such status quo , in which final judgments of [ criminal ] courts are not enforced , leads to the weakening of the authority of the ORG . \u201d", "In addition , ORG under the principle of the so - called \u201c right of privilege \u201d ( przywilej korzy\u015bci ) ordered an individual measure , namely that with regard to the author of the constitutional complaint the judgment should enter into force immediately after its publication . The right of privilege is relied on by ORG in the event the proceedings instituted by an individual terminate with a judgment with a delayed entry into force . This principle aims at rewarding the individual who brought the first constitutional complaint concerning a particular matter for his or her proactive attitude .", "As regards the context of the case , all the ORG authorities involved in the proceedings before ORG , namely ORG , the ORG and the Speaker of the PERSON , acknowledged the existence of overcrowding in the NORP detention facilities . ORG , in his pleadings of DATE , submitted that the problem of overcrowding in NORP detention facilities had continually existed since DATE , arising from the flawed interpretation of the impugned provision by domestic courts and penitentiary authorities .

In a number of countries visited by the ORG , particularly in central and eastern LOC , inmate accommodation often consists of large capacity dormitories which contain all or most of the facilities used by prisoners on a DATE basis , such as sleeping and living areas as well as sanitary facilities . The ORG has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when , as is frequently the case , the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions ... Large - capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives ... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level ; further , in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions .", "CARDINAL . The ORG frequently encounters devices , such as metal shutters , slats , or plates fitted to cell windows , which deprive prisoners of access to natural light and prevent fresh air from entering the accommodation . They are a particularly common feature of establishments holding pre - trial prisoners . The ORG fully accepts that specific security measures designed to prevent the risk of collusion and/or criminal activities may well be required in respect of certain prisoners ...
