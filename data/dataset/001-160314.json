Following the expiry of the DATE free period , the service became subject to a fee ; and this without prior notification of the users . This was possible because , by registering on the website , the users accepted the terms and conditions stipulating that they could be changed unilaterally by the service provider . The opinion also noted that the service provider removed any obsolete advertisements and personal data from the websites only if any overdue charges were paid .

In their counterclaims before ORG , the applicants argued that they , as intermediary publishers under LAW no . CVIII of DATE , were not liable for the user comments .

On DATE ORG partially sustained the claim , holding that the plaintiff \u2019s right to good reputation had been infringed . As a preliminary remark , the court observed that consumer protection bodies had instituted various proceedings against the plaintiff company , since it had not informed its clients adequately about its business policies .", "The ORG found that the comments ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) were offensive , insulting and humiliating and went beyond the acceptable limits of freedom of expression . The court rejected the applicants\u2019 argument that they were only intermediaries and their sole obligation was to remove certain contents , in case of a complaint . It found that the comments constituted edited content , fell in the same category as ORG letters and the respondents were liable for enabling their publication , notwithstanding the fact that later on they had removed them .", "As regards the content of the opinion as such , the court found that it had contributed to an on - going social and professional debate on the questionable conduct of the real estate websites and did not exceed the acceptable level of criticism .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed . In their appeal the applicants argued that the plaintiff had not requested them to remove the offensive comments . Nonetheless , they had done so as soon as soon as they had been informed of the plaintiff \u2019s action . They also argued that ORG comments were to be distinguished from ORG letters , since these latter were only published on the basis of editorial decisions , whereas comments did not constitute edited content . They argued that , in respect of comments , they had only acted as service providers of information storage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld in essence the first - instance decision but amended its reasoning . It ordered each applicant to pay MONEY ( ORG ) as first - instance and ORG CARDINAL as second - instance procedural fee .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that \u2013 as opposed to ORG letters whose publication was dependent on editorial decisions DATE the comments , unedited , reflected the opinions of the sole commenters . Notwithstanding that , the owner of the website concerned was liable for them . According to the court \u2019s reasoning , Act no . CVIII of DATE , transposing Directive CARDINAL on ORG into NORP law , did not apply to the applicants\u2019 case since it only related to electronic services of commercial nature , in particular to purchases through the Internet . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , electronic commercial services were information society - related services whose purpose was the sale , purchase or exchange of a tangible and moveable property , which was not the situation in the ORG case . In any event , pursuant to its section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the scope of the LAW did not extend to expressions made by persons acting outside the sphere of economic or professional activities or public duties , even if uttered in connection with a purchase through the Internet . For ORG , the comments were private utterances which did not fall under Act no . CVIII of DATE on ORG . Thus , there was no reason to assess the meaning of the terms of \u2018 hosting service providers\u2019 and \u2018 intermediaries\u2019 under that LAW . Nonetheless , the comments attracted the applicability of LAW rules on personality rights , notably Article CARDINAL . Since the comments were injurious for the plaintiff , the applicants bore objective liability for their publication , irrespectively of the subsequent removal , which was only relevant for the assessment of any compensation .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a petition for review with the GPE . They argued that , in their interpretation of the relevant law , they were under no obligation to monitor or edit the comments uploaded by readers on their websites .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE upheld the previous judgments . It stressed that the applicants , by enabling readers to make comments on their websites , had assumed objective liability for any injurious or unlawful comments made by those readers . It rejected the applicants\u2019 argument that they were only intermediary providers which allowed them to escape any liability for the contents of comments , other than removing them if injurious to a third party . The PERSON held that the applicants were not intermediaries in terms of section CARDINAL(lc ) of Act no . CVIII and they could not invoke the limited liability of hosting service providers . It shared ORG view in finding that the comments were capable of harming the plaintiff \u2019s good reputation and that the applicants\u2019 liability consisted of their having allowed their publication .", "The PERSON imposed ORG CARDINAL on each applicant as review costs , including the costs of the plaintiff \u2019s legal representation .", "This decision was served on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants introduced a constitutional complaint on DATE , arguing in essence that the ORG rulings holding them responsible for the contents of the comments amounted to an unjustified restriction on their freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint admissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the constitutional complaint , ( decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . ( V.CARDINAL . ) AB ) . In the analysis of the proportionality of the interference , ORG explained the absence of unconstitutionality in the case as follows .", "\u201c [ CARDINAL ] In the case concerned by the PERSON \u2019s judgment , the operator of the webpage did not moderate the comments . The identities of those primarily responsible , unless figuring nominatively , are unknown ; and for that reason , the liability lies with the operator of the webpage .", "[ DATE ] In the present case , the aggrieved fundamental right is not the right to freedom of expression as such , but CARDINAL of its particular elements , the right to freedom of the press .", "[ CARDINAL ] It is without doubt that blogs and comments constitute expressions and as such attract the protection of LAW .", "[ CARDINAL ] The liability incumbent on the operator of the webpage obviously restricts freedom of the press \u2013 which includes , without doubt , communication on the Internet .", "[ CARDINAL ] The legislation pursues a constitutionally justified aim . It is also suitable for that purpose in that , without the liability of the operator of the webpage , the person concerned could hardly receive compensation for the grievance . However , the proportionality of the restriction is open to doubt from CARDINAL perspectives : is it proportionate to hold the operator of the webpage liable for the expression which proved to be unlawful ; and moreover , is the extent of the liability ( that is , the amount of compensation ) proportionate ?", "[ CARDINAL ] If the liability for the publication of comments is based on the very fact of the publication itself , it is not justified to distinguish between moderated and non - moderated comments in regard to the proportionality of the restriction on the fundamental right in question . ... ORG has already held that the liability of press organs \u2013 not of the author \u2013 as applied in order to protect personality rights is constitutional . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
