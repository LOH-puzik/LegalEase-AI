THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and , at the time of lodging the application , was detained in GPE police station . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "The applicant is an ethnic NORP from GPE , brought up in Vinkovci in the region of Eastern Slavonia which was at the time in GPE .", "In DATE , the applicant was beaten up by NORP police because of his NORP origin and was unable to walk for DATE .", "In DATE , the applicant joined ORG set up by NORP when it became clear that war was imminent .", "On DATE , GPE declared independence . Hostilities followed with GPE and the NORP minority living in GPE . In DATE , ORG , which included PERSON , were set up in GPE . After the conflicts escalated , the applicant joined a special forces unit called \u201c the ORG \u201d where he became commander of a unit with the rank of lieutenant . He participated in the heaviest battles of the war in GPE and GPE .", "In DATE , the applicant married . He claims that his wife was killed by NORP on DATE .", "In DATE , ORG entered the region of LOC where the applicant was based . In DATE , GPE and GPE signed ORG which sanctioned the setting up of an interim ORG in LOC before the transfer of the region to GPE on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant moved to GPE as he feared imprisonment by the NORP authorities because of his involvement with the ORG .", "In DATE , the applicant claims that his brother - in - law , PERSON , died following a beating by PERSON . The applicant \u2019s sister went to live in GPE .", "On DATE , the applicant left GPE as he had no legal status or rights there . He claimed asylum in GPE but this was refused .", "On DATE , the applicant entered GPE illegally and applied for asylum on DATE .", "By letter dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG rejected his claim on the basis that there was no longer any real risk in the applicant returning to GPE . He referred to the amnesty introduced in DATE for those who had participated in the DATE conflict and the recognition of the interests of ethnic NORP introduced in changes to LAW .", "On DATE , the Adjudicator heard , and granted , the applicant \u2019s appeal . She accepted that the applicant had never been involved in war crimes but that he was reasonably likely to be arrested on such charges if returned to GPE , particularly due to his position as commander of CARDINAL of the special units . There was a reasonable likelihood that he would face lengthy incarceration without receiving a fair trial on political motives . She also found that the level of discrimination that he would face as an ethnic NORP on a general level would cumulatively amount to persecution , which was either state - sponsored or in respect of which there was an insufficiency of protection by the ORG . The Secretary of ORG appealed to ORG .", "While the appeal was pending , ORG issued its decision in a case concerning claims of ethnic NORP who claimed that the general situation in GPE placed them at risk of persecution and severe discrimination . In its decision , ORG and others [ ORG ] DATE , issued on DATE , it concluded that \u201c unless the situation deteriorates to a significant extent or special circumstances can be shown in an individual case , no ethnic NORP should be able to establish a claim under either Convention \u201d .", "On DATE , ORG heard the applicant \u2019s appeal . In its decision of DATE , it relied on its findings in ORG about the general situation in GPE and found that the applicant \u2019s rank as a special unit officer , the death of his wife in DATE and his brother - in - law some time later did not amount to special circumstances .", "ORG refused leave to appeal to the applicants in the ORG case on DATE .", "In its decision issued on DATE in Secretary for ORG and GPE , ORG quashed the decision of the Adjudicator who had upheld the appeals against the refusal of asylum to ethnic NORP on the ground that they would face persecution in GPE . It also found that the applicants were not at risk of treatment contrary to Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL or DATE . Materials before it included reports from ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG and statements of CARDINAL experts ( PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ) .", "\u201c ... we turn to our assessment of the situation . The claimants recognise that unfair war crimes trials are of less significance in these cases ( with the exception of GPE ) and that there is no sufficient evidence to suggest that in general there is a real risk that returning NORP will face unfair war crimes trials . There must be some special factor to bring that concern into play . ... The essential complaints common to all are : -", "CARDINAL . Discriminatory loss of homes and livelihood .", "CARDINAL . Discriminatory denial of social and economic rights in the areas to which return is envisaged . No special efforts are being made to redress the wrongs suffered and help return to society .", "CARDINAL . Discriminatory denial of judicial assistance in reclaiming homes occupied by NORP .", "CARDINAL . Loss of stability and security because of the prospect of a marginalised and ostracised existence in a largely ethnically cleansed country . Only a small fraction of NORP who used to live in GPE now remain and the majority are the elderly who have returned to die in their homeland . ... \u201d", "It proceeded to examine the situation in GPE , noting that there had been considerable improvements since the end of the NORP regime in DATE , with the Government making real efforts to overcome the legacy of hatred and taking positive steps to remove the obstacles to the return of refugees and discrimination against ethnic minorities . It noted that concerns had remained that the good intentions of the central government were being frustrated by local officials and by incompetence of , or unwillingness to apply the laws in favour of NORP by , the judiciary . By DATE , in the OSCE status report , it was found that property repossession remained at the core of the return process . An action plan had been drawn up by the Government to return CARDINAL properties by DATE and steps were being taken to address the tenancy problems . The tribunal reviewed other sources and noted that real difficulties and discrimination undoubtedly faced returning NORP but that the Government was undoubtedly taking steps to improve the situation , for example undertaking to assist returnees in re - integration by providing basic assistance depending on DATE income for DATE . It noted that the ORG directly supported the Government \u2019s return programme and was satisfied that it would not be encouraging returns if persuaded that there would be persecution , or treatment , contrary to LAW .", "It noted as regarded war crimes prosecutions :", "\u201c War crimes prosecutions we can deal with relatively briefly having regard to the concession that unless there is a particular reason to believe an individual will be prosecuted or ( as in the case of PERSON ) has been prosecuted , they can not be relied on as a barrier to return . ... The PERSON and ORG closely monitor prosecutions and in particular if a returnee is arrested , the ORG will \u2018 very closely and thoroughly ORG the situation . It notes that \u2018 we found the trials have been very fair and correct in their ORG . The numbers do not suggest there are widespread prosecutions let alone an implementation of the lists to which we have been referred ... In DATE , we find OSCE noting:\u2013", "\u2018 ... a positive trend in ... decisions by County Prosecutors and judges to reject war crimes and genocide charges against groups of NORP due to the lack of evidence of individual crimes.\u2019", "Despite this , there remain some problems where trials in absentia have been held . PERSON is an example , he having been sentenced to DATE imprisonment on the basis of charges which ... can not properly be said to amount to conduct which can be reasonably regarded as constituting a war crime . He manned a barricade and was ... offensive and threatening in a racist manner to NORP . An accelerated procedure has been put into effect to ensure a reconsideration and if necessary retrial of anyone convicted in absentia . But there may be a remand in custody of usually CARDINAL or DATE while the matter is reconsidered . If it is clear that the case is too weak ... , release may be effected after DATE ... we find it impossible to say that there would be persecution or a breach of human rights if the question whether there should be a re - trial is investigated properly even if there may be a relatively short period of remand in custody while that is being done .", "The tribunal concluded :", "\u201c ... the material before us does not persuade us on the low standard required that there is a real risk that in general NORP if returned to GPE will suffer persecution or a breach of any LAW . We recognise that the situation is far from pleasant and the deprivation and misery that will be faced . That stems from the war and the destruction caused by it . But that by itself can not mean that surrogate protection is needed or that there will be a breach of human rights . We regard the steps taken by the NORP government , despite difficulties at local level and the obstacles that still undoubtedly exist , as sufficient to provide the necessary protection . ... Even though there is discrimination coupled with the difficulties particularly of housing , employment and convalidation to which we have referred , we are satisfied that the threshold of Article CARDINAL , in particular of degrading treatment , has not been crossed . Equally , although we recognise that the Article CARDINAL threshold is lower , we are not persuaded that it has been crossed . But even if it has , we are satisfied that removal is justified by proper control of immigration .", "... unless the situation deteriorates to a significant extent or special circumstances can be shown in an individual case , no ethnic NORP should be able to establish a claim under either Convention . \u201d", "In Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) on the Honouring of obligations and commitments by GPE , ORG on DATE adopted its recommendation closing the monitoring procedure concerning GPE . It welcomed the significant progress that GPE had made towards its commitments and obligations as a member state since its accession to ORG on DATE and in particular , since the parliamentary and presidential elections held at DATE .", "A post - monitoring dialogue with the NORP authorities has continued through ORG .", "Arrests of returnees on war crimes : DATE ( CARDINAL ) ; DATE ( CARDINAL ) ; DATE ( CARDINAL ) ; DATE ( CARDINAL ) .", "Suspects released : DATE ( CARDINAL ) ; DATE ( CARDINAL ) ; DATE ( CARDINAL ) ; DATE ( CARDINAL ) .", "Conviction on war crimes : DATE ( CARDINAL ) ; DATE ( CARDINAL ) ; DATE ( CARDINAL ) ; DATE ( CARDINAL ) .", "\u201c The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens ; however , although there were some improvements , serious problems remained . There were instances of arbitrary arrest and lengthy pre - trial detention . The ORG continued to arrest and charge persons for war crimes committed during the DATE conflicts in GPE and GPE . Domestic courts continued to adjudicate war crimes cases , taking steps to depoliticize cases against ethnic NORP and opening or reopening investigations of members of NORP military forces . However , ethnic NORP remained incarcerated after being convicted in non - transparent politicized trials in DATE . Reforms in the courts and ORG offices resulted in some improvements in the judiciary ; however , the courts convicted persons in mass trials and in absentia , particularly in LOC . The court continued to be subject to some political influence and suffered from bureaucratic inefficiency , insufficient funding and a severe backlog of cases . At times the Government infringed on privacy rights ; restitution of property to refugees ( mostly ethnic NORP ) returning to the country remained slow and problematic .", "... Ethnic minorities , particularly NORP and GPE , faced serious discrimination , including occasional violence . While some progress was made , ethnic tensions in the war - affected areas remained high , and abuses , including ethnically motivated harassment and assaults continued to occur ...", "a. Arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life", "There were no reports of arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life by the ORG or its agents . ...", "Domestic courts continued to adjudicate cases arising from the DATE conflicts in GPE and GPE . Courts opened and reopened several war crimes cases involving NORP forces , but despite their increased number , questions remained about the criminal justice system \u2019s ability to conduct fair and transparent trials in these complex and emotionally charged cases . Observers blamed inadequate training , shortcomings in the legal code , chronic witness intimidation , and an often hostile local public as hampering the war crimes process . ...", "During DATE , the Government took some steps to depoliticize cases against ethnic NORP . The LOC reported that at the DATE \u2019s end it was monitoring CARDINAL ongoing war crimes cases against ethnic NORP . In DATE ORG sentenced PERSON , an ethnic NORP accused of war crimes against civilians in PERSON in DATE , to DATE in prison . In a previous in absentia trial she had been given a maximum DATE sentence . The indictment included participation in the murder of CARDINAL civilians . International monitors considered it a fair trial .", "Courts continued the practice of convicting persons in mass trials . For example , in DATE mass trials in the \u2018 Tompojevci group\u2019 case resulted in absentia convictions on war crimes charges for CARDINAL defendants , and in DATE ORG confirmed CARDINAL of these convictions . ...", "d. Arbitrary Arrest , Detention or Exile", "The LAW prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention ; however , the Government did not always respect this right in practice . ...", "The Government granted amnesty under the DATE LAW ( which amnestied acts of rebellion by ethnic NORP ) to several individuals during the law , particularly returning ethnic NORP refugees . In DATE ORG directed local prosecutors to review old war crimes cases to determine whether sufficient evidence existed to proceed with the prosecution . Arrest of ethnic NORP for war crimes continued but decreased throughout DATE . During DATE , CARDINAL NORP and CARDINAL NORP were arrested on war crimes charges and CARDINAL NORP and CARDINAL NORP were released . In some cases of arrest on war crimes charges , the subject was released DATE after charges were dropped ; however , in other cases , the persons were detained for long periods . The inability of judges to issue written verdicts was the leading cause of detention beyond the legal DATE limit . ... Over DATE , several ethnic NORP defendants convicted in absentia or at nontransparent trials continued to be held in detention for extended periods while their appeals progressed slowly through the overburdened judicial system . ...", "Observers reported a decline in the practice of police summoning ethnic NORP to police stations for \u2018 voluntary informative GPE which amounted to brief , warrantless detentions intended to harass NORP citizens .", "e. Denial of Fair Public Trial", "Although the LAW provided for the right to a fair trial and a variety of due process rights in the courts , at times citizens were denied these rights . Excessive delays , particularly in civil trials , remained a problem . Courts tried and convicted persons in absentia for war crimes . Courts convicted persons in mass trials and in trials with weak supporting evidence , particularly in LOC . In DATE , mass trials in the \u2018 Tompojevci group\u2019 case resulted in the in absentia convictions of CARDINAL ethnic NORP ... In DATE ORG convicted and sentenced in absentia CARDINAL NORP in the \u2018 Branjina\u2019 case . In DATE and DATE the ORG continued in absentia trials against CARDINAL NORP in the \u2018 ORG I\u2019 and against CARDINAL NORP in a retrial in the \u2018 GPE case .", "Activities that should have qualified for amnesty under LAW ... were classified mistakenly and prosecuted as common crimes or war crimes , although this practice declined and was under review by ORG . For those who had previously exhausted their appeal procedures , there was no mechanism to review their cases .", "Nevertheless , the courts continued to adjudicate war crimes cases arising from the DATE conflicts in GPE and GPE , initiated investigations into several allegations involving NORP forces and took steps to depoliticize cases against ethnic NORP . For example , the chief ORG initiated a case - by - case review of war crimes cases and sought to limit sharply the use of in absentia proceedings . County prosecutors were under instructions not to initiate criminal proceedings or in absentia proceedings without consultation with ORG . ...", "At DATE , CARDINAL individuals remained incarcerated on war crimes or related charges based on politicized or nontransparent trials held under the previous regime . ...", "Section CARDINAL . ORG , Sex , ORG", "...", "ORG", "Ethnic minorities enjoy the same constitutional protections as other self - identified ethnic and religious groups ; however , in practice a pattern of open and sometimes severe discrimination continued against ethnic NORP in several areas , including in the administration of justice , employment , housing and freedom of movement . Ethnic NORP in war - affected regions continued to be subject to harassment , intimidation , and occasional violence . In DATE after extensive discussion with minority groups and political parties , ORG passed LAW ORG with broad political support . The ORG generally assessed the new law positively . The law assures minority representation in local government bodies , creates minority councils from the local to national level to advise elected officials on minority rights , promotes the use of minority languages and symbols , and provides for the election of CARDINAL minority representatives in the next ORG . ...", "Societal intimidation and violence against NORP continued in war - affected areas ... Weapons left over from the war , including firearms and explosives , were readily available and used in incidents of harassment during DATE . Incidents largely occurred in the areas of return in central GPE . In DATE NORP returnee PERSON was beaten to death in GPE near GPE ; contradictory police reports were published and no arrests were made . Also in DATE grenades were thrown into the yard of a house owned by a NORP family in the LOC area . Police responded appropriately and an investigation was ongoing . In DATE a returnee \u2019s house in the NORP area and a local school were burned . In PERSON a NORP returnee \u2019s shop was attacked after the screening of a war - related film in which the perpetrators allegedly recognised the owner as a former soldier . NORP in the village of PERSON reported continuous destruction of crops and LOC by a NORP settler ; despite repeated reports to the local police , no action was taken against the suspect . Ethnic NORP in the area received verbal death threats and CARDINAL family was pelted repeatedly by stones while working their fields ...", "An ongoing impediment to the return and reintegration of ethnic NORP refugees is the failure of the Government to recognize or \u2018 GPE their legal and administrative documents from the period of the DATE conflict . Implementation of the DATE convalidation law to allow the recognition of documents issued by the rebel NORP para - state was undermined by ORG instructions that seriously limited eligibility . While the law itself did not include a deadline for filing applications , a decree issued by the previous regime established an DATE deadline . Since CARDINAL of the CARDINAL NORP who have returned to GPE returned after DATE , the filing deadline effectively excludes most of those who otherwise would be beneficiaries . Even persons who filed before this deadline experienced arbitrary delays and obstructions . Without the recognition conferred by law , citizens ( almost exclusively ethnic NORP ) remained unable to resolve a wide range of problems including pensions , disability insurance , and ability to establish work experience . Most requests came from elderly persons and related to pension and employment histories from occupied territories during the conflict . ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
