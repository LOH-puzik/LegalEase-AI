De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the owner of a property named \u201c GPE \u201d at FAC , PERSON , GPE ( a QUANTITY house , with stairs allowing access to the second floor , each floor having CARDINAL main rooms and a smaller room , as well as a terrace ; and with further rooms on the roof ( hereinafter \u201c the property \u201d ) ) . Following the death of the applicant \u2019s uncle on DATE , the applicant and another CARDINAL heirs inherited his uncle \u2019s estate , including the property . By a deed of partition of DATE the property was assigned to the applicant as sole owner .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the property was requisitioned and allocated to ORG In DATE the applicant became aware that on an unspecified date PERSON had left the property and given the keys back to the authorities , and that the property had then become occupied by a certain ORG , who had no title to it ( since it had not been allocated to him by the authorities ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained to ORG , which , instead of condemning the illegal occupation , on DATE issued a new requisition order , assigning the property to C.C. Subsequently , ORG obtained a development permit to carry out alteration work to the property . The work was carried out without the consent of the applicant , as owner .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout DATE while the requisition order was in force , the applicant was meant to receive an annual rent of CARDINAL NORP Liras ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) from ORG . That amount was increased to LAW ( approximately LAW ) in DATE or thereabouts . However , ORG has not been paying the applicant since DATE , nor does it transpire that the rent has been deposited in court . According to the ORG , the applicant has never requested such payment from the authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant considered that those amounts were far below the rental value of the property .", "CARDINAL . After having written to ORG several times to no avail , on DATE the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings against ORG and the Attorney General . He requested the court to find that the requisition orders had breached his rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW . Consequently , he sought to annul the order , and requested the release of the property in his favour with free and vacant possession . He also sought an award of compensation for the occupation of the LOC , as well as any other relevant redress . In so far as relevant , paragraph CARDINAL of his application concerning the facts of the case reads as follows :", "\u201c In DATE , after the applicant had inherited the property , he discovered that a certain ORG had left the property ... \u201d .", "It then specified in paragraph CARDINAL that \u201c on CARDINAL DATE the same authority again requisitioned the same property by means of requisition order no . CARDINAL \u201d . In paragraph CARDINAL the applicant noted that his rights were being breached as a result of \u201c the requisition order mentioned above \u201d . Lastly , his first request to the court was to the effect that the court should \u201c declare the abovementioned requisition ... as being in breach ... \u201d and his second request read \u201c to annul all requisition order issued against the applicants \u201d ( tannulla l - ordni ta\u2019 rekwizzjoni kollha rilevanti ma\u0127rugin kontra tag\u0127hom ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , when giving evidence in court on DATE , the applicant mentioned the deed of partition of CARDINAL DATE . At the same time he acknowledged that he did not contest the requisition order issued in DATE ( no record of this has been provided ) .", "CARDINAL . Pending the outcome of the proceedings , the court appointed an expert to make a valuation of the property . According to a report of CARDINAL DATE the expert considered that the DATE rental value of the property on the market in DATE was ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , and that in DATE it was MTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . Its sale market value was estimated at FAC .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( FAC ) , in its constitutional jurisdiction , found in favour of the applicant . It held that although the measure was lawful and pursued a legitimate aim , the applicant had suffered a breach of his property rights on account of the lack of proportionality of the measure , in so far as it made the applicant bear a disproportionate burden , given the low amount of rent applicable compared to the market rental value of the property . It held , however , that the measure was not abusive in so far as ORG suffered from a physical disability and lived on social benefits . He thus required lodging compatible with his needs to avoid hardship and the property at issue was adequate for such purpose .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that the Attorney General should not have been summoned as a defendant in the case ( m\u2019huwiex le\u0121ittimu kontradittur ) . The applicant was therefore ordered to pay his own costs of the proceedings as well as those of the Attorney General ( in total approximately ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The court held that given that the violation had arisen solely from a lack of fair balance , it was not necessary to annul the requisition order and release the property . Referring to domestic case - law , it held :", "\u201c ... while this [ constitutional ] court has a wide latitude in giving any order it may consider relevant in order for it to safeguard ORG DATE LAW and human rights and fundamental freedoms as defined in the LAW , such latitude was not unlimited and was circumscribed by the judicial system of the country , which did not allow this court [ of constitutional jurisdiction ] to amend national laws , nor could it make mandatory an action which according to domestic law was discretionary , nor could it order ORG to pay rent or compensation of a higher value than that provided for by the relevant law . Compensation , if any , which may be paid by this court [ of constitutional jurisdiction ] is that for the violation found . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court awarded the applicant LAW . sic . ) ; for DATE had paid ORG MTL DATE and it was only recently ( sic . ) that the rent had been increased to MTL CARDINAL ; that the applicant had only received payment up until DATE ; that the rental value of the property on the market in DATE was ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , and in DATE it was ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) ; and lastly , that the requisition order had been issued in the public interest to procure accommodation for those in need , and thus the compensation payable could be less than the full market value .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining that the court had failed to annul the requisition order and return the property to him despite finding in his favour . He had thus remained a victim of the situation as the court had not given him an appropriate remedy for the violation . He also complained that the compensation was far too low and had not been determined in accordance with the applicable market value . He further argued that the Attorney General had been the correct defendant given that the amount of rent depended on the law , which in consequence was also an issue in the case . It does not transpire from the written pleadings that the applicant explicitly raised the issue of compensation in relation to DATE , during which he had already been an owner of the property .", "CARDINAL . ORG and the Attorney General also appealed . They agreed with the merits of the first - instance decision , but requested the court to reduce the award of compensation which had been awarded arbitrio boni viri and not on proper calculations , and this especially since the applicant had waited DATE before instituting proceedings .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG reduced the amount of compensation to LAW . It , too , considered that the applicant should be penalised for the delay ( of DATE since coming into possession of the property ) in instituting proceedings , as had been done in other domestic cases . It noted that , according to ORG case - law , ORG control over levels of rent may often cause significant reductions in the amount of rent chargeable ; in the circumstances of the present case it was therefore not appropriate to make awards in accordance with market values . It considered that the firstinstance court had been free to make an award equitably , and correct to make no award for the time prior to DATE , DATE when the applicant had become the owner of the property ( sic . ) and before which he had had no ties with it . ORG also refused to annul the order , given that it had been issued lawfully and had pursued a legitimate aim . It considered that in such circumstances it was not appropriate ( mhux indikat ) to release the property and to evict the tenant ( as also held in previous cases , namely PERSON vs Director of ORG , Constitutional Court judgment of CARDINAL DATE and PERSON Attorney General , ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) , nor could it impose a higher rent for the future , when such rent was not provided for by law ( as also held in PERSON , cited above ) . It reiterated that its role was limited to awarding compensation for the violation found . The same had also been held by ORG Compensation in cases of a constitutional nature was not equivalent to civil damage , which could be pursued before the courts of ordinary jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further confirmed that the proper defendant was solely ORG , and not the Attorney General , as the applicant was not contesting the constitutional validity of the law itself , but solely the requisition order issued in respect of his property . ORG upheld the first - instance court \u2019s order for the payment of costs and ordered the applicant to pay the costs of all the parties related to the appeal .", "CARDINAL . As a result of this judgment , the applicant had to pay his share of the costs of the proceedings as well as those of the Attorney General at first instance , and those of all the parties on appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
