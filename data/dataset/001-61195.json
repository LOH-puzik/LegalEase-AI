The applicant , born in DATE , is the father of the child PERSON , born out of wedlock on DATE . The applicant acknowledged paternity of M.", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the child \u2019s mother lived together at the time of the child \u2019s birth . They separated in DATE . The child \u2019s mother prohibited any contact between the applicant and the child . The applicant still met PERSON several times at school until such contact was no longer possible . Subsequently the child \u2019s mother married Mr PERSON , the father of her child A. , born in DATE , PERSON being the common family name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a decision granting him a right of access to his daughter . Having heard the persons concerned , ORG , in comments dated DATE , advised against a right of access . ORG submitted that PERSON had established a close relationship with Mr. PERSON , which would be adversely affected by contact between PERSON and her natural father . It also stated that PERSON , when heard in the absence of her mother , had indicated that she was not keen to see the applicant and was suffering as a result of his continuing efforts to obtain access .", "CARDINAL . On DATE M. , then DATE , was heard by a judge of ORG . She stated that the fact that the applicant was always standing at the fence of the schoolyard disturbed her and that she did not wish to visit the applicant even if access should be ordered by the court .", "CARDINAL . At a court hearing on DATE , the applicant and the child \u2019s mother declared that they would attempt to settle the question of a visiting arrangement with the assistance of ORG . On DATE ORG informed ORG that no agreement had been achieved and that PERSON had stated that she did not wish to see the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court ordered that a psychological expert opinion be prepared . On DATE , in CARDINAL - page submissions , the psychologist of ORG stated that , as contact between the applicant and PERSON had been disrupted for DATE , no diagnosis of their current relationship appeared possible . The psychologist considered that the views which the applicant and PERSON had expressed on the question of future contact were very different . PERSON was growing up in a family unit and , unlike the applicant , was not suffering from any deficits in that respect , and did not wish to have any personal contact with the applicant . He should give her the necessary time to take up contact of her own motion . The psychologist noted that she had arranged a meeting between the applicant and PERSON which , however , had been cancelled by PERSON \u2019s stepfather .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG judge heard the applicant and PERSON in the presence of the psychological expert .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted the comments filed by ORG on DATE as well as the GPE and the child \u2019s statements in court . ORG also had regard to the comments filed by ORG in DATE and to the statement submitted by the psychologist in DATE , both in the context of the first set of access proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant could not be granted access to the child . Referring to section DATE of LAW , the ORG observed that the mother , having sole custody , determined the father \u2019s access and the guardianship court could only decide to grant the father access if this was in the child \u2019s best interest . In this respect , the court found as follows :", "\u201c On the basis of its extensive investigations , and especially its conversations with [ M. ] in DATE and DATE , this court has decided that , in the present case , access by the father to his child is by no means in her best interest .", "At the age of DATE , [ M. ] is certainly able to make up her own mind and has clearly rejected the idea of establishing contact with her biological father . In the court \u2019s opinion , forcing her to see him against her will can not be justified , since this would seriously disturb her emotional and psychological balance . Such a decision would on no account be in her best interest .", "This court can not accept the [ applicant \u2019s ] sweeping statement that access is always in the child \u2019s interest . The extent to which this is true invariably depends on circumstances . In this case , the only justifiable decision is that set out in the operative part of the judgment .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the following grounds :", "\u201c The appeal is admissible under LAW , but is unfounded . ORG was right to refuse the applicant all access to [ M. ] , since this is not in the child \u2019s best interest ( sections DATE and DATE of LAW ) . This court also takes the view that ORG had no cause to permit exceptions for any specific area of life . It considers that the arguments advanced in the contested decision are correct . It regards it as important that the girl [ M. ] \u2013 who is , after all , DATE has stated clearly and for a long time that she wants no contact with her father . The applicant should accept this clearly expressed wish in his adolescent daughter \u2019s interest and also his own . Only if he ceased to exert pressure on her might it one day be possible for them to resume contact . The court would also point out that access to [ M. ] on the strength of a court order could hardly be enforced against the child \u2019s will . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
