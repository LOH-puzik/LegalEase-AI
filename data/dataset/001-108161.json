Eventually , on CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered her pre - trial detention in her absence , implicitly relying on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . It is not clear whether this act took place at a hearing ( t\u00e1rgyal\u00e1s ) or a session ( \u00fcl\u00e9s ) .

By decision no . DATE . ( III.CARDINAL . ) ORG , ORG deleted the phrase \u201c pre - trial detention ordered \u201d from the above provision . ORG reasoned in essence that the impugned provision , in its original form , constituted a basis for a disproportionate measure : the accused \u2019s mere non - attendance after the issuance of a bench warrant , caused by any reason , led to the assumption of wrongful omission on his / her side , entailing , without any further examination , the ordering of pre - trial detention . ORG went on to conclude as follows :", "\u201c [ T]he LAW ... prescribes as a statutory guarantee in the procedure with a view to deciding [ on pre - trial detention ] that the accused must be heard . To hear the accused is part of the [ constitutional ] requirement of due process which is relevant in every stage of the proceedings . There is no such constitutional interest or aim which would allow a limitation on the accused \u2019s [ constitutional ] right to be heard by a court , without a breach of the latter \u2019s right to a due process . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to further arguments challenging the constitutionality of the remainder of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ORG nevertheless upheld the provision in its part allowing for an arrest warrant to be issued , holding that such a measure was still within the boundaries of proportionality , as opposed to the ordering of pre - trial detention which is the most stringent coercive measure in this field . It argued that once the absconding or unavailable accused was arrested , the court would be in a position to examine the merits of those circumstances which might require the imposition of pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , from DATE and at the material time , section CARDINAL ) read as follows :", "\u201c If a bench warrant has been issued in the procedure due to the non - attendance of the accused , an arrest warrant shall be issued , provided that the offence in question is punishable with imprisonment . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
