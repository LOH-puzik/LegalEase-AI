He was represented before the ORG by Mr U. Jacobson , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Following the applicant \u2019s laryngectomy operation in DATE , at which his cancerous larynx was removed , ORG ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ; hereinafter \u201c the Office \u201d ) of GPE granted him disability benefits under LAW ( NORP om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) amounting to PERCENT of a basic amount geared to the price index ( basbelopp ) .", "On DATE the ORG reviewed the applicant \u2019s eligibility for disability benefits and decided that such payments should be discontinued as he had retired from work and no longer had needs or additional costs which entitled him to further benefits . The applicant requested the ORG to review its decision under LAW , section CARDINAL a of the DATE Act . Attaching a list of alleged additional costs , he claimed that the decision of DATE had been based on incomplete information .", "On DATE the ORG , having regard to the applicant \u2019s submissions , changed its earlier decision and granted the applicant disability benefits amounting to PERCENT of the basic amount . In an attached document , the ORG indicated which additional costs had been accepted and which ones had not . In regard to several items , it also stated summary reasons for its decision .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , requesting that the benefits be fixed at a higher percentage of the basic amount . In substance , he maintained what he had submitted to the ORG .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the appeal , subscribing to the reasons given by the ORG . The court did not hold an oral hearing , nor did the applicant request one .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , essentially maintaining his previous submissions on additional costs and complaining that the Office and ORG had failed to give reasons for their decisions . He completed his appeal on DATE , submitting further arguments in regard to his costs . At the end of that document , the following handwritten note had been added : \u201c P.S. Requesting an oral hearing . \u201d No reasons for the request were given .", "On DATE the appellate court rejected the request for an oral hearing . After having restated section CARDINAL of ORG ( ORG , ORG ; hereinafter \u201d the DATE LAW ; see further below ) , the court gave the following reasons :", "\u201c Having regard to the subject - matter at issue and the information that has come to hand in the case , [ the court ] finds that an oral hearing is unnecessary and rejects the request to that effect . ... [ The applicant ] is invited to state the further circumstances he wishes to invoke and submit his final written observations in the case within DATE after having been notified of this decision .", "The case can be determined notwithstanding a failure to submit such written observations . \u201d", "The applicant reiterated his request for an oral hearing on CARDINAL DATE stating that it was necessary in order to \u201c clarify circumstances relating to the subject - matter of importance to the outcome of the case \u201d .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and his renewed request for an oral hearing . It stated that it shared the conclusion reached by the lower instances that the applicant \u2019s needs and additional costs were not such that he was entitled to higher disability benefits than had already been granted .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) . He complained about the lack of oral hearings in the lower courts and asked ORG to hold one . In those respects , he claimed that the case had not been adequately investigated .", "By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the court informed the applicant that it normally did not hold oral hearings . He was given the opportunity to submit further observations in writing . He made such submissions on DATE repeating , in regard to the oral - hearing issue , that a hearing had been necessary in order clarify circumstances relating to the subject - matter of the case .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "According to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW , a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits , provided that , before reaching DATE , he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time - consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses . The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation . It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses .", "A decision by ORG under LAW may be appealed against to ORG and from there on to ORG and ORG . Appeals may be made against the ORG \u2019s ordinary decision or a decision upon review DATE , section CARDINAL a of LAW .", "The latter provision enables the ORG to change a decision it has previously taken in order to rectify certain obvious defects of that decision , provided that it has not already been reviewed by a court . Thus , the ORG must change its earlier decision if it contains a writing error , miscalculation or similar mistake or if it is incorrect due to it being based on obviously incorrect or incomplete information or an obviously incorrect application of the law or other similar reason . A decision is to be changed under this provision even if a request to that effect has not been made by the individual concerned .", "The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of LAW . Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The proceedings are in writing .", "An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "According to the preparatory documents to LAW , an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in CARDINAL situations in particular : firstly , when it is necessary to hear a witness , an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and , secondly , when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute . In the latter case , the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character . It was stressed , however , that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It was further stated , in respect of the third paragraph of section CARDINAL , that a party \u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration . However , such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter , as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case . Still , other circumstances may be of relevance , for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party \u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case . Nevertheless , if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case , there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing ( p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
