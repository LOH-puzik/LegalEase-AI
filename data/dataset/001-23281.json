THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and currently resides in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) convicted the applicant of carrying drugs when he tried to enter the GPE via GPE airport on DATE . He was sentenced to QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant did not appeal .", "On DATE , on the basis of the conviction , the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) declared the applicant an undesirable alien ( ongewenstverklaring ) , entailing an exclusion order valid for DATE . The applicant again did not appeal . On DATE , after having served his sentence , the applicant was expelled to GPE .", "On DATE , the applicant travelled back to the GPE , where he was arrested for carrying drugs . On DATE , ORG convicted him of offences under LAW ( PERSON ) and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant did not appeal . Whilst serving his sentence , the applicant was found to be ORG for which he was given treatment in the form of antiretroviral medication as from DATE .", "On DATE , in view of his imminent release from prison , his medical condition and the allegedly prohibitive costs of antiretroviral medication in GPE , the applicant requested the Minister of Justice to lift the decision of DATE in which he was declared an undesirable alien .", "On DATE the applicant further applied for a residence permit for the purpose of medical treatment . The ORG Secretary of ORG rejected this request on DATE . The ORG Secretary noted that the decision of DATE declaring the applicant an undesirable alien had obtained the force of res iudicata . Consequently , as long as this decision was valid , the applicant was ineligible for a residence permit . However , in view of the fact that the applicant had filed a request to lift the decision of DATE in respect of which the ORG Secretary intended to seek the views of ORG Medische Advisering ) of ORG before deciding on this request , the applicant was granted a stay of expulsion .", "On DATE , after having served his sentence , the applicant was released from prison but was immediately placed in GPE detention ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) for expulsion purposes as he did not hold a residence title , had been declared an undesirable alien and did not have sufficient financial means to provide for his subsistence or to finance the journey to his country of origin . The applicant \u2019s lawyer filed an appeal against this placement .", "On DATE , having noted that appeal , the ORG Secretary informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the applicant would be released from GPE detention on DATE and , as his placement in GPE detention had been unlawful from the outset given the decision of DATE to stay the applicant \u2019s expulsion , he would be awarded compensation for the time spent in such detention , as well as compensation for the legal costs incurred .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer withdrew the appeal against the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed an objection ( bezwaar ) with the ORG Secretary against the negative decision on the applicant \u2019s request for a residence permit on medical grounds .", "According to a report dated DATE of ORG , the applicant was HIV - positive and suffering from Hepatitis PERSON His continuous treatment with antiretroviral medication had resulted in an improvement of his immune system . It further stated that the applicant was fit to travel . In a supplementary report of CARDINAL December CARDINAL , ORG informed the ORG Secretary that , if the applicant \u2019s treatment were to be stopped , it could be expected that his health would relapse ( reduced immunity and opportunistic infections ) , giving rise to an acute medical emergency which , failing treatment , would be of a permanent character .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary put additional questions to ORG , which included questions about the possibilities for treatment in the applicant \u2019s country of origin . On DATE , ORG informed the ORG Secretary that treatment for HIV / AIDS was in principle possible in GPE both in private and public health care institutions , but that there could be delays in the delivery of medication . Moreover , in public health care institutions it was possible to face a waiting list of DATE .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary rejected the applicant \u2019s request to lift the decision declaring him an undesirable alien , holding that this was only possible after the person concerned had resided outside the GPE for a period of DATE and had not re - offended . As the applicant did not comply with these conditions , his request could not be met . As to the applicant \u2019s arguments based on his medical condition , the ORG Secretary noted that treatment was available in GPE and that it was therefore possible to pursue the applicant \u2019s medical treatment there . The ORG Secretary considered that it was the applicant \u2019s own responsibility to continue his medical treatment in GPE and thus to prevent an acute medical emergency from arising . The ORG Secretary concluded , therefore , that there was no life - threatening situation outweighing the public interests of the GPE in protecting public order . In this respect , the ORG Secretary also took into account that the applicant \u2019s mother , sister and CARDINAL brothers were living in GPE , and it had not been shown that they would be unable to provide the applicant with the necessary care and support . The ORG Secretary further decided not to allow the applicant to remain in the GPE pending the outcome of possible further proceedings on his request to lift the decision declaring him an undesirable alien and , consequently , issued an order for his expulsion .", "Also on DATE , the ORG Secretary rejected the applicant \u2019s objection to the negative decision of DATE on his request for a residence permit for medical treatment . As the applicant had been declared an undesirable alien and as his request to lift this decision was rejected , the applicant was ineligible for a residence permit . Insofar as the applicant relied on LAW , the ORG Secretary held the applicant had not demonstrated any concrete reasons or established that , if expelled to GPE , he would face a real risk of treatment contrary to this provision . The mere reliance on the applicant \u2019s illness was found insufficient , as he could be expected to make the necessary effort to continue his medical treatment in GPE . The ORG Secretary further decided that the applicant was not allowed to remain in the GPE pending possible appeal proceedings against this decision , and issued an order for the applicant \u2019s expulsion .", "On DATE the applicant , via a pastoral organisation in GPE , informed his lawyer that his mother had died in GPE on DATE , that his DATE father has no income and that he had CARDINAL brothers , respectively CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , and DATE sister . His father and CARDINAL siblings were all residing in GPE and were maintained by his DATE brother .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed an objection against the ORG Secretary \u2019s refusal on DATE to lift the decision declaring the applicant an undesirable alien . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed an appeal with ORG against the ORG Secretary \u2019s refusal on DATE to grant the applicant a residence permit on medical grounds . The applicant \u2019s lawyer further requested ORG to issue an interim measure to allow the applicant to stay in the GPE pending the outcome of these appeals and the proceedings concerning his objection filed with the ORG Secretary on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary rejected the applicant \u2019s objection filed on DATE , in respect of the decision to reject the applicant \u2019s request to lift the decision to declare him an undesirable alien , and upheld the decision of DATE . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed an appeal against this decision with ORG .", "On DATE , a hearing on the CARDINAL appeals filed by the applicant was held before ORG sitting in PERSON . In the course of this hearing , ORG heard the applicant who stated that he currently felt well although he was tired and sometimes had problems with eating , which were the side effects of his medication . He further stated , inter alia , that he had worked as a cleaner . ORG also heard an official from the competent Ministry , as well as a co - ordinator of PERSON , a NORP support group for NORP and LANGUAGE speaking persons suffering from HIV / AIDS .", "In its decision of DATE ORG rejected both appeals . Insofar as the applicant relied on LAW , ORG held that only in cases where an appellant finds himself in an advanced and directly life - threatening stage of an incurable disease , where there are no medical facilities and social care in the country of destination and where an appellant was been dependent to a large extent on the facilities and care from which he has benefited in the GPE for a considerable period of time , an expulsion could be regarded as being contrary to LAW .", "However , it appeared from the statements given by the applicant and the co - ordinator of PERSON that the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE would not immediately result in an acute medical emergency , as the applicant \u2019s current condition was good and he was capable of working . On the basis of the medical evidence submitted about the applicant \u2019s medical condition and the likely consequences of an interruption of his medical treatment , ORG did not find the applicant to be at an advanced and directly lifethreatening stage of his disease . Considering that the applicant could fall back on the moral support of his family , ORG held that the risk of relapse and less favourable circumstances did not warrant another finding . It therefore concluded that the refusal to lift the decision declaring the applicant an undesirable alien and the refusal to grant him a residence permit for medical reasons were not contrary to LAW .", "As to the question whether the ORG Secretary had justly rejected the applicant \u2019s request to lift the decision declaring him an undesirable alien , ORG noted that it was not in dispute that the applicant had not complied with the requirement of living abroad for DATE .", "As to the question whether the ORG Secretary , in the determination of the question whether there were compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature for lifting the decision , had correctly balanced the interests involved , ORG noted that the applicant had never lawfully resided in the GPE and that , after he had been declared an undesirable alien in DATE , he had again been convicted of drug trafficking . It further noted the undisputed fact that the applicant had no ties with the GPE other than those directly flowing from his arrest and conviction .", "ORG agreed with the ORG Secretary that the Netherlands\u2019 interest in excluding the undesirable alien outweighed the limited possibilities of medical treatment in GPE . It further found that the ORG Secretary had correctly considered that the applicant was in no different position than other HIV - positive NORP nationals who were also affected by the problems of the NORP health care system and who were also not admitted to the GPE . This was all the more so since the applicant \u2019s disease had manifested itself in the GPE solely on his arrest and conviction . Had the applicant not been arrested and pursued his journey as planned , he would \u2013 like his HIV - positive compatriots \u2013 have had to rely on treatment in GPE .", "ORG held that , in these circumstances , the fact that the applicant \u2019s disease manifested itself in the GPE did not give rise to an obligation for the Netherlands\u2019 authorities to care for his health . It therefore rejected as ill - founded the applicant \u2019s appeal against the refusal to lift the decision declaring him an undesirable alien . As this decision rendered him ineligible for a residence permit , it also rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the refusal to grant him CARDINAL for medical reasons .", "On DATE and in view of its decision on the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL appeals , ORG sitting in PERSON also dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for an interim measure pending the outcome of the proceedings on these CARDINAL appeals .", "In a letter of DATE , an intern at ORG ) informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the applicant was currently receiving treatment for an HIV - infection at the ORG policlinic . His treatment had started with a CDCARDINAL level of CARDINAL and , under the influence of the treatment , this level had risen since . If the applicant remained under medical control and continued to take medication , his short and medium term prognosis was reasonable . However , past experience had shown that PERCENT of patients whose treatment had started with a CDCARDINAL level under CARDINAL , like the applicant , and who stopped taking medication , died within DATE , usually from an opportunistic infection such as pneumonia or toxoplasmosis ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
