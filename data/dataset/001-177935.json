The applicant stated that on TIME DATE several police cars and an ambulance drove to the house and an officer asked her whether her son was keeping firearms . She replied that he was not , as far as she was aware . The applicant remained outside during the intervention and could not remember exactly how the events unfolded . She heard screaming , but was afraid to go inside . Sometime later she looked into the hallway and saw her son lying on the floor , surrounded by PERSON and the medical technicians . She asked them what was going on , and they replied that they were resuscitating her son . She noticed that he had vomited .", "CARDINAL . GPE and PERSON , police officers , stated that upon entering the house , PERSON , who appeared to be talking on the telephone , told the medical technicians that he would not go with them , and GPE and PERSON then warned him that they would use force if necessary . PERSON also tried to convince him to go with them without success and he then instructed the officers to handcuff him . PERSON and PERSON took him by the arms to lead him to the ambulance but he resisted strongly . Dog handler PERSON attempted to calm him down by ordering the police dog to jump at him but Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d did not react to the dog \u2019s attack . The officers struggled to wrestle him to the ground and eventually succeeded in pushing him to the ground on his back ; they then turned him onto his stomach , but he continued to resist forcefully .

After PERSON received the second dose of medication , GPE noticed a brown palm - sized pool of liquid under his head . Somebody mentioned that it was vomit and PERSON then asked if that was right . Dr GPE was on the telephone arranging for PERSON transport to the psychiatric hospital but upon hearing PERSON \u2019s question checked PERSON and said that the vomiting was due to exertion . PERSON confirmed that PERSON initially said that PERSON was okay and vomited from exertion but added that the doctor did not check PERSON pupils or pulse . Then CARDINAL of the medical technicians looked at Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d again and checked his pulse . He called out to the doctor , saying that something was not right as he was breathing irregularly . Officer PERSON then attempted to unlock the handcuffs , and managed to get the CARDINAL on his right hand off before the key broke . The medical staff started to resuscitate him . The whole incident , from the beginning of the police intervention until the beginning of the resuscitation procedure , only lasted TIME , five at the most .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , a police dog handler , confirmed that he had first joined the intervention by ordering the police dog , which was muzzled , to jump at Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d , who , however , made no attempt to shake the dog off or to withdraw from the attack . Therefore PERSON took the dog back to his car and then returned to the house , where officers PERSON and PERSON were not able to turn Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d onto his stomach . PERSON helped them by holding him in a rear chokehold and together they managed to turn him onto his stomach and handcuff him . As this was going on , one of the medical technicians injected medication into his buttocks . PERSON also confirmed his NORP accounts as to how the resuscitation of PERSON proceeded after it was discovered that he had vomited .", "CARDINAL . I.P. , a medical technician , stated that on his arrival , he first asked the applicant a few questions and then entered her house with his colleague PERSON According to both medical technicians , PERSON pretended to be speaking on the telephone . ORG explained to him that he was being taken to the psychiatric hospital to see a psychiatrist . PERSON refused to go and PERSON ordered him to be handcuffed . As regards the events that ensued concerning the use of force by the police officers , ORG \u2019s statement matched the statements of police officers GPE , PERSON and PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , while PERSON did not pay much attention to the police operation , as he was preparing a syringe of GPE .", "CARDINAL . As soon as the police officers managed to wrestle Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d to the ground and turn him onto his side , PERSON injected him with GPE . PERSON added that because Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d forcefully resisted , he could not administer the full dose of medication to him . He then left the house . While the police officers turned Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d onto his stomach , ORG administered the second injection into his buttocks and he calmed down . ORG then noticed that he was not breathing or was struggling to breathe . As far as he could remember , he called out that PERSON was not breathing . PERSON approached him and saw him take a breath , concluding that he was breathing . PERSON , standing outside , stated that he had not seen when and how PERSON had started to vomit , but heard the exchange between his colleague and PERSON The doctor then left the house and started to arrange PERSON transport to the hospital . GPE checked PERSON again and exclaimed that he was not breathing . Together with the police officers they turned PERSON \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d onto his back and GPE noticed that he was cyanotic . He also noticed traces of vomit on PERSON face , so he first protected his airways . The police officers had by then removed the handcuffs from him . His colleague PERSON , who confirmed that PERSON looked grey and had traces of vomit on his face , fetched the resuscitation kit from the ambulance . Together with PERSON they had intubated him ; however , even at the beginning of resuscitation , his pupils were dilated , which was also a bad sign . ORG also stated that the whole incident , from the use of physical force on Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d until the beginning of the resuscitation procedure , only lasted TIME , five at the most . ORG \u2019s account was confirmed in substance by traffic officer PERSON , who together with his colleague PERSON guarded the back entrance to the applicant \u2019s house and thus only heard part of the incident .", "CARDINAL . Medical technician PERSON expressed the view that the police officers might have used excessive force in dealing with PERSON . He added that though Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d had refused to go to the psychiatric hospital , he had not been particularly aggressive , and above all , had not physically attacked anyone .", "CARDINAL . Dr B.A. , a general practitioner , stated that PERSON psychiatrist expected that he might behave aggressively so he received instructions to give him an injection of CARDINAL ampoules of GPE and CARDINAL ampoule of ORG . Although in the beginning of the intervention Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d appeared agitated , but not aggressive , he started to resist forcefully when the police officers attempted to handcuff him .", "CARDINAL . According to PERSON , after PERSON was handcuffed and calmed down , he came out of the applicant \u2019s house and started to arrange his transport . CARDINAL of the police officers then called out to him that something was not right , that Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d had vomited and was having trouble breathing . He was immediately turned onto his back . Dr GPE noticed that Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d had turned blue in the face and that he was wheezing . The medical team then started the resuscitation procedure , massaging his heart and intubating him , as well as administering QUANTITY mg of adrenaline and QUANTITY of atropine to him . However , as they did not have an electrocardiogram monitor or a defibrillator , another ambulance was called . By the time the second ambulance arrived at TIME , they could only establish that Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d had died .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal investigations officer of the Nova Gorica police obtained an oral preliminary report from the forensic pathologist who had performed the autopsy of Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d . According to him , the deceased had most likely died of asphyxiation from inhaling gastric contents ( choking on his own vomit ) . With regard to the question of potential liability for Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d \u2019s death , he took the view that the asphyxiation occurred during the police intervention , and that the presence of a doctor could not have altered the course of events . He added that the doctor could only be accused of negligence if the death had occurred during the resuscitation , which in his opinion had not been the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the Nova Gorica police criminal investigations unit submitted a report of the incident to ORG . Based on a statement provided by the forensic pathologist who conducted the forensic examination , the report stated asphyxiation from inhaling gastric contents as the cause of PERSON death . As to the events leading to the death , the police report summarised the statements given by the intervention team and stated that PERSON had resisted the police officers who had tried to take him to the psychiatric hospital , whereupon physical force had been used on him . After PERSON \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d had been restrained and had calmed down , the police officers and medical technicians had noticed that he had vomited . After Dr B.A. had initially assessed that this could be attributed to exertion , he had been found to have an irregular heartbeat and the medical team had tried to resuscitate him , but to no avail . As regards the question of potential liability for Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d \u2019s death , the police report followed the forensic pathologist \u2019s opinion that he had died during the police intervention and that his death could not have been prevented by any medical assistance . The report concluded by saying that no facts had been established giving rise to a suspicion that a criminal offence had been committed in connection with the death of Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d which warranted criminal prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the completed forensic report was submitted to the investigating judge of ORG , confirming asphyxiation from inhaling gastric contents as the immediate cause of PERSON death . In addition to the trauma consistent with the cause of death , the examination revealed a number of blunt injuries to various parts of his body .", "CARDINAL . These included contusions on the outer edge of the shoulder blade , the left of the back and the back of the right thigh , swelling on the right of the hairline and the squamous part of the temporal bone , contusions on the inside of the upper right arm and left forearm and on the front of the left thigh . Several haematomas were recorded around the left shoulder blade , on the outer edge of the right shoulder blade , on the right of the thorax and on the scalp , as well as a pulmonary oedema , an oblique fracture of the fifth rib , bruising around the lumbar spine , and brain swelling .", "CARDINAL . According to the report , these injuries had either been caused by Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d \u2019s body being struck by an object , by part of his body being pressed against something , by him falling , or by his body being pressed between CARDINAL hard surfaces . As regards the injuries to the back of his body , hairline and front left thigh , the forensic pathologist concluded that they had most likely occurred by him falling or falling after being struck , and that the bruises were caused by the body being pulled to the ground .", "CARDINAL . The toxicology report revealed a low concentration of haloperidol ( an antipsychotic drug with strong calming effects ) in PERSON blood . The forensic report concluded that the substance had been consumed either as a prescription medicine or administered during the intervention in order to calm him down , but could not be linked to his death or identified as the cause of his vomiting .", "CARDINAL . No particularities or disease - related changes had been found in Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d \u2019s system which could have directly contributed to his death .", "CARDINAL . With regard to enquiries made by the investigating judge as to whether PERSON death could have been prevented by prompt and adequate medical assistance , the forensic report stated :", "\u201c Disregarding the particular circumstances surrounding the incident , this question could be answered in the affirmative ; however , one can not neglect the exceptional circumstances in which the incident occurred .", "Prompt and adequate medical assistance could have saved the life of [ Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d ] , even in the event that no ambulance with resuscitation equipment was immediately available .", "It is likely that [ Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d ] was thrown or pushed to the ground where , prior to being handcuffed , his body was pushed down by applying body weight or some other pressure . [ Being struck or pushed in ] the stomach most likely induced the vomiting . In so far as the medical staff or the officers assisting them in the involuntary confinement had noticed in due course that [ Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d ] began to vomit , they could have prevented him from inhaling gastric contents either by lifting his body into a vertical position or by turning him onto his side and mechanically clearing his oral cavity by using their fingers or an aspirator ( if an aspirator was at the disposal of the medical staff ) . However , it was not possible to apply any of these measures to an aggressive patient resisting hospitalisation ; it is only possible to apply such measures after the patient has calmed down or lost consciousness as a result of disruption in the exchange of gases following the aspiration of gastric contents . Having regard to the agitation and aggressiveness of the patient , as well as the circumstances of the incident , such measures almost certainly could not have been applied .", "The deceased only lost consciousness when his breathing was disrupted by inhaling massive amounts of gastric contents . Only then was it possible to apply more aggressive medical intervention ( mechanical clearing of the oral cavity , suction of gastric contents from the oral cavity and respiratory tract , removal of potentially larger foreign objects and insertion of a tube with a balloon to prevent continuing aspiration of gastric contents , ventilation of the patient ) , which could not be performed on a conscious person , in particular on an aggressive person , due to the unpleasant feelings such an intervention induces . In the present case , the aspiration of gastric contents was particularly massive and aggressive , which is indicated by the pieces of food found by the histological analysis to be present even in the alveoli , the final branching of the respiratory system .", "In the present case it was not possible , once the deceased lost consciousness , to apply those methods and to suck the gastric contents from the respiratory passages and alveoli ; considering the quantity and force of the aspiration of gastric contents , medical assistance probably would not have saved the life of [ Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge of ORG sent the statements of the persons involved in the incident , a record of the examination of the scene , the order for a forensic examination of PERSON body and the forensic report to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of ORG , ORG , informed ORG that the conditions had not been met for the institution of criminal proceedings , and that the case file had been archived .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through her representative , lodged a criminal complaint against police officers PERSON , GPE and PERSON , whereby she stated that her son had been strangled and had died as a result of an unnecessary and unprofessional police intervention . The applicant also stated that the forensic report was misleading and there were doubts as to its accuracy . In addition , an anonymous criminal complaint was lodged against ORG , the head of the Nova Gorica uniformed police unit . The complainant alleged that ORG had abused his position by giving a statement at a press conference in which he had covered up the actual cause of Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d \u2019s death in order to prevent criminal prosecution of Dr B.A.", "CARDINAL . After having reviewed ORG Office \u2019s case file , on DATE a ORG prosecutor from ORG ( GPE dr\u017eavnih to\u017eilcev za posebne zadeve \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the Special Matters Group \u201d ) , which had exclusive jurisdiction over the prosecution of criminal offences committed by police officers , rejected both criminal complaints on the basis of the police and forensic reports and the media reports from the press conference on Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision to reject the criminal complaints summarised the information included in the police and forensic reports , as well as the statements given to the police by PERSON and medical technicians PERSON and GPE", "CARDINAL . The ORG prosecutor , relying on the forensic report , concluded that PERSON death could have been prevented if someone had been noticed in time that he had started to vomit . However , in the case in question PERSON had been aggressive and resisted hospitalisation , and no assistance could be provided until he had calmed down . Therefore , in the ORG prosecutor \u2019s opinion there was no is reasonable suspicion that the actions of PERSON , GPE and PERSON , the QUANTITY police officers who had restrained PERSON , constituted a criminal offence . Moreover , as regards the anonymous criminal complaint , the ORG prosecutor established that , according to the reports in the media , the head of the PERSON uniformed police unit had stated neither that Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d had died as a result of being administered sedatives , nor that the medical team had immediately begun resuscitation after his condition had deteriorated . Therefore , no reasonable suspicion existed that ORG had committed a criminal offence liable to prosecution ex officio .", "CARDINAL . No appeal was available to the applicant against the decision to reject her criminal complaint . However , she could take over the conduct of criminal proceedings as a \u201c subsidiary prosecutor \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
