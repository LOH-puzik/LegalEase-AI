SAN MARINO [Extracts]", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1 concerning the length of proceedings;Violation of Art. 6-1 concerning the right to a court;Violation of P1-1;Just satisfaction reserved (pecuniary damage and costs and expenses of domestic proceedings);Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant church is a NORP church institution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP government issued an expropriation order in respect of certain plots of land belonging to the applicant church . The latter was awarded MONEY ( MONEY ) in compensation . The land , which was earmarked for urban development projects that were scheduled for completion by DATE , was only partially used . On DATE the applicant church applied to the government seeking to recover possession of the unused land . On DATE the government refused the application on the ground that the land in question could still be used in the interests of the community .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , relying on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ( \u201c Law no . CARDINAL \u201d ) , which provides that expropriation orders lapse in the event of expiry of the deadline set for completion of the relevant work , the applicant church brought an action before the first - instance civil judge ( PERSON ) to recover possession . The first hearing , which was set for DATE , could not be held on that date as the government had not been notified . The government joined the proceedings on CARDINAL DATE . At a hearing on DATE , the government requested that a particular witness be heard . That request was granted on DATE . On the date in question , namely DATE , the witness failed to attend the hearing . On CARDINAL DATE the government waived its right to have the witness heard . The parties submitted their written pleadings on CARDINAL DATE . Preparation of the case was concluded on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , deposited at the registry on DATE , the court dismissed the applicant church \u2019s request on the grounds that , firstly , the expropriation order of CARDINAL DATE was an administrative act and thus fell outside the civil court \u2019s jurisdiction and , secondly , that the applicant church could not bring an action to recover possession , since the disputed land had been lawfully expropriated and had not been obtained by the ORG without title .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant church brought an action before the judge of civil appeals ( Giudice delle PERSON ) to establish title to land , seeking to obtain restitution of the land in question in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL . It also alleged that the authorities\u2019 conduct had breached LAW No . CARDINAL . The first hearing was held on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant church filed a number of documents . On CARDINAL DATE the proceedings were adjourned on the ground that an attempt to reach a friendly settlement was in progress . On DATE , noting that the negotiations had failed , the PERSON della PERSON , the official responsible for preparing appeal cases , ordered that the proceedings be resumed . At a hearing on DATE , the applicant church requested that an expert be appointed and a witness questioned in order to determine exactly which parts of the land had not been used . By decisions of DATE and DATE , the PERSON della PERSON allowed both requests . Evidence was heard from the witness on DATE and the expert report was filed on DATE . The parties lodged their final submissions on DATE and DATE . Preparation of the case was concluded on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the appeal Judge PERSON died . No other judge could replace him , as the organisational structure of the court of civil appeals provided for CARDINAL judge . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) enacted PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of which provided : \u201c If the judge of civil appeals dies or if , following a serious impediment , he or she is unable to perform the duties of investigating judge , those duties shall be carried out by CARDINAL of the judges of criminal appeals , who shall carry out any urgent measures until such time as a replacement is appointed or the serious impediment is removed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed Judge PERSON to replace the deceased judge . However , ORG asked ORG for leave to withdraw from the proceedings in question on the ground that he had been involved as the first - instance civil judge . Under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG , which acted as a third - instance judicial body in cases where the appeal court did not uphold the decision of the first - instance court , was also responsible at the material time for ruling on requests to withdraw or applications challenging a judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the request and sent the case in question to ORG , an appeal judge in criminal cases ( PERSON delle PERSON per le cause penali ) .", "CARDINAL . He dismissed the appeal in a judgment of DATE , which was deposited at the registry on DATE . He found that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL provided that expropriation orders would lapse where the deadline for execution of the relevant work had expired , but not in the event of failure to use all of the expropriated assets ; that , in any event , the administrative courts had jurisdiction to rule on the merits of expropriation proceedings ; and that the appellant sought restitution of its title to the assets , whereas at first instance it had sought merely to recover possession of the land . He concluded that the request could not be granted since , according to the established case - law , \u201c requests made for the first time on appeal [ were ] manifestly inadmissible \u201d ( judgment of the PERSON delle PERSON , DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , after a new land - use plan had taken effect , changing the designated use of the land in question from industrial to agricultural , the applicant church had asked the government on DATE to return its assets . On DATE , having received no reply , it sent the government a formal notice asking it to adopt the necessary measures for restitution . On DATE it applied to the first - instance administrative court . A hearing took place on DATE . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , deposited at the registry on DATE , the court stated that it did not have jurisdiction to \u201c recognise the existence of a possible right to restitution of unused land \u201d , as the administrative courts could only examine legitimate interests . It found that ORG alone was entitled to rule on what was to be done with the said property . Noting finally that the new land - use plan had changed the designated use of the unused land , it declared the expropriation order of DATE void in so far as it had lapsed in respect of that particular property , but pointed out that declaring it void did not create a right to reconveyance .", "CARDINAL . The government then lodged an appeal , disputing the existence of an implied refusal which would legitimise an application to the first - instance administrative courts , and also the latter \u2019s jurisdiction to declare the expropriation order partially void . The appeal hearing , initially fixed for CARDINAL DATE , was adjourned to CARDINAL DATE because the judge of administrative appeals was unable to attend . He allowed the appeal in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was deposited at the registry on DATE . The judge found that the ORG had acquired ownership of the plots of land in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law , on payment of compensation for expropriation , and that no legislative provision obliged the government to return that property . Accordingly , he concluded that the applicant church \u2019s request of DATE was inadmissible , since the government \u2019s behaviour could not be described as an implied refusal . Finally , he stated that , in declaring the expropriation order partially void \u2013 an order which , moreover , had never been contested \u2013 the first - instance administrative court had exceeded its jurisdiction , which only permitted it , where appropriate , to declare unlawful the government \u2019s alleged implied refusal .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the administrative court of appeal ordered that the case file be sent to ORG . After taking expert advice , that body gives rulings in administrative disputes where first - instance and appeal judgments reach opposite conclusions ( section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE establishing the administrative courts ) . On DATE ORG upheld the appeal court \u2019s judgment , thus endorsing the expert \u2019s conclusion that , while the public - interest declaration in connection with the urban development work had transformed PERSON right of property into a mere legitimate interest , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL conferred not only a legitimate interest in the lawfulness of the authorities\u2019 actions but an actual right to apply to the civil courts and obtain a declaration that the expropriation order had lapsed because the deadline for completion of the work had expired ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
