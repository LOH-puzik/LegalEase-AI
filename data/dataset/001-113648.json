Similar complaints were addressed to ORG on DATE and on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a confrontation was carried out between the applicant and a witness PERSON The applicant \u2019s counsel was present . According to the record of the confrontation , PERSON confirmed the applicant \u2019s involvement in the robbery and the applicant denied it . When given an opportunity to put questions to PERSON , the applicant did not have any .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the pre - trial investigation in the applicant \u2019s criminal case was completed and he was given an opportunity to read the materials in the case file . After reading the case file the applicant submitted several written requests , including a request to hold an identity parade to determine whether the victim of the robbery could identify him in a line - up .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor rejected the applicant \u2019s requests . With regard to the identity parade , the prosecutor considered that it would serve no useful purpose as the victim had stated that he would not able to recognise his attackers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the R\u012bga City Zemgale District Court convicted the applicant of extortion and sentenced him to a prison term of DATE . That judgment eventually became final after the applicant revoked his appeal .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE hearings in the robbery case took place in ORG . At the hearing , apart from the applicant and his CARDINAL co - accused , the following witnesses were present and testified : GPE , who explained that he had driven all the accused persons to the victim \u2019s residence ; GPE , the victim \u2019s neighbour , who had not seen the act of robbery but had heard some conversations through the doors of his apartment and had later seen that the victim had been beaten ; CARDINAL minor girls , who had noticed a car in which goods taken from the victim \u2019s apartment were being loaded and had written down its licence number ; GPE , the applicant \u2019s former partner , who testified that she had seen the applicant at home on DATE of the robbery ; PERSON , a friend of GPE , who had also seen the applicant at home on DATE of the robbery ; PERSON , the applicant \u2019s neighbour , who had seen the applicant working in the yard of his house on DATE of the robbery ; PERSON , the applicant \u2019s neighbour , who on DATE of the robbery had worked in the yard together with the applicant , and CARDINAL other witnesses .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court then turned to the question of whether the pre - trial statements of the victim and the witness PERSON could be read out in their absence . The applicant insisted that they had to be questioned in court . On DATE the victim had written to the court and indicated that he was unable to attend the hearing \u201c owing to a disability \u201d . The court decided to read out the victim \u2019s pre - trial statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court ordered that PERSON be brought to the hearing by the police under constraint , since he had failed to appear at the court without a legitimate excuse . On DATE the police informed the court that PERSON was not residing at the address known to the court . The court then decided to read out the pre - trial statements of PERSON The applicant again insisted that PERSON had to be questioned in person because his testimony directly implicated the applicant in the commission of the crime . The court nevertheless read out the statements obtained during the pre - trial investigation , according to which PERSON had attempted to enlist GPE \u2019s help in recovering his stolen motorcycle and that the CARDINAL accused had also joined in . PERSON had waited in the car outside the victim \u2019s apartment building , so he did not see what happened inside but saw the accused carrying out a TV set and other items , which they loaded into the boot of the car and eventually took with them", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a judgment by which the applicant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The court held that the applicant and his co - accused had gone to the victim \u2019s apartment to help PERSON find his stolen motorcycle . It considered that the applicant \u2019s guilt had been established by the testimonies of the applicant \u2019s co - accused , the victim , GPE , GPE , GPE , and the CARDINAL minor girls who had written down the number of the licence plate of the car used to transport the victim \u2019s stolen property . The court considered that there was no reason not to believe the pre - trial statements of PERSON and that slight discrepancies in the testimony of GPE could be explained by the fact DATE had passed since the events in question . The court did not believe the testimonies of the witnesses who confirmed that on DATE of the robbery the applicant had been working in the yard of his house , because those witnesses had been questioned at the applicant \u2019s request and because too long a time had passed since DATE of the robbery and they could not possibly remember what the applicant had been doing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted an appeal , which he amended on DATE . He complained inter alia about the victim \u2019s absence from the hearing , which had been justified with reference to his disability ; yet , according to the information available to the applicant , his disability was not such as to prevent him from attending the trial . Further , the applicant alleged that his defence had been impaired by the absence of PERSON from the court hearing , especially because PERSON had a reason to falsely accuse him because of their strained personal relationship . He complained that CARDINAL other people \u2013 S.K - a and LAW \u2013 had not been summoned to the court and that their testimonies given during the pre - trial investigation had not even been read out . The applicant requested that the victim , PERSON , S.K - a and S.K - s be summoned to the appeal hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of the first - instance court , essentially relying on the reasoning of the first - instance court and without specifically addressing any of the above - mentioned issues raised by the applicant in his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law to the ORG of ORG . He essentially repeated the submissions he had made in his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent the applicant a letter , explaining , inter alia , that there had been a delay with regard to the hearing of his case in ORG because of \u201c objective reasons \u201d \u2013 the heavy workload of that court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . In its decision the ORG pointed out , inter alia , that during the trial at the court of appeal the applicant had not repeated his request that \u2013 among others \u2013 M.B. and the victim be summoned to the hearing . The ORG therefore held that the applicant \u2019s complaint about their absence was ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON vietu p\u0101rvalde ) sent a letter to the applicant informing him that in DATE a blood test had disclosed that he was HIV positive . Subsequently , additional tests had revealed that the applicant was also infected with hepatitis C.", "CARDINAL .

The applicant also explained that he had never used intravenous drugs and that he was not a homosexual .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL occasions in DATE ORG received letters from the applicant in which he explained that he had been infected with HIV while in LOC . However , he consistently reiterated that he did not know in what circumstances he had been infected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a claim with ORG seeking damages from LOC because he had been infected with HIV by the fault of the prison staff .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the administration of FAC submitted its response . It pointed out that on DATE , upon the applicant \u2019s arrival at FAC , his HIV test had been negative . On DATE the test had been positive , which made the representatives of FAC believe that the initial test could have been performed during the \u201c window \u201d period and that the applicant had been infected before his arrest or , alternatively , that he had been infected while in prison because of failure to observe personal hygiene or by way of a sexual intercourse . It was also noted that all the blood samples in FAC were taken using single - use vacuum containers , which excluded the possibility of being infected during the taking of a blood sample .", "CARDINAL . In his reply of CARDINAL DATE the applicant indicated that , on the contrary , when his blood was taken in DATE , a multiple - use glass syringe had been used . He contended that he could not have been infected by his cell - mates and that , instead , he had been infected with HIV and hepatitis C in DATE when the medical staff of ORG had used a multiple - use syringe to take a sample of his blood .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant amended his claim , additionally alleging that because of the negligence of the prison \u2019s medical staff he had been infected with hepatitis C.", "CARDINAL . On DATE Central Prison replied to the applicant \u2019s statement of CARDINAL DATE , pointing out , inter alia , that ORG had used single - use syringes since DATE and that there were no multiple - use syringes in the medical centre of that prison in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . The judgment noted that the very fact of being placed in prison placed people at a risk of being infected with HIV and hepatitis C. The nurse who had taken the applicant \u2019s blood sample in DATE had testified before the court that exclusively single - use syringes had been used for blood tests in LOC since DATE or DATE . The court considered that the respondent had proved that a single - use syringe had been used when taking the applicant \u2019s blood sample . It also noted that it was impossible to pinpoint exactly when the applicant had been infected with hepatitis C , since he had not been tested for that disease upon his arrival at FAC in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted an appeal against the judgment of the first - instance court , which he disputed in a general manner . DATE he amended his appeal and noted that , while single - use syringes might indeed have been available in FAC , they had not been used for his blood test in DATE . He also requested that his presence at the hearing be ensured .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant that the hearing concerning his appeal would be held on DATE . The applicant was invited ( aicin\u0101ts ) to attend the hearing . On DATE the administration of Jelgava Prison sent confirmation to ORG that the applicant had attested by his signature that he had received the above information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG held a hearing and issued a judgment with regard to the applicant \u2019s appeal . In the judgment the court pointed out that \u201c the plaintiff has not appeared [ at the hearing ] because he is detained \u201d . There was no further analysis of the question of the applicant \u2019s absence . The appeal court essentially dismissed the appeal by relying on the same grounds as the first - instance court . The respondent \u2019s representatives and the nurse from FAC were reported to have stated that FAC had used exclusively single - use syringes since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . Among other things he complained that he had not been transported to the appeal court hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and then again on DATE the applicant complained to ORG that he had been infected with HIV because of negligence on the part of the medical staff of ORG . The applicant \u2019s complaint requested \u201c the initiation of criminal proceedings against the persons responsible for infecting me with HIV and hepatitis C \u201d . ORG forwarded the applicant \u2019s claim to ORG , which on DATE refused to initiate an internal investigation concerning the actions of the prison staff because the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law was still pending before the ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the ORG , by a decision of a preparatory meeting ( r\u012bc\u012bbas s\u0113de ) , had dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . The ORG did not address the applicant \u2019s complaints about his absence from the appeal court hearing .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE in the case concerning the applicant \u2019s alleged infection , he had left to the court \u2019s discretion the decision whether to open the trial to the public . The court had decided to hold a closed hearing .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the applicant expressed his desire for the trial to be open to the public , as long as no photos were taken . The representative of ORG objected to opening the trial to the public , since the case concerned sensitive medical information . The court allowed the applicant \u2019s request and the trial was opened to the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a DATE newspaper , PERSON , published an article entitled \u201c Prison Doctors Accused of Injecting AIDS \u201d , where it was stated that \u201c prisoner PERSON had lodged a complaint against ORG alleging that he had been infected with AIDS because of the fault of the doctors at the prison . The article also included a photograph of the applicant behind bars , in DATE profile , where his facial features were clearly distinguishable . It also reported that the trial had not been open to the public and further described the applicant as a recidivist , who had been convicted CARDINAL times and was currently serving a prison term of DATE in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another hearing was held in the trial between the applicant and FAC . The applicant told the court that he did not object to the presence of representatives of the media at the hearing , but added that no pictures should be taken and that his name should not be published . If video recordings were to be made , the applicant insisted that his face should not be visible and his name should not be shown . The court acceded to the applicant \u2019s demands and prohibited the representatives of the media from disclosing the applicant \u2019s identity , while otherwise authorising media coverage of the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a claim with ORG , naming the publisher of PERSON ( ORG \u201c GPE Nams \u201d ) as the respondent and requesting non - pecuniary damages for moral and psychological harm caused to him when PERSON published the above - mentioned article , which included his photo in which he was fully recognisable . The claim was based on an alleged infringement of personal data protection legislation and an alleged violation of criminal law which , in accordance with LAW , created an obligation to pay damages .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its response the publisher pointed out that the applicant had implicitly consented to the disclosure of his personal data when he had lodged a claim against FAC . Furthermore , he had not asked for the trial to be closed to public . At an unspecified later date the respondent publisher amended its observations , indicating that the disputed article had merely put together information that had been in the public domain . Furthermore the applicant himself had striven to make the information about his case as widely available as possible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a judgment by which it dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It expressed the opinion that data protection legislation was applicable to the applicant , as he could be identified from the photograph published in the newspaper . It also agreed that the applicant had not consented to the publication of his personal data , since during the trial he had asked not to be filmed or photographed . Thus the respondent newspaper had contravened the law by publishing sensitive personal data . Nevertheless , the applicant had failed to prove the existence of any damage and/or had not referred to any legal basis for the damages claimed ; therefore his claim for compensation had to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . Among other things he indicated specific types of damage he had allegedly suffered . On DATE the applicant submitted additional comments to the appeal court in which he emphasised that the publication of his data and photo had been prohibited by the court during the hearing of CARDINAL DATE in the case against FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant asked the appeal court when his appeal would be heard and also requested that his presence at the hearing be ensured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG held an appeal hearing . Its verbatim record indicates that the court noted that the applicant had not appeared at the hearing and , after asking for the opinion of the respondent , it decided to proceed in the applicant \u2019s absence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted its judgment , in which it was pointed out that the applicant had not been escorted to the hearing and that the case could be heard in his absence . No further comments in this regard were made .", "CARDINAL . As to the substance , the court held that the media were not subject to the data protection legislation and that there were no legal grounds for compensating the non - pecuniary damage allegedly caused to the applicant by the publication .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG of ORG , by a decision of a preparatory meeting , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . The ORG considered that the applicant had merely disputed the assessment of facts by the first - instance and appeal courts and therefore his appeal on points of law did not meet the procedural requirements .
