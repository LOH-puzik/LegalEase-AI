The judgment of DATE was quashed on appeal by ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d , ORG \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 ORG ) on DATE . The case was remitted for fresh examination at first instance .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant and his counsel were again given an opportunity to study the case - file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hearings recommenced at first instance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's civil defender PERSON and his counsel Mr PERSON failed to attend the hearing of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr Chumak excused himself by reference to his previous engagements in a different set of proceedings . It appears that Mr PERSON was undergoing medical treatment in a hospital .", "CARDINAL . In view of their absence , the court adjourned the hearing until DATE . On CARDINAL DATE PERSON and Mr Kozlov were again absent and , despite the applicant 's proposal to continue the examination of the case in their absence , the court again adjourned the hearing , this time until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE both the civil defender and counsel PERSON attended the hearing .", "CARDINAL . According to the transcript , at the hearing the applicant requested the court to admit PERSON as a \u201c specialist in international law \u201d . The court considered the request unfounded and irrelevant as there was no need for advice on international law at that stage of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he requested to admit PERSON as a replacement counsel for Mr PERSON who was present and unfit effectively to participate in the hearing due to his medical condition .", "CARDINAL . From the hearing transcript it does not transpire that either the applicant or his defence counsel objected to the decision rejecting the applicant 's request with reference to Mr PERSON 's alleged inability to participate in the further examination of the case on medical grounds .", "CARDINAL . During the trial ORG heard CARDINAL witnesses in total , both for the prosecution and the defence .", "CARDINAL . The court refused the applicant 's requests to call certain witnesses , including the former Regional Governor , ORG and other officials , and admitted and considered CARDINAL witness statements taken at the pre - trial stage of proceedings and during the first round of proceedings at first instance without hearing the respective witnesses in person .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of these witnesses were the NORP nationals NORP and PERSON who had both been questioned by ORG ( \u201c the NORP authority \u201d , ORG ) and the NORP investigators in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The trial court attempted to secure the presence of these witnesses in person by making an official request to that effect to the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . By letters of CARDINAL and DATE NORP and PERSON refused to appear and give evidence to the court , and on an unspecified date the NORP authorities refused to secure their presence at the trial by force .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the witnesses NORP and PERSON did not attend the trial and the applicant could not cross - examine them .", "CARDINAL . The third witness was a NORP national PERSON who gave evidence at the pre - trial stage of proceedings and during the first round of proceedings in DATE . The applicant and his counsel were able to cross - examine him during the first round of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The trial court unsuccessfully tried to secure his presence but PERSON was in GPE and could not be found .", "CARDINAL . The fourth and fifth witnesses , the NORP nationals M. and A. , were also questioned during the pre - trial investigation and during the trial in DATE . The applicant and the defence team were able to cross - examine them during the proceedings in DATE .", "CARDINAL . From the case - file and the documents presented by the Government it transpires that during the hearings the court summoned these CARDINAL witnesses and the authorities repeatedly undertook various measures , including questioning the close relatives and the witnesses ' connections , with a view to securing their presence at the trial . Apparently these measures proved futile as the witnesses ' whereabouts could not be established .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the prosecution case contained several documents in LANGUAGE and NORP .", "CARDINAL . All documents admitted by the court as evidence were translated either by certified translators or by the staff of the NORP embassy . Most of the translations were attached to the case - file prior to the beginning of the first instance hearings , whilst some of them on DATE ( numbering CARDINAL pages ) and CARDINAL DATE ( CARDINAL pages ) , were submitted already after the beginning of the trial .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on CARDINAL occasion the defence requested translation of a document which had not been used by the prosecution or the court . The request was granted and the necessary translation was made .", "CARDINAL . The court also admitted a number of expert reports ( technical , medical , graphologist and others ) which had been ordered by the prosecution during the pre - trial stage of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . It follows from the case - file that the applicant was officially notified of most of the prosecution decisions to carry out expert examinations ( counting CARDINAL ) within DATE from DATE on which such decisions had been taken .", "CARDINAL . The decisions of CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE to carry out expert examinations were served on the applicant on DATE . The decision to carry out expert examination dated DATE was served on him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the time when these decisions were served , both the applicant and his counsel were officially informed about the procedural rights of the accused , including the right to challenge an expert , seek an appointment of a particular person as an expert , adduce further questions , be present during the expert examination in person and make any comments and be informed of expert conclusions . The accused also had an opportunity to make related requests and motions in writing .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the decisions of DATE and DATE to carry out technical examinations , the applicant requested to provide him with copies of some documents . The copies were provided to him on DATE . As regards the decision of CARDINAL DATE to carry out technical examinations , the applicant stated that it \u201c might have been more objective \u201d to carry out that examinations in GPE or GPE .", "CARDINAL . The copies of the notification reports state that the applicant and his counsel did not make any additional requests and motions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty on charges of misappropriation , embezzlement , bribery and the attempt not to return money from abroad .", "CARDINAL . According to the judgment , the applicant and a co - accused PERSON , the director of a shipyard \u201c PERSON \u201d , had tampered with documents with a view to embezzling the shipyard 's property . The director , acting on behalf of the shipyard , was found to have arranged large - scale money transfers under fraudulent contracts with the companies owned by the applicant , whereas the applicant was found to have bribed the director by opening bank accounts in the name of PERSON in GPE and transferring the stolen money there . Among other things , the applicant was also convicted of having extorted money from a marketplace owned and run by the companies \u201c GPE \u201d and \u201c NL TOP \u201d , and from a casino owned and run by a company \u201c Slot \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In total , the court sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment and the confiscation of part of his property . The court also upheld civil claims for damages by the shipyard \u201c FAC and CARDINAL other companies , \u201c GPE \u201d , \u201c NL TOP \u201d and \u201c Slot \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's conviction was based on various pieces of evidence , i.e. numerous documentary items , including accounting , financial and contractual papers reflecting the operation of sham companies owned and run by the applicant and PERSON as well as oral and written evidence given by CARDINAL witnesses and various expert examinations .", "CARDINAL . A copy of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Later it was discovered that the copy contained errors and misprints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG corrected a number of clerical and technical mistakes in the judgment and ordered that the applicant be furnished with the amended version .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claims that he did not receive the amended version .", "CARDINAL . The records in the case - file indicate that the amended copy of the judgment was served on the applicant against his signature on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government submit that the whole trial was taken down in shorthand and taped and that the respective records were all available to the interested parties , including the applicant and his counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested to study records , audiotape recordings and shorthand records .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was provided with this opportunity on DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a specialist of ORG certified that the applicant had been given access to the trial record , though he had refused to study audio records and shorthand records .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG decided that the defence counsel should be given access to the records DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The deadline for filing objections was set on DATE accordingly .", "CARDINAL . It does not appear from the case - file that the applicant ever challenged the accuracy of the trial records .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made a number of separate rulings ( \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f ) in the case .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL of these rulings the court noted that there had been breaches of the relevant rules of criminal procedure during the investigation and that these breaches had been remedied during the trial .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the court established that the defendants had been informed about the commissioning of expert reports in the case only after the respective examinations were over .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that this failure did not invalidate the conclusions of the experts ' reports and that the applicant had failed to contest the results of the reports during the investigation or during the trial or request additional or repeated examinations to be carried out .", "CARDINAL . The court also noted that a number of documents in the case - file were in foreign languages , but considered that this did not violate the applicant 's defence rights because the documents were similar to or copies of other documents in NORP and that in any event all relevant documents had been translated into LANGUAGE during the trial .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that certain statements of witnesses had been admitted as evidence , even though they gave no indication as to the time or place of questioning . To verify the relevant points , these witnesses as well as other witnesses had been questioned in the courtroom on the circumstances of the questioning .", "CARDINAL . The defence appealed against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In their appeal , inter alia , the applicant 's counsel contested the admissibility of certain evidence admitted by the court such as expert reports , documents in foreign languages , certain procedural documents , statements of witnesses made during the pre - trial investigation and at the first round of proceedings at first instance , statements of witnesses taken by the NORP police , and other evidence obtained in GPE , claiming that were allegedly in breach of the domestic procedural rules .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , it was stated that the applicant 's defence had not had due access to the trial records and the quality of the defence had been impaired by ORG refusal to admit PERSON as a replacement for a lawyer who was sick .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON joined the defence team . In DATE and on DATE she referred to various difficulties in organising the defence and made several requests to ORG to adjourn the hearing .", "CARDINAL . She also complained that the applicant had been served neither with the final copy of the judgment , nor with the rulings of CARDINAL DATE and that the defence had had no access to the verbatim record and certain volumes of the case - file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted one of her requests to adjourn the hearing . The hearing initially scheduled for DATE was postponed .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter PERSON failed to appear at the hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON requested to postpone a further hearing claiming that the defence had not been properly notified of the judgment and separate rulings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to her request for adjournment , ORG ruled that both the defence in general and PERSON in particular had had sufficient time to examine the trial records , study the first instance judgment and prepare for the case MONEY and DATE and turned down the request as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The appeal hearing took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the presence of the applicant 's defenders , PERSON and PERSON , and the prosecution , ORG examined the appeals and , with minor alterations , confirmed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded that there had been no significant breaches of national procedural law or international standards during the trial .", "CARDINAL . As to the complaints about the handling and assessment of the evidence , the court found that the lower court had properly admitted and considered the evidence in the case and that the conclusions of the lower court had been reasonable and substantiated . It also noted that the defence had been furnished with NORP translations of foreign documents during the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The court further considered that the applicant had been adequately represented throughout the pre - trial investigation and the trial , and that at no time during the proceedings had he been deprived of professional legal advice .", "DATE . In respect of the events of CARDINAL DATE , the court noted that the applicant 's lawyer had never applied for an adjournment of the hearing for health reasons and ORG refusal to admit PERSON as a further lawyer did not constitute a violation of the applicant 's right to defence .", "CARDINAL .

In such cases the court takes the decision having heard the opinions of the participants of the proceedings ( Section CARDINAL of the Code ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Code states that an accused and his counsel have the right to challenge an expert , seek an appointment of a particular person as an expert , adduce further questions , be present during the expert examination in person and make any comments and be informed of expert conclusions .

The investigator should draw up a report reflecting the progress of the defence in studying the case . The investigator can not limit the time for study , except in cases where the accused and his counsel manifestly protract the process .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , criminal proceedings are conducted in LANGUAGE . The contents of documents relating to court proceedings and investigation are made available to the accused in a language that he understands .", "CARDINAL . A translator appointed by a court or an investigator is under an obligation to make correct translations and may be held criminally liable for incorrect translations under LAW of the LAW and LAW of GPE .", "CARDINAL . By Section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , participants in the proceedings , including the accused and his defendants , have the right to make requests to summon new witnesses , experts and specialists or retrieve items of evidence and documents etc .
