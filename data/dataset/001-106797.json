The applicant was born in DATE and currently lives in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . He entered GPE with his parents on CARDINAL September CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he obtained a DATE residence permit , which was subsequently renewed on a regular basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE he received , respectively , a suspended prison sentence of DATE , a DATE suspended prison sentence and a sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , for a number of offences committed DATE ( wounding , grievous bodily harm , assault , theft , robbery , damage to property , receiving stolen goods , proffering insults and threats , disturbance , a weapons offence and a serious breach of road traffic regulations ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG for ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s administrative removal for an indefinite duration . His appeals against that decision were dismissed , first on DATE by ORG for ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , then on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was deported to GPE . After returning to GPE illegally in DATE or DATE , he was arrested and taken into custody on DATE pursuant to arrest warrants issued on the basis of his criminal convictions .", "CARDINAL . After various procedural developments and CARDINAL further prison sentences , of DATE and DATE respectively , for the improper use of a communication facility and for the offence of returning to GPE while banished , he was apparently sent back to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , he had lodged an application with the ORG submitting that his removal from GPE for an indefinite duration , as upheld by ORG , entailed a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which became final on DATE , ORG unanimously declared admissible the complaint under LAW and found that there had been a violation of that provision . On that basis , it held that GPE had to pay the applicant the sums of QUANTITY ( ORG ) for non - pecuniary damage and LAW for the costs and expenses he had incurred \u201c in the domestic proceedings and before the ORG \u201d . The relevant passages of that judgment read as follows :", "\u201c - Nature and seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes , at the outset , that the relevant date for an assessment of the above - mentioned criteria is , in the present case , DATE , the date on which the applicant was notified of the final judgment of ORG confirming the withdrawal of his residence permit ( see , mutatis mutandis , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards , first , the \u2018 ORG of the offences committed by the applicant , the ORG notes that in DATE and DATE he was given a suspended prison sentence of DATE , and then a DATE prison sentence , for proffering threats and insults , a serious breach of road traffic regulations , wounding , assault , theft , receiving stolen goods , robbery , damage to property and other property - related offences . In DATE he was given a further prison sentence of DATE , to be followed by deportation and a DATE ban on re - entering GPE , for disturbance and a weapons offence committed in DATE . Lastly , in DATE he was sentenced again on CARDINAL occasions , to DATE respectively . The total duration of his prison sentences ( DATE in all ) is thus far from negligible .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also notes that the criminal activities in question were spread over a wide period ( from DATE ) ( contrast GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and that the CARDINAL suspended sentences of DATE and DATE were activated in view of the further offences committed by the applicant . At the same time , the ORG observes that some of the conduct attributed to the applicant dated back to his adolescence and some to a relatively young age ( see , to the same effect , GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and PERSON GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . Moreover , the sentences of CARDINAL DATE and DATE were handed down by ORG for GPE . Therefore , at least some of the offences in question were committed by the applicant in a juvenile delinquency context . In this connection , the ORG notes that according to ORG , experience has shown that juvenile delinquency tends to disappear spontaneously in most individuals with their transition to adulthood ( see sub - paragraph I , CARDINAL ( e ) of LAW for ORG ( ORG ) , adopted and proclaimed by ORG in its CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the \u2018 nature\u2019 of the offences committed by the applicant , it is undeniable that the convictions for wounding weigh heavily against him . Concerning the weapons offence , however , it appears to have been constituted merely by the possession of a tear - gas canister . In addition , it has not been established that it was the applicant who stabbed a security guard with a knife during the attack on the discotheque on DATE ( ORG judgment , point CARDINAL ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As to the road traffic offences , whilst they may well constitute a potential danger they should nevertheless be seen in the light of the relatively lenient penalties normally imposed in such matters ( see , to this effect , PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE , and PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "DATE . Therefore , in the light of comparable cases , the applicant \u2019s convictions should be assessed for what they really are , both in terms of their seriousness and of the penalties ultimately imposed ( contrast PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; PERSON GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Reports CARDINALIII ; PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE in fine ; and GPE v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; NORP , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ; GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "- Length of the applicant \u2019s residence in GPE", "CARDINAL . As regards the length of the applicant \u2019s residence in the country from which he is to be deported , the ORG notes that the applicant , who was born on DATE , arrived in GPE on DATE , before DATE . At the time of ORG judgment of CARDINAL May CARDINAL he was CARDINAL and a half . He had thus spent CARDINAL and a half years in GPE .", "- Time between the commission of the offences and the impugned measure , and the applicant \u2019s conduct during that period", "CARDINAL . As regards the time that elapsed between the commission of the offences and the time when the impugned measure became final , and the applicant \u2019s conduct during that period , the ORG notes that his criminal activities were spread over a considerable period . Similarly , the domestic courts noted that he had not shown any awareness of his criminal activities and that he had refused to follow his psychotherapy ( see , in this connection , ORG , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "- Strength of social , cultural and family ties with host country and destination country", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s particular ties with his host country , ORG noted that he had spent most of his life in GPE , including all his school years , and that his parents and brothers , CARDINAL of whom had NORP nationality , lived in the country . Whilst there is some debate between parties as to his professional integration in GPE ( see above , DATE and DATE ) , the ORG does not feel obliged to settle this question .", "CARDINAL . NORP In comparison with the above factors , showing that the applicant is integrated to a certain extent in GPE , despite his criminal activity , his social , cultural and family ties with GPE seem very tenuous . It can be seen from the case file that the applicant only stayed in that country for DATE , and that only his grandmother is still living there . The ORG is not convinced that his brief stay in GPE after his first removal , a measure complained of in the present application , may be taken into consideration . Moreover , there is no certainty that the applicant is sufficiently fluent in GPE . Even though relationships between parents and adult children would not attract the protection of Article CARDINAL without \u2018 evidence of further elements of dependency , involving more than the normal , emotional ties\u2019 ( see , mutatis mutandis , PERSON and GPE v. the GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , the ORG also notes that ORG itself admitted that his family ties with GPE were far less significant than those he had made with his host country . Moreover , that court did not call into question the fact that the applicant would \u2018 face major difficulties if returned to Turkey\u2019 .", "- Specificities of the case : the medical aspect", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that a report of the ORG psychiatric and social centre dated DATE indicated that the applicant showed signs of \u2018 an emotionally labile personality disorder , with impulsive and borderline elements , together with a phobic anxiety disorder\u2019 vis - \u00e0 - vis the prospect of his deportation ( ORG judgment , point CARDINAL ; see above , paragraph CARDINAL ) . A letter from the family doctor dated DATE moreover confirmed that the applicant had been brought up in a violent environment with little stimulation , and explained that deportation would distance him from the reassuring and structuring elements that he had built up in DATE ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . The views of the parties to the proceedings differ on this point . The applicant argued that his illness , having involved suicide attempts , could not be adequately treated in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The Government , for their part , claimed the contrary , considering that his family would still be able to support him financially from GPE . Moreover , they emphasised that the applicant had largely refused to undergo the psychiatric treatment prescribed for him ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG does not rule out the possibility that the applicant \u2019s health problems could be treated adequately in GPE . Neither does it disregard the fact that the applicant neglected the prescribed treatment , at least at the outset . At the same time , it finds that his disorders , which the Government have certainly not called into question , whilst they are not sufficient in themselves to form the basis of a separate complaint under LAW , nevertheless constitute an additional aspect that would render even more difficult the applicant \u2019s return to his country of origin , where his social network would be lacking .", "- The permanent nature of the expulsion", "CARDINAL . In order to assess the proportionality of the impugned measure , the ORG must also consider whether the exclusion from NORP territory was a temporary or permanent measure .", "CARDINAL . It notes that in the present case ORG and ORG of the Canton of ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s deportation for DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , his administrative removal was ordered by ORG for ORG for an indefinite duration ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG observes that the applicant \u2019s application is directed against his administrative removal , the duration of which it finds particularly harsh ( see , as an example of cases in which the permanent nature of the exclusion order was considered by the ORG in concluding that the measure had been disproportionate , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ; ORG , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE , and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ; and by contrast , for cases where the limited duration of the impugned measure contributed to a conclusion that it was proportionate , see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ; PERSON , cited above , and GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . As to the possibility for the applicant to request that the exclusion order be suspended temporarily or permanently rescinded , the ORG finds that this possibility remains purely speculative at present .", "CARDINAL . In view of the foregoing , and particularly in consideration of the relative seriousness of the applicant \u2019s convictions , the weakness of his links with his country of origin and the permanent nature of the removal measure , the ORG finds that the respondent ORG can not be regarded as having struck a fair balance between the interests of the applicant and his family , on the one hand , and its own interest in controlling immigration , on the other .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , there has been a violation of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . When asked what action it would take in response to the ORG \u2019s judgment , ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , in a decision of DATE , refused to consider a request for leave to enter GPE on the ground that the matter had been dealt with on CARDINAL May CARDINAL by a final judgment of ORG . The ORG suggested that the applicant lodge a request for revision with that court .", "CARDINAL . In pleadings dated DATE , the applicant lodged a request for revision with ORG , requesting it to annul its judgment of CARDINAL DATE and the judgment previously delivered in the same case by ORG of the Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted that the request for revision should be rejected .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the request for revision and annulled its judgment of DATE . At the same time it quashed the CARDINAL DATE judgment of ORG , limiting the duration of the applicant \u2019s exclusion to DATE from DATE . The reasoning of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c ... CARDINAL In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG observed that , in deporting PERSON from its territory for an indefinite duration , GPE had breached his right to private and family life , as guaranteed by DATE . On that basis it awarded him ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage under LAW . That provision gives ORG the power to grant \u2018 just satisfaction\u2019 to the injured party where the internal law of the ORG in question \u2018 allows only partial reparation to be PERSON for the violation found . The payment of such compensation does not , however , necessarily release the ORG concerned from its obligation under LAW to comply with the judgments of ORG . The respondent ORG , having been found responsible for a violation of the ORG or its Protocols , is thus obliged not only to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction , but also to choose , subject to supervision by ORG , the general and/or , if appropriate , individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the ORG and to redress as far as possible the effects , the aim being to put the applicant , as far as possible , in the position he would have been in had the requirements of the ORG not been disregarded ( see , among other references , the judgment of ORG in PERSON gegen GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and DATE , CARDINAL DATE , and the numerous authorities cited therein ) . This is the principle of restitutio in integrum , which has the practical effect of limiting the freedom of GPE in the choice of means by which to remedy a violation of the Convention ...", "CARDINAL Where , as in the present case , ORG upholds a request for revision , it gives CARDINAL separate decisions in succession , even though it generally does so in a single judgment . In the first , referred to as the rescindant , it annuls the judgment of which revision is sought ; in the second , known as the rescisoire , it rules afresh on the application previously referred to it . The annulment decision puts an end to the revision procedure as such and leads to the re - opening of the previous proceedings . This has an ex tunc effect , such that ORG and the parties are put back in the situation in which they found themselves at the time the annulled judgment was delivered , and the case will have to be adjudicated as if that judgment had never existed ( see the above - cited judgment PERSON of DATE , point CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL In its judgment , ORG found that , in view of the circumstances , and particularly of the applicant \u2019s relatively serious convictions , the weakness of his links with his country of origin , and the permanent nature of the removal measure , GPE had failed to strike a fair balance between the interests ( private and public ) at stake ( judgment cited above , para . CARDINAL ) . It specifically emphasised that the indefinite duration of the exclusion had been \u2018 particularly harsh\u2019 , taking the view that the possibility for the applicant to have the exclusion order suspended temporarily or permanently rescinded remained purely speculative at present ( judgment , para . CARDINAL ) . In other words , it was not particularly opposed to the principle of the impugned measure but rather to its permanent nature . Generally speaking , in its most recent judgments , ORG seems , moreover , to accord increasingly decisive weight to the latter criterion , refusing , with rare exceptions , to endorse permanent exclusions from a country , unlike bans of limited duration ...", "That being said , in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the material time , namely when the annulled judgment was delivered ( on DATE ) , an immediate revocation of the removal measure was not a matter for consideration . Admittedly , the applicant \u2019s links with GPE were at that time weaker than those he enjoyed with GPE , such that a return to his country of origin appeared to be a relatively harsh measure for him . That obstacle had in fact been taken into consideration and discussed in the first judgment . However , ORG had also observed , without being contradicted by ORG on this point , that the applicant \u2019s presence in GPE represented a particularly serious danger for public order and security , because his conduct and offences showed that his \u2018 mindset was hardly capable of resolving conflicts and frustrations otherwise than by violence , ready to impose his own rules , by himself or with the help of partners , without consideration for property or for the physical well - being of others , and openly contemptuous of the judicial authority\u2019 ( judgment cited above of DATE , point CARDINAL ) . Moreover , ORG also emphasised , and there is nothing in ORG judgment that would justify departing from this assessment , that the applicant had no awareness of the seriousness of his actions and that he thus presented a high risk of reoffending : he had committed further offences after his first convictions and had refused to follow psychiatric treatment during his detention ( see the above - cited judgment of ORG DATE , point CARDINAL in initio ) . In those circumstances , it was not possible for the applicant \u2019s private interest in remaining in GPE , bearing in mind that he was an adult , was single and had no children , to prevail over the public interest in his expulsion , at least for a certain period of time . In other words , the only appropriate solution in order to alleviate the effects of the impugned measure against the deportee and comply with the judgment of ORG would consist in limiting the duration of the exclusion .", "CARDINAL Consequently , it is justified to limit the removal measure ordered against the applicant to a period of DATE with effect from the removal decision of DATE . After such time he will be able to lodge an application for leave to remain , which will be examined by the competent authority in the light of the applicable law and the circumstances then prevailing ( the applicant \u2019s family and personal situation ; his conduct since his expulsion ; etc . ) .", "CARDINAL . It follows from the foregoing that the request for revision must be upheld and ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE annulled . Moreover , the judgment delivered on DATE by ORG must be set aside , and the measure of removal banning the applicant from GPE for an indefinite duration is to be replaced by removal with a ban of DATE from DATE .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant married a NORP national . As a result of that marriage he has obtained a NORP residence permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he lodged with ORG for ORG an application for reconsideration of a decision of DATE of ORG , which had refused the suspension of his removal , relying in particular on his new situation , namely his marriage to a NORP citizen . In a judgment of DATE , the court rejected the request and referred the matter back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant transmitted additional documents to ORG on DATE and DATE . The response to his request for the revocation of the removal measure so that he could settle in GPE was negative . In a letter of DATE , ORG for ORG took the view that it could not rule on a request for reconsideration , in particular for the following reasons :", "\u201c ... Although the marriage solemnised on DATE in GPE to a NORP national , together with the issuance of a NORP residence permit following that marriage , constitute new facts , we note that they do not by themselves constitute pertinent justification for ORG to act upon the request for reconsideration . The nationality of the wife , by itself , does not have the effect of requiring the annulment of the removal or the granting of leave to remain in GPE . The wife would have to submit a request for leave to remain in GPE , to be in CARDINAL of the situations covered by ORG ( ORG ) , and to fulfil the conditions thereof , without being excluded by any public order or security grounds .", "The right to family reunification is always predicated on the existence of original leave to remain granted to an ORG / EFTA national under the provisions of the ORG . The right of abode conferred on family members is a correlative right of which the validity is in principle subject to the duration of the original leave to remain .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , there was no possibility of challenging or complaining about the content of that letter .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , in force since DATE , provides as follows :", "\u201c An application for review of a judgment of ORG on account of a violation of LAW DATE for ORG ) may be submitted if the following conditions are satisfied :", "( a ) ORG , in a final judgment , has found a violation of the ORG or its Protocols ;", "( b ) compensation can not remedy the effects of the violation ;", "( c ) the review is necessary to remedy the effects of the violation . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
