The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE X , a plain - clothes police officer from the GPE police organised crime unit , approached the applicant in a nightclub . According to a report drafted on DATE , the meeting had been planned in order to verify information received by the police that the applicant might have been dealing drugs . The report mentioned that X had discussed with the applicant , who claimed that he could get drugs and promised to call with more details . In a second report drafted on DATE it was stated that the applicant had called PERSON to ask whether he was interested in buying CARDINAL ecstasy tablets at a cost of CARDINAL ( ORG ) each .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor from the GPE department for the investigation of organised crime ( \u201c the organised crime department \u201d ) opened a criminal investigation against the applicant on suspicion of drug trafficking . A request to intercept his telephone conversations and make ambient voice recordings was authorised by a judge of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor from the organised crime department authorised the use of X as undercover police agent in order to determine the facts of the case , identify the offenders and obtain evidence . The prosecutor justified the issuing of the authorisation on the basis that there was reason to believe that the applicant was about to commit a drug trafficking offence .", "CARDINAL . In a report dated CARDINAL DATE the chief of the GPE police organised crime unit stated that PERSON had called the applicant several times in DATE and DATE in order to enquire when the transaction might take place . The report also mentioned that the applicant had replied on several occasions that he was not in possession of the drugs , which were to be brought into the country by friends of his who had not yet returned from abroad .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE the applicant called NORP and set up a meeting for TIME . He and a friend , PERSON , picked up X by car . X was accompanied by Y , a colleague in plain clothes . The CARDINAL of them drove to a petrol station where a meeting had been arranged with ORG to buy drugs . The applicant and Y went inside the petrol station while X remained outside and talked to ORG As the deal got underway in the car park of the petrol station , the case prosecutor and QUANTITY police officers suddenly intervened and arrested the applicant , ORG and PERSON In the car driven by ORG the police found CARDINAL ecstasy tablets . The offence report drafted on the spot by the police was signed by everyone , including the applicant , without any objection . The police operation was recorded on video .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted with ORG and PERSON for trafficking \u201c high risk \u201d drugs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and ORG testified before ORG . The applicant averred that he had acted as an intermediary for the meeting and subsequent deal between ORG and X because the latter had asked him whether he could get drugs for him . Moreover , X had set the price for the drugs . ORG stated that the drugs found on him had been for his own personal use and that he had had no intention of selling them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer argued before the court that the applicant had in fact been incited by X to act as an intermediary in the drug deal and requested that X be called to give evidence , along with CARDINAL witnesses in the applicant \u2019s defence . The court allowed the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court heard evidence from X , PERSON and one of the witnesses proposed by the applicant who appeared in court . X stated that the applicant had called him in order to arrange the drug deal without any incitement on his part . The applicant \u2019s lawyer had the opportunity to cross - examine X. He asked whether the reports of DATE and DATE had been signed by him and whether the criminal investigation had already been open when he had been authorised to investigate undercover . The CARDINAL questions were disallowed by the court because they were considered an attempt to disclose X \u2019s identity .", "CARDINAL . The Buz\u0103u County Court gave judgment on DATE . It convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The conviction was based on the reports of DATE and CARDINAL DATE and the offence report of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , as well as on transcripts of the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations with X , ambient recordings of discussions between X and ORG and the in - court testimonies given by the applicant , the codefendants and X. The court considered that the applicant \u2019s allegations that he had been incited by X were clearly disproved by the abovementioned evidence taken as a whole .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment . He alleged that X had exceeded his authority and that Y should have also been called to testify in court . He also claimed that X had incited him to commit the offence under coercion and that the first - instance court had failed to respond appropriately to his arguments on that issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ploie\u015fti Court of Appeal rejected the appeal . In reply to the applicant \u2019s arguments , the court held that the authorisation and actions of the undercover police officer had been in accordance with the law . The statement of Y was irrelevant to the case since he had not directly witnessed the deal . The court considered that the applicant had not been incited by X since it was apparent from the evidence in the file that he had called the officer on several occasions and had planned the meeting of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( recurs ) , reiterating his previous arguments .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG and Justice dismissed the appeal on points of law . Basing its findings on the reports of DATE and DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court considered that there had been serious reason to suspect that the applicant would commit a criminal offence at the time of authorisation of the covert operation . It further noted that it was apparent from the documents in the file that X had acted lawfully . In addition , the information collected by PERSON and the applicant \u2019s active participation in the crime in question were supported not only by the police reports , but also by transcripts of the telephone conversations that the applicant had with ORG and X. The court stated that it was clearly apparent from those transcripts that the applicant had initiated calls to X on CARDINAL occasions in order to act as an intermediary in the drug deal . It also noted on this point that the applicant and the other co - defendants had signed the offence report without any objection ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant \u2019s allegations concerning the unlawfulness of the covert operation and the police incitement were therefore considered to be ill - founded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
