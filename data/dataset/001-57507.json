The second applicant , PERSON the Sixth Duke of GPE , resides at GPE . The third applicant , PERSON , is a chartered accountant resident in GPE . The fourth applicant , Sir PERSON , is a banker in GPE . The fourth applicant was appointed as trustee on DATE in place of the third applicant , who retired .", "In the area of GPE in LOC , upon a site which was once farmland on the outskirts of GPE , the GPE family and its trustees have developed a large ORG comprising CARDINAL houses which has become one of the most desirable residential areas in the capital . The applicants , as trustees , have been deprived of their ownership of a number of properties in this Estate through the exercise by the occupants of rights of acquisition conferred by LAW DATE , as amended .", "CARDINAL . This legislation confers on tenants residing in houses held on \" long leases \" ( over , or renewed for periods totalling over , DATE ) at \" low rents \" the right to purchase compulsorily the \" freehold \" of the property ( the ground landlord \u2019s interest ) on prescribed terms and subject to certain prescribed conditions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL below ) . Under the system of long leaseholds , a tenant will typically purchase a long lease of property for a capital sum and pay a small or even nominal rent for it thereafter . The lease is a real - property interest , registerable in ORG . The legislation in issue in the present case is not concerned with the ordinary system of rented tenure under which the tenant pays a \" rack rent \" reflecting the full DATE value of the property . The landlord / tenant relationship under the ordinary system is regulated , for houses under a certain ( rateable ) value , by separate legislation in the form of ORG , which provide machinery for fixing \" fair rents \" and provide certain security of tenure for tenants .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL principal forms of long lease of residential property exist .", "The first is a building lease , typically for DATE , under which the tenant pays a \" ground rent \" - a low rent fixed by reference to the value of the bare site - and undertakes to erect a house on the site and in general also to deliver it up in good repair at the end of the lease .", "The second is a premium lease where the tenant pays the landlord a capital sum or \" premium \" for a house provided by the landlord , and thereafter a rent . The duration of the lease is variable , as are the relative proportions of premium and rent . According to evidence submitted to the ORG , the premium charged will typically take into account the building cost and an appropriate profit element . Factors entering into the calculation will normally include the length of the proposed lease , its terms ( for example , whether sub - letting is allowed ) and the state of the property at the time when the lease is granted . The method used to calculate the premiums under the leases concerned in the present case is described below ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The distinction between the CARDINAL types of lease is not clear - cut . For example , a \" premium lease \" may contain an obligation to carry out substantial repairs , alterations , additions or improvements to an existing property , and thus be analogous to a building lease . In any event , it is the almost invariable practice for the lease to contain a clause making the tenant responsible for all running repairs to the house during the currency of the lease and requiring him to yield up the property at the end of the lease in good repair .", "The tenant holding a property under a long lease may normally sell the lease to a third party , who then acquires the tenant \u2019s rights and obligations under the lease for the remainder of its duration . In practice , leases are commonly bought and sold on the property market without the landlord playing any part in the transaction . A tenant may normally also grant an \" under - lease \" of the property . As a matter of law , however , whether there is a right to sell the lease or sublet depends on the terms of the particular lease .", "CARDINAL . The capital value of the landlord \u2019s interest in a property let on a long lease arises from CARDINAL sources : firstly , the rent payable under the lease and , secondly , the prospect of reversion of the property to him at the end of the lease . At the beginning of a very long lease the value of the reversion may be very little and the total market value of the landlord \u2019s interest may therefore amount to little more than the capitalised value of the rent . The capital value of the tenant \u2019s interest arises from his right to occupy the house under the lease , and the time for which that right will subsist is of critical importance in relation to its value . At the beginning of a very long lease , the value of the tenant \u2019s interest may be more or less equivalent to a \" freehold \" interest if the rent payable is a nominal one .", "The lease , however , is a wasting asset . As a lease progresses , the value of the tenant \u2019s interest in the property diminishes , whilst the value of the landlord \u2019s interest increases . At the end of the lease , the tenant \u2019s interest ceases to exist and the buildings , including improvements and repairs made , revert to the landlord without any compensation to the tenant .", "The sum of the values of the landlord \u2019s and tenant \u2019s respective interests is less than the freehold value of the property with vacant possession , since neither the landlord alone nor the tenant alone can offer a third party the freehold with such possession . If , however , the reversion is sold to the occupying tenant , who can then merge both interests into a simple freehold , its value is greater than the investment value to a third party purchasing the reversion subject to the existing lease . In free market transactions , it is usual for the vendor and the purchaser to share this additional value , known as the \" merger value \" , in agreed proportions .", "CARDINAL . The long - leasehold system of tenure has been widely used in GPE and GPE , and in particular was associated with much urban development in DATE following the industrial revolution .", "CARDINAL . From DATE , demands began to be made for \" leasehold enfranchisement \" , that is the right for tenants to purchase compulsorily the freehold of their holdings . CARDINAL , a number of unsuccessful ORG to grant some measure of leasehold enfranchisement were introduced into ORG .", "CARDINAL . Demand for reform of the law revived soon after the Second World War and in DATE a ORG ( ORG ) was appointed by the Lord Chancellor to consider various aspects of the leasehold question .", "In their report , presented to ORG in DATE ( ORG Paper Cmd CARDINAL ) , the majority of the ORG came out against giving tenants a right of enfranchisement . They concluded that there were both general objections of principle and practical obstacles to such a course of action . They further believed that \" leasehold enfranchisement ... would not be in the public interest \" ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . They did , however , recommend that occupying tenants of houses under a certain rateable value should have security of tenure under LAW .", "The minority report of the ORG drew attention to the strong and bitter sense of injustice felt by long leaseholders in the case of building leases and recommended that certain occupying tenants should have a right of leasehold enfranchisement by compulsory purchase .", "ORG did not have time to put forward any permanent legislation following the ORG report . ORG elected in DATE accepted the majority view of ORG , and its recommendations were enacted in the Landlord and Tenant Act DATE ( \" the CARDINAL Act \" ) . In broad terms , the effect of this LAW was - and still is - that on the expiry of a long residential lease the tenant should have the right to continue occupying the house as a sitting tenant under ORG , paying a \" fair rent \" as defined in those Acts and enjoying the security of tenure afforded by the ordinary rent legislation . This privilege is transferable on death to other members of the tenant \u2019s family residing in the property .", "CARDINAL . Public discussion of the matter continued . In DATE , claims were made in ORG that leaseholders were being subjected to hardship as a result of the onerous terms which landlords were asking for the sale of reversions or for the extension or renewal of existing leases . Enquiries were made by the Government who invited the bodies representing professions most experienced in the field ( solicitors , surveyors , auctioneers , estate and property agents ) to report on the practice of ground landlords in this respect . In DATE , a ORG was published presenting a summary of their assessments ( ORG Paper Cmnd DATE ) . In general , the professional bodies appeared to find that the existing system worked adequately , although there was widespread dissatisfaction among tenants as to the limited nature of the interest they held .", "CARDINAL . For DATE compulsory enfranchisement had been part of ORG policy . After the election of a ORG in DATE , a further ORG was published in DATE setting out the ORG \u2019s proposals for reform including a scheme of compulsory enfranchisement ( ORG in GPE and GPE - Command Paper Cmnd CARDINAL ) . The grounds on which the Government considered reform to be necessary were set out as follows :", "\" The purpose", "CARDINAL . This White Paper is concerned with residential long leases particularly those granted originally in DATE . In the case of long leases , experience has shown that the system has worked very unfairly against the occupying leaseholder . The freeholder has provided the land ; but in the great majority of cases it is the leaseholder or his predecessor in title who at their own expense have built the house on the land . Whether this is so or not in all cases , it is almost universally true that over DATE it is the lessee and his predecessors who have borne the cost of improvements and maintenance , and these will probably have cost far more than the original building itself . At their expense the leaseholders have preserved it as a habitable dwelling and have used it as such , and not unnaturally , an occupying leaseholder who at the end of the term has lived in it for such a period of years regards it as his family home . It is in such cases quite indefensible , if justice is to be done as between freeholder and occupying leaseholder , that at the end of the term , the law should allow the ownership of the house to revert to the freeholder without his paying anything for it so that he gets not only the land but also the house , the improvements and everything the leaseholder and his predecessors have added to it .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has decided that a solution must be found to right this injustice . In the ORG \u2019s view the basic principle of a reform which will do justice between the parties should be that the freeholder owns the land and the occupying leaseholder is morally entitled to the ownership of the building which has been put on and maintained on that land .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL circumstances make reform a matter of urgency . First , most people buy their house on mortgage and for them the leasehold system works particularly harshly . A purchaser on mortgage may pay virtually the freehold price for a lease with DATE to run but as he reaches the end of his mortgage term he will feel a sharpening sense of injustice . He will realise that after he has discharged the mortgage he will have an interest far less valuable than it was when he bought it , and difficult to sell because a subsequent purchaser may not be able to get a mortgage . This is the reality now confronting many owner occupiers who purchased their houses on setting up home immediately after the war . Second , a great many leasehold estates were built in DATE when landowners used their monopoly power to prevent development taking place on other than leasehold terms . This occurred particularly in GPE and in some NORP areas . These leases are beginning to fall in and the leaseholders are now experiencing the full harshness of the leasehold system .", "The Plan", "CARDINAL . The ORG will , therefore , introduce a PERSON to give leaseholders with an original long lease greater security and to enable them to acquire the freehold on fair terms . The PERSON will be based on the principle that the land belongs in equity to the landowner and the house belongs in equity to the occupying leaseholder . It follows that the leaseholder will have the right to retain his house after the lease expires and the right to enfranchise his lease . \"", "The White Paper contained details of the Government \u2019s proposals to allow certain qualified leaseholders to acquire the freehold or obtain a DATE extension of their existing lease . The Government \u2019s proposals as to the terms of enfranchisement were explained as follows in DATE and CARDINAL of the White Paper :", "\" CARDINAL . Subject to provision for special cases , a qualified leaseholder will have the right at any time during the original term of the lease to acquire the freehold by buying out the landlord compulsorily . It is important to ensure that the price paid for enfranchisement is a fair price . But present market prices reflect the position under the present law which is inequitable to the leaseholder , and the price for enfranchisement must accordingly be based not on present market values but on the value of the land itself , including any development value attaching to it . The price of enfranchisement must be calculated in accordance with the principle that in equity the bricks and mortar belong to the qualified leaseholder and the land to the landlord .", "CARDINAL . It follows , and the PERSON will so provide , that where there is no development value ( and often there will not be ) the fair price for enfranchisement will be the value of the freehold interest of the site , subject to the lease and its extension of DATE . This will completely disregard the value of the building on reversion . \"", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , following their re - election in DATE , ORG introduced a LAW into ORG to give effect to their proposals . During the ORG proceedings , ORG accepted the principle , enunciated in their DATE Election Manifesto , that there should be legislation \" to allow ground leaseholders to buy or rent their houses on fair terms except where the property is to be developed \" , but they opposed the terms in the LAW as being confiscatory . They argued that the case for basing the price of enfranchisement solely on the site value rested on a wholly false argument that the house belonged to the leaseholder . In fact , he had only purchased a right to live in it for a specified period . Market prices should be paid for what belonged to the landlords .", "In the parliamentary debates on the PERSON , members of all political parties expressed the view that LAW , which provides security of tenure ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , had not succeeded in relieving the hardship or injustice caused to tenants at the expiry of long leases . CARDINAL of the reasons given were the continuing liability of the tenant to pay freshly assessed rents and the potential burden of heavy claims for dilapidations which some landlords used as a means of persuading tenants to give up their statutory right of possession .", "CARDINAL criticism which was made of the provisions of the PERSON was that it did not distinguish between \" deserving \" and \" undeserving \" tenants and did not provide machinery for a court or tribunal to determine whether it was reasonable to make an enfranchisement order in favour of the tenant . The reason given for rejecting this criticism was the concern that , in view of the very large number of houses held on long leases , a system whereby the reasonableness of the enfranchisement would have to be established in each individual case would inevitably give rise to considerable uncertainty , to delay , to litigation in many cases and , no doubt in some tenants , to the feeling that it might be too expensive to venture on the uncertain exercise .", "Another point raised in the debates arose from the fact that , under the PERSON , the right of enfranchisement would be restricted to the tenants of houses under a certain value . It was argued that if the leasehold system worked unjustly for the reasons suggested by the Government , then logically it must work unjustly in respect of all tenants , regardless of the value of the house . The reasons put forward by the Government spokesmen for confining the applicability of the legislation to houses below a certain value were essentially as follows :", "( a ) it was appropriate for legislation improving the position of leaseholders to apply to the same class of property as the Rent Acts ;", "( b ) the Government had tried to define the cases of greatest hardship which justified them in rectifying existing contracts ; the precedent had therefore been followed of the limits set by ORG ; whilst it might be argued on grounds of logic and consistency that no limit should be set , that would involve rectification to an unnecessary degree ;", "( c ) to a degree the Government were influenced by the large capital gains which could be made by some tenants if the limits were removed entirely .", "After extensive debate in both ORG , the PERSON introduced by the Government was duly enacted as LAW DATE . There were about one and a quarter million dwellinghouses occupied by long leaseholders in GPE and GPE in DATE . It was estimated at the time by the Government that all but CARDINAL or MONEY fell within the scope of the enfranchisement scheme introduced by the LAW . Subsequently , as a result of an amendment introduced in DATE , a band of more valuable houses within this remaining CARDINAL or MONEY was also made susceptible of enfranchisement ( see paragraph DATE ( b ) below ) .", "CARDINAL . The legislation governing leasehold enfranchisement now consists of LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" ) , as amended by LAW ( \" LAW \" ) , LAW ( \" LAW \" ) , LAW DATE , LAW ( \" LAW \" ) and ORG DATE . This legislation provides occupying tenants of \" houses \" let on long leases in GPE and GPE with the right to acquire the freehold of the house , or an extended lease , on certain terms and conditions . The term \" house \" , as defined , includes semi - detached and terrace houses but not flats and maisonettes ( section QUANTITY of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The following , in broad terms , are the principal conditions which must be satisfied before the tenant of a house becomes entitled to the right of acquisition conferred by the Act :", "( a ) The tenancy must be a \" long \" tenancy , that is either for a term certain of DATE or more or for a lesser term once it has been renewed for periods totalling over DATE ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "( b ) With certain exceptions not relevant for present purposes , the \" rateable value \" of the house ( that is , the notional DATE rental value fixed for local taxation purposes ) must not exceed \u00a3 MONEY , or \u00a3 MONEY if the house is in LOC ( section CARDINAL of LAW as amended by CARDINAL of LAW ) . The original rateable - value limits fixed in LAW ( \u00a3 CARDINAL and , for GPE , CARDINAL ) were revised ( in effect being raised to \u00a3 MONEY and \u00a3 MONEY , respectively ) by LAW to take account of the country - wide rating revaluation carried out in DATE . LAW further extended the scope of the enfranchisement scheme under LAW by bringing in houses of a still higher rateable value ( MONEY CARDINAL and , for LOC , MONEY CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , in respect of which , however , a different purchase price was payable ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Certain even more valuable properties , being outside the global rateable - value limits , remain outside the ambit of the legislation altogether .", "( c ) The DATE rent must be a \" low \" rent , that is CARDINAL of the rateable value ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "( d ) The tenant must occupy the house as his only or main residence and must have done so for DATE prior to the time when he gives notice of his desire to exercise his rights under the LAW ( section CARDINAL of LAW as amended by section CARDINAL and schedule CARDINAL of the DATE LAW originally provided for a DATE period ) .", "CARDINAL . Where the above conditions are satisfied the tenant has CARDINAL rights :", "( a ) he can obtain a DATE extension of the lease at a rent representing the letting value of the ground ( without buildings ) , the rent being subject to revision after DATE ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) ;", "( b ) he can purchase the freehold on the terms outlined below ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "The tenant can set in motion the procedure for exercising his right to purchase the freehold at any time up to the original term date of the lease , but not thereafter ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . No price or premium is payable for an extended lease other than the rent .", "On the purchase of a freehold , a price is payable to the landlord as determined in accordance with CARDINAL or other of CARDINAL bases of valuation . These are referred to as the \" DATE basis of valuation \" , which was introduced by LAW ( as amended by LAW ) , and the \" DATE basis of valuation \" , which was introduced by LAW . The DATE basis applies to less valuable properties , and the DATE basis to the small percentage of more valuable properties ( see paragraphs CARDINAL in fine and CARDINAL ( b ) above ) brought within the scope of the legislation for the first time by LAW . The essential features of the CARDINAL bases of valuation may be summarised as follows :", "( a ) The DATE basis of valuation applies to properties with a rateable value of MONEY CARDINAL , or \u00a3 MONEY if the house is in LOC . The price payable is the amount which the house , if sold on the open market by a willing seller , might be expected to realise on the assumptions , inter alia , that ( i ) the tenant has exercised his statutory right to obtain an extension of the lease for DATE , and ( ii ) the purchaser is someone other than the tenant ( section QUANTITY of LAW , section CARDINAL of the DATE Act and section CARDINAL of LAW ) . The effect of the assumption as to the extension of the lease is that the tenant pays approximately the site value , and pays nothing for the buildings on the site . The assumption that the purchaser is someone other than the tenant , introduced by LAW , also excludes any element of \" merger value \" from the price ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . This basis of valuation reflects the policy outlined in the DATE ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "( b ) The DATE basis of valuation applies to properties with rateable values of MONEY and MONEY CARDINAL , or MONEY and up to \u00a3 CARDINAL,CARDINAL if the house is in LOC . The price payable is the amount which the house , if sold on the open market by a willing seller , might be expected to realise on the assumption , inter alia , that at the end of the tenancy the tenant had the right to remain in possession of the house under LAW , that is as a statutory tenant paying a \" fair rent \" reflecting his occupation of the house ( see paragraph CARDINAL above - section CARDINAL of LAW as amended by CARDINAL of LAW ) . In principle , this basis of valuation is more favourable to the landlord and is intended to provide a price approximately equivalent to the market value of the site and house , assuming it to be tenanted under LAW ; it also allows the landlord a share of the \" merger value \" .", "However , in a case where a tenant had obtained a DATE extension of the lease and subsequently , before expiry of the original term date of the tenancy , applied for the freehold , it was held by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that the assessment of the compensation had to be on the basis of the tenant having extended his lease ( PERSON v. Phillimore ORG ( DATE ) ORG , PERSON . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . In such circumstances , therefore , the landlord receives substantially less than the above market value in compensation . The Government recognised at the hearings before the ORG that this decision had identified a loophole in LAW that needed to be cured by amending legislation . The ORG has since been informed by the ORG that the decision of ORG has been set down for appeal .", "Special provisions apply for extinguishing any intermediate lease where the occupying tenant claiming enfranchisement does not hold his lease direct from the freeholder ( schedule CARDINAL to LAW ) . These provisions do not , however , appear to be relevant in the present case .", "CARDINAL . The tenant may , at any time before the price of the property has been fixed , institute a procedure to have the rateable value of the house adjusted for the purposes of the legislation so as to leave out of account the value of structural improvements carried out by himself or his predecessors ( section CARDINAL and schedule CARDINAL of LAW ) . ORG is competent to determine disputes as to whether improvements are within the scope of the scheme and , since LAW came into force , there has been a right of appeal to ORG from such decisions .", "CARDINAL . The legislation lays down procedures for carrying the relevant transactions into effect and for determining disputes . Where the tenant wishes to acquire the freehold , he must first give the landlord written notice of his desire to do so ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . Disputes over the tenant \u2019s entitlement to acquire the freehold under the LAW and related matters are within the jurisdiction of ORG ( section DATE CARDINAL Act ) . In such proceedings , ORG has powers to penalise in costs a tenant who is guilty of unreasonable delay or default in the performance of the obligations arising from the notice of enfranchisement ( ibid . ) . In default of agreement , the price payable is now subject to determination by a local ORG , with a right of appeal to the GPE - based ORG which forms part of ORG ( section CARDINAL and schedule CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) . Before the CARDINAL Act came into force , disputes as to price were within the jurisdiction of ORG ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . It is open to a landlord who believes that the enfranchising tenant is deliberately or unnecessarily delaying the process of enfranchisement to refer the matter to ORG ( or , formerly , to ORG ) . Regulations prescribe a timetable for completion of the purchase after the price has been determined ( paragraph CARDINAL of Part I of the schedule to LAW Regulations DATE , ORG No . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . For the purpose of assessing the price payable , the house is valued as at the date of the tenant \u2019s notice to the landlord of his desire to acquire the freehold ( sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( d ) of LAW ) , and not as at the date when the valuation is being carried out .", "CARDINAL . In transactions completed DATE and DATE , the tenants of some CARDINAL long leasehold properties forming part of the residential Estate in GPE ( GPE ) which the GPE family and its trustees have developed ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) exercised their powers under the contested legislation to acquire compulsorily the applicants\u2019 interest as freehold owners of the properties . These transactions related to CARDINAL properties held on \" premium \" leases and CARDINAL properties held on \" building \" leases ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicants explained that under the practice followed by ORG , the premiums were calculated on the following basis : first the rent under the lease was fixed as a percentage of the estimated market rent obtainable and then the premium was the calculated capitalised value of the balance of the estimated market rent over the term of the lease . The relevant properties were valued on the DATE basis in CARDINAL transactions and on the DATE basis in CARDINAL transactions ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "As time passes , according to the applicants , LAW will affect an increasingly higher ratio of properties on their ORG . Since DATE , another CARDINAL enfranchisements have taken place , bringing up to a total of CARDINAL the number of properties enfranchised on the ORG under the leasehold reform legislation to date . The applicants estimate that there are likely to be CARDINAL further enfranchisements on their Estate in the future .", "CARDINAL . In each of the CARDINAL transactions the subject of the present case , the price paid was fixed by negotiation . The applicants were advised by their legal advisers that they had no grounds for disputing the right of any of the tenants to acquire the freehold , and that they could not reasonably hope to obtain a higher price for any of the relevant properties in proceedings before ORG or , in respect of the more recent transactions , a ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants drew attention to the following features of the individual transactions in question :", "( i ) in no case except CARDINAL was the property built either by the tenant who enfranchised or by the tenant \u2019s predecessors ;", "( ii ) in CARDINAL cases was the property occupied by members of the tenant \u2019s family continuously since the date of creation of the lease ;", "( iii ) the period of occupation of the tenant prior to the date of his or her notice to acquire had varied from TIME ; in CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL instances , it had been DATE ;", "( iv ) in all the cases , the tenant was entitled to security of tenure , subject to the conditions laid down by ORG , upon expiry of the lease ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ;", "( v ) the period between the tenant \u2019s notice ( the relevant date for assessment of the price - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and completion of the sale varied between one and DATE , and in CARDINAL of the CARDINAL transactions was DATE ;", "( vi ) the unencumbered freehold value of the properties ( as assessed by the applicants ) varied from MONEY CARDINAL,CARDINAL , whereas the price paid for enfranchisement by the tenant varied from MONEY CARDINAL ;", "( vii ) the value of the unexpired portion of the lease to the tenants was said to be up to \u00a3 MONEY - without taking into account the right to enfranchise ;", "( viii ) in CARDINAL cases , the tenant sold the lease , after making the claim but before enfranchising , with the benefit of the right to enfranchise ;", "( ix ) in CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL cases , the tenant who enfranchised did not remain in occupation of the property , but sold the freehold within DATE of acquiring it , and in CARDINAL of these cases did not occupy after enfranchisement at all ;", "( x ) the profits said to have been made by the tenants on such onward sale varied from \u00a3 CARDINAL,CARDINAL to \u00a3 CARDINAL,CARDINAL , with CARDINAL cases where the tenant made MONEY ; in particular in CARDINAL case , the tenant who had come into occupation DATE before publication of the DATE ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) - and who had paid a low price ( \u00a3 MONEY ) for the lease , without prospect of enfranchisement at that time - was able to buy the freehold at MONEY of its proper value ( as assessed by the applicants ) , and sold it DATE for a profit of CARDINAL per cent - a profit of \u00a3 MONEY .", "The losses claimed by the applicants to have been sustained through having to sell on the statutory terms as opposed to open - market conditions range from MONEY CARDINAL on each transaction , and total CARDINAL for properties in respect of which the DATE basis of valuation obtained and \u00a3 MONEY for properties in respect of which the DATE basis of valuation obtained ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "14", "6", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
