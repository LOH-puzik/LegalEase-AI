MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a private company located in the town of PERSON , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Housing Secretary of GPE issued a requisition order in respect of a tenement in PERSON . The applicant company occupied the tenement in question . The requisition order had the effect of protecting its occupation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the owners of the tenement , the PERSON brothers , instituted civil proceedings before ORG against the ORG Secretary and the applicant company . They requested that the requisition order of DATE be declared null and void as being contrary to section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW , and sought to regain possession of the tenement . They also requested compensation for the damage allegedly sustained .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the ORG claim .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON brothers appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE , ORG declared that the requisition order was null and void and ordered that the appellants be given possession of the LOC within DATE . It sent the case back to ORG regarding compensation for the damage allegedly sustained by the appellants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged an application with ORG for a new trial . It alleged that the judgment of DATE had been based on a wrong application of the law , as the requisition order had been issued in the public interest and the powers of the ORG Secretary in this field could not be reviewed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON brothers intervened in the proceedings , requesting that the application be rejected . They argued that the law had in fact been duly applied and interpreted and that the applicant company was trying to lodge another appeal , inadmissible under NORP law , against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG invited the parties to file written submissions and adjourned the case to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company filed a note of submissions in which it requested , inter alia , that the judges of ORG examining the request for a retrial withdraw from the case , as they were the same judges who had sat on the bench when the impugned judgment of DATE had been delivered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s plea challenging the judges . It also observed that , under Article CARDINAL of LAW \u2013 \u201c the COCP \u201d ) , where the ground for a judicial request was the wrong application of the law , the relevant party should make reference to the law which should have been applied . As the applicant company had failed to do so , its submissions were manifestly defective .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s request for a new trial .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant company had initiated proceedings in FAC sitting in its constitutional capacity . It alleged that the decision taken by the CARDINAL judges composing ORG rejecting the plea for their withdrawal had violated LAW , as the court in question could not be considered an \u201c impartial tribunal \u201d within the meaning of that provision .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG found for the applicant company and declared that the failure to withdraw by the judges composing ORG had violated LAW . It observed that the same judges had been called upon to rule twice on a case concerning the same facts and the same parties . Moreover , in a judgment given on DATE in PERSON v. the Honourable Prime Minister , ORG had held that LAW in accordance with which the same judges may sit when the request for a new trial is based on an alleged wrong application of the law ) was contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON brothers appealed to ORG . They alleged , in particular , that the question dealt with by ORG when examining the request for a retrial , namely whether there had been a wrong application of the law , was not in any way connected with the merits previously dealt with by the same court .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG allowed the appeal , set aside the judgment of DATE and rejected all the pleas raised by the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court observed that the possibility of a new trial provided the remedy of revision of a final judgment in order to rectify evident and gross errors leading to a miscarriage of justice . However , NORP law restricted the application of this remedy to specific situations . As a retrial was an extraordinary remedy which entailed a derogation from the principle that res judicata decisions were legally binding between the parties , the relevant legal provisions had always been interpreted restrictively .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law , a new trial could be conducted by the same court that had pronounced the judgment complained of , and the same judges could sit . This meant that the judges were given the option of deciding whether to hear the case or not . In ORG view , this rule was consistent with the Convention and justified by the fact that a retrial was not a third - instance procedure and that the court that had pronounced the judgment was in the best position to identify any mistake and to grant expeditiously an appropriate and fast remedy .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that , when a request for a new trial appeared unfounded and was accompanied by a dubious demand that the judges withdraw , it was likely that an abuse of the judicial system might occur . This would be prejudicial to the other party , who had the right to have his or her case heard within a reasonable time . After the delivery of its judgment in PERSON ( cited above ) , ORG had observed a systematic abuse of the remedy of retrial . In particular , some parties had been attempting to obtain a third - instance appeal in cases in which a final decision had already been made .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to avoid such abuses , the NORP courts had interpreted the judgment in PERSON to mean that the judges who had previously adjudicated the case should examine the admissibility of the request for a retrial in order to determine whether it met the requirements laid down in domestic law . If it did , they should withdraw ; if it did not , they should simply reject the request . ORG considered that these principles were correct and in conformity with LAW .", "CARDINALbefore it , ORG found that there were reasons to believe that the applicant company was trying to prolong the proceedings in order to delay vacating the LOC for as long as possible and that its request for a retrial was procedurally inadmissible . In particular , the request did not correctly quote the section of law which , according to the applicant company , had been wrongly applied , it did not indicate which provision ought to have been applied , and it was essentially based on the assumption that ORG had given a wrong interpretation of the notion of \u201c public interest \u201d . The admissibility examination by the CARDINAL judges of ORG had dealt merely with points of fact and had therefore been different in nature from the examination by the same judges previously .", "CARDINAL . Finally , there were no grounds to believe that the judges in question had some personal or real interest in the outcome of the case other than that of ensuring that justice was done .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction are provided for in the NORP legal system : first instance and appeal . There is no third level of jurisdiction such as a court of cassation . However , the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure ( \u201c the COCP \u201d ) afforded the possibility of a retrial .", "CARDINAL . The grounds for a new trial are set out in an exhaustive list which appears in LAW . The relevant part of this provision reads as follows :", "\u201c A new trial of a cause decided by a judgment given in second instance may be demanded by any of the parties concerned , such judgment being first set aside , in any of the following cases :", "( a ) where the judgment was obtained by fraud on the part of any of the parties to the prejudice of the other party ;", "( b ) where the writ of summons was not served on the party cast , provided that , notwithstanding such omission , such party shall not have entered an appearance at the trial ;", "( c ) where any of the parties to the suit was under legal disability to sue or be sued , provided no plea thereanent had been raised and determined ;", "( d ) where the judgment was delivered by a court having no jurisdiction in terms of LAW ( a ) , provided no plea thereanent had been raised and determined ;", "( e ) where the judgment contains a wrong application of the law ;", "For the purposes of this paragraph there shall be deemed to be a wrong application of the law only where the decision , assuming the fact to be as established in the judgment which it is sought to set aside , is not in accordance with the law , provided the issue was not in reference to an interpretation of the law expressly dealt with in the judgment ;", "( f ) where judgment was given on any matter not included in the demand ;", "( g ) where judgment was given in excess of the demand ;", "( h ) where the judgment is conflicting with a previous judgment given in a suit on the same subject matter and between the same parties , and constituting a res judicata , provided no plea of res judicata had been raised and determined ;", "( i ) where the judgment contains contradictory dispositions ;", "( j ) where the judgment was based on evidence which , in a subsequent judgment , was declared to be false or which was so declared in a previous judgment but the party cast was not aware of such fact ;", "( k ) where , after the judgment , some conclusive document was obtained , of which the party producing it had no knowledge , or which , with the means provided by law , he could not have produced , before the judgment ;", "( l ) where the judgment was the effect of an error resulting from the proceedings or documents of the cause .", "For the purposes of this paragraph there shall be deemed to be such error only where the decision is based on the supposition of some fact the truth whereof is incontestably excluded , or on the supposition of the non - existence of some fact the truth whereof is positively established , provided that , in either case , the fact was not a disputed issue determined by the judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW COCP , a request for a new trial must be made to the court by which the judgment complained of was given , and the same judges \u201c may \u201d sit . Article CARDINAL of the ORG sets out the contents of an application for a retrial . The plaintiff must , in particular , state the provisions of the judgment complained of , the grounds for a new trial and the facts giving rise to each ground . Where the ground is the wrong application of the law , as provided for in LAW , he or she must refer to the law that should have been applied .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW COCP ,", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The time for demanding a new trial is DATE , which shall commence to run \u2013", "( a ) in regard to the cases referred to in LAW ( a ) and ( k ) , from DATE on which the fraud was discovered , or the document obtained ;", "( b ) in regard to the case referred to in paragraph ( b ) , from DATE on which the plaintiff became aware of the judgment ;", "( c ) in regard to the cases referred to in paragraph ( j ) , if the falsity was , at the suit or complaint of the plaintiff himself , declared subsequently to the judgment complained of , from DATE of such declaration , and if it was declared subsequently to such judgment , but at the suit or complaint of other parties , or if it was declared previously , from DATE on which the plaintiff became aware of such declaration ;", "( d ) in regard to all other cases , from the date of the judgment complained of .", "( CARDINAL ) A new trial may in no case be demanded after the lapse of DATE from which the first judgment was given . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a decision given on DATE in A v. B , ORG held that the possibility of a retrial was an extraordinary remedy for the exceptional cases stated in the law .
