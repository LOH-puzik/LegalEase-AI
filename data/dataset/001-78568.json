The CARDINAL applicants , whose names are listed in the appendix , are the descendants of some of the co - owners of a plot of land of QUANTITY in GPE , on LOC coast .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG , ruling on an application for partition of real estate consisting of QUANTITY of land on LOC coast and appurtenant buildings , formerly the property of the late PERSON , noted that some of the heirs had sold their shares of the estate to PERSON , who therefore remained a co - owner of the property in common with CARDINAL other heirs .", "CARDINAL . With a view to taking the property out of common ownership , ORG divided it into CARDINAL shares , of which CARDINAL were allocated to PERSON , the CARDINAL other heirs being assigned either CARDINAL , CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the property .", "CARDINAL . Following a further purchase of shares in the estate , PERSON became the owner of CARDINAL of the property , which was now owned in common with CARDINAL other heirs .", "CARDINAL . By Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG , on a proposal by ORG , expropriated the land in question on public - interest grounds , together with an adjoining plot of land belonging to a third party , with a view to building a military base .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , once the plan to build a military base had been abandoned , ORG took possession of a large portion of the land that had belonged to PERSON and the other co - owners , while other parts were transformed following consolidation works on the cliff or were allocated to private individuals to build housing .", "CARDINAL . Following proceedings for the recovery of possession of the plot adjoining the land that had belonged to PERSON and the other co - owners , ORG ruled in a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE that Decree no . PERSON contravened LAW as in force on the date of the expropriation , and ordered the return of the land to the heir of its former owner . The court held , firstly , that the plan to build a military base had been abandoned shortly after the expropriation and , secondly , that the former owner had not received any compensation for the expropriation of his property .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , as the children and heirs of PERSON , who had died in DATE , brought an action against PERSON and PERSON , alleging that they had illegally taken possession of a plot of land measuring QUANTITY . m at CARDINAL NORP Street , on part of the land that had formerly belonged to PERSON . The applicants submitted that the plot in question was part of the land of which PERSON had been allocated a CARDINAL share by ORG in DATE and that the ORG had never had valid title to it .", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON applied for the case to be struck out on the ground that the applicants lacked the capacity to take proceedings , firstly because the land in question had been expropriated before PERSON death , and secondly because they had not formally accepted their ascendant 's estate . They submitted that the action was in any event inadmissible in that it had been brought solely by PERSON heirs , without the consent of the heirs of the CARDINAL other co - owners .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL other applicants , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , ORG , PERSON , PERSON , GPE , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , ORG , PERSON and PERSON , the heirs of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL co - owners in question , applied to join the action , asserting their rights over the plot of land forming the subject matter of the proceedings . They instructed PERSON , the first applicant , to represent them .", "CARDINAL . According to the information provided by the applicants , the heir of CARDINAL of the former co - owners refused to join their action , while the heirs of another former co - owner could not be traced .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG , finding that the first CARDINAL applicants had proved that they were the heirs of PERSON and that the latter had owned a CARDINAL share of the estate of PERSON , dismissed PERSON and PERSON first objection .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the court held that the land in issue had not belonged exclusively to PERSON , who had merely been CARDINAL of the co - owners . Accordingly , observing that the consent of the heirs of CARDINAL of the co - owners had not been obtained , the court declared the main action and the application to join the proceedings inadmissible on the ground that , since it entailed a legal transaction disposing of property , an action for recovery of possession of property held in undivided shares could be brought only with the consent of all the co - owners . However , the applicants ' shares represented only CARDINAL of the property in issue .", "CARDINAL . Arguing that it was not necessary to obtain the consent of all the co - owners since the action for recovery of possession was for the benefit of all of them , the applicants appealed against the judgment to ORG . A hearing was held on DATE , in the absence of the first applicant , and delivery of the judgment was adjourned until DATE , despite a request for additional time which the first applicant maintained he had made in order to be able to instruct a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal . In its judgment it noted , firstly , that in its DATE judgment ORG had not formally divided the co - owned property into individual parts , with the result that it was still held in common despite the creation of shares . It further observed that it was common knowledge that an action for recovery of possession of property held in undivided shares could not be brought by CARDINAL of the co - owners without the others ' consent , since the aim of such an action was not only to protect the ownership of shares but also to secure recognition of title to the property as a whole and its return to the claimant .", "CARDINALOn that account , they informed ORG that the heir of CARDINAL of the former co - owners had refused to take part in the proceedings although he had been notified of their existence , and that it had been impossible to obtain the other heirs ' consent as they were scattered across various countries .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the application , holding that the applicants could not seek recovery of a property held in undivided shares to the detriment and in breach of the rights of the heirs of the other co - owners .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON brought an action against a commercial company , PERSON , for recovery of possession of a plot of land measuring CARDINAL sq . m at CARDINAL NORP Street , which occupied part of the land that had formed the subject of ORG DATE judgment . They also sought the annulment of the contract signed in DATE by which the company had purchased the land from a third party , asserting that that party had never had valid title to the land in issue .", "CARDINAL . The commercial company objected that the action was inadmissible in that it had been brought solely by PERSON heirs .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the company 's objection and declared the action inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the judgment given by ORG in DATE had merely allocated PERSON shares of the land that had belonged to PERSON and that the land had not subsequently been divided into individual parts .", "CARDINAL . Observing that the aim of an action for recovery of possession of a property held in undivided shares was not only to protect the ownership of a share of the property but also to secure recognition of title to the property as a whole and its return to the claimant , the court concluded that since they had not obtained the consent of all the heirs of the former co - owners , the applicants were not entitled to seek recovery of the land in issue .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG , which found against them in a judgment of DATE , holding that it was common knowledge that an action for recovery of possession of property held in undivided shares could not be brought by CARDINAL of the co - owners without the others ' consent .", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied to ORG to have that judgment quashed . They submitted that since individual co - owners could sell their shares without the other co - owners ' consent , there was no cause to prohibit a co - owner from seeking recovery of the entire property held in common in order to protect his ownership of his own shares . They argued that , since an action for recovery of possession that resulted in the return of the property to the co - owners benefited all of them , it was unnecessary to obtain the consent of all the co - owners .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , they submitted that regard should be had to the particular circumstances of their case , namely that the property had in their view passed illegally into ORG ownership and that it had been difficult , if not impossible , to identify all the heirs of the former co - owners on account of the social and historical circumstances of the period and the time that had since elapsed .", "CARDINAL . Observing that the proceedings for partition that had ended with ORG judgment of DATE had not resulted in the actual division of the property , ORG ruled that the applicants could not claim exclusive ownership of the land in issue .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , pointing out that the unanimity rule precluded a co - owner from engaging in any transaction entailing the administration or disposal of property held in undivided shares without the other co - owners ' consent , ORG dismissed the application in a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON brought an action against CARDINAL parties for recovery of possession of CARDINAL plots of land measuring CARDINAL sq . m and QUANTITY m at CARDINAL Patriei Street , which occupied part of the land that had formed the subject of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . They submitted that in a DATE decision of ORG one of the third parties had been wrongly granted title to the CARDINAL plots of land , CARDINAL of which had subsequently been sold to the other third party . At the applicants ' request , the action was also directed against ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG objected that the action was inadmissible in that it had been brought by the heirs of only some of the co - owners of the land .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL other applicants , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , ORG , PERSON , PERSON , GPE , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , ORG , PERSON and PERSON , applied to join the action in order to assert their rights over the plots of land forming the subject matter of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG declared the action inadmissible on the ground that the aim of an action for recovery of possession of property held in undivided shares was to secure recognition of exclusive title to the entire property and its return to the claimant .", "CARDINAL . It held that , since they had failed to obtain the consent of all the heirs of the former co - owners , the applicants were not entitled to seek recovery of the plots of land in issue since they were able to claim ownership of only shares of the property .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that judgment to ORG , which found against them on DATE . As ORG had done , it based its conclusion on the finding that it was impossible to seek recovery of possession of property held in undivided shares without the consent of all the co - owners .", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied to ORG to have that judgment quashed . They submitted that since individual co - owners could sell their shares without the other co - owners ' consent , there was no cause to prohibit a co - owner from seeking recovery of the entire property held in common in order to protect his ownership of his own shares . They argued that , since an action for recovery of possession that resulted in the return of the property to the co - owners benefited all of them , it was unnecessary to obtain the consent of all the co - owners .", "CARDINAL . They further submitted that regard should be had to the particular circumstances of their case , namely that the property had in their view passed illegally into ORG ownership and that it had been difficult , if not impossible , to identify all the heirs of the former co - owners on account of the social and historical circumstances of the period and the time that had since elapsed .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , they argued that the requirement to obtain the consent of all the co - owners had ceased to apply following the entry into force of PERSON no . CARDINAL on the legal status of immovable property wrongfully seized by the ORG DATE and DATE , which provided for the possibility of restoring ownership of shares of a property held in common .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed at the outset that the proceedings for partition initiated by ORG judgment of DATE had not resulted in the division of the land . It held that in those circumstances , the applicants ' action did not concern a particular property of which they claimed to be the exclusive owners , but shares that could not be separated from those belonging to the other co - owners .", "CARDINAL . It also dismissed the argument concerning PERSON no . CARDINAL on the ground that the law had not come into force until after the action had been brought in DATE . It pointed out that in any event , the new rule was applicable only in the context of the special procedure provided for in PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , whereas the applicants ' action for recovery of possession had been based on the provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , applying the unanimity rule , ORG dismissed the application in a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Although there was no provision in statute law for the application of the rule that an action for recovery of possession of property held in undivided shares had to be brought by all the co - owners , the former ORG held in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE that a single co - owner could not initiate such an action , stating as follows :", "\u201c ... as long as the property remains co - owned in undivided shares , the co - owners ' rights over it are indeterminate and they can not claim exclusive rights over their shares until after the property has been divided , when each co - owner has been granted exclusive ownership of part of it . It follows that CARDINAL [ individual ] co - owner can not seek recovery of a property held in undivided shares prior to its partition , since an action for recovery of possession implies the existence of an exclusive and determinate right , which a co - owner can acquire only as a result of the partition . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The case - law developed by the former ORG has been adhered to by the courts with very few exceptions , one being a judgment delivered by ORG on DATE . After recapitulating the unanimity rule , the court held :", "\u201c ... in the instant case , and more generally in the case of actions for recovery of possession of property that was nationalised in the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , the legal status of such property and of the persons claiming that it was wrongfully nationalised differs substantially from ordinary cases .", "Former owners or their heirs are precluded from applying for partition of the property before seeking recovery of it by the fact that they do not have title to the property until it has been established that it was wrongfully nationalised and that the ORG does not have valid title to it .", "In such sui generis cases , actions for recovery of possession are complex and go beyond the standard model ; CARDINAL or more co - owners , but not necessarily all of them , may bring a court action seeking a ruling ... that the ORG does not have valid title to the property ... and , consequently , that the wrongfully nationalised property belongs to the owner or his or her heirs . They may subsequently apply for partition of the property . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
