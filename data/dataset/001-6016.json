THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national of NORP origin , born in DATE and was expelled from the GPE to GPE shortly before the introduction of the application . He is represented before the Court by PERSON Later , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant was apprehended and detained for the purposes of establishing his identity , nationality and residence status . On DATE , an order for his expulsion was issued and he was placed in GPE detention for the purposes of expulsion ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) under LAW ( a ) of LAW ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an asylum request and was consequently placed in GPE detention under LAW ( c ) of LAW . On DATE , he filed an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) against his placement in GPE detention and requested this court to award him compensation .", "By decision of CARDINAL DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal of CARDINAL DATE as well as his request for compensation . It held that it had not been argued and that it had not appeared that the applicant \u2019s apprehension and placement in GPE detention had been unlawful . It found established that the applicant did not have a valid residence title or any identity papers and that he did not have sufficient means for his subsistence or to finance his return journey . ORG considered that the serious suspicion expressed by the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) to the effect that the applicant would seek to find ways of avoiding his expulsion were not unfounded . Since the applicant \u2019s statements about the date of his arrival in the GPE were contradictory , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s account that he had only arrived on DATE as not credible . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention was in the interest of public order .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s request for asylum , ORG held that there were no indications that this should be considered as standing chances of success . The applicant \u2019s mere contention that he was a deserter was held to be insufficient for a finding that his request for asylum might be successful . ORG concluded that the ORG Secretary could correctly adopt the position that , pending the proceedings on the asylum request , the applicant should remain in GPE detention .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG declared the applicant \u2019s request for asylum inadmissible on the basis of LAW ( f ) of LAW . In accordance with LAW , the ORG Secretary further ordered that the applicant \u2019s freedom of movement be restricted by assigning him to an asylum seekers centre , this order was to be suspended until the measure of the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention was lifted otherwise than through a departure from the GPE . The applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG .", "As the applicant \u2019s appeal was denied suspensive effect by the ORG Secretary as to his expulsion , the applicant requested the President of ORG on DATE for an injunction on his expulsion pending the appeal proceedings .", "By decision of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , the Acting President of ORG rejected the appeal and the request for an injunction . The Acting President held , insofar as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The president finds that the < ORG Secretary > has correctly declared the asylum request inadmissible pursuant to LAW ( f ) of LAW . He considers on this point that the applicant has made contradictory statements as to the date of entry to the GPE . According to the formal record of findings ( proces - verbaal van bevindingen ) of DATE drafted under oath of office ( ambtseed ) by the GPE police , the applicant stated that he had been in the GPE for DATE . During the questioning in relation to his placement in GPE detention on DATE , the applicant stated that he had been in the GPE for DATE , whereas during the proceedings on the appeal filed against the order on deprivation of liberty under LAW he stated that he had arrived in the GPE on DATE . ... Since the applicant has only filed the request at issue on DATE after having been apprehended on DATE , whereas it has by no means been established on what date the applicant has arrived in the GPE , the president finds that the < ORG Secretary > has declared the request for entry ... inadmissible on reasonable grounds .", "CARDINAL . The inadmissibility of the asylum request ... does not dispense the < ORG Secretary > from the obligation to examine whether the facts and circumstances submitted by the applicant form an obstacle to expelling the applicant to his country of origin if this would be contrary to LAW", "CARDINAL . The president agrees with the < ORG Secretary > that it has not been established that the applicant can be considered as a refugee within the meaning of the Convention < relating to the status of refugees>. It is considered at the outset that there are serious doubts about the sincerity of the applicant \u2019s request for asylum . The applicant submits to fear persecution from the side of the NORP authorities on grounds of evasion of military service . However , the applicant has only invoked the protection of the Convention < relating to the status of refugees > DATE after he had been apprehended , during a public transport check , for travelling without having a valid ticket . This course of action does not indicate that the applicant finds himself in a situation requiring his immediate flight .", "CARDINAL . NORP \u2026 the president considers that the general situation for members of the NORP population in GPE is not such that the fact that an alien belongs to the NORP population group in GPE makes him automatically a refugee . The applicant must therefore make it plausible that there are facts and circumstances relating to his person which justify his fear for persecution within the meaning of < the Convention relating to the status of refugees>.", "CARDINAL . In the president \u2019s opinion , the applicant has failed to do so . The applicant has not made it plausible that he has attracted the negative attention of the authorities of his country of origin . The applicant has declared that he has never been a member of any political party or movement or that he has been engaged in political activities in his country of origin . He has submitted that he was a sympathiser of ORG , but it has not been argued nor has it appeared that through this he has attracted the negative attention of the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s submissions in relation to his refusal to fulfil his military obligations in GPE ... the applicant has attained DATE on DATE , which is the military age in GPE . \u2026 the president finds it sufficiently established that the applicant must fulfil his military obligations and that he is considered in GPE as having refused to do his military service .", "CARDINAL . < This aspect of the case > must be examined in the light of the criteria formulated in the ... decision taken by this court < on DATE > , in which it was held that a draft evader or deserter is a refugee , if he", "a. has a well DATE founded fear of disproportionate or discriminatory punishment or execution of the punishment for refusing military service on grounds of his race , religion , belonging to a particular social group or political conviction , or if , on the basis of the above grounds , he has a well DATE founded fear for a different discriminatory or disproportionate punishment or execution of a punishment ;", "b. has refused < to fulfil military obligations > because he has serious insurmountable conscientious objections on grounds of his religious of other deep - rooted conviction prescribing a refusal to do military service , and where there is no possibility in his country of origin to fulfil instead of military service a non - military service ;", "c. has reached the decision to refuse military service or to desert , because he does not want to become involved in a ( sort of ) military action that has been condemned by the international community as being contrary to the basic principles of humane behaviour or that is in violation of fundamental norms applying during an armed conflict .", "As regards the category under a. ... the president considers that it can not be derived from information known ex officio that the punishment of NORP draft evaders of NORP origin is different from that of other NORP draft evaders . The applicant can not , therefore , be classified as falling within this category .", "As regards the category under b. ... the president considers that the applicant has only submitted during the appeal proceedings that his refusal to do his military service is connected with his NORP origins , without further substantiating this contention . The president finds that what has been submitted on this point is not sufficient for accepting this as a form of conscientious objection within the sense as meant here . ...", "As regards the category under c. the president considers that it has not appeared in the present case that a condemnation by the international community has in fact been made of the military actions in south - east GPE on grounds of being contrary to the basic principles of humane behaviour or on grounds of a violation of fundamental norms applying during an armed conflict . Also in this respect , the applicant \u2019s appeal on grounds of having refused military service fails .", "CARDINAL . ... Having regard to the considerations DATE it has not been established that a forcible return of the applicant to GPE is contrary to LAW . \u201d", "On DATE , after having been notified of this decision on DATE , the applicant filed a second request for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . This request was declared inadmissible by the ORG Secretary on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE , the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG , which did not have suspensive effect as to his expulsion .", "On DATE and accompanied by NORP police officers , the applicant was expelled to GPE . Upon his arrival at the GPE airport he was handed over by the NORP police officers to the NORP authorities .", "The applicant claims that he was blindfolded , placed in a car and driven to a place where he was detained for DATE . During his detention there , the applicant claims that he was interrogated about his knowledge of persons belonging to the ORG and that , during these interrogations , he was subjected to various forms of ill - treatment including beatings , kicking , hosing with pressurised cold water , squeezing of his testicles and branding with a hot iron . After his release from detention , the applicant returned to the GPE on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant was medically examined by a doctor of ORG , who found , inter alia , CARDINAL scars on his back in the form of a horseshoe with a diameter of QUANTITY . These scars were found to be healing first to second degree burn wounds . The doctor concluded that a connection between the scars on the applicant \u2019s back and his account of torture was very plausible and that the applicant \u2019s psychological and physical condition could very well fit a recently suffered serious trauma .", "By letters of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , the applicant requested the ORG Secretary to withdraw the decision of CARDINAL DATE and to grant him asylum or a residence permit on the basis of LAW . On DATE , the ORG Secretary advised the applicant to file a fresh request for asylum or a residence permit . On DATE , the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) with the ORG Secretary against the contents of the letter of DATE .", "On DATE , as the ORG Secretary had failed to determine the applicant \u2019s objection timely , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG .", "In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG noted that , on DATE , the ORG Secretary had in fact withdrawn the decision of CARDINAL DATE , but that no new decision on the applicant \u2019s second request for asylum or a residence permit on humanitarian grounds had been taken by the ORG Secretary . It ordered the ORG Secretary to do so within DATE after the notification of the decision . On DATE , the parties were notified of the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed a new appeal with ORG since no decision had yet been taken by the ORG Secretary . These proceedings are currently still pending .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW , insofar as relevant and as in force at the relevant time , provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

The lawfulness of a placement in GPE detention can , however , be challenged before a court . Where the court is of the opinion that there are no prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time , it can order that the measure of placement in GPE detention be lifted .", "According to NORP case - law , the interest of an alien to be released from GPE detention increases with the passage of time . Where a placement in GPE detention exceeds a period of DATE , it is generally held that the alien \u2019s interest in being released is greater than the interest to keep him in detention for the purposes of expulsion . Depending on the specific circumstances of each case , it may be that this point in time is reached at an earlier or later point in time than after DATE have passed . It may be later where the alien frustrates the determination of his identity or nationality and it may be sooner where the alien concerned is unable to obtain travel documents for reasons beyond his control .", "Article PERSON of LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
