Finally , the applicants PERSON , PERSON and PERSON have applied for residence permits and the respective proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL . From the First World War until DATE , the territory comprising the modern GPE was incorporated into a union of NORP nations of LOC ( mostly of LOC ) . On DATE the first union DATE ORG , NORP and NORP \u2013 joined with GPE and became GPE , NORP and NORP . In DATE the latter was renamed as GPE .", "CARDINAL . A new entity was subsequently formed during the Second World War . This common ORG first bore the name of ORG , then of ORG , which in DATE was renamed as the SFRY . It was a federal ORG composed of CARDINAL republics : GPE , GPE , GPE ( with CARDINAL autonomous regions , GPE and GPE ) , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . SFRY nationals had \u201c dual citizenship \u201d for internal purposes , that is , they were citizens both of the SFRY and of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The first LAW after the Second World War was adopted in DATE . In DATE , under the new Constitutions of the SFRY and of the then GPE , the whole system of government shifted from strict centralism to greater autonomy for the constituent GPE . The preamble to LAW introduced the right of every nation to self - determination , including to secession . Until DATE , federal citizenship prevailed over republic citizenship : republic citizenship could only be held by a NORP citizen ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The regulation of citizenship was similar in all republics of the SFRY , with the basic principle of acquiring citizenship by blood ( ius sanguinis ) . In principle , a child followed his GPE citizenship ; if parents were citizens of different GPE , they jointly agreed on their child \u2019s citizenship . This basic principle was combined with the principle of place of birth ( ius soli ) or of residence ( ius domicilii ) , of granting of republic citizenship to a citizen of another republic upon application , of naturalisation and recognition under international agreement . Moreover , on the date of admission into the citizenship of another republic , a person \u2019s prior republic citizenship came to an end .", "CARDINAL . DATE a separate Register of Citizenship was kept at the level of the GPE and not at the level of the federal ORG . It follows from the documents at the ORG \u2019s disposal that those Registers were not always accurate , since different authorities were responsible for keeping them , the rules governing citizenship were not always strictly respected and republic citizenship was not regarded as crucial during the existence of the SFRY since all republic citizens also had SFRY citizenship . Moreover , in a limited number of cases republic citizenship was not even entered in the Register of Citizenship .", "CARDINAL . SFRY citizens had freedom of movement within the federal ORG and could register permanent residence wherever they settled on its territory . Full enjoyment of various civil , economic , social and even political rights for SFRY citizens was linked to permanent residence .", "CARDINAL .

At the material time , in contrast with some other former ORG , the NORP population was relatively homogeneous , as MONEY of the CARDINAL residents had NORP citizenship . CARDINAL NORP residents ( or MONEY of the population ) , including the applicants , were citizens of the other former ORG . This proportion also broadly reflects the ethnic origin of the NORP population at that time .", "CARDINAL .

Under second paragraph of LAW of LAW , citizens of the former GPE who either failed to apply for NORP citizenship within the prescribed time - limit or whose requests were not granted became aliens . The provisions of LAW became applicable to the former SFRY citizens either DATE after the expiry of the time - limit for filing the requests for citizenship under LAW CARDINAL of LAW , that is , DATE , or when a decision issued in administrative proceedings dismissing their application for citizenship became final ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On or shortly after CARDINAL DATE the municipal authorities removed those concerned by the second paragraph of LAW of LAW from LAW and , according to the respondent Government , transferred them into the Register of Aliens without a Residence Permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ministrstvo za notranje zadeve , \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) sent \u201c Instructions on the implementation of LAW \u201d to the municipal authorities , indicating that it would be necessary to regulate the legal status of the persons affected by LAW after the expiry of the time - limits in DATE . It drew attention to the fact that problems were expected to arise with regard to persons from other GPE of the former SFRY who would become aliens on DATE and had not lodged an application for citizenship . In addition , it pointed out that the papers of such persons , even if issued by the NORP authorities and formally valid , would in fact be invalid owing to the person \u2019s change in status ex lege . Some of those concerned would be required to leave GPE in accordance with sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants stated that persons whose names were removed from the ORG received no official notification . They pointed out that no special procedure was provided for to that effect and no official documents were issued . They only subsequently became aware that they had become aliens , when , for example , they attempted to renew their personal documents ( personal identification card , passport , driving licence ) . On the other hand , the respondent Government maintained that , in addition to the publication in ORG , the NORP population was informed about the new legislation through public media and notices . In some municipalities , personal means of notification were allegedly also used .", "CARDINAL . Until recently , according to the official data from DATE , the number of former SFRY citizens who lost their permanent residence status on CARDINAL DATE amounted to CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , of whom CARDINAL had been refused citizenship . Their names were erased , ex lege , from ORG on or shortly after CARDINAL DATE and entered into the Register of Aliens without a Residence Permit . They became known as \u201c the erased \u201d ( izbrisani ) , and included the applicants in the present case .", "CARDINAL . As a result , \u201c the erased \u201d became aliens or stateless persons illegally residing in GPE . In general , they had difficulties in keeping their jobs , driving licences and obtaining retirement pensions . Nor were they able to leave the country , because they could not re - enter without valid documents . Many families became divided , with some of their members in GPE and others in CARDINAL of the other successor GPE to the former SFRY . Among \u201c the erased \u201d were a certain number of minors . In most cases their identity papers were taken away . Some of \u201c the erased \u201d voluntarily left GPE . Finally , some were served removal orders and deported from GPE .", "CARDINAL . After the expiry of the DATE period set by section CARDINAL of LAW , the less favourable conditions for acquisition of citizenship by naturalisation provided for by its section CARDINAL became applicable also for citizens of other former LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . After DATE the registration of permanent residence of citizens of other former SFRY republics was terminated if they had not acquired a new residence permit . On the other hand , under section CARDINAL of LAW , permanent residence permits issued to foreigners with citizenship of other GPE than the former SFRY republics continued to be valid after the entry into force of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government maintained that , in view of the large number of persons from the other GPE of the former SFRY living in GPE with non - regulated status , on DATE the ORG decided also to take into account the period before the entry into force of LAW for the purposes of calculating the required period of DATE residence in GPE for issuing a permanent residence permit under section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . A total of CARDINAL permanent residence permits were thus issued in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Convention took effect in respect of GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , on DATE , further to a request submitted by ORG for a referendum on the question whether or not the citizenship awarded to former SFRY citizens on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW should be withdrawn , ORG held that the request was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL .

It simplified the requirements for acquiring a permanent residence permit . In particular , LAW was no longer applicable to this group of persons . Under this LAW , residence permits were granted ex nunc to those fulfilling the conditions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Ruling on another constitutional challenge , on CARDINAL DATE ORG set aside some of the provisions of LAW as unconstitutional because it found that the requirements for the acquisition of permanent residence set forth in these provisions were stricter than the grounds for revoking a permanent residence permit under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the respondent Government , CARDINAL applications were lodged under LAW by DATE . As a result , CARDINAL permanent residence permits were issued .", "CARDINAL .

It further found that there was no legal basis for this measure ; ORG did not provide for an ex lege deregistration .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that the provisions of LAW were , in general , designed to regulate the status of foreigners who entered GPE after independence , not of those who were already living there .

As a consequence , the latter were in a less favourable legal position than foreigners who had lived in GPE since before independence .

Furthermore , the provisions of LAW regulating the acquisition of permanent and temporary residence ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) could not be used to remedy the status of citizens of the former SFRY republics because permanent residence and the fact of actual residence in GPE were particular circumstances requiring special consideration . Citizens of the former ORG had a reasonable expectation that the new conditions for retaining permanent residence in GPE would not be stricter than those set forth in LAW relating to LAW on the Sovereignty and Independence of GPE and section CARDINAL of LAW , and that their status would be determined in accordance with international law .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL was therefore declared unconstitutional as it did not prescribe the conditions under which persons subject to this section who either failed to apply for or were denied NORP citizenship could apply for permanent residence after the expiry of the prescribed time - limit .

Lastly , ORG observed that by DATE CARDINAL citizens of the former SFRY republics had been granted permanent residence status on the basis of LAW , that CARDINAL applications had been dismissed or rejected , CARDINAL applications were pending and that CARDINAL citizens of former ORG republics had not applied for permanent residence . The decisions concerning the first group of persons concerned were of a constitutive nature and thus only had ex nunc effect .

Following ORG decisions , ORG , after some delay , started issuing permanent residence decrees with retroactive validity . CARDINAL such decrees have since been issued , but at the time of the follow - up visit , it appeared that the issuance of decisions was suspended .", "DATE . According to the information received from ORG , out of the CARDINAL erased persons , CARDINAL have over time either obtained citizenship or received a permanent residence permit . All of these QUANTITY persons , according to the DATE decision of ORG , should have had their permanent residence status recognised with retroactive effect .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the enactment of the law required to regulate the status of those erased persons who had been expelled from or had left GPE , the issue is still unresolved . There has been an ongoing and heated discussion regarding this issue , which \u2013 quite apart from what the criteria for legitimate absence from GPE and the situation of the expelled should be DATE has focused also on whether the law should be enacted in the normal legislative process or adopted as a constitutional act .", "Conclusions", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner urges ORG to immediately continue and finalise the issuance of supplementary decisions giving retroactive effect to the permanent residence permit of all those persons , who are entitled to it .", "CARDINAL . As regards the enactment of the law regulating and reinstating the status of the remaining erased persons , the Commissioner urges the NORP government to definitely resolve the issue in good faith and in accordance with the decisions of ORG . Whatever the appropriate legislative solution may be , the current impasse reflects poorly on the respect for the rule of law and ORG judgements in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner is extremely concerned about the continuous public manifestations of hate speech and intolerance by some politicians . The Commissioner calls for greater responsibility of politicians and media in this regard and for the full respect of the rights and values laid down in ORG Rights and other international instruments . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL and DATE the Commissioner visited GPE and , inter alia , discussed the issue of the \u201c erased \u201d with the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG against Racism and Intolerance ( \u201c ECRI \u201d ) published its third report on GPE , which was adopted on DATE . This report described the situation of \u201c the erased \u201d as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In its second report , ORG dealt at length with the situation of those citizens of other ex - NORP countries who were removed ex officio from the register of permanent residents of GPE in DATE and who since then , are often referred to as the \u2018 GPE . As explained in that report , following the armed conflict in GPE in DATE and the ensuing independence of the country , over CARDINAL CARDINAL of the approximately QUANTITY permanent residents of GPE from other ex - NORP countries obtained NORP citizenship on the basis of the DATE citizenship law . This law allowed for a DATE window to apply for citizenship . Of the remaining QUANTITY persons , CARDINAL left GPE around that time . However , for a number of reasons , including the war between other successor GPE of the former GPE , the uncertain situation prevailing in other such GPE , and the destruction , loss or inaccessibility of personal documents , CARDINAL permanent residents did not or could not apply for NORP citizenship or applied and were rejected . As mentioned , these persons were struck off the register of permanent residents on DATE . Many of these persons DATE for the most part reportedly persons without good levels of education DATE had been living in GPE for a long time and some of them were even born in the country . However , as a result of the erasure from the registers , they became foreigners without legal status in GPE from DATE to the next , in many cases without being aware of it . Loss of legal status meant for them loss of access to fundamental rights attached to residence , including the right to work and access to healthcare and other social rights , along with the annulation of personal documents and exposure to a risk of deportation .", "CARDINAL . In its second report , ORG noted that a law had been passed in DATE to open the possibility for the \u2018 GPE to apply for permanent residence . It also noted however , that the time - limit of DATE to do so and the requirement that applicants prove that they had lived in GPE since DATE without interruptions of DATE seriously limited the effectiveness of this law . ORG notes that CARDINAL people have obtained permanent residence permits on the basis of that law . However , such residence permits were not granted with effect from the date of erasure ( DATE ) , but from the date of formal acquisition of these permits , i.e. in a majority of cases , DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG notes that in DATE , ORG declared the DATE law unconstitutional , inter alia because : it did not give retroactive effect to residence permits ; it did not regulate the obtaining of residence permits for those \u2018 GPE who had been forcibly deported from GPE ; it did not prescribe criteria for the fulfilment of the requirement of continuous residence in GPE . ORG therefore established that ORG must issue supplementary administrative decisions whereby residence permits already granted were given retroactive effect from DATE to the date of formal acquisition . It also established that the DATE law must be amended within DATE to determine a new time limit for possible new applications .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the first point , ORG notes that following initial delays , ORG under the former Government started to issue supplementary administrative decisions giving residence permits retroactive effect at DATE . ORG notes however , that only approximately CARDINAL CARDINAL such decisions have been issued . The representatives of ORG under the current Government have stated that they consider that these supplementary decisions do not rest on a sufficiently strong legal basis , and that a general law establishing conditions and criteria for issuing of residence permits should be passed first . ORG notes however , that in DATE ORG made it clear that its decision of DATE constituted a sufficient legal basis for issuing such decisions and that , in fact , the CARDINAL CARDINAL administrative decisions already issued were issued on such a basis . ECRI expresses serious concern at the fact that CARDINAL of the \u2018 GPE who , since DATE , have secured citizenship or permanent residence of GPE are still not in a position to see their rights linked to permanent residence restored with effect from the date of erasure .", "CARDINAL . The situation as concerns the implementation of the other parts of the decision of ORG appears very unclear and uncertain at the time of writing and is a cause for serious concern to ORG . The issue essentially relates to the enactment of a law to regulate the status of MONEY \u2018 GPE who have not yet secured NORP citizenship or permanent residence permits and whose current position varies from holders of temporary permits ( CARDINAL CARDINAL persons ) and persons still living in GPE without legal status to persons who have left GPE or have been deported . The NORP authorities have reported to ORG their decision to adopt such a law in the form of a constitutional law . ORG notes that this decision has been widely criticised both within the ORG and in civil society for effectively and deliberately leading to non - implementation of ORG decision , inter alia as it entails the use of constitutional means and relative procedures ( including the need for a qualified majority in ORG ) in order to deal with matters that should be regulated through primary legislation . ORG is not aware of the exact content of the law , which is reportedly in the drafting process , nor has it been possible to clarify the envisaged timetable for adoption . In any event , ORG deplores the fact that , as a result of the non - implementation by the NORP authorities of the decision of ORG , it is still not possible for CARDINAL people to regain the rights of which they were unlawfully stripped over DATE .", "CARDINAL . More generally , ORG is deeply concerned at the tone prevailing in NORP public and political debate concerning the \u2018 GPE since its last report . It regrets that this part of the NORP population has in many occasions fallen hostage to merely political considerations , including the exploitation of their situation as a vote gainer , and that the debate around the position of these persons has steadily moved away from human rights considerations . It is particularly regrettable that racism and xenophobia have been encouraged and fostered as part of this process , including through generalisations and misrepresentations concerning the loyalty of these persons to ORG or the economic burden that restoration of their rights would entail .", "Recommendations", "CARDINAL . ECRI urges the NORP authorities to restore the rights of persons erased from the registers of permanent residents on DATE . To this end , it strongly recommends that the NORP authorities implement the DATE decision of ORG in good faith and without further delay . This includes the immediate resumption and finalisation of the process of issuing supplementary decisions granting retroactive permanent residence rights , and the adoption of a legal framework enabling those \u2018 NORP persons who have not yet secured permanent residence or NORP citizenship to have their rights reinstated in a manner that is as fair and generous as possible .", "CARDINAL . ECRI urges the NORP authorities to take the lead in placing public debate on the situation of the \u2018 GPE securely in the realm of human rights and to refrain from generalisations and misrepresentations concerning these persons which foster racism and xenophobia . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG adopted the Convention on the Reduction of Statelesness . GPE has not ratified it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG on ORG issued concluding observations under LAW of all Forms of Racial Discrimination stating , inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG is encouraged by the steps taken by ORG to address the long - standing issue of persons living in GPE who have not been able to obtain citizenship . It is nevertheless concerned that many of the persons who have not acquired NORP citizenship may still experience administrative difficulties in complying with the specific requirements contained in the law . The ORG recommends that the ORG party give priority to addressing this issue and , taking into account the difficulties which have arisen , ensure that the new citizenship legislation is implemented in a non - discriminatory manner .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG notes the rulings of ORG ( ORG of DATE and ORG of DATE ) that the erasure of CARDINAL people originating from other parts of the former ORG from ORG in DATE had no legal basis and that the permanent residence status should be restored to the affected persons retroactively . ORG is concerned that many children were negatively affected by this erasure , as they and their families lost their right to health care , social assistance and family benefits as a consequence of losing permanent residence status and children born in GPE after DATE became stateless .", "CARDINAL .
