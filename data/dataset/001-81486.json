SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the Court by Mr U. Jacobson , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant suffers from ORG disease ( a disease marked by chronic inflammation of the colon ) .", "On DATE ORG ( F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ) in GPE granted her disability benefits ( handikappers\u00e4ttning ) at the level of PERCENT of the basic amount geared to the price index ( basbeloppet ) as from DATE . On DATE it decided to increase the benefits to the level of PERCENT as from DATE because of her extra costs incurred as a result of the disease .", "In DATE the applicant applied for an increase of the disability benefits , as she claimed that her costs had increased further , inter alia , she had to follow a special diet , was dependent on medication and had extra expenses to be able to work .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant an increase , to the level of PERCENT of the basic amount , as from DATE . It noted that she had substantial extra costs due to her disease but that she did not have any need for assistance in her DATE life . The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , demanding that the increase be paid retroactively as from DATE . In a judgment of DATE , the court granted the appeal .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant requested ORG , under LAW section CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW ( NORP om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , DATE hereinafter \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) , to change its decision of CARDINAL DATE , and to grant her disability benefits at the level of PERCENT of the basic amount retroactively from DATE . She claimed that the original decision had been incorrect as all her extra costs had not been taken into account at the time .", "On DATE an official at ORG made a re - assessment of the decision of CARDINAL DATE , in accordance with the relevant provision of LAW , and decided to reject the request on the grounds that that decision had not been made on obviously incorrect or incomplete material . In this respect , the official noted that the ORG had accepted all the extra costs , as specified by the applicant at the time , except certain reductions for food expenses .", "The applicant appealed to ORG , complaining that ORG decision should have been made by its board and not by a single official , for which reason the case should be returned to the Office for reconsideration by the board . In the alternative , she maintained her claim that she should granted disability benefits at the level of PERCENT of the basic amount retroactively from DATE .", "ORG submitted that its decision had been duly made , as a decision for re - assessment under LAW section CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW could be made by a single official . It referred to both a judgment by ORG ( ref . F\u00d6D CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) and a general opinion ( allm\u00e4nna r\u00e5d CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) issued by ORG ( Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket ) .", "Following further submissions from the parties in which the applicant continued to question the legality of ORG decision and whether it had at all tried the case on the merits , ORG , on DATE , sent her a letter ( underr\u00e4ttelse ) , inter alia , informing her that it appeared from the ORG \u2019s decision that it had tried her request on the merits according to LAW section CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW and that the decision had been made by an official at the ORG who was competent to make such a decision . The court further gave the applicant DATE in which to finalise her submissions .", "In a letter of DATE , the applicant maintained her claims and added that she requested that an oral hearing be held in the case . She wished for the court to take appropriate measures to clarify how ORG had dealt with her case and , once she had received that information , she would consider whether she wanted to hear someone from ORG before the court .", "The parties made further submissions , in which the applicant maintained her request for an oral hearing and added that she wished for the official who had made the decision at ORG and a named person at ORG to be heard in order to establish whether the ORG \u2019s decision had been duly taken .", "In response to the applicant \u2019s requests , ORG , in DATE , decided to ask ORG to submit its opinion on the matter based on the applicant \u2019s submissions . The ORG delivered its opinion to the court in DATE , and a supplementary opinion in DATE . In these opinions , the ORG agreed with ORG , with reference to its general opinions and to case - law , that the decision had been taken according to law .", "The applicant still maintained her request for an oral hearing in order to clarify whether ORG decision had been taken in due order .", "On DATE ORG invited the applicant to make her concluding submissions in the case and , on DATE , the applicant submitted that she maintained her claims and request for an oral hearing .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal as well as the applicant\u2019", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , relying on the same grounds as before the lower court , and developing her reasons further . Moreover , she complained that ORG had not held an oral hearing in the case which was in breach of her rights under LAW . In a further submission , received by the court on DATE , the applicant demanded that ORG hold a hearing to clarify the contentious issues . The official at ORG should be heard about whether the case had been examined in substance and ORG should be questioned about the ORG \u2019s position on decision - making competences , in general , at ORG .", "The parties made further submissions to ORG and , on DATE , it rejected the applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing as it considered that it was not necessary in order to decide whether or not to grant leave to appeal . The applicant was given DATE to submit supplementary written pleadings , which she did .", "On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal as it found no reasons to change the lower court \u2019s judgment .", "The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) , maintaining her claims and adding that the lower courts had violated LAW by not granting her an oral hearing . She also requested that ORG hold an oral hearing if it granted her leave to appeal .", "On DATE , ORG refused leave to appeal .", "According to LAW , LAW , of LAW ( as in force until DATE , when the DATE LAW ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) om handikappers\u00e4ttning och v\u00e5rdbidrag \u2013 entered into force ) , a person who was ill or handicapped was entitled to disability benefits , provided that , before reaching DATE , he or she had been functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needed time - consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise had considerable extra expenses . The total need for support and assistance determined the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation . It was thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses . According to the guidelines of ORG the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should attain PERCENT of a basic amount geared to the price index in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance . In DATE , when the applicant was first granted the benefit , the basic amount was SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL and , in DATE when she was granted increased benefits , the basic amount was SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "According to LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , as in force before DATE , such benefits were granted on a DATE basis at a level of PERCENT , PERCENT or PERCENT of the basic amount , depending on the extent to which the insured person was in need of assistance and the amount of extra expenses caused by the disability . Before DATE the levels were PERCENT , PERCENT or PERCENT of the basic amount .", "A decision by ORG under LAW may be appealed against to ORG and from there on to ORG and to ORG . Appeals may be made against the ORG \u2019s ordinary decisions or a decision upon review under LAW , section CARDINAL ( a ) , of LAW .", "The latter provision enables ORG to change a decision it has previously taken in order to rectify certain obvious defects of that decision , provided that it has not already been reviewed by a court . Thus , the ORG must change its earlier decision if it contains a writing error , miscalculation or similar mistake or if it is incorrect due to it being based on obviously incorrect or incomplete information or an obviously incorrect application of the law or other similar reason . The question of changing a decision under LAW ( a ) should , in principle , be raised within DATE from DATE the decision was taken . However , it may nevertheless be changed if it appears only after the elapse of this DATE period that it was based on obviously incorrect or incomplete material or if there are other exceptional reasons . A decision is to be changed under this provision even if a request to that effect has not been made by the individual concerned .", "The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of ORG , DATE hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The proceedings shall be in writing .", "An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that that would assist in the proceedings or be conductive to the speedy determination of the case .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings and if it is not unnecessary and there are no particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "From the case - law of the national courts , it appears that the grounds stated in the third paragraph of section CARDINAL for refusing an oral hearing have been interpreted as being alternative rather than cumulative ( see PERSON ) .", "According to the preparatory work to LAW , an oral hearing could be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and could benefit the examination of a case , in particular in CARDINAL situations : firstly , when it was necessary to hear a witness , an expert or a party or when it was difficult for a party to present the case in writing and , secondly , when different positions in the case needed to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute . In the latter case , the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character . It was stressed , however , that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a supplement to it ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It was further stated , in respect of the third paragraph of section CARDINAL , that a party \u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given close consideration . However , such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter , as the question whether an oral hearing was necessary was to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case . However , other circumstances could be of relevance , for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party \u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case . Nevertheless , if the case was of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the value of what was at stake in the case , there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing ( p. CARDINAL ) .", "In DATE , it appears from the case law of ORG that it has set aside a number of decisions on appeal and granted leave to appeal in the administrative courts of appeal because an oral hearing has been denied in the lower courts ( see , inter alia , PERSON ref CARDINAL , PERSON DATE note CARDINAL , and ORG note CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
