On DATE , at ORG , the applicant pleaded guilty to conspiracy fraudulently to evade excise duty on alcoholic liquor in contravention of section CARDINAL of ORG . On DATE PERSON made a restraint order prohibiting disposal by the claimant of his assets and on CARDINAL DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINALA of LAW DATE ( \u201c the ORG DATE \u201d ) , save in exceptional circumstances confiscation proceedings should be concluded DATE after conviction . At a directions hearing on DATE the judge was told that the DATE statutory time limit for making a confiscation order would expire on DATE . He noted that \u201c we may have to extend the period \u201d . A date was agreed for service of the applicant \u2019s responses to the ORG \u2019s statements and it was ordered that a further directions hearing should be listed within DATE . This further hearing took place on DATE . The judge noted the court \u2019s power to extend the DATE time limit and no objection was raised by counsel for the applicant . The confiscation proceedings took place on DATE . The judge made an order against the applicant in the sum of GBP CARDINAL to be paid by DATE , with CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment in default .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal against the confiscation order . He submitted that the court had no jurisdiction to make the order because it was imposed DATE after his conviction in breach of the statutory time limit under section CARDINALA of the ORG DATE . At the time there was judicial uncertainty about whether failure to comply with the DATE time limit would deprive the court of jurisdiction to make a confiscation order . Permission to appeal was granted on DATE and enforcement of the confiscation order was suspended pending the outcome of the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG considered a group of appeals lodged on the same ground as that of the applicant , namely that ORG did not have jurisdiction to make a confiscation order outside the DATE time limit . ORG held that a procedural irregularity did not necessarily deprive the court of jurisdiction to make a confiscation order . CARDINAL of the appellants ( PERSON ) obtained leave to appeal to ORG . His appeal was joined to that of another appellant ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant issued an out - of - time notice of appeal against conviction on the ground that his conviction had been tainted by non - disclosure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stayed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the confiscation order pending the ORG of Lords\u2019 decisions in R v. ORG and R v. PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal out of time against his conviction .", "CARDINAL . The decisions in R v. ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL and R v. PERSON [ DATE ] UKHL CARDINAL were handed down by ORG on DATE . In those decisions ORG affirmed ORG conclusion that a procedural irregularity would not necessarily deprive the court of jurisdiction to make a confiscation order . Following publication of the decisions , counsel advised the applicant against continuing his appeal and withdrew from the case . However , with the assistance of his solicitors the applicant did continue the appeal . His solicitors sought leave to amend the grounds of appeal to include CARDINAL further grounds : first , that the confiscation order was unlawful because it had been made in respect of facts constituting a substantive offence when the applicant had only pleaded guilty to the prior and distinct offence of conspiracy ; and secondly , that the duration of the proceedings up to the date of the appeal had been unreasonably long , in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the application to amend the grounds of appeal was considered together with the substantive merits of the appeal . Permission to amend the grounds was refused , the substantive appeal was dismissed , and the court declined to certify that points of law of general public importance were involved in the decision . PERSON found that the ORG judge \u2019s reasons for extending the DATE time limit \u201c were the proper administration of justice , based upon judicial availability . They explicitly were not for the purpose of allowing the ORG to secure more information \u201d . Applying R v. PERSON and R v. PERSON , she held that artificial adherence to statutory time limits was outwith the intentions of ORG and that the appeal should therefore be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG . On DATE leave was refused . On DATE , the applicant submitted his application to this ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c RCPO \u201d ) wrote to the applicant seeking his proposals for payment of the outstanding confiscation order . On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitor asked the RCPO to delay enforcement proceedings pending consideration of his application to the ORG . The RCPO declined and confiscation enforcement proceedings against the applicant took place on DATE . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that to continue the enforcement proceedings would be an abuse of process and a breach of LAW . The applicant applied for permission to judicially review this decision . In the meantime the enforcement proceedings were adjourned to DATE for a NORP enquiry to take place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the District Judge refused to stay the enforcement proceedings pending determination of the application for permission to apply for judicial review . However , he adjourned the FAC enquiry to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a further application to ORG for a stay of the enforcement proceedings . On DATE ORG refused the application for permission to apply for judicial review and the application for urgent interim relief . However , the application for interim relief was subsequently granted at an oral hearing on DATE and at a further oral hearing on DATE the applicant was granted permission to apply for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was found to be in contempt of court in relation to numerous breaches of the restraint order and was ordered to pay GBP CARDINAL within DATE . The applicant satisfied this judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the application for judicial review was heard by ORG . The applicant sought to argue that the delay between his arrest and conviction and the confiscation proceedings was unreasonable in its length of time and that the proceedings should be stayed as an abuse of process or a breach of LAW . On DATE a ORG Judge dismissed the applicant \u2019s judicial review application . In particular , he noted that the slow progress of the appeal against the confiscation order was interrupted by the supervening decision of the applicant to seek leave to appeal out of time against conviction . As the application for leave took place within a reasonable time , the only period of delay which was both material and unexplained was the period DATE ( the hearing of the application for leave to appeal against conviction out of time ) and DATE ( publication of opinions of ORG in NORP v. PERSON and R v. PERSON ) . However , the judge accepted that the decision to await the outcome of the proceedings before ORG was eminently sensible even if it did prolong the period before the applicant \u2019s appeal could be heard by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge refused to certify a point of law of public importance and refused permission to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was imprisoned until the outstanding confiscation figure was paid .
