They argued that the name \u201c PERSON \u201d was common in GPE and GPE , and it was also used in GPE and GPE . It was pronounceable in the NORP language and was not incompatible with NORP naming practice . There were CARDINAL persons with that name registered in ORG ( v\u00e4est\u00f6tietoj\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4 , befolkningsdatasystemet ) of GPE .
