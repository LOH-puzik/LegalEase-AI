The poll \u201c also investigated voters\u2019 expectations and was therefore designed to find out how the election campaign should be slanted , since the concerns expressed by the majority were addressed at length in the published election material [ referred to above ] \u201d .", "As it also noted that the magazine CARDINAL Ind\u00e9pendant had campaigned in favour of CARDINAL candidates , including the applicant , ORG added CARDINAL of the cost of the DATE issue to his accounts ( FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "After deducting other sums , it thus assessed the expenditure in issue at ORG ORG and rejected the applicant \u2019s campaign accounts as they exceeded the statutory ceiling by ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . It also referred the matter to the ORG pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON applied to the ORG d\u2019Etat to have ORG decision quashed and reversed . His main contention was that , in breach of Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW and the adversarial principle , ORG had added the cost of the opinion poll and the publications in issue to his campaign accounts without first giving him a hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG d'Etat dismissed the application on the following grounds :", "\u201c ...", "The contested decision , whereby ORG ... revised PERSON campaign accounts and , having found that the maximum permitted amount of election expenditure had been exceeded , referred the matter to ORG , can not be separated from the proceedings thus instituted before that body . That being so , no appeal lies against the decision to the administrative courts . Mr PERSON application is therefore inadmissible .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Applications were made to ORG on DATE by a voter in the CARDINALth administrative district , Mr M. , who maintained that the applicant had exceeded the statutory maximum amount of campaign expenditure , and on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON lodged a pleading . He asked ORG to stay the proceedings until the ORG d\u2019Etat had ruled on the lawfulness of ORG decision and , in the alternative , to hold that his campaign expenditure had not exceeded the statutory ceiling and that he should not be disqualified from standing for election .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected PERSON request to stay the proceedings , disqualified him from standing for election for DATE from DATE and declared that he had forfeited his seat as a member of ORG .

The view it takes when scrutinising a candidate \u2019s campaign accounts consequently can not prejudice the decision of ORG , the body that adjudicates upon the lawfulness of an election under LAW .", "The inclusion of expenditure relating to the magazine ORG", "... regard being had to the dates on which it was published , to the extent of its circulation and to its content , this magazine can be seen to be a vehicle for election propaganda . Issues DATE , however , contain numerous pages of general and local news which can not be directly linked with promoting the candidate or furthering his election programme . Accordingly , those pages must not be viewed as expenditure committed or incurred for election purposes within the meaning of LAW of LAW . That being so , they should not be included in the expenditure recorded in Mr PERSON campaign accounts .", "On the other hand , other pages in those CARDINAL issues contain numerous photographs of the candidate or are made up of articles relating to topics addressed during his election campaign . Those pages consequently amount to election propaganda . This is true [ of ORG pages ... ] ... , which helped to promote the elected candidate . To that extent , the corresponding expenditure must be seen as coming within the expenditure referred to in the first paragraph of Article PERSON of LAW and must be included in the candidate \u2019s campaign accounts . Regard being had to the total cost of the publications concerned and the number of pages to be taken into account , the expenditure incurred under this head amounts to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "...", "The inclusion of the cost of an opinion poll", "It is clear from the inquiry into the facts that an opinion poll commissioned by the ORG was conducted in the CARDINALth constituency in GPE among a representative sample of voters . The questions asked related firstly to the voters\u2019 main concerns , secondly to their voting intentions and thirdly to their appraisal of various political figures and groups .", "The inquiry into the facts revealed that Mr PERSON then made use of the poll findings that related to voters\u2019 expectations by choosing his campaign topics on the basis of voter concerns as shown by the findings . Both in issues CARDINAL of the magazine ORG and in various leaflets , he gave priority to the topics so identified . The findings were accordingly used to determine the thrust of the candidate \u2019s election campaign in the constituency .", "The inclusion of the cost of part of issue CARDINAL of the magazine CARDINAL Ind\u00e9pendant", "In issue CARDINAL of DATE the magazine CARDINAL GPE , which has a circulation of CARDINAL , published an article by PERSON , the mayor of the district , expressing his support for the CARDINAL opposition candidates standing , including Mr PERSON . That article , which was intended to underline the unity in the local majority party DATE before the first round of the election , was an integral part of the whole publication , which thus in its entirety amounts to election propaganda . Responsibility for it must also be attributed to the CARDINAL candidates who benefited from it . Consequently , CARDINAL of the cost of the publication ( FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) must be included as expenditure in Mr PERSON campaign accounts , as ORG and Political Funding ruled .", "The inclusion of the cost of various propaganda expenses", "PERSON criticised Mr PERSON for omitting various propaganda expenses . It is clear from the very details provided by the candidate that some expenditure was omitted ... On the basis of the figures submitted by Mr PERSON himself , the total amount to be taken into account for the purposes of Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL is thus ORG CARDINAL .", "It follows from all the foregoing that the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL must be added to PERSON Pierre - Bloch \u2019s expenditure . The total amount of his expenditure is thus ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL and the applicant has consequently exceeded the maximum permitted amount of campaign expenditure by ORG .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON lodged an application with ORG seeking rectification of clerical errors which , in his submission , vitiated the decision of DATE .

( Mr PERSON argued that Mr PERSON had failed to prove that he was lawfully in possession of the opinion poll report , marked \u201c confidential exclusive property of client \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a pleading containing further arguments on DATE . He argued that ORG decision did not contain its President \u2019s signature or that of the secretary - general or the rapporteur ; furthermore , the rapporteur \u2019s name had not been given . He added that he had also been denied any opportunity to lodge final submissions as he had not been informed when his case would be heard .", "CARDINAL . Neither the applicant nor his counsel was informed of the date of the hearing , even though in a letter of DATE the lawyer had asked the secretary - general for the date .", "CARDINAL .

It also reduced the amount of propaganda expenditure to ORG CARDINAL and set the amount of expenditure incurred by the applicant at ORG CARDINAL , consequently materially amending its decision of CARDINAL DATE , while stating that \u201c this rectification [ was ] not such as to call in question Mr PERSON disqualification from standing for election or the forfeiture of his seat \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant applied to ORG to quash this decision . He alleged , in particular , that ORG had breached LAW .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed his application as follows :", "\u201c ...", "It appears from the inquiry into the facts that the impugned decision was taken by ORG , which is not a court . It is thus not required to afford the procedural safeguards provided for in [ LAW ] . The applicant is not , however , thereby deprived of the right \u2013 which he exercised \u2013 to have his case heard by a tribunal .
