On DATE the Braunau ORG Bezirkshauptmannschaft ) ordered the applicant to pay a fine of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) , with CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in default , for driving under the influence of drink , contrary to sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW DATE ( Stra\u00dfenverkehrsordnung ) . The applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on CARDINAL DATE , a criminal information was laid against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) convicted the applicant under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ) of causing injury by negligence , with the additional element of LAW , and sentenced him to pay a fine of ORG CARDINAL with CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in default .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG noted that ORG had meanwhile found that the NORP reservation in respect of LAW No . CARDINAL was invalid ( see the PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-C , pp . DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . However , the judgment was not directly applicable and , therefore , it had to be assumed that double punishment was still lawful under domestic law , if the courts decided after the administrative authorities . In addition it noted that , following a judgment of ORG changing the subsidiarity provisions in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( c ) of LAW , the administrative offence of drunken driving was subsidiary to an offence under LAW committed with the additional element of LAW . This change of law was however not applicable to the case in issue .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE provides that it is an offence for a person to drive a vehicle if the proportion of alcohol in his blood or breath is equal to or QUANTITY or QUANTITY respectively .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , so far as relevant , provided at the material time , that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) It shall be an administrative offence ( GPE ) , punishable with a fine of not less than ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and not more than ATS CARDINAL,CARDINAL or , in default of payment with CARDINAL to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , for any person :", "( a ) to drive a vehicle when under the influence of drink ...", "( CARDINAL ) An administrative offence is not committed where : ...", "( c ) facts constituting an offence under sub - sections ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) also constitute an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the [ ordinary ] courts ... . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG had to examine the constitutionality of LAW subsection ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , by virtue of which the administrative offence of driving under the influence of drink was not subsidiary to an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the courts .", "ORG noted that that it was not contrary to LAW if a single act constituted more than one offence . This was a feature common to the criminal law of many NORP countries . However , it was also accepted in criminal law doctrine that sometimes a single act only appeared to constitute CARDINAL offence , whereas interpretation showed that one offence entirely covered the wrong contained in the other so that there was no need for further punishment . Thus , LAW prohibited the trial and punishment of someone for different offences if interpretation showed that one excluded the application of the other . Where , as in the present case , the law explicitly provided that one offence was not subsidiary to another , it had to be guided by LAW . The ORG \u2019s Gradinger judgment of DATE had shown that there was a breach of this Article if an essential aspect of an offence , which had already been tried by the courts , was tried again by the administrative authorities .", "Section CARDINAL subsections ( CARDINAL)(a ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , taken together , meant that the criminal administrative offence of drunken driving could be prosecuted even when an offence falling within the competence of the normal criminal courts was also apparent . According to the criminal courts\u2019 constant case - law under LAW of LAW ( cited below ) , drunken driving was also an essential aspect of certain offences tried by these courts . Insofar as LAW ( CARDINAL ) of FAC limited the subsidiarity of administrative offences to those enumerated in subsections ( CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) of section CARDINAL , thus excluding subsidiarity for the offence of drunken driving contained in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(a ) , it violated LAW .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW has been amended . It now provides that an administrative offence is not committed where facts constituting an offence under LAW also constitute an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts .", "CARDINAL . By LAW , it is an offence , punishable by up to three months\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of up to CARDINAL and eighty day - rates , to cause injury by negligence .
