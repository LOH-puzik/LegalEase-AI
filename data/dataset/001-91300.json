At the beginning of the hearing the applicant submitted that he had refused assistance from legal aid counsel and that his refusal was not linked to his financial situation . Lawyer PERSON , who had been provided to the applicant , left the courtroom .", "CARDINAL . The applicant pleaded guilty to theft . As regards the charges of murder , he submitted that he had committed the murder in self - defence because during their quarrel PERSON had threatened him with an axe . The trial court heard the applicant and his co - accused , the mother of PERSON and several witnesses including witness PERSON During the questioning of PERSON the court rebuked the applicant twice for contempt of court and finally , at the prosecutor \u2019s request , removed the applicant from the hearing for putting pressure on the witnesses .

The trial court ordered that the record of the hearings be amended accordingly .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , but not DATE . , appealed against the judgment of DATE . He argued in the first place that the trial court \u2019s conclusion that PERSON had no axe in his hands had been inconsistent with the facts of the case and the evidence submitted in the trial . His actions should have been recharacterised as a murder committed as a result of exceeding the limits of necessary defence under LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below , paragraph CARDINAL ) , because PERSON had threatened him with an axe .

They asked for the judgment to be quashed and the case remitted for fresh consideration to the trial court . The appeal court also heard the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . Having studied the materials of the case , the appeal court found , in particular , that the trial court had rightly concluded on the basis of evidence and ORG testimony that PERSON had no axe and had not represented a serious danger to the applicant . It further confirmed the trial court \u2019s conclusion that the applicant \u2019s balance of mind had not been disturbed when he had committed the murder . The appeal court concluded that the trial court had correctly characterised the applicant \u2019s actions as premeditated murder and had imposed an appropriate sentence . On DATE it upheld the judgment of DATE in its totality .", "CARDINAL . It does not appear from the decision of DATE that the appeal court verified whether the applicant had been duly informed of the hearing and of the procedure to follow to take part in it , and whether he had expressed a wish to take part in it .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL provided that persons who had lodged appeals were to be apprised of the date of the appeal hearing if it was to be held before courts lower than ORG of GPE . If an appeal was to be examined by ORG , an appellant had to be apprised of the appeal hearing if he or she had requested the court to do so in their appeal or observations on the appeal .

It provides , among other things , that at the hearing the court shall hear the statement of the party who had lodged the appeal and the objections of the opposing party .

Article CARDINAL provides that the judgment shall be deemed unfair if the sentence imposed is inconsistent with the seriousness of the offence , the personality of the convicted person , or if that sentence , although within the limits of the relevant Article of LAW , is unfair in its chosen type or extent , being either disproportionately lenient or disproportionately severe . A judgment may be reversed in connection with the necessity to impose a more severe penalty due to the fact that the penalty imposed by the trial court is deemed unfair as being disproportionately lenient , but only in instances when there is either a prosecution request or an application as a private prosecution , the victim or his representative to that effect .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that where there has been a violation of the provisions of LAW , the appeal court may apply a law of a less serious offence and reduce the sentence , in accordance with legal reclassification of the acts committed . In doing so , the appeal court may not apply a law of a more serious offence or aggravate a sentence imposed . In cases where the trial court imposed a sentence more severe than that set forth by the relevant LAW , the appeal court may reduce the sentence without changing the legal classification of the offence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
