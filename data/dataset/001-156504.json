The applicants own , in equal shares , a property built in DATE in PERSON and which is known DATE as ORG . According to the applicants , the property is used as a storage facility for a nearby shop . At first , this was not contested by the Government , but at a later stage in the proceedings , they submitted that the property had been abandoned and was not in use .", "CARDINAL . The applicants inherited the property from their uncle on DATE . At the time , the property was already leased to PERSON , a company registered in GPE , for MONEY ( ORG ) ( equivalent to MONEY ( EUR ) ) DATE , that is , ORG DATE on the basis of a voluntary lease agreement . Although there was no evidence of the GPE ever having signed a lease agreement , it appears that the lease commenced in DATE . Rent is payable DATE in advance , and in accordance with the law the lease is renewed automatically DATE .", "CARDINAL . In such circumstances , PERSON hereinafter \u201c the Ordinance \u201d ) , LAW of LAW , ( see Relevant domestic law below ) provides that the eviction of a tenant or a change in the conditions of a lease requires the authorisation of ORG ( \u201c the RRB \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicants undertook a valuation of the property with a view to making a request for an increase in the rent . The architect who carried out the valuation indicated that the current rental value of the property was ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with legal requirements ( see Relevant domestic law below ) , on DATE , the applicants informed PERSON by means of a judicial letter that they intended to raise the rent to ORG DATE with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . By means of a judicial letter dated CARDINAL DATE , PERSON replied that it did not agree to the request . It failed , however , to apply to the RRB for the rejection of such an increase or for new conditions , as required by law ( see Article CARDINAL of the Ordinance ) .", "CARDINAL . As from the second term of DATE the applicants stopped accepting rent for fear it would prejudice their claim . In consequence , company PERSON continued to pay the rent by means of a schedule of deposit filed with the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought an action before ORG , requesting it to impose on PERSON an obligatory time - limit within which to make an application to the RRB . They considered that in default of such action by PERSON , the increase in rent requested should be deemed to have been agreed . PERSON having eventually filed the said application ( see below ) , the applicants\u2019 action was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE E. applied to the RRB , requesting it to dismiss the claim for the increase in rent . The applicants responded , arguing that the rent should reflect market values .", "CARDINAL . In a report dated DATE CARDINAL court - appointed architects concluded that the rent of ORG CARDINAL was already PERCENT over and above the rent level at which the LOC were or could have been leased before DATE ( LAW b ) of the LAW , see Relevant domestic law below ) . It followed that in the light of LAW ) ( b ) of the LAW , the increase in rent could not be recommended .", "CARDINAL . By a note filed on DATE the applicants submitted that an unfavourable decision would breach their rights under the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the ORG request on the basis of the opinion of the CARDINAL court - appointed architects . It noted that it had no jurisdiction to determine the human rights issue raised by the applicants , who had not made a request for a constitutional referral .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed . They argued that the ORG \u2019s decision had breached their rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW . They requested the court to refer the matter to the constitutional jurisdictions .", "CARDINAL . By decree of CARDINAL DATE ORG referred the matter to the constitutional jurisdictions . Following the constitutional proceedings ( described below ) and the applicants\u2019 lodging of an application with the ORG , on DATE ORG adjourned the case sine die , pending the outcome of the present proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( FAC ) , in its constitutional jurisdiction , upheld the applicants\u2019 claim , holding that their rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW had been breached . Referring to the ORG \u2019s case - law , it considered that the applicants had not had an effective remedy , in so far as they had been constrained by the capping of rent levels set out in the law . In relation to their property rights , it upheld the finding of a violation , on the basis of the reasoning in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . ORG , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) DATE namely the low level of the rent , the applicants\u2019 state of uncertainty as to the possibility of recovery of the property , the lack of procedural safeguards , and the rise in the standard of living in GPE over DATE coupled with the applicants\u2019 argument that the interference had been disproportionate , as it had caused them to bear an excessive burden , given that the property was used for a commercial purpose . Indeed , the lessor could have used other property it had owned , but had preferred to sell that other property for ORG CARDINAL and to continue to rent from the applicants at a low rate .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , by a judgment of DATE , ORG reversed the first - instance judgment . It considered that although when the parties had concluded the contract they had been aware of the law as it stood ( and had stood for DATE ) , they had nevertheless opted to enter into that contract . Therefore , they and their legal successors could not now complain of a breach of their human rights . Indeed , the original lease agreement had neither stipulated a low level of rent nor envisaged future increases in rent . Given that the original owner had opted to lease the LOC , knowing the legal consequences attached , the impact on their property rights had been neither unforeseen nor arbitrary ; nor had there been a state of legal uncertainty . Moreover , recent amendments to the law had improved their position from DATE ( Act X of DATE ; see Article CARDINALD of LAW below ) .", "CARDINAL . As mentioned above ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) as soon as they inherited the property , the applicants refused to accept the rent to avoid prejudicing their legal position . In consequence , it transpires from the documents provided to the ORG that from DATE to DATE the tenants deposited in court by means of schedules of deposit the sum of ORG CARDINAL DATE ( ORG CARDINAL DATE ) . For DATE those deposits amounted to ORG CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL in DATE , and EUR CARDINAL DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE LAW was amended to stipulate that the impugned restrictions would not apply to leases entered into after DATE .", "CARDINAL . While the above - mentioned constitutional proceedings were pending , a new law was enacted , stipulating that with effect from CARDINAL DATE the rent applicable to commercial leases was to be increased by PERCENT per year , and that an increase at that level should also take place for DATE , DATE and DATE ( Section CARDINAL D of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Thus the amounts of rent payable to the applicants in DATE were as follows : in DATE EUR CARDINAL ; in DATE ORG CARDINAL ; in DATE EUR CARDINAL ; and in DATE ORG CARDINAL . For DATE the rent would increase by PERCENT DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
