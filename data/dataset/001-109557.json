In the meantime , PERSON was examined by PERSON , a psychologist , who produced an expert report dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . As to PERSON \u2019s perceptions of his mother and father , the report noted that he both loved and feared his parents and that his main concern was the arguing and shouting that he associated with his parents .

He noted that PERSON demonstrated some of the characteristics of such damage , but was also showing signs of resilience .", "CARDINAL . In terms of therapeutic work which should be undertaken with ORG said that PERSON \u2019s main need was to have a stable and safe environment with predictable relationships where he could play and grow in self - esteem , and have experiences which developed happy feelings and a sense of self efficacy .

NORP The social worker appointed to PERSON carried out a formal parenting assessment of the applicant from DATE , based on CARDINAL sessions between the applicant and social workers and observations of the supervised contact sessions with PERSON When the assessment began the applicant was living alone at the family home .

All the meetings took place while the applicant was separated from GPE However , on CARDINAL DATE GPE confirmed to the local authority that he had moved back into the family home and was once again in a relationship with the applicant .

NORP The social worker commented on the fact that on each of the visits , she had found the applicant \u2019s home to be in good order , clean and tidy . She observed that the applicant demonstrated a strong loving bond towards PERSON and that she offered him appropriate affection . However , observations of PERSON \u2019s behaviour and responses suggested that he had developed an insecure attachment . The applicant \u2019s knowledge of the dietary needs of a child were found to be adequate , although in practice it appeared that they ate convenience foods rather than fresh vegetables and that the applicant allowed PERSON too many unhealthy snacks . The social worker also raised some concerns regarding the applicant \u2019s ability to address and treat signs of illness in PERSON and the lack of attention paid to PERSON \u2019s dental care . She noted that the applicant showed poor knowledge of the need for visual stimulation , interaction and setting appropriate routines and that she had difficulty interacting with PERSON and keeping him occupied for any length of time .", "CARDINAL . NORP The social worker considered that the applicant deferred to GPE on the majority of issues , apparently because she was afraid of the repercussions of challenging him . The applicant was unable to recognise that the behaviour she described was abusive and that it would have a detrimental effect on PERSON She unintentionally put PERSON at risk because her perception of parenting did not afford her the ability to identify risk , make decisions and set appropriate boundaries for PERSON The report concluded :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] has informed me that she is in a relationship with [ GPE ] and that their intentions are to parent [ PERSON ] together . [ The applicant ] can not be considered a protective factor within the relationship .

An undated parenting assessment report of GPE indicated that a significant concern was that he displayed aggression , intimidation and controlling behaviours when not under the influence of alcohol .", "CARDINAL . Alcohol tests of the applicant and GPE from samples collected on DATE and DATE respectively showed no evidence of frequent excessive alcohol consumption .", "CARDINAL . The social worker prepared further statements for the court following the parenting assessment reports . In a statement dated DATE , it was noted that PERSON had become upset on occasions during contact with the applicant and said that he wanted to go home .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant and GPE attended a ORG to Talk parent support group and had CARDINAL - to - CARDINAL parenting sessions .", "CARDINAL . D.I. also carried out a full psychological assessment of both parents and produced an addendum report dated DATE . In his report , PERSON noted :", "\u201c ... [ K. ] told me when asked that he wants to go home , that his mum likes him and added that his dad takes him out and gives him presents ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . D.I. observed that PERSON displayed fewer characteristics of emotional trauma than in the previous meeting . When questioned about his relationships with his family he indicated strong positive feelings for his parents , and in particular for his mother .", "CARDINAL . D.I. commented that both parents had told him that they had maintained their abstinence from alcohol , but he said that this would only be tested if they were challenged by situations which mirrored the original issues which prompted them to turn to alcohol . As to their ability to prevent further domestic violence , PERSON referred to incidents of aggressive behaviour by GPE which he had personally witnessed and noted that this did not \u201c augur well for someone who considers that their aggression is due only to drinking behaviour \u201d . He considered that he had insufficient details of GPE \u2019s history to make a more accurate prediction . He criticised the GPE lack of self - awareness and noted that there was still work to be done in this regard . In terms of the GPE ability to engage meaningfully with professionals , PERSON commented only on GPE , making reference to problems encountered in this respect . Similarly , in so far as their commitment to the care of PERSON was concerned , PERSON referred to certain indications of GPE \u2019s level of commitment , with no specific examples of the applicant \u2019s conduct , while making the overall assessment that he was not convinced that the parents had fully taken on board what they needed to learn from their mistakes and what new parenting behaviour they were going to practise .", "CARDINAL . As regards the aspects of each parent \u2019s psychological profile that were likely to assist or hinder their parenting of GPE , PERSON explained that serious limitations were placed on his assessment of GPE by his lack of cooperation . In respect of the applicant , he explained :", "\u201c [ The applicant \u2019s ] profile ... is characterized by prominent compulsive , narcissistic and histrionic patterns . This does not imply that she has a personality disorder but does have patterns of behaviour that need addressing ... These patterns need to be addressed by [ the applicant ] in counselling to address bereavement and domestic violence . Otherwise they will have an impact that hinders good enough parenting . [ The applicant \u2019s ] love for [ K. ] , her physical parenting to date , participation in the Time to Talk programme and her declared abstinence from drinking thus far are to be praised and built upon . \u201d", "CARDINAL . D.I. noted that PERSON appeared to see the applicant as the main source and object of his love , but cautioned that PERSON might be idealising the situation at home as he was no longer there . He continued :", "\u201c ... [ K. ] is attached to both his parents . He stated a strong preference to return home . [ K. ] is less attached to his father than his mother ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In terms of therapeutic intervention required , GPE considered that the applicant needed to address her role in the fighting with GPE , with discussion about her drinking , her lack of assertiveness and her inability to impose boundaries on PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the social worker filed her final statement on behalf of the local authority with the court . She indicated that since PERSON had been taken into care in DATE , there were no recorded domestic incidents and that both parties had informed her that they were still abstaining from alcohol .", "CARDINAL . She reported that both the applicant and GPE had \u201c continued to work with professionals to a limited extent \u201d . She gave examples of GPE \u2019s unwillingness to work with the local authority and how the applicant often found herself in the middle of conflicts between the CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . As to K \u2019s own views , she noted :", "\u201c ... When I have tried to ask [ PERSON ] how he would feel about going home he has changed the subject . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In her analysis and conclusions , she noted :", "\u201c In a very simplistic form it may appear that [ K. ] is in the care of the local authority due to his parents drinking and violence and as the parents have self reported that there have been no further incidents and we have no evidence to say there are then [ K. ] should return home . However there are a significant number of other factors which evidence that there remain extensive concerns . \u201d", "CARDINAL . She referred to attempts by the local authority to conduct a parenting assessment prior to PERSON \u2019s removal into care , which had been unsuccessful as a result of the GPE failure to engage . She also referred to the separation of the applicant and GPE in DATE , which she considered not to have been genuine from the very outset . She raised concerns about PERSON \u2019s health , and notably his lack of immunisations and bad dental condition , which she noted appeared to some extent to result from GPE \u2019s difficult behaviour . She explained that her professional opinion was that GPE had engaged only superficially in the parenting assessment and had failed to recognise or accept his shortcomings and their impact on his parenting . She continued :", "\u201c We acknowledge that [ the applicant ] is in a very difficult position and we have seen that she has made efforts to work with the local authority but is often stuck in the middle of the conflict [ GPE ] has with the department . She has been successful in persuading [ GPE ] to comply with some issues , but on occasions she has been unable to share information with him until she has chosen the right time as she predicted \u2018 he will blow\u2019 . However [ the applicant ] is a very vulnerable woman who is not strong enough to separate or manage on her own . She is aware of the conflict [ GPE ] creates with others and tries to be the \u2018 peacemaker\u2019 ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the GPE abstinence from drinking , she noted that it was not possible to predict whether this would continue , partly because of their failure to participate in any meaningful assessments , and she referred in this regard to GPE \u2019s refusal to provide relevant information . Similarly , as regards the likelihood of further incidents of domestic violence occurring , she noted that past behaviour was the best predictor , and that GPE had a history of violence in previous relationships . He had done minimal work to address concerns and nothing which could give the local authority confidence that ORG needs would be met appropriately . She continued :", "\u201c ... [ T]he level of cooperation and lack of awareness in my professional opinion is sadly lacking and has not given the local authority any information which enables them to make a decision that it is appropriate for [ K. ] to return to his parents . The court could consider that a further opportunity is given to [ the applicant and GPE ] to undertake that assessment . However it has been made very clear to them during the court process that this information is essential in informing the court care plan and it is unlikely that [ GPE \u2019s ] attitude is likely to change in the short term and we can not delay planning for [ PERSON ] any further . [ The applicant and GPE ] have been aware of the seriousness of this case from the outset and despite the possibility of their son not being returned to their care they remain resolute in their attitude and lack of acknowledgment of the issues . [ GPE ] in particular has deflected the issues away from his parenting of [ PERSON ] and the issues within the family focussing on acrimonious relationships with professionals and losing sight of [ PERSON \u2019s ] needs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In her professional opinion , PERSON had an idealised view of returning home , seeing the opportunity for treats and presents with the ability to manipulate his parents into giving him all he wanted with few boundaries and controls . He maintained his strong desire to have supervised contact to ensure that the arguments between his parents did not recommence .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , she repeated her view that PERSON would suffer significant harm if he returned home as their drinking and violence were likely to reoccur . Neither parent had engaged in any meaningful assessments which would indicate a positive outcome were PERSON to return home . The parents were committed to one another and GPE had shown no ability to work in partnership with the local authority . She considered that PERSON was of an age where there was a very limited time window for achieving legal permanence and long - term fostering with ongoing parental contact would not be in his best interests , given his GPE level of negative influence in his life . She was of the view that PERSON needed the opportunity to form attachments with long - term carers without the placement being undermined by his parents . She therefore concluded :", "\u201c The local authority respectfully recommends to the court that [ ORG \u2019s ] long term interests can be best met through adoption preferably with some form of contact with his parents . [ PERSON ] is only CARDINAL and deserves the opportunity to live in a family where he will be legally secure , developing positive attachments without feeling disloyal to his parents . He needs to be with a family who can exercise parental responsibility and make decisions in [ PERSON \u2019s ] life without the negative influence of the birth parents . \u201d", "CARDINAL . She asked the court to make a care order and a placement order in respect of PERSON", "DATE . On DATE the applicant filed a statement in response . The statement noted :", "\u201c I can confirm that not only have there been no reported incidents between myself and my partner [ GPE ] , but also there have been no actual domestic incidents ... I confirm that we do not consume alcohol and although we have indicated that we would be willing to undergo further testing when we have met on contact appointments the same has never been pursued ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . She refuted several aspects of the social worker \u2019s statement , noting :", "\u201c ... It often feels like whatever we are being asked to do we are then asked to do more . I certainly do not agree that I have only worked with professionals to a limited extent . \u201d", "CARDINAL . She concluded that while she and GPE had hoped that PERSON could be returned to their joint care , they both recognised that the social services\u2019 opinion of GPE was so damaged that their only chance of parenting might be to do it separately . The applicant indicated that for this reason , she and GPE were thinking of separating so that she could parent PERSON on her own . She requested the court not to make a placement order and to return PERSON to her care .", "CARDINAL . A statement from GPE confirmed the absence of any domestic incidents and the fact that neither he nor the applicant had consumed any alcohol . No mention was made of the possibility of separation .", "CARDINAL . The guardian \u2019s ORG and Recommendations report was dated DATE . It was based on full consideration of the welfare checklist ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the section of her report dealing with recent developments , she indicated that the status of the relationship between the applicant and GPE was not clear as they had recently informed the authorities that they had separated . The report also referred to information regarding a violent domestic incident at the home on DATE when the police were called . The applicant had told the police that GPE had hit her , although he denied it . The guardian explained that the information had been received after the report had been prepared in draft , but noted that the incident added \u201c cogent testimony \u201d to the detail of her report .", "CARDINAL . The guardian compared PERSON as she then saw him with his condition in DATE and reported that he had grown in confidence and settled in all aspects of his placement . He presented as happy and settled , embracing family life in his carers\u2019 home and making very good progress at school .", "CARDINAL . As to PERSON \u2019s wishes and feelings , in DATE he had appeared confused about returning home . He had felt safe with his carers and gave mixed messages about whether he wished to stay with them or return home . He was firm in his view that he did not want contact with his parents without social workers being present . In DATE he indicated that he wanted to go home to live with his parents . When questioned about how that would work since he wished to have supervised contact with them , he replied that social services would also be there . She observed :", "\u201c These statements clearly demonstrate what [ GPE ] has stated in \u2018 that [ PERSON ] both loves and fears his parents \u2013 his father more so\u2019 . He wants to go home but wants the safety net of social workers being in his home to protect him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The report continued :", "\u201c In my opinion [ the parents ] both needed to access treatment programmes for their drinking and violence , they would also have to begin to discover , reflect and recover from the underlying issues that led to the drinking and violence in DATE place ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report went on to consider in more detail GPE \u2019s behaviour and history .", "CARDINAL . The guardian also commented on the parenting assessments conducted , noting in respect of the applicant that she appeared to lack understanding of the impact of arguments on PERSON and of alcohol on her parenting ability , and that she failed to see that GPE \u2019s behaviour towards her was abusive and controlling . The guardian considered the crux of the issue for reunification to be that the parents had not engaged in or completed treatment programmes for alcohol or domestic abuse , noting that GPE refused to accept that he was a perpetrator . She concluded :", "\u201c There can be no delay for PERSON His parents have sadly not even begun to do the work that is needed to support and assist them with their fundamental problems / difficulties and the underlying issues that predispose their drinking and violence . Without the input they need I would expect their behaviour to revert to type , especially in the case of [ GPE ] , which would fundamentally seriously impact on PERSON causing him further significant harm if he was returned to their care . \u201d", "CARDINAL . She recommended that the court endorse the local authority plan for a care order with a plan for adoption .", "CARDINAL . A DATE hearing took place before ORG DATE . It had before it applications by the local authority for a care order and for a placement order .", "CARDINAL . At the start of the hearing , the court was presented with a new case on behalf of the applicant . In a position statement dated DATE , she said that on DATE she had discovered that GPE had been to a pub and had drunk QUANTITY of beer . She had remonstrated with him for drinking when they were so close to having PERSON returned to them and he had pushed her into a chair and slapped her . She had called the police . She said that the relationship with GPE was over , and that from the guardian \u2019s report she had learned new information about domestic violence in GPE \u2019s past relationships . She was planning , with the help of a recent inheritance , to rent a property near her sister , with the support of her sister and GPE \u2019s adult son , ORG The applicant asked to be given a chance to prove that she could safely parent PERSON on her own , away from parental conflict , and requested a section CARDINAL ) assessment of her as a sole carer ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She proposed that PERSON be assessed with her by an independent social worker who would address PERSON \u2019s relationship with the applicant , the applicant \u2019s parenting abilities and the management of any risks to PERSON In the interim , she sought a further ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a brief written statement dated DATE , ORG said that he intended to sign a joint lease shortly , move in with the applicant and support her as much as he could .", "CARDINAL . The court heard oral evidence . Notes were taken by the clerk and a transcribed note of evidence has been provided to the ORG by the respondent Government . However , it is in note form , with no clear distinction drawn between questions asked by counsel and responses made by witnesses . The notes are therefore of limited assistance in identifying the exact nature of the oral evidence given and any conclusions drawn from them should be treated with caution .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the notes that , in his oral evidence , PERSON expressed concern regarding the lack of evidence of a change in parenting skills by the applicant . Some discussion of adoption took place with him . He appeared to agree that if PERSON could be rehabilitated to the applicant \u2019s care , in circumstances in which his needs were properly met by her , then that would be a better solution than adoption . The notes suggest that he referred to PERSON \u2019s age and the greater difficulties encountered in seeking to place an older child for adoption . However , he seems to have expressed pessimism about the prospects for change in the applicant \u2019s behaviour , and indicated that his preference was for PERSON to stay with his foster placement on a long - term basis , although he appeared to recognise that this was not an option . He commented that the applicant had been entirely cooperative with him . His views on the value of a further assessment of the applicant are not clear .", "CARDINAL . The notes suggest that the social worker did not believe that the applicant \u2019s separation from GPE was genuine . She expressed the view that the applicant was so entrenched in domestic violence and her self - esteem was so eroded that she would be unable to separate properly from GPE She added that in any event the local authority had already carried out a parenting assessment ; a further assessment would unsettle PERSON , disrupt his placement and delay the matching process .", "CARDINAL . The notes confirm that the applicant gave an account of the incident of DATE . She explained that she had subsequently asked her social worker for help in separating from GPE She accepted that her statement of CARDINAL DATE , in which she had said that there had been no further violent incidents , was untruthful . She said she was too scared to tell anyone . She indicated that she had not drunk alcohol since DATE , nor had she been violent towards GPE She reiterated that she had decided to move to a new house close to her sister and that FAC was going to move in with her to assist . She had a fund of GBP CARDINAL which she would use for the benefit of PERSON She would apply for an injunction to prevent GPE from visiting her , and his contact with PERSON would have to be supervised . She said that she would undergo any programmes or assessments by a social worker , and that she was willing to see the guardian and PERSON again . She concluded that she had no intention of resuming a relationship with GPE if PERSON were returned to her . She had discovered from the guardian \u2019s report how he had treated his older children . She asked for the opportunity to be assessed as a sole parent for PERSON and accepted that PERSON would have to remain in care while the assessment took place .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the guardian gave evidence . The notes indicate that she opposed any further assessment of the applicant . It appears that she did not think that the separation was genuine . In any case , whether the separation was genuine or not was immaterial because in order for the applicant to keep herself and PERSON safe , her personality had to change . It seems that the guardian gave evidence to the effect that CARDINAL of the children placed for adoption DATE were PERSON \u2019s age . She appears to have expressed concern that any work with the applicant to address her issues would require long - term psychological input . She recommended adoption and indirect contact with the parents until they came to terms with the adoption .", "DATE . At the conclusion of the evidence and submissions on DATE the court reserved its decision . On DATE it handed down judgment . Commenting on the parenting assessments , the court indicated that in its view the contact sessions had generally gone well . It observed :", "\u201c ... We note that [ K. ] is not distressed when he returns from contact with his parents and understand that during contact he does ask his parents when he can come home and whether they have stopped drinking . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court found that the threshold criteria for the making of a final care order ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had been established , in light of the parents exposing PERSON to domestic violence and alcohol misuse causing him emotional and physical harm . It considered its range of powers and the need for a care order , referring to LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and emphasising that the child \u2019s welfare was the paramount consideration . It continued :", "\u201c In determining the child \u2019s welfare we have considered the welfare checklist . We have referred to the welfare consideration in the Children \u2019s ORG \u2019s report and consider this to be comprehensive . We accept the welfare aspects but consequent upon the late position statement by mother , dated DATE , reach a different conclusion . The ORG \u2019s report does not address [ the GPE ] separation . ... At this juncture we believe that this separation is genuine and this therefore leads us into considering whether [ the applicant ] is capable of meeting [ ORG ] needs , which includes protecting him from [ GPE ] . This information is not before the court and puts us in great difficulty in deciding whether a care order should be made . The only way to achieve this information would be by making a s.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) direction [ for an assessment ] , however this needs to be balanced against a further delay for [ PERSON ] .", "In considering our range of powers we could make an interim care order with a s.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) direction for [ the applicant ] to undergo a parenting assessment as a sole carer for [ K. ] . We are told that the assessment would take DATE and realistically DATE , before the case can be properly considered again by the court . This delay must be weighed against [ PERSON \u2019s ] best interests . Any delay is considered in law to be prejudicial unless it is planned and purposeful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After examining domestic case - law on the circumstances in which a parenting assessment was appropriate , the court continued :", "\u201c ... We therefore believe in fairness to [ the applicant ] she should be given CARDINAL last opportunity to have her parenting ability assessed in respect of [ PERSON ] .", "... We accept that [ K. ] needs a secure and stable environment in which to develop and have his needs met but this must be weighed up against him losing the opportunity to be brought up within his birth family , particularly his mother . He is DATE and has memories of his parents and has continuously asked when he can return to live with them .

The court recorded that this option was not recommended by the guardian , and explained why it disagreed :", "\u201c The reasons why we have gone against the ORG \u2019s recommendation are that we believe that a delay of DATE is acceptable in this case provided that it is purposeful and could prove to be in [ PERSON \u2019s ] best interests , should the assessment be positive as this will allow him to be raised with his birth mother , with whom [ GPE ] has clearly stated [ PERSON ] has a very strong bond . This assessment will provide us with valuable information when reaching our final decision and we intend to return for the final hearing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court accordingly made a direction for a section CARDINAL ) assessment and made a further ICO in respect of PERSON", "CARDINAL . The local authority and the child \u2019s guardian appealed the decision of ORG , arguing that there was no sufficient basis for the proposal that the applicant would be able to parent PERSON well enough on her own ; that the proposed assessment would duplicate earlier assessments ; and that the prospects of any assessment being favourable were too poor to justify the harm to the child of disruption and delay . They argued that the court ought to have made a final care order on the evidence before it . In their notices of appeal , they specifically sought a final care order and a placement order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the social worker lodged a further statement with the court . She confirmed that PERSON had been informed of the separation of his parents and appeared to have accepted the situation , noting that he seemed more relaxed during contact sessions with his mother and made no reference to having contact with his father . The social worker also confirmed that the applicant had moved to a new address , on the basis of a joint tenancy agreement with ORG , but indicated that ORG had not actually yet moved into the property . The applicant remained in direct and indirect contact with GPE , and the social worker noted that she appeared to be confused about his behaviour towards her .", "CARDINAL . The statement indicated that the applicant had been informed of the support she could access in order to develop her parenting skills , but observed that to date she had not accessed such support . The applicant had also spoken with a domestic violence worker , although a planned meeting had not taken place as there was some confusion over the venue and had not been rescheduled . The social worker reported that contact sessions between the applicant and PERSON had been broadly positive . However , she considered that the applicant had demonstrated that she was unable to make a clean break from GPE , which remained a concern to social services .", "DATE . The case came before ORG on DATE . By that time , the applicant and ORG had signed a lease on a property and the applicant had moved there . The judge considered extensive written and oral argument from the local authority and the guardian in support of the appeal . He took into account a substantial skeleton argument submitted by the applicant , who was represented by counsel at the hearing . He also had before him the various reports prepared for the hearing before ORG and the note of oral evidence prepared by the clerk ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He reserved his decision to DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the interim , on DATE , the court issued an order allowing the appeal . In its second paragraph , the order stated :", "\u201c The Judge is satisfied that the conditions for making a care order exist and accordingly make a placement order , dispensing with the consent of the parents under PERSON ) and CARDINAL of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge handed down his judgment on the appeal . He summarised the relevant reports and the oral evidence as recorded in the notes by the clerk , commenting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]he justices [ in ORG ] heard first oral evidence from [ GPE ] , and then from [ the social worker ] in support of the local authority \u2019s application . Their evidence is recorded in notes kept by the ORG clerk . I should observe that these notes are quite difficult to follow and there is sometimes little distinction between questions put and answers given . It is however clear that , when questioned about the mother \u2019s proposal to be assessed as a sole care for [ PERSON ] , both witnesses were unsupportive . [ D.I. ] said it was necessary to consider [ PERSON \u2019s ] needs now , and that a promise was not the same as change . He said that the mother \u2019s contact had not demonstrated a change in parenting skills . He was struck by the guardian \u2019s report , acknowledging that although the parents loved their child and wanted to change , they could not change . He said that [ PERSON ] was insecurely attached to both parents . He said that he was not recommending returning [ PERSON ] to his parents as it would cause him emotional and developmental damage . He said that his preference would be for [ PERSON ] to stay with his foster placement on a long - term basis , but it appears that he recognised that this was not an option . [ The social worker ] expressed the view that the mother \u2019s self - esteem was so eroded that she would not be able to separate properly from the father . She said that it was unclear whether the proposed assessment would be residential or in the community , but that in any event the local authority had already carried out a parenting assessment . She said that a further assessment would unsettle [ PERSON ] , disrupt his placement and delay the matching process . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge summarised the evidence of the applicant and ORG before turning to the evidence of the guardian , in respect of which he noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Again it was clear from her evidence that she opposed the further assessment of the mother . She said that she did not think that the mother could separate from the father simply by moving house , as he had a lot of power and control over her . But whether or not the separation was genuine was immaterial because in order to keep herself and [ PERSON ] safe her personality needed to change . This could only happen with long term psychological support . She agreed with [ GPE ] that everything would not be fine if the mother separated because she would return to the father . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge acknowledged that the decision of ORG was reached after hearing oral evidence from the principal witnesses over a period of DATE . He further acknowledged that the course of action selected by ORG was one that was open to it . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The temptation for a court to give directions for further evidence , often in the form of a s.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) assessment , is often strong . The decision to do so must always be taken in the best interests of the child . The proposition that the \u2018 ... court needs all the help it can get\u2019 has an immediate attraction , but the help must always be directed at achieving the right outcome for the child . Often there is the disadvantage of delay , and it is necessary accordingly to consider the possible outcomes of an assessment . In the present case the justices justified the delay as it retained the prospect of what they regarded as the best outcome for [ K. ] \u2013 rehabilitation to his family . But that outcome depended on the assessment being able to demonstrate that the mother had the capacity to parent [ K. ] in the long term . Given that the ORG findings contain the phrase \u2018 neither parent is at present capable of caring for [ K.]\u2019 , it is necessary to give consideration as to how the proposed assessment would proceed . If it was envisaged that [ PERSON ] would remain with his foster parents and spend increasing periods of visiting contact with his mother the report , \u2018 if PERSON , would merely state that the mother had given all the signs of being able to care for her son , at least in the contact situation . If it was envisaged that there would be a phased return to the mother , with increasing periods of staying contact , then the report would be able to speak with greater confidence of the mother \u2019s capacity to parent her son . In either case however [ PERSON ] would be exposed to a degree of disruption of his foster placement , and to the risk of emotional harm should the assessment break down . In both cases the duration of the assessment would be too short to enable the report writer to give any sufficient guarantee that the mother would not , as predicted by the local authority and the guardian , resume her relationship with the father in due course . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . I have come to the conclusion that the evidence about the mother was clear . [ D.I. ] regarded the mother \u2019s separation from the father as a promise of change , not change itself , and it was his view that there was no change in her parenting skills . The assessment of the mother would never have been able to provide evidence that would be sufficient to justify the refusal of a care order and the decision to return [ PERSON ] to his mother , given her shortcomings and the real risk that she would be unable to maintain her separation from the father . In reality the only effect of postponing the decision to make a care order was to delay , and therefore to jeopardise , the process of finding an alternative long term placement for [ PERSON ] by way of adoption ... In these circumstances the decision of the justices must be categorised as wrong , and must be set aside ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He therefore allowed the appeal , indicated that he was satisfied that the conditions for making a care order existed and accordingly made a placement order , dispensing with the consent of the parents , under sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) and CARDINAL of ORG ( \u201c the DATE Act \u201d \u2013 see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . He added :", "\u201c I have come to the above conclusions independently of information which I was given at the outset of the hearing before me about ORG \u2019s failure so far to join the mother at her new accommodation , her further contact with the father at public houses , and her taking of small quantities of alcohol . Nonetheless this information tends to confirm the pessimistic view expressed about the mother \u2019s inability to separate from the father .", "... I do not propose that the judgment be formally given at a court hearing , although if there is anything that requires my further attention in court , an appropriate hearing can be arranged . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON informed the applicant that he was not happy with the decision of the judge and that he wanted to come home .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal the judgment of ORG , arguing that as there had previously been no care order in place , the judge should not have made a placement order without having due regard to the responsibilities placed on him by section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . In particular , she contended , the judge should have considered the child \u2019s ascertainable wishes and feelings regarding the decision and the relationships which he had with relatives and any other relevant person .", "CARDINAL . Permission to appeal was refused on the papers on DATE on the ground that ORG judge had been sitting in an appellate capacity , that he had reached a conclusion that was clearly open to him and that he had explained his conclusion most clearly . The applicant renewed her request for leave . An oral hearing subsequently took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG handed down its judgment on the request for leave to appeal . In relation to the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG had failed to take into account relevant considerations , and in particular had failed to have regard to the welfare checklist , the judge delivering the opinion of the court noted :", "\u201c Her proper remedy in my judgment was to take advantage of the judicial offer in the final sentence of the [ ORG ] judgment ... She could have asked the judge to clarify the order that he was making and to indicate in his judgment how he arrived at such a conclusion . She could equally have asked him for permission to appeal . None of those things were done in the county court and a notice of appeal was filed in this court ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued :", "\u201c ... it seems to me on fuller investigation that [ the applicant \u2019s case ] lacks merit . First of all , the judge was reviewing a decision from the magistrates who had , I suspect out of understandable sympathy for the mother , held off the local authority \u2019s application with an order under LAW ) . But it is hard to see how that application was justified on the facts and circumstances , and [ ORG ] decision to set aside an order which stood on flimsy legal foundation is hardly open to challenge . Nor do I think in the end that there is any substance [ to the complaint ] that he dealt with the outcome in too peremptory a fashion . After all , the mother \u2019s legal team knew from the form of the notices of appeal to the circuit judge precisely what the local authority sought to gain from the hearing . It was quite open to [ counsel for the applicant ] to submit to the judge that he should not make a placement order even if he were persuaded to make a care order , since there was insufficient material to enable him to carry out the LAW review . It seems that she did not make that submission prior to judgment and , as I have already observed , she ignored the opportunity to make it immediately on receipt of the written judgment and to ask the judge to reconsider the order of CARDINAL [ DATE ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
