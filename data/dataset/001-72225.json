THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He is represented before the ORG by ORG , a firm of solicitors based in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows . The applicant was , at the material time , a lance corporal ( a non - commissioned officer ) in the NORP army .", "On DATE he was convicted by a General Court Martial ( \u201c GCM \u201d ) of CARDINAL offences of rape of a junior female army officer ( a Lieutenant ) . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and dismissed with disgrace from the service . The ORG comprised CARDINAL officers ( not below the rank of Captain ) , a permanent president and a judge advocate . ORG did not alter the GCM \u2019s finding or sentence .", "The appeal to ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) was dismissed on DATE . The applicant had argued that trial by court - martial comprised exclusively of officers violated the impartiality guarantee of LAW where the complainant was an officer , the accused was a soldier from the ranks and the issues in the case turned on the credibility of the evidence of those individuals . The ORG noted that :", "\u201c We have already referred to the fact that the members of the court swear a judicial oath for each case they are to try . The following passage formed part of the judge advocate \u2019s summing - up ... :", "\u201c What is required of you at this stage is cold , clinical dissection of the evidence . You are a panel of CARDINAL commissioned officers , trying the factual issues in this case . The complainant ... is a commissioned officer . It would , of course , be entirely wrong for you to prefer the evidence of [ the complainant ] because she is a commissioned officer as against the evidence of the accused because he is a non - commissioned officer . That would be to show partiality and I remind you again of the oath you took at the outset of this case , to try this case without partiality , favour or affection . Your commonsense will no doubt tell you that commissioned officers do not always tell the truth any more than non - commissioned officers do not always tell the truth . It may be , I know not , that you were unimpressed with [ the complainant \u2019s ] career to date . It \u2019s not been without its problems . She was short - toured from GPE and I suspect you will conclude that on occasions she drank rather more than was good for her . These are factors about her that you are entitled to consider , but again it would be wrong to say ... that simply because of those problems in her career to date , she is not worthy of belief . Similarly with the accused , bear in mind all you know about him , the fact that he is a non - commissioned officer is CARDINAL of the things you know about him . You also know about his career to date , his achievements and what other people think of him and his qualities . Weigh that in the balance when deciding the weight that you feel is appropriate to attach to his evidence . \u201d", "These directions were clear , robust , and balanced . The court can have been left in no possible doubt but that it was their duty to assess the evidence free of the least influence exerted by the ORG respective ranks . In our judgment no apparent bias ... is shown , and there was no violation of LAW . \u201d", "In its judgment of that date the ORG also refused to certify a point of law of public importance to ORG concerning the applicant \u2019s ground of appeal to the ORG .", "LAW ( the \u201c LAW \u201d ) came into effect on DATE , amending the Army Act DATE ( the \u201c CARDINAL Act \u201d ) . The relevant domestic law and practice applicable to air - force courts - martial following the entry into force of LAW is set out in the case of ORG v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINALXII ) . The relevant regulatory framework governing post-CARDINAL Act army courts - martial is the same in all material respects ( the ORG judgment , at \u00a7 MONEY ) .", "At the relevant time , a ORG was required to consist of a permanent president , not CARDINAL serving military officers of CARDINAL years\u2019 military experience and a judge advocate ( section CARDINAL of LAW , prior to amendment by LAW ) .", "LAW ( the \u201c LAW \u201d ) has since inserted a new section CARDINALD into LAW . The new section provides , inter alia , that membership of a ORG may include CARDINAL ( non - commissioned ) warrant officers where the accused is a person of a rank below that of the warrant officers concerned . In giving evidence on DATE to ORG on this draft legislation , the Chief of ORG stated :", "\u201c There are some areas where [ the Bill ] will improve the way we actually conduct our discipline . The idea , for example , of having warrant officers able to sit on courts - martial gives us the opportunity to use the experience of these excellent people within the service , and I am sure that will be perceived as a good thing , which in turn must reflect on the overall discipline . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
