On DATE the expert submitted his report which concluded that it had been proved to a probability of PERCENT that the applicant was the child \u2019s biological father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG scheduled a hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment establishing that Mr M. was not the child \u2019s father and that the applicant was the child \u2019s father . ORG found the applicant \u2019s action admissible , as he had submitted a statutory declaration that he had had sexual intercourse with the child \u2019s mother during the period of conception . The action was well - founded , as it had been proved by expert opinion that the applicant was the child \u2019s biological father . ORG considered that the applicant had not been precluded from challenging paternity under LAW ( see relevant domestic law below ) , as there had been no social and family relationship between Mr M. and the child at the time of the last court hearing . It could not be assumed that Mr M. bore actual responsibility for the child . This would have required the legal father and the child to have lived together for a longer period of time , which , according to ORG , necessitated a minimum period of DATE . Taking into account the constitutional right of the biological father under LAW of LAW , it was necessary that the factual relationship between the legal father and the child enjoyed a certain stability . This stability could only be assumed after DATE , which had not passed in the instant case . Under these circumstances , it was not relevant that the applicant actually took care of the child together with the child \u2019s mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE ) quashed ORG judgment and rejected the applicant \u2019s action . The court noted that it was undisputed between the parties that Mr M. had lived with the child and her mother since the child \u2019s birth and that he had continued to live with them after it had been established by an expert that he was not the child \u2019s biological father .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , ORG had failed to recognise that the applicant did not have the right to challenge paternity because of the existence of a social and family relationship between Mr M. and the child . ORG considered that such a relationship had not only existed at the time it decided on the appeal , but already a long time before , as Mr M. had lived together with the child and her mother in a joint household since the child \u2019s birth . A young child could not possibly live together with another person for a period of time longer than his or her own lifetime . The legislature had not strictly defined which period of time would amount to a \u201c longer period of time \u201d , but had left this assessment to the courts adjudicating each individual case .", "CARDINAL . The period of time which was necessary to establish a social and family relationship was not absolute , but had to be assessed with regard to the circumstances of each individual case and , in particular , the child \u2019s age . There was no doubt that a child , during DATE of his or her life , developed a social and family relationship with the persons taking care of him or her on a DATE basis . During DATE of his or her life , a child was in particular need of secure family relationships , which allowed him or her to develop further social contacts . A child \u2019s interest in learning about its true descent could only become relevant at a more advanced age . According to the intentions of the legislature , who were guided by ORG case - law , external disturbances should be avoided in the child \u2019s best interests and in the interest of the already existing family relationship . The constitutional rights of the biological father should not prevail over the equally protected rights of the legal father , if and as long as the latter assumed parental responsibility within the meaning of social parentage . Against this background , even a period of DATE which elapsed between a child \u2019s birth and the bringing of an action to challenge paternity could be considered as a \u201c longer period \u201d within this specific context .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not find it necessary to decide whether the period of time which had elapsed between the child \u2019s birth and the lodging of the applicant \u2019s action would have been sufficient to establish a social and family relationship . According to the case - law of ORG , in cases in which the child had lived since birth without interruption together with his or her legal parents , the existence of a social - family relationship had to be assumed if the cohabitation persisted and the judge was convinced that the legal father assumed actual parental responsibility in a way which appeared to be long - lasting . It was not decisive whether the social and family relationship already existed when the action was lodged , but only whether there was a social and family relationship at the time of the last court hearing . The applicant had failed to point to any circumstances which could call into question the existence of such a relationship in the instant case . Conversely , the fact that the relationship between the legal parents had endured the crisis which had been caused by the mother \u2019s breach of trust indicated that the relationship was particularly stable . ORG did not allow an appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , everyone is equal before the law ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ; men and women have equal rights ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , in so far as relevant , provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Marriage and the family shall enjoy the special protection of the ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) The care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them . The ORG shall watch over them in the performance of this duty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a child \u2019s father is either the man who on the date of the child \u2019s birth was married to the child \u2019s mother ( no . CARDINAL ) , or the man who acknowledged paternity ( no . CARDINAL ) , or whose paternity is judicially established under LAW ( no . CARDINAL ) . An acknowledgement of paternity is not valid as long as the paternity of another man exists ( LAW ) . Paternity can only be validly acknowledged with the mother \u2019s consent ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Paternity may be challenged within a time - limit of DATE . The period commences on the date on which the entitled person learns of the circumstances that militate against the established paternity ; the existence of a social and family relationship does not prevent the period from running ( LAW ) . Under LAW , entitlement to challenge paternity lies with the man whose paternity exists LAW nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , with the mother and with the child , and also with the man who makes a statutory declaration that he had sexual intercourse with the child \u2019s mother during the period of conception . However , pursuant to LAW , the biological father has a right to challenge the paternity of the man who is the child \u2019s legal father under LAW . CARDINAL or CARDINAL only if there is no social and family relationship between the legal father and the child . A social and family relationship is considered to exist if the legal father has or had actual responsibility for the child at the relevant point in time . There is , as a rule , an assumption of actual responsibility if the legal father is married to the mother of the child or has lived together with the child in a domestic community for a long period of time ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW as in force since DATE , the legal father , the mother and the child can request the examination of paternity by genetic testing . The outcome of these proceedings does not change the legal status of the persons involved . However , no such right is granted to a third person alleging that he is the biological father .", "CARDINAL . Research undertaken by ORG in respect of PERCENT ORG GPE shows that in CARDINAL of those GPE acknowledgment of the paternity of a child born out of wedlock requires the mother \u2019s consent . In GPE ( namely GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , the presumed biological father is entitled to challenge the legal paternity of a third party established by acknowledgment . This right may be subject to certain time - limits . In GPE this remains the position where the legal father has lived with the child in a social and family relationship . In GPE and GPE , the biological father may not challenge paternity if the child has lived in a social and family relationship with the legally acknowledged father for a period of CARDINAL or DATE , respectively ( la possession d\u2019\u00e9tat conforme au titre ) .", "CARDINAL . By contrast , in CARDINAL GPE ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) the biological father does not have standing to challenge the paternity of the legal father established by acknowledgement . In those CARDINAL jurisdictions , the courts are not entitled to judicially consider ( on the grounds of the best interests of the child or otherwise ) whether the biological father should be allowed to challenge paternity ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
