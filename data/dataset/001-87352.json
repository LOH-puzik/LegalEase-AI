This article provides that compensation shall be paid to a victim of a miscarriage of justice , on certain conditions .", "First , the person concerned has to have been convicted of a criminal offence by a final decision and to have suffered punishment as a result of such conviction . According to the definition contained in the explanatory report of ORG on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments , a decision is final \u201c if , according to the traditional expression , it has acquired the force of res judicata . This is the case when it is irrevocable , that is to say when no further ordinary remedies are available or when the parties have exhausted such remedies or have permitted the time - limit to expire without availing themselves of them \u201d . It follows therefore that a judgment by default is not considered as final as long as the domestic law allows the proceedings to be taken up again . Likewise , this article does not apply in cases where the charge is dismissed or the accused person is acquitted either by the court of first instance or , on appeal , by a higher tribunal . If , however , in CARDINAL of the States in which such a possibility is provided for , the person has been granted leave to appeal after the normal time of appealing has expired , and his conviction is then reversed on appeal , then subject to the other conditions of the article , in particular the conditions described in paragraph CARDINAL below , the article may apply .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the article applies only where the person \u2019s conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned , in either case on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice - that is , some serious failure in the judicial process involving grave prejudice to the convicted person . Therefore , there is no requirement under the article to pay compensation if the conviction has been reversed or a pardon has been granted on some other ground . Nor does the article seek to lay down any rules as to the nature of the procedure to be applied to establish a miscarriage of justice . This is a matter for the domestic law or practice of the ORG concerned . The words \u201c or he has been pardoned \u201d have been included because under some systems of law pardon , rather than legal proceedings leading to the reversal of a conviction , may in certain cases be the appropriate remedy after there has been a final decision .", "CARDINAL . Finally , there is no right to compensation under this provision if it can be shown that the non - disclosure of the unknown fact in time was wholly or partly attributable to the person convicted .", "CARDINAL . In all cases in which these preconditions are satisfied , compensation is payable \u201c according to the law or the practice of the ORG concerned \u201d . This does not mean that no compensation is payable if the law or practice makes no provision for such compensation . It means that the law or practice of the ORG should provide for the payment of compensation in all cases to which the article applies . The intention is that GPE would be obliged to compensate persons only in clear cases of miscarriage of justice , in the sense that there would be acknowledgement that the person concerned was clearly innocent . The article is not intended to give a right of compensation where all the preconditions are not satisfied , for example , where an appellate court had quashed a conviction because it had discovered some fact which introduced a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused and which had been overlooked by the trial judge . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
