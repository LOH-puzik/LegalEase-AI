The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has been registered with ORG ) in GPE and , since DATE , she has been taking part in different programmes provided by it . CARDINAL of these programmes , called activity guarantee ( aktivitetsgaranti ) , was a programme for persons who were , or who were at a risk of becoming , unemployed for a long period as well as for groups of persons who often had difficulties in finding a job . The purpose of the programme was to give the participants greater opportunities to find a job and it involved different activities such as short term education and the possibility to try different kinds of work . Each person who participated in the programme had a personal supervisor from ORG and together they were supposed to set up a plan for the activities in which the participant was taking part . The participant was obliged to attend meetings and to meet his or her supervisor on a regular basis , and he or she also had an obligation to apply for suitable jobs which were advertised through ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( apparently on delegation from ORG ) ) decided to withdraw its approval for the applicant to take part in the programme in which she was participating . The decision was taken in accordance with Section CARDINAL(a ) of the Ordinance on Labour Market Policy Programmes ( f\u00f6rordningen om arbetsmarknadspolitiska program , SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; hereafter \" the DATE Ordinance \" ) . According to ORG , the applicant had not been acting in a proper manner in relation to the demands laid upon her . The decision was taken on the basis of a report drawn up by ORG . The report stated that the applicant had been called to attend information meetings on several occasions but that she had either announced that she was not able to attend or she had simply not attended . It also stated that the applicant , at an information meeting , had made statements that led to a job interview being cancelled .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant \u2019s permission to participate in the programme was revoked , her subsistence support in the form of activity support ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL below ) was also revoked , leaving her without any income . According to the applicant this forced her to pay for living expenses out of her savings for DATE and to take PERCENT early retirement in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision of ORG to ORG ( PERSON - nadsstyrelsen ORG \u201c the Board \u201d ) . She claimed that there were several statements in the report which were not true . For instance , she had been ill and hospitalised and therefore had not been able to attend certain meetings and she had informed ORG about the situation . She also alleged that a note in the report which stated that on CARDINAL occasion she had not attended a meeting was not true . Moreover , she claimed that , at the aforementioned information meeting , she had told an official of ORG that she felt she was not suited for the job in question . Thereafter , the official had told her that she could leave .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to reject the appeal . It found that the applicant had , on several occasions in DATE and DATE , announced that she was not able to attend certain meetings ; on one occasion because she had planned to go on vacation . ORG took into account the possibilities to adapt the kind of work the applicant was offered , and the fact that she had not proved her medical problems or shown that they were of a permanent nature , and found that she had not done everything in her power to get a job . Therefore , the ORG concluded that there were grounds to withdraw her entitlement to participate in the programme . Consequently , the appeal was rejected .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s decision , it was expressly stated that there was no possibility in accordance with LAW DATE Ordinance to appeal against the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote a letter to ORG , expressing her dissatisfaction with its decision . In the letter she referred , inter alia , to the fact that the ORG in its decision had noted that no appeal lay against the decision and asked how she could obtain redress .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a complaint to the Chancellor of Justice ( NORP ) where she complained , inter alia , about the authorities\u2019 decisions and their handling of her case . She requested damages , but did not claim that there had been a breach of her rights under LAW . This complaint seems still to be pending before the Chancellor of ORG .", "CARDINAL . A person who is unemployed may be entitled to subsistence support through the unemployment insurance . The main regulations in this area are given in LAW ( lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shets - f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , LAW ; hereafter \" LAW \" ) and LAW ( lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shetskassor , LAW ) . Unemployment benefits are financed through membership contributions made by the members of the unemployment insurance funds and ORG funding . A person who is not a member of an unemployment insurance fund can still receive some benefit , a so - called basic insurance . Benefits are paid to a person who is unemployed and has fulfilled a qualifying period of employment , that is he or she has worked a certain number of DATE before becoming unemployed , and who fulfils certain basic qualifying conditions , for example , he or she must actively be looking for work . At the relevant time benefits were provided for a limited number of DATE . After that , a new qualifying period of employment had to be completed in order to qualify for a new period of benefits .", "CARDINAL . According to Section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW , the benefits will be reduced for a certain period if the beneficiary , without acceptable reasons , rejects suitable work or if he or she , without having expressly rejected the work , by his or her actions causes employment not to be realised . The third time this happens the beneficiary will be disqualified from receiving benefits . According to LAW , the same will happen if a beneficiary without acceptable reasons rejects an assignment to a labour market policy programme ( arbetsmarknadspolitiskt program ) . Decisions regarding the right to the benefits regulated in LAW can be appealed against to the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . The activity guarantee scheme was CARDINAL of several different labour market policy programmes . The scheme ceased to be in force on DATE . According to Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Ordinance , a person could ( the word \u201c may \u201d ( f\u00e5r ) was used in the GPE ) be assigned to the activity guarantee scheme if he or she was DATE , was or was at risk of becoming unemployed for a long time and was searching for work through the public employment service . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Ordinance stated that an assignment to the programme had to be motivated in terms of labour market policy and , thus , an assignment could only be made if it appeared appropriate both for the individual and from an overall labour market policy perspective . Moreover , Section CARDINAL stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would apply for as long as it was justified in terms of labour market policy .", "CARDINAL . A person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would no longer be entitled to unemployment benefits . His or her subsistence would instead be paid according to the provisions in the Ordinance on Activity Support ( f\u00f6rordning om aktivitetsst\u00f6d , SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . LAW stated that a person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would lose his or her remaining DATE of unemployment benefits . In the preparatory works preceding the amendment of LAW Act the Government stated that it was not necessary to allow people who left the activity guarantee scheme a possibility to use their remaining DATE of unemployment benefits , \u201c since the system around the activity guarantee scheme means that no one should have to leave the activity guarantee without having his or her support secured \u201d ( Government PERSON p. DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The Ordinance on Activity Support stated that a person who took part in , inter alia , the activity guarantee scheme was entitled to economic support . According to LAW , a person who was or would have been entitled to unemployment benefits or who had received unemployment benefits for the longest period for which benefits could be provided , would be given activity support equivalent to the unemployment benefits he or she would have received under LAW . A person who was not entitled to benefits as described above would still be given a specific amount per day in activity support . When a person who had been taking part in a programme such as the activity guarantee ceased to be part of it , he or she was no longer entitled to the activity support .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(a ) of the DATE Ordinance stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would be revoked if a person assigned to it refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme without an acceptable reason . An assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would also be revoked if the individual did not act in a proper manner or otherwise disrupted the activities . Moreover , an assignment could be revoked if there were other special reasons to do so .", "CARDINAL . According to Section CARDINAL(b ) of the DATE Ordinance , if an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme was revoked because the individual had refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme , without an acceptable reason , the individual would ( the word \u201c shall \u201d ( skall ) was used in the GPE ) be reassigned to the activity guarantee scheme after a suspension of DATE , if certain basic requirements were met . In the Government PERSON which preceded the introduction of this provision , the Government noted that the consequences for those who had their assignment to the activity guarantee scheme revoked would be far - reaching unless they had fulfilled a new qualifying period of employment . The Government also observed that the activity guarantee scheme had the character of a last economic protection among the labour market policy measures for those who were , or were at a risk of becoming , unemployed for a long period . Thereafter the Government stated : \u201c The person applying should therefore in principle have a right to participate in the activity guarantee until he or she finds a solution for his or her unemployment situation , on condition that he or she in an active way contributes to such a solution . ... A person who has had his or her assignment to the activity guarantee revoked on the ground that he or she has refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme , shall therefore be offered a new assignment to the guarantee . \u201d ( Government PERSON CARDINAL p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . Decisions regarding the revocation of an assignment to a labour market policy programme , including the activity guarantee scheme , were taken by ORG . Appeals against ORG decision could be made to ORG . According to LAW Ordinance , no appeal lay against ORG decisions .", "CARDINAL . In connection with a reorganisation of ORG into ORG , the issue of whether decisions regarding labour market policy programmes should be subject to appeal was considered by the Government . It first stated that there was a right to be assigned to the labour market policy measure called \u201c new start jobs \u201d ( nystartjobb ) and then stated , inter alia , the following : \u201c In the case of other labour market policy measures and financial compensation , assignment decisions to them depend to a great extent on the situation in the labour market . There is no right to receive such a measure and there is no right to retain it either . This means that the decisions to be taken by the new agency in these matters , including the revocation of a measure , do not need to be examined by a court . Nor are the decisions suited to an examination by a court . \u201d ( Government PERSON p CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . The handling of matters in the NORP public administration is regulated by LAW ( f\u00f6rvaltningslagen , SFS CARDINAL ; hereafter \" LAW \" ) . LAW , of the DATE Act states that the provisions in the Act are subsidiary if they differ from the provisions in any other act or ordinance . According to LAW , a decision may be appealed against by any person whom the decision concerns , provided the decision affects him or her adversely and an appeal against the decision is permitted . Section CARDINAL(a ) states that appeals are to be made to the administrative courts . The preparatory works ( Government PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL pp CARDINAL ) state that CARDINAL of the purposes of LAW ) is to assign a competent court when a prohibition to appeal against a decision has to be set aside because it would be in violation of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new second paragraph was added to LAW which states that the provisions on appeal according to LAW should always apply if it is necessary in order to provide for everyone \u2019s right to a fair trial in the determination of their civil rights or obligations as laid down in LAW . According to the preparatory works ( Government PERSON p CARDINAL ) , one of the reasons for amending LAW was to make it clear that LAW provisions on appeal applied regardless of what was stated in other acts or provisions , if this was necessary in order to satisfy the right to access to court in accordance with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Act states that an authority has an obligation to inform a party about how to appeal against all decisions that affect the party adversely , if the decision can be appealed against .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) ORG ( ORG domstolen ) found that a dispute over agricultural subsidies concerned a civil right in the sense of LAW and found that a trial before a court should be allowed . Therefore , the court set aside the prohibition to appeal against the authority \u2019s decision . Similarly , ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) has set aside prohibitions to appeal against different authorities\u2019 decisions , when the cases concerned civil rights and obligations ( see , for example , decision of DATE in R\u00c5 DATE ref . CARDINAL and decision of DATE in R\u00c5 DATE ref . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It follows from LAW , LAW ( ORG , ORG ) that the ORG is liable to pay compensation for , inter alia , financial loss caused by a wrongful act or omission in connection with the exercise of public authority . From LAW , LAW it follows that , under certain circumstances , the ORG is liable to pay compensation for financial loss caused by an erroneous instruction or advice given by an authority .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG found that an individual had a right to bring a civil action against the ORG before the national courts on the ground that there had been a violation of LAW because a criminal case against the individual had not been concluded within a reasonable time . ORG has subsequently , in a judgment on DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , found that individuals have a right to bring civil suits against the ORG for violations against any ORG of the ORG when the ORG , according to the ORG , has an obligation to pay damages for the violation and such obligation can not be based on national legislation .", "CARDINAL . Anyone who wishes to claim compensation from the ORG for financial loss , which he or she considers to have been caused by a wrongful decision taken by a court or an administrative ORG authority , can proceed in CARDINAL different ways : He or she may either petition the Chancellor of Justice in accordance with LAW on ORG against the State ( F\u00f6rordningen om handl\u00e4ggning av skadest\u00e5ndsanspr\u00e5k mot staten , ORG ) , or bring a civil action against the ORG in the ordinary courts . No appeal lies against a decision of the Chancellor of ORG . However , if the claim is rejected , the claimant still has the possibility to institute civil proceedings before the courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
