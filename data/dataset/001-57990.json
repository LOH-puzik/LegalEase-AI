In certain circumstances a failure on the part of the debtor to work and put himself in funds to pay the community charge might constitute culpable neglect . In my judgment , however , before such a finding could be sustained , at the very least there would have to be clear evidence that gainful employment , for which he was fit , was on offer to the debtor and that he had rejected or refused that offer .

Applying legislation similar to LAW of ORG , the magistrates found that his failure to follow the accountant 's advice constituted culpable neglect and they committed him to prison . ORG held that no causal connection had been established between the failure to follow advice in DATE and the failure to pay the rates in DATE , and that the magistrates had not properly entered into the inquiry ( as to whether the failure to pay was due to culpable neglect ) required by the legislation as a condition precedent of the warrant of commitment . They were therefore acting in excess of jurisdiction and were liable in damages .", "The CARDINAL ORG judges expressed their findings in slightly different terms .
