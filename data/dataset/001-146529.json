The applicants , PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in PERSON . They were represented before ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , and PERSON and PERSON from ORG in GPE , GPE . The applicants stated that they were also submitting the application on behalf of their relative PERSON , who had died on an unspecified date at DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON , who was the daughter of the first and second applicants and the sister of the third applicant , and was born in DATE , was diagnosed with schizophrenia . In DATE she was declared mentally incapable by the ORG and was deprived of legal capacity . No guardian was appointed as it was decided that she would be represented by her parents .", "CARDINAL . As PERSON \u2019s state of health deteriorated , on DATE the family placed her in an institution , ORG Mentally Ill Adults in the village of Radovtsi ( hereafter referred to as \u201c the Radovtsi Home \u201d ) . The home was financed by the ORG and managed by the mayor of the GPE municipality .", "CARDINAL . An inspection by ORG carried out in DATE established that the Radovtsi Home housed CARDINAL mentally ill patients at the time . The building was in a poor state of repair due to the lack of funds to carry out renovation work .", "CARDINAL . The inspectors also established that during DATE inmates of the home whose state of health was especially poor were kept in a locked room , known as the \u201c room for special care \u201d . The inspectors recommended the closure of the room , which was implemented on DATE . After that date the inmates were allowed to move around freely within the building , the doors of which nevertheless remained locked . The yard outside , occupying an area of QUANTITY , was enclosed by a wire fence . Even though on some occasions inmates managed to leave the home , they always returned promptly .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE a member of the staff of ORG administered a medication with a sedative and tranquilising effect to PERSON . DATE , around lunchtime , PERSON could not be found . Another inmate had seen her shortly beforehand , when Ms Lazarova had said that she was very hungry and was going to look for a friend of hers in the village . The gates had been open .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the staff informed the director of the home of Ms ORG \u2019s disappearance . They conducted a search of the area : on foot in the vicinity of the building and by vehicle in the neighbouring villages . They checked abandoned and derelict buildings . It had been snowing , but as the roads had just been cleaned , there were no footprints . It appears that the search may have been suspended at nightfall , although some documents indicate that it continued until TIME The search was resumed DATE . Oral contact with the police was established at TIME on DATE , and written contact on CARDINAL DATE , when PERSON was officially declared missing . The staff of the home and the police questioned the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages , some of whom said that they had seen a woman they did not know . However , PERSON was not found when the locations concerned were visited and searched . The search continued over DATE but did not yield any result .", "CARDINAL . The case file contains contradictory information as to the date on which the ORG staff informed the applicants about their relative \u2019s disappearance . Some documents indicate that this happened on DATE , whereas the applicants allege that they were not contacted until DATE .", "CARDINAL . Valya Lazarova \u2019s body was found on DATE , QUANTITY away from the home . According to the post mortem , her death was due to hypothermia and physical exhaustion . There were no traces of physical violence . Death had occurred DATE before the body \u2019s discovery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant lodged a complaint with the prosecution authorities alleging that the staff of ORG were responsible for his sister \u2019s disappearance from the home and her subsequent death .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE a prosecutor from the GPE regional public prosecutor \u2019s office concluded that there was no indication that PERSON had been the victim of intentional homicide .", "CARDINAL . A separate investigation was opened in relation to offences under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , namely exposing the life of a vulnerable person to risk and failing to assist a vulnerable person . In a decision dated DATE a prosecutor from the FAC district public prosecutor \u2019s office refused to institute formal criminal proceedings against identified persons under those provisions , noting that on DATE when PERSON had disappeared there had been CARDINAL members of the medical staff and CARDINAL orderlies on duty . None of them had been personally responsible for ensuring the inmates\u2019 physical presence . Accordingly , it did not appear that any of them had committed an offence under Articles CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the Criminal Code .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by the third applicant , on DATE a prosecutor from the GPE regional public prosecutor \u2019s office quashed the abovementioned decision and ordered a further investigation into the matter .", "CARDINAL . The GPE district public prosecutor \u2019s office interviewed the staff who had been on duty on DATE , residents of the village of Radovtsi and the people who had participated in the search following PERSON disappearance . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE a prosecutor from that office again refused to institute criminal proceedings , concluding that there was no indication that any of the staff members of ORG had committed an offence .", "CARDINAL . Upon a further appeal by the third applicant , on DATE that decision was upheld by the GPE regional public prosecutor \u2019s office . In addition to the findings of the ORG public prosecutor \u2019s office , it noted that the building housing the Radovtsi Home had been in a poor state of repair and that the institution had been understaffed . This , combined with the very poor state of health of the inmates , had facilitated PERSON disappearance from the home ; however , these factors had not been within the staff \u2019s control . Accordingly , none of the staff members , including the director of the home , could be held criminally liable .", "CARDINAL . In decisions dated DATE and DATE respectively , the PERSON appellate prosecutor \u2019s office and ORG upheld the above - mentioned decisions .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the third applicant also complained to ORG , which conducted an inquiry and informed the applicant of its findings in a letter dated DATE . The inquiry showed that the director of ORG had been informed of PERSON disappearance at TIME on DATE . The search had started immediately after that . Members of the staff had searched the neighbouring villages . The police and the mountain rescue service had joined in as well . The enquiry concluded that the search had been prompt and adequate . Moreover , it transpired that PERSON had left the home on another occasion in DATE , but had been found DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought a tort action against the GPE municipality , ORG and the ORG under the ORG and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They claimed CARDINAL NORP levs for each of them in compensation for non - pecuniary damage resulting from GPE death . In their statement of claim they argued that the medical treatment and the care provided to PERSON in FAC had been inadequate and that her needs had been neglected . They pointed out that the \u201c room for special care \u201d in the home had been closed in DATE , and argued that inmates in a serious state of health had been provided with no alternative care . In addition , they alleged that the staff of the home had not been sufficiently trained and had not treated the inmates in a humane manner . They also pointed out that the living conditions in the home had been poor . They argued that PERSON death was", "\u201c directly and immediately linked to the lack of appropriate care in the social institution , lack of administrative supervision on the part of the GPE municipality , lack of adequate support for the institution \u2019s work and lack of good practice \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The statement of claim was reviewed by a judge of ORG , who on DATE instructed the applicants to specify those administrative duties performed by the defendants in the course of which the alleged damage had occurred . The judge also asked for clarification of the specific acts and omissions complained of in respect of each defendant and the grounds for viewing these acts or omissions as unlawful .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response , on DATE the applicants submitted that the mayor of the FAC municipality , in his role as employer , and the bodies responsible for social assistance ( forming part of the centralised ORG ) had failed to monitor the staff of ORG as regards the performance of their duty to \u201c provide individually tailored social services and assess the needs of NORP Lazarova \u201d and had failed to ensure the presence of qualified medical personnel . They alleged that the mayor had also failed to ensure that the living conditions in the home were satisfactory in relation to PERSON \u2019s state of health and that ORG had failed to ensure methodical assistance , administrative supervision and the necessary financing . As to the ORG , represented by ORG , they claimed that it had not created the necessary legislative framework , had not adopted policies ensuring that staff of social care institutions were adequately qualified , and had not provided the GPE municipality with the financing needed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a decision dated DATE ORG refused to accept the statement of claim for examination , noting that the applicants had failed to provide the information and the clarification requested on DATE . In particular , it considered that the submissions of CARDINAL DATE mostly restated the initial statement of claim and that the inclusion of a new possible defendant , ORG , led to confusion . It thus concluded that", "\u201c neither the [ statement of claim ] , nor the additional submissions contain a request to order the cessation of an action that is not based on an administrative decision or on law , nor do they allege failure to take actions which the administrative body is obliged to take pursuant to the law , which actions or omissions are causally linked to the damage they allegedly sustained . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by the applicants , on DATE the abovementioned decision was upheld by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) provides in LAW that the ORG and the municipalities are liable for damage caused to private individuals and legal entities as a result of unlawful decisions , acts or omissions of their authorities or officials while discharging their administrative duties . Since DATE claims under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG have been examined by the administrative courts under the rules of LAW .", "CARDINAL . It is also possible to seek damages from the ORG and the municipalities under the general tort provisions ( sections CARDINAL et seq . ) of ORG Legal persons may be vicariously liable under section CARDINAL of the Act , which provides that a person who has entrusted another with performing a job is liable for the damage caused by that other person in the course of or in connection with the performance of the job . In this case the employer \u2019s liability is presumed and is to be engaged even where it can not be established which of its employees has caused the damage ( ORG DATE \u0433. , ORG DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. ) . Section CARDINAL of ORG has been successfully relied on in a case which , like the present one , concerned the disappearance and the subsequent death of a mentally ill patient placed in a social care institution . The domestic courts , which found that the staff of the institution \u2013 by virtue of its internal rules \u2013 had been responsible for constantly monitoring and supervising the claimants\u2019 relative , ordered the mayor of the respective municipality , as their employer , to pay the damages sought ( ORG \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. , PERSON \u0441\u044a\u0434 I \u0413\u041e , \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. ; ORG \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. , PERSON \u0430\u043f\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434 , ORG \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0438\u044f , \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 DATE ; PERSON \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 DATE , ORG , III \u0433. \u043e. ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
