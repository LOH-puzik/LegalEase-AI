Referring to a warrant issued by the NORP authorities which indicated , inter alia , that the applicant had been convicted to a term of DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for sexual assault and bodily harm , the expert assumed that the applicant had a personality \u201c with psychopathic features \u201d , which undermined his capacity to exercise a parental role .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the CAT sent the court a social report concerning the situation of GPE in the centre . The report \u2019s conclusion was that GPE should be referred for adoption , given that her mother had stopped visiting DATE previously and the applicant had not taken any concrete action aimed at assuming his responsibilities towards her .", "CARDINAL .

According to this report , the brother of the applicant had stated that he did not know about the birth of GPE and that he did not have the means to take her into his care .

By a judgment of DATE , ORG ordered that GPE be taken into care with a view to adoption , revoked the applicant \u2019s parental responsibility and forbade all contacts between him and GPE , pursuant to ORG DATE and CARDINAL-A of the Civil Code . Relying on the ORG statements and on the conclusion of a psychiatric report dated CARDINAL DATE , the court considered the following as relevant established facts :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . GPE stopped visiting GPE in DATE ...", "CARDINAL . GPE has not tried to receive , in any way , news concerning GPE ...", "CARDINAL . No other family member has ever tried to visit GPE", "...", "CARDINAL .

He has only indicated his willingness to find someone to take care of his child when confronted by [ staff of the centre ] .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE [ DATE ] the father \u2019s visits occur once per week , by a decision of the accommodation centre based on the fact that he has not defined his role in his daughter \u2019s upbringing ( n\u00e3o se assumir como projecto de vida para a filha ) .", "CARDINAL . The child does not ask about her father when she is not with him .", "CARDINAL . She calls him \u201c father \u201d and the visits are not problematic .", "CARDINAL .

The court further considered that , in accordance with DATE CARDINAL of LAW , the best interests of the child should prevail over the GPE interests as well as her integration in her biological family . However , as far as the mother , GPE , was concerned , it found that the conditions of paragraph CARDINAL ( e ) of DATE of LAW had been fulfilled , since she had not contacted GPE , nor tried to do so , for a period of over DATE .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the applicant , the court , relying on the established facts , considered that :", "- he had not undertaken any concrete measures to find an alternative to the institutional care ;", "- he had never taken the initiative of defining his role ( encontrar um projeto de vida ) in GPE \u2019s upbringing ;", "- C.H. did not have an emotional bond with her father , considering him as someone with whom to play , and never asked about him ; and", "- the father \u2019s attitude during the proceedings had consisted of repeatedly requesting time to find a solution for his daughter \u2019s upbringing but he never came out with one .", "CARDINAL . ORG also emphasised that there was no option for a member of the extended family to take GPE into their care . It considered that there were no perspectives of any change in GPE \u2019s situation within a short period of time and DATE in the life of a DATE child was a long time .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG relied on the conclusion of the psychiatric expert report of CARDINAL DATE , in which it had been stated that the father \u2019s personality was characterised by features that undermined the exercise of a parental role .", "The domestic court thus concluded that the conditions of paragraph CARDINAL ( d ) of DATE of LAW had been fulfilled with regard to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the first - instance decision to ORG . He argued that ORG should not have concluded that there was no emotional tie between himself and GPE , because it was in contradiction with other established facts and with the ORG statements . The applicant further argued that the court should not have found it established that he had made no efforts to create the necessary conditions in which to raise GPE because the ORG statements had indicated the opposite ; the applicant claimed that he had made numerous efforts to change his living conditions . In addition , the applicant contested established fact no . CARDINAL , that he had \u201c a personality with psychopathic features characterised by instability and impulsivity , which undermines the exercise of a parental role \u201d . He claimed that the court \u2019s reasoning was not clear with regard to the reasons supporting that established fact . According to the applicant \u2019s allegations , a first report dated DATE had considered that \u201c the applicant did not have any psychiatric illness \u201d and that he \u201c was aware of the specific needs of children in different development stages and that he had the mental and emotional abilities to undertake the role of a father figure \u201d . In the applicant \u2019s view , ORG had not provided reasons for its decision to give more weight to the report of CARDINAL DATE than to the CARDINAL of DATE .", "Lastly , the applicant argued that the requirements to make a decision on placing his child for adoption , in particular those of LAW d ) , were not applicable to him . In his view , the only element he lacked in order to raise ORG was a better financial situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the appeal admissible and ordered that the case file be sent to ORG . In its decision , it maintained the suspension of contacts between the applicant and GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld ORG judgment . After examining the evidence produced at first instance , it confirmed the facts that had been considered established .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that it resulted from the ORG statements that ORG did not regard the applicant as her father , but as someone with whom to play . Regarding the applicant \u2019s efforts to improve his financial situation and to define his role in his daughter \u2019s upbringing , ORG laid emphasis on the fact that he had not found any solution , regardless of the effort he had dedicated to doing so .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the psychiatric expert reports , ORG referred to the fact that the report of CARDINAL DATE had been requested with the intention of receiving clarifications , in the light of a warrant issued by the NORP authorities which had been submitted to the proceedings on DATE . The warrant indicated that the applicant had been convicted for sexual assault and bodily harm ( agress\u00e3o sexual em concurso com les\u00e3o corporal dolosa ) and sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . He had also lost the possibility of holding public office in GPE or being elected until DATE and had been banned from employing , supervising , instructing and training young persons .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court concluded that the CARDINAL psychiatric reports were not contradictory , as both mentioned that the applicant did not have a psychiatric illness ; the report of CARDINAL DATE only added to that of DATE that the applicant had a \u201c personality with psychopathic features \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that measures capable of integrating a child in his or her biological family should prevail . If the biological family could not fulfil its duties to take care of the child , then adoption should be considered . In this connection , ORG focused its reasoning on the family situation .", "CARDINAL . Regarding GPE , ORG noted that she had been a victim of sexual abuse and physical violence during her life and that she had attempted suicide several times . It also noted that she was in a fragile financial situation .", "CARDINAL . Looking at the applicant \u2019s past , the court noted that his life had been characterised by instability , without any known emotional ties . It also noted that he was unemployed , was a beneficiary of the minimum income allowance ( ORG ) and was living in a rented room .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court found that the applicant did not have the competence , maturity or lifestyle necessary to create a favourable environment in which to raise a child . The court expressed understanding of the applicant \u2019s affection for GPE and his disappointment with the current situation , but emphasised that the child \u2019s developmental needs should prevail .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date the applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG . He submitted a request to lodge an ordinary appeal under LAW or , alternatively , an exceptional appeal ( recurso de revista excecional ) under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible on the grounds that decisions adopted on grounds of \u201c suitability or appropriateness \u201d ( conveni\u00eancia ou oportunidade ) were not amenable to appeal before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date the applicant challenged that decision before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible on the grounds that ORG had fully upheld the first - instance decision ( dupla conforme ) . It further considered that the applicant had not submitted clear arguments that would justify an exceptional appeal .", "CARDINAL . Following a request from the applicant made in a letter of CARDINAL DATE , on CARDINAL DATE the ORG granted an interim measure pursuant to Rule CARDINAL of ORG , indicating to the Government that the adoption of the applicant \u2019s child should be stayed and his contacts with his child reinstated until the end of the proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government contested the ORG \u2019s decision concerning the applicant\u2019", "CARDINAL . Following a request for information , on CARDINAL DATE the Government submitted relevant case - file documents in order to contest the interim measure that had been applied .", "CARDINAL .
