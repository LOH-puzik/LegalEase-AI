It established that prior to her death PERSON had rented the contested apartment , which had not been privatised . The apartment had been in the possession of the GPE municipality . The rental agreement concluded with ORG had not affected ORG \u2019s rights to her inheritance . The court considered that the arguments raised concerning the rights of other persons ( including the rights of the applicant organisation ) were not relevant as the civil claim had only been brought in the name of ORG Further , the court noted that under domestic law rental agreements could only be challenged by landlords , tenants or members of a tenant \u2019s family . Neither ORG , nor ORG or members of her family were contesting the tenancy agreement . Besides , no competent institution of the GPE municipality had ever concluded a rental agreement with ORG , the appeal court agreed with the conclusion that the proceedings had been brought by a person who had had no standing .", "CARDINAL .

According to the Government , on DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) refused to lodge a civil claim contesting the rental agreement because it had concluded that there was no dispute about the applicant organisation \u2019s title to the collection of art works and that the fact the collection was stored in the contested apartment did not vest any right to the mentioned premises in the applicant organisation . Subsequent appeals to ORG and ORG were dismissed on DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . In relation to this point the applicant organisation submitted to the ORG CARDINAL letters prepared by ORG .

However , the other letter , dated DATE , bearing the same number and the signature of the same official , stated that ORG had examined the applicant organisation \u2019s request and had prepared a civil claim , to be brought before ORG . It also noted that on DATE this claim had been submitted to the relevant department of ORG for its approval . According to the applicant organisation , the existence of the CARDINAL contradictory letters and the fact that the claim was never brought proved that ORG had not acted independently and impartially and that its decision - making had been influenced by other persons with an interest in the outcome of this case . In particular , the applicant organisation noted the political influence of ORG son - in - law , who had been a member of parliament at the time in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE V.B.S. died .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant organisation also requested the recognition of its right to use the contested apartment . In subsequent submissions the applicant organisation clarified that it did not request the recognition of its own property rights over the contested apartment and indicated that ORG heir , PERSON , should be CARDINAL of the defendants in these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened proceedings . On DATE it decided to terminate the proceedings on the grounds , inter alia , that the applicant organisation had had no standing to bring the above \u2013 mentioned claims . In particular , the applicant organisation had contested a rental agreement and a purchase agreement to which it was not a party .", "CARDINAL . The applicant organisation lodged an ancillary complaint with ORG of ORG . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG . It noted that the applicant organisation had never been a party to the rental agreement in question or a beneficiary of the privatisation proceedings concerning the contested apartment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant organisation lodged a further ancillary complaint with the ORG of ORG . The applicant organisation reiterated that the privatisation of the contested apartment had been unlawful and had been carried out in bad faith . It also argued that there had been no legal grounds for the termination of the proceedings . The courts had indicated no legal basis for their conclusion that a person who was not a party to a rental agreement but whose rights to use the rented premises in question had been affected had no right to bring a claim to protect its rights . The applicant organisation , insofar as relevant , relied on DATE of the Civil Law ; sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG ; and sections CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the PERSON on the Privatisation of State and ORG . The applicant organisation contended that none of these provisions prevented it from bringing its claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG upheld the decision to terminate the proceedings . It noted that section CARDINAL of ORG defined the right to bring a claim as the possibility for an interested person to bring proceedings in order to protect his or her infringed or contested rights . Accordingly , a person could benefit from court protection if his or her claim was connected with an interference with that person \u2019s rights . Moreover , when deciding on a person \u2019s right to bring proceedings , a court had to take into account the fact that nobody had the right to interfere in another person \u2019s civil - law relationships if those relationships did not affect them ( either legally or in practice ) . The court continued :", "\u201c The ORG considers that the [ appeal ] court has justly found that because the ORG PERSON foundation is not a party to the rental agreement , it can not contest it . To consider that the interest of a third party DATE which the applicant is with regard to the rental agreement \u2013 in the annulment of a contract ( and hence the restoration of the previous situation ) is justified , it is necessary to establish that as a result of the annulment of that agreement an interference with that person \u2019s rights would be eliminated . However , in the present case , given that the contested apartment has never been in the possession ( vald\u012bjums ) of the ORG PERSON foundation one can not speak of an interference with the plaintiff \u2019s rights . The fact that the collection of art works is situated in the disputed LOC , which have the legal status of residential LOC , contrary to the opinion expressed in the ancillary complaint , does not grant the ORG PERSON foundation the right to acquire possession of the apartment .", "As correctly indicated by the [ appeal ] court , the plaintiff \u2019s right to contest the privatisation and ORG property rights should be assessed within the same context . An object such as the apartment owned by ORG can only be claimed from his [ that is to say ORG ] possession by its owner [ by lodging ] a property claim ( section ORG ) , which serves as an owner \u2019s protection against the illegal holding of a possession ( vald\u012bjuma pretties\u012bgu aiztur\u0113jumu ) of its immovable property . In the present case the aforementioned ground for contesting the defendant \u2019s property rights can not be established because the plaintiff \u2019s right to possess the contested object has not been established in a procedure set by law , which , in turn , precludes the reason to talk about interference with rights , as they have not been acquired . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , and CARDINAL with regard to different types of situations provide that all rented apartments shall be offered for privatisation to their tenants and their family members . Such persons can acquire title to a rented apartment if no proceedings have been brought requesting the termination of the rental agreement in question and the eviction of the tenants . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the relevant privatisation commission decides on whether to conclude a purchase agreement with a person who has applied for privatisation . On the basis of this decision , the privatisation commission then concludes a purchase agreement . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that only the person who is registered in the land register in respect of a particular property can be recognised as the owner of the privatised object .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , rented apartments are offered for privatisation after the privatisation of the residential building in which they are situated has commenced . Nonetheless , the PERSON also sets out the procedure whereby the ownership rights to an apartment can be transferred to tenants prior to the privatisation of the residential building . The decision on whether to transfer the ownership rights to an apartment prior to the privatisation of the residential building is taken by a privatisation commission upon a request of a tenant ( section CARDINAL ) . The name of the person who has acquired ownership rights to an apartment prior to the privatisation of the relevant residential building shall be registered in the cadastral register and from the moment of this registration that person shall be recognised as the owner of the apartment ( sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) ) .

Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that a court is competent to examine disputes , inter alia , concerning the rights of a beneficiary of privatisation to privatise an apartment , the registration of the privatised object in the land register , and other disputes which may arise in the course of the privatisation of residential buildings and which do not fall to be examined by local municipalities . Under section DATE , the privatisation of an apartment shall be declared unlawful in the following circumstances : the apartment has been privatised in a manner disregarding the sequence of steps set out in this PERSON ; the person concerned has privatised a previously rented apartment without having first informed his or her family members thereof ; or other requirements set out in this PERSON or rules of ORG adopted on the basis of this PERSON have been disregarded .", "CARDINAL .
