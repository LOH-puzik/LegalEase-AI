The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . His father was a pharmaceutical entrepreneur who had owned property in GPE of GPE which was subject to expropriation measures in DATE and DATE , after an administrative body classified him as a \u201c NORP activist \u201d , \u201c NORP criminal \u201d and \u201c person profiting from the war \u201d . After GPE \u2019s reunification , the applicant \u2019s application for restitution of the property under LAW ( Verm\u00f6gensgesetz ) proved unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant initiated proceedings under LAW ( Strafrechtliches Rehabilitierungsgesetz ) on behalf of his late father . He claimed that the expropriation and other measures had a penal character , although his father \u2019s guilt had been determined not by a court but by an administrative body . He submitted a vast number of documents , claiming that the historical background of the measures taken under the NORP occupation command had to be evaluated anew . In particular , the DATE and DATE provisions on which the measures against his father had been taken could now be qualified as criminal prosecution . New research had shown that their objective was to punish individual NORP for alleged wrongdoing . The applicant requested , inter alia , that the DATE decisions to find his father guilty of being a NORP and the subsequent decisions to expropriate him and confiscate his personal property and the property belonging to his company be declared contrary to the rule of law and hence void . According to the applicant , the value of his restitution claims amounted to QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG fixed a public hearing for DATE , as requested by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers published a press release under the following title :", "\u201c Turnaround in the assessment of the NORP industrial reform ? For the first time FAC discusses a criminal rehabilitation application at an oral hearing . \u201d", "In the press release the lawyers explained , in particular , that until that time the domestic courts had seen the objective of the measures in question as motivated by economic policy , that is , having the purpose of modifying the prevailing ownership structure . They presented the fact that ORG had fixed an oral hearing as a potential turning point in domestic case - law and announced that they would explain orally and in detail at the hearing what the so - called \u201c economic reform \u201d had really been about . At the same time they communicated the date , time and place of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG cancelled the hearing foreseen for DATE and set a time - limit for written procedure ending on DATE . It found that , according to section QUANTITY , first sentence , of LAW , a decision should generally be taken without holding an oral discussion . The date for a hearing , according to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had been set to give the applicant the opportunity to illustrate ( erl\u00e4utern ) his legal opinion , which conflicted with that of ORG and ORG and was supported by particularly extensive factual submissions . Making use of its margin of appreciation , ORG refrained from holding a hearing since , contrary to its prior opinion , there was no longer any additional benefit to be gained for dealing with the case . In fact , the scheduling of the hearing had been used to create the impression in a press release , also published on the internet , that by calling a hearing ORG had indicated that it was abandoning its settled case - law . Furthermore , the press release had announced that the applicant would use the hearing to \u201c reveal an important part of contemporary history \u201d . This indicated that the hearing was to be used as a public forum . Against this background , the court refrained from holding a hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following unsuccessful claims by the applicant that the judges were biased , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request . It held that the measures taken against the applicant \u2019s father were not of a penal character . The expropriation measures did not result in further consequences to his detriment . Contrary to the applicant \u2019s submission , nothing indicated that an arrest warrant had been issued in DATE . The applicant \u2019s father \u2019s loss of his electoral rights , his business licence and his personal assets had been a necessary consequence of the expropriation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without holding an oral hearing , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , fully endorsing ORG reasons . It added that the documents submitted proved neither the penal character of the measures in question nor that there had been an arrest warrant . An oral hearing was not necessary as the documents presented were sufficient for the case to be assessed .", "CARDINAL . NORP By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , without providing reasons , declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , in which he had alleged violations of his right to an effective remedy , his right to be heard and his personality rights ( file no .
