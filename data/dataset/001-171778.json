He affirmed that his tics were aggravated each time that he remembered , or had to discuss , the treatment to which he had been subjected in the nursery school . The experts confirmed that the aggravation of the tics was indeed related to the applicant \u2019s memories of the nursery school . The experts found that before DATE the applicant had not suffered from any psychiatric disorder . There had been a causal link between his nervous disorder and the prolonged , psychologically traumatic experience to which he had been subjected in the nursery school from DATE . DATE he still continued to suffer from nervous tics . He had therefore suffered damage of medium severity to his health . The experts further noted that the applicant did not suffer from any memory or intellectual disorder and that his intellectual development corresponded to his age ; he was therefore capable of understanding and relating the relevant events accurately . However , his ability to remember the events had decreased with time . If in DATE he had been still capable of remembering the events in question accurately , with the passage of time his memory of the events had become unrealistic and distorted . His statements \u2013 both in DATE and at that current moment DATE could not therefore be relied upon in the criminal proceedings .

They found that in the absence of any anomalies in the applicant \u2019s brain , his neurological disorder could not be organic in nature . It was highly probable that they had been caused by psychological trauma . Given that the nervous tics had appeared for the first time in DATE , there was a causal link between the ill - treatment in the nursery school to which the applicant had been subjected from DATE until DATE and his nervous tics . Finally , the experts noted that the applicant was of normal intellectual development and did not suffer from any memory or intellectual disorders .

The experts had found that , because of his young age at the material time , the applicant \u2019s description of the events was unreliable and his further participation in investigative measures was inadvisable . There were therefore doubts about the credibility of his statements .

Ms Pt . \u2019s statements of CARDINAL DATE contradicted her previous statements and statements by other witnesses . They could not therefore be considered reliable either . The expert opinions establishing a causal link between the alleged ill - treatment and the applicant \u2019s neurological disorder could not serve as evidence of ill - treatment because it was not within the experts\u2019 remit to establish whether or not ill - treatment had occurred . The expert opinions had been made on the assumption that such ill - treatment had indeed taken place . PERSON . \u2019s statements therefore constituted the only evidence of such ill - treatment . The investigator considered that those statements were insufficient to prove that ill - treatment had indeed taken place .

The police department further added that although the applicant had indeed had a bruise on his face , it was not possible to establish how he had received that bruise .
