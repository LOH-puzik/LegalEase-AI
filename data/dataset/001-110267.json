It alleges the commission of CARDINAL felonies DATE : conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists ; providing material support to terrorists ; conspiracy to kill , kidnap , maim or injure persons or damage property in a foreign country ; and money laundering . On DATE , a similar indictment was returned against the third applicant , save that the charge of money laundering was not included . For both indictments , the material support is alleged to have been provided through a series of websites , CARDINAL of whose servers was based in GPE . The charge of conspiracy to kill , kidnap , maim or injure persons or damage property in a foreign country is based on CARDINAL allegations : first , that the websites exhorted NORP to travel to GPE and GPE to defend those places ; and second , that classified ORG plans relating to a GPE naval battle group operating in LOC in LOC had been sent to the website . The plans are alleged to have discussed the battle group \u2019s vulnerability to terrorist attack .", "CARDINAL . The indictment against the fourth applicant was returned on DATE by a Federal Grand Jury sitting in LOC of GPE . It charges him with CARDINAL different counts of criminal conduct . These cover CARDINAL sets of facts .", "CARDINAL . NORP The first group of charges relates to the taking of CARDINAL hostages in GPE in DATE , CARDINAL of whom died during a rescue mission conducted by NORP forces . The indictment charges the fourth applicant with conspiracy to take hostages and hostage taking and relates principally to his contact with the leader of the hostage takers , PERSON , before and during the events in question .", "CARDINAL . The second group of charges relates to the conduct of violent jihad in GPE in DATE . The indictment alleges that the fourth applicant provided material and financial assistance to his followers and arranged for them to meet ORG commanders in GPE . In this respect , CARDINAL counts of the indictment charge him with providing and concealing material support and resources to terrorists and a foreign terrorist organisation and conspiracy thereto . A further count charges him with conspiracy to supply goods and services to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The third group of charges relates to a conspiracy to establish a jihad training camp in GPE , GPE DATE . CARDINAL counts charge the fourth applicant with providing and concealing material support and resources to terrorists and providing material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organisation ( ORG ) ; a further CARDINAL counts charge him with conspiracy to the main CARDINAL counts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a superseding indictment was returned which named and indicted the second applicant as the fourth applicant \u2019s alleged co - conspirator in respect of the Bly , GPE charges ( thus charging the second applicant with the same CARDINAL counts as those faced by the fourth applicant in respect of the Bly , GPE conspiracy ) . On DATE a second superseding indictment was returned , which indicted a third man , PERSON , as a co - conspirator in respect of the Bly , GPE charges .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was extradited to GPE from GPE in DATE . On DATE , Mr ORG was convicted on CARDINAL counts relating to the Bly , GPE jihad camp conspiracy . He was also convicted of a further CARDINAL counts relating to the operation of terrorist websites . On DATE , after submissions from Mr Kassir and his defence counsel , the trial judge sentenced Mr GPE to the maximum permissible sentence on each count . As a life sentence was the maximum permissible sentence on CARDINAL of the counts , Mr Kassir had effectively been sentenced to a term of life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL .

NORP On DATE , ORG in GPE issued Diplomatic Note No . CARDINAL .

Similar Diplomatic Notes were provided in respect of the other applicants in the course of their respective extradition proceedings .", "CARDINAL . At the extradition hearing before the Senior District Judge , the first applicant argued , inter alia , that , notwithstanding the Diplomatic Note , the risk of the death penalty being imposed remained since he could be tried on a superseding indictment . He further argued that he remained at risk of being designated as an \u201c enemy combatant \u201d pursuant to ORG and that he remained at risk of extraordinary rendition to a third country . He also argued that there was a substantial risk that he would be subjected to special administrative measures whilst in detention in a federal prison , which could involve , among other measures , solitary confinement in violation of LAW and restrictions on communication with lawyers in violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a decision given on CARDINAL DATE , the Senior District Judge ruled that the extradition could proceed and that , inter alia , the first applicant \u2019s extradition would not be incompatible with his rights under the LAW . The Senior District Judge found that , on the basis of ORG , there was no risk that the death penalty would be imposed , that the applicant would be designated as an enemy combatant , or subjected to extraordinary rendition . The LOC found the application of special administrative measures to be the greatest ground for concern but concluded that , having regard to the safeguards accompanying such measures , there would be no breach of the applicant \u2019s Convention rights .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Senior District Judge concluded as follows :", "\u201c This is a difficult and troubling case . The [ first applicant ] is a NORP subject who is alleged to have committed offences which , if the evidence were available , could have been prosecuted in this country . Nevertheless the Government of GPE are entitled to seek his extradition under the terms of LAW and I am satisfied that none of the statutory bars [ to extradition ] apply . \u201d", "Accordingly , he sent the case to the Secretary of ORG for his decision as to whether the first applicant should be extradited .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG ( Mr PERSON ) ordered the first applicant \u2019s extradition . The first applicant appealed to ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant was arrested in GPE , also on the basis of an arrest warrant issued under LAW of LAW DATE , following a request for his provisional arrest by GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Senior District Judge gave his decision in the second applicant \u2019s case on DATE . He concluded that none of the bars to extradition applied , and sent the case to the Secretary of ORG for his decision as to whether the second applicant should be extradited .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG ordered his extradition . The second applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants\u2019 appeals were heard together . In its judgment of DATE , ORG rejected their appeals . ORG found that , according to the case - law of this ORG , solitary confinement did not in itself constitute inhuman or degrading treatment . Applying that approach , the evidence before it \u2013 which included an affidavit from a ORG official outlining the operation of special administrative measures \u2013 did not \u201c begin to establish a concrete case under LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants applied for permission to appeal to ORG . This was refused by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . GPE formally requested the extradition of the third applicant on DATE . The extradition hearing started on DATE on which date the Senior District Judge determined that the third applicant was accused of offences for which he could be extradited . The case was then adjourned for evidence and argument , inter alia as to whether the third applicant \u2019s extradition would be compatible with his LAW rights . The hearing resumed on DATE . By now bound by ORG judgment in respect of the first and second applicants , the Senior NORP found that the third applicant \u2019s extradition would be compatible with the LAW . He accordingly sent the case to the Secretary of ORG for his decision as to whether the third applicant should be extradited .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG ( PERSON ) ordered that the extradition could proceed . The third applicant appealed against this decision to ORG and also sought judicial review of the alleged failure of ORG and GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to consider whether he should instead be tried in GPE . He relied on guidance agreed between the Attorney General of GPE and his GPE counterparts for handling criminal cases with concurrent jurisdiction between GPE and GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the third applicant \u2019s human rights appeal , relying on its ruling in respect of the first and second applicants . In the same judgment , it also dismissed his application for judicial review , finding that the guidance had no application to the third applicant \u2019s case . The guidance only applied to cases where there had been an investigation of the case in GPE and the ORG had been seized of the case as prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to certify a point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by ORG and also refused leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . GPE requested the fourth applicant \u2019s extradition on CARDINAL DATE . He was arrested in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The extradition proceedings were adjourned when he was convicted of offences in GPE and sentenced to DATE imprisonment ( see PERSON ( PERSON ) v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . The extradition proceedings resumed when the criminal appeals process was concluded .", "CARDINAL . When the case came before the Senior District Judge for his decision as to whether the extradition could proceed , the fourth applicant argued , inter alia , that his extradition would give rise to a real risk of a violation of LAW since he would be likely to be detained in a \u201c supermax \u201d detention facility such as ORG , ORG , GPE , GPE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . In this connection , he also relied on his poor health , specifically his type - CARDINAL diabetes , his high blood pressure , the loss of sight in his right eye and poor vision in his left , the amputation of both his forearms ( which frequently led to infections through abrasions ) , psoriasis on much of his body , hyperhydrosis ( excessive sweating ) . A violation of Article CARDINAL , he claimed , would also result from the imposition of special administrative measures .", "CARDINAL . The Senior District Judge , in his ruling of CARDINAL DATE , rejected all these submissions . In respect of detention at ORG the Senior District Judge found that the fourth applicant \u2019s poor health and disabilities would be considered and , at worst , he would only be detained there for a relatively short period of time . The Senior District Judge was also not satisfied that special administrative measures would be applied to the fourth applicant but even if they were , he was bound by the ruling of ORG in respect of the first and second applicants . Having concluded that none of the bars to extradition applied , the Senior District Judge sent the case to the Secretary of ORG ( PERSON ) for her decision as to whether the fourth applicant should be extradited . She ordered his extradition on DATE . The fourth applicant appealed to the High ORG against the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision and against the decision of the Senior District Judge .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , the fourth applicant again relied on his submission that conditions of detention at ORG would not comply with LAW . He also argued that the length of the possible sentence he faced in GPE would be contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The High Court gave its judgment on DATE , dismissing the fourth applicant \u2019s appeal . In relation to LAW , ORG found that , if convicted , the fourth applicant would be sentenced to very lengthy terms of imprisonment and that , in all likelihood , a life sentence would be imposed . It found that this , of itself , would not constitute a breach of LAW . On the question of the compatibility of detention at ORG with LAW , ORG relied in particular on the understanding of the prison warden , Mr PERSON , to the effect that if , after a full medical evaluation , it was determined that the fourth applicant could not manage his activities of DATE living , it would be highly unlikely that he would be placed at ORG rather than at a medical centre . Accordingly , there was no risk of a violation of LAW on this ground . However , ORG added :", "\u201c [ T]he constitution of GPE guarantees not only \u2018 due PERSON , but it also prohibits \u2018 cruel and unusual punishment\u2019 . As part of the judicial process prisoners , including those incarcerated in ORG prisons , are entitled to challenge the conditions in which they are confined , and these challenges have , on occasions , met with success .", "...", "We should add that , subject to detailed argument which may be advanced in another case , like Judge PERSON [ the Senior District Judge ] , we too are troubled about what we have read about the conditions in some of the ORG prisons in GPE . Naturally , the most dangerous criminals should expect to be incarcerated in the most secure conditions , but even allowing for a necessarily wide margin of appreciation between the views of different civilised countries about the conditions in which prisoners should be detained , confinement for DATE in what effectively amounts to isolation may well be held to be , if not torture , then ill treatment which contravenes LAW . This problem may fall to be addressed in a different case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant then applied to ORG for a certificate of points of law of general public importance and for leave to appeal to ORG . On DATE , ORG refused both applications .", "CARDINAL . ORG requested the fifth and sixth applicants\u2019 extradition from GPE in DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . At his committal hearing before ORG , the sixth applicant contended that extradition was only permitted within the terms of the DATE GPE - UK LAW for offences committed within the jurisdiction of the requesting ORG , and not when that ORG exercised jurisdiction over extra - territorial offences . He further argued that there was \u201c insufficient evidence \u201d to prove a prima facie case , which was a requirement for extradition under LAW . As part of that submission , he sought to have excluded CARDINAL anonymous witness statements , which had been provided by CARDINAL informants , \u201c CS/CARDINAL \u201d and \u201c CS/CARDINAL \u201d , and which ORG relied upon as part of their case against him . It was later revealed that CS/CARDINAL was a Mr PERSON who had given evidence against the certain of the ORG co - defendants during their trial in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In his ruling of CARDINAL DATE , the District Judge rejected these submissions . He considered that the proper construction of the Treaty did not prevent the exercise of jurisdiction over extra - territorial offences . The District Judge was also satisfied that there were real grounds for fear if the identities of CS/CARDINAL and CS/CARDINAL were revealed . Thus , their anonymous witness statements could be admitted as evidence of a prima facie case . He further found that there was a case for the sixth applicant to answer .", "CARDINAL . The sixth applicant appealed to ORG by way of an application for a writ of habeas corpus . The application was dismissed on DATE . ORG held that it was necessary to show that the crime in respect of which extradition was sought was alleged to have been committed within the actual territory of GPE . The High ORG was , however , satisfied that CARDINAL overt acts alleged by GPE could be relied on to found territorial jurisdiction in GPE , namely ( a ) the setting up and operating of a secure telephone line in GPE by the sixth applicant through an organisation called ORG ; ( b ) the purchase by the sixth applicant of a satellite phone system in GPE and ( c ) the issuing , in pursuance of the conspiracy of fatwas and jihads , allegedly prepared with the concurrence of the sixth applicant in GPE and elsewhere . ORG also found that GPE had not erred in admitting the evidence of CS/CARDINAL or in finding that there was a prima facie case against the sixth applicant . It did not consider it necessary reach any conclusions in respect of CS/CARDINAL , judging CS/CARDINAL \u2019s evidence to be \u201c far the most significant \u201d .", "CARDINAL . While the sixth applicant \u2019s appeal was pending before ORG , a committal hearing before ORG was held in respect of the fifth applicant . The District Judge gave his ruling on DATE in which he reaffirmed the rulings he had made in respect of the sixth applicant and found that there was also a prima facie case against the fifth applicant .", "CARDINAL . The fifth applicant also appealed to ORG and , on DATE , a differently constituted court dismissed his appeal . Again the High ORG found that the District Judge had not erred in admitting the anonymous evidence of CS/CARDINAL ; that there was sufficient evidence against the fifth applicant for the extradition to proceed , and that GPE had jurisdiction to try him .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants appealed to ORG . Their appeals were dismissed on DATE . ORG found unanimously that ORG had erred in its finding in respect of jurisdiction : it was sufficient that the offence for which extradition was sought was triable within GPE and an equivalent offence would be triable in GPE . Accordingly , the applicants were liable to extradition to GPE if a prima facie case of conspiracy to murder was established . This was the case for each applicant .", "CARDINAL . DATE there then followed voluminous representations by the fifth and sixth applicants to the Secretary of ORG as to why they should not be extradited to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the course of these exchanges , on DATE the President of GPE designated the sixth applicant as a \u201c specially designated global terrorist \u201d , which had the effect of placing him on a list of persons maintained by ORG of the ORG and available on its website . This was done pursuant to Executive Order DATE which enables the NORP assets of any person so designated to be blocked .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , ORG in GPE issued Diplomatic Note No . CARDINAL , which gave assurances that ORG would neither seek nor carry out the death penalty against DATE applicants . It also gave assurances that they would be tried before a federal court and that they would not be prosecuted by a military commission or designated as enemy combatants . On DATE , ORG Diplomatic Note No . CARDINAL , which assured ORG that , if either applicant were acquitted or completed any sentence imposed or if the prosecution against them were discontinued , GPE authorities would return the men to GPE , if they so requested .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG ( PERSON ) rejected the fifth and sixth applicants\u2019 representations on DATE . She found that assurances given by GPE in the Diplomatic Note of DATE could be relied upon and thus that the fifth and sixth applicants were not at risk of the death penalty , indefinite detention or trial by a military commission .", "CARDINAL . The fifth and sixth applicants also contended that they would not receive a fair trial in GPE owing to the unavailability of defence witnesses and evidence , adverse publicity , the possible imposition of special administrative measures before trial , and the sixth applicant \u2019s designation as a global terrorist . The Secretary of ORG found none of these claims amounted to a \u201c flagrant denial of justice \u201d such as would act as a bar to extradition .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG accepted that there was a real possibility that they would be sentenced to life imprisonment if convicted but , relying on the ORG of Lords\u2019 judgment in R ( GPE ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) , found that this would not amount to a breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG also considered that the conditions of the fifth and sixth applicants\u2019 detention in GPE would not violate LAW whether they were subjected to \u201c special administrative measures \u201d before trial or detained at ORG after trial . In the fifth applicant \u2019s case , this conclusion was not affected by the fact that he suffered from a recurrent depressive disorder . There was also no risk that either applicant would be tortured , that evidence obtained by torture would be adduced at trial , or that they would be at real risk of torture as a result of extraordinary rendition or refoulement to a third ORG .", "CARDINAL . The fifth and sixth applicants sought judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision in ORG . Before ORG the applicants submitted that , if convicted , they would be detained at ORG in violation of LAW . In rejecting that contention , Lord Justice PERSON , delivering the judgment of the court on DATE , found that the decisions of GPE federal courts in PERSON , PERSON and PERSON v. PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) demonstrated that there was effective judicial oversight of \u201c supermax \u201d prisons such as ORG . The fifth and sixth applicants would also have the possibility of entering ORG \u2019s \u201c step down program \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) . He concluded :", "( CARDINAL ) It is reasonably likely that the claimants will be subjected to [ special administrative measures ] and will be held in ORG following trial .", "( CARDINAL ) Neither [ special administrative measures ] ( see PERSON and PERSON ) or life without parole ( see GPE ) cross the article CARDINAL threshold in the present case . Although near to the borderline the prison conditions at ORG , although very harsh do not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment either on their own or in combination with [ special administrative measures ] and in the context of a whole life sentence .", "( CARDINAL ) Whether the high article CARDINAL threshold for inhuman or degrading treatment is crossed depends on the facts of the particular case . There is no common standard for what does or does not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment throughout the many different countries in the world . The importance of maintaining extradition in a case where the fugitive would not otherwise be tried is an important factor in identifying the threshold in the present case .", "Had the claimants persuaded me that there was no prospect that they would ever enter the step down procedure whatever the circumstances then in my view the article CARDINAL threshold would be crossed . But that is not the case . The evidence satisfies me that the authorities will faithfully apply the criteria [ for entry to the program ] and that the stringency of the conditions it imposes will continue to be linked to the risk the prisoner presents . Further , there is access to the GPE courts in the event that the [ ORG ] acts unlawfully . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the fifth applicant \u2019s submission that his recurrent depressive illness would deteriorate if extradited , ORG considered that , to the extent that this affected his fitness to stand trial , this was a matter for the GPE authorities and , if he were convicted , the fifth applicant \u2019s mental health would be an important factor in deciding whether he should be sent to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG also rejected the fifth and sixth applicants\u2019 submissions that they were at real risk of violations of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the LAW by virtue of the imposition of special administrative measures , relying on its previous judgment in respect of the first and second applicants ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Having regard to the Diplomatic Note of DATE , ORG found that there was no real risk of refoulement to GPE or GPE by GPE . ORG was also satisfied that GPE would honour the assurances it had given in the Diplomatic Note of DATE . The mere fact that the sixth applicant had been designated as a global terrorist by the President of GPE did not mean he was at risk of a flagrant denial of justice within the meaning of LAW the designation added little to what was already known about him ; it would be made clear to the jury at any trial what had to be proved as regards the indictment .", "CARDINAL . ORG also rejected the ORG submission that they should be tried in GPE , finding that this was neither viable nor appropriate and that any connection with GPE was \u201c tenuous indeed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Although ORG refused leave to appeal to ORG , it certified CARDINAL questions of general public importance . The first question was whether prison conditions at ORG were compatible with LAW ; the second question was whether the relativist approach to LAW adopted by the majority of ORG in GPE should apply where the issue under LAW the compatibility of prison conditions with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused permission to appeal .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the applicable bilateral treaty on extradition was the DATE GPE \u2013 USA Extradition Treaty ( now superseded by a DATE treaty ) . LAW DATE treaty provided that extradition could be refused unless the requesting ORG gave assurances satisfactory to the requested ORG that the death penalty would not be carried out .", "CARDINAL . Guidance for handling criminal cases with concurrent jurisdiction between GPE and GPE was signed on DATE by the Attorney General of GPE , Her Majesty \u2019s Attorney General and also , for its application to GPE , by the Lord Advocate . It sets out a series of measures that prosecutors in each ORG should take to exchange information and consult each other in such cases and to determine issues which arise from concurrent jurisdiction . A case with concurrent jurisdiction is defined as one which has the potential to be prosecuted in both GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . GPE requested the extradition of GPE from GPE to stand trial in GPE on CARDINAL counts of murder in the first degree . In his appeal against extradition , Mr GPE argued that his surrender would violate LAW , on the basis that there was a real risk that he would be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment in the form of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole .", "CARDINAL . In giving judgment in ORG ( [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) ) , Lord Justice Laws found that there were \u201c powerful arguments of penal philosophy \u201d which suggested that risk of a whole - life sentence without parole intrinsically violated LAW . He observed :", "\u201c The abolition of the death penalty has been lauded , and justified , in many ways ; but it must have been founded at least on the premise that the life of every person , however depraved , has an inalienable value . The destruction of a life may be accepted in some special circumstances , such as self - defence or just war ; but retributive punishment is never enough to justify it . Yet a prisoner \u2019s incarceration without hope of release is in many respects in like case to a sentence of death . He can never atone for his offence . However he may use his incarceration as time for amendment of life , his punishment is only exhausted by his last breath . Like the death sentence the whole - life tariff is lex talionis . But its notional or actual symmetry with the crime for which it is visited on the prisoner ( the only virtue of the lex talionis ) is a poor guarantee of proportionate punishment , for the whole - life tariff is arbitrary : it may be measured in DATE or DATE according to how long the prisoner has to live . It is therefore liable to be disproportionate \u2013 the very vice which is condemned on LAW grounds \u2013 unless , of course , the death penalty \u2019s logic applies : the crime is so heinous it can never be atoned for . But in that case the supposed inalienable value of the prisoner \u2019s life is reduced , merely , to his survival : to nothing more than his drawing breath and being kept , no doubt , confined in decent circumstances . That is to pay lip - service to the value of life ; not to vouchsafe it . \u201d", "However , and \u201c not without misgivings \u201d , he considered that the relevant authorities , including those of this ORG , suggested an irreducible life sentence would not always raise an Article CARDINAL issue .", "CARDINAL . GPE \u2019s appeal from that judgment was heard by ORG and dismissed on DATE . Central to the appeal was paragraph CARDINAL of this ORG \u2019s judgment in GPE v. GPE , DATE , LAW , Series A no . CARDINAL , where the ORG stated that considerations in favour of extradition :", "\u201c .. must also be included among the factors to be taken into account in the interpretation and application of the notions of inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment in extradition cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A majority of their Lordships , Lord PERSON , ORG and Lord PERSON , found that , on the basis of this paragraph , in the extradition context , a distinction had to be drawn between torture and lesser forms of ill - treatment . When there was a real risk of torture , the prohibition on extradition was absolute and left no room for a balancing exercise . However , insofar as LAW applied to inhuman and degrading treatment and not to torture , it was applicable only in a relativist form to extradition cases .", "DATE . Lord PERSON , giving the lead speech , considered the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , in which the ORG stated that :", "\u201c It should not be inferred from the ORG \u2019s remarks [ at paragraph CARDINAL of GPE ] that there is any room for balancing the risk of ill - treatment against the reasons for expulsion in determining whether a ORG \u2019s responsibility under LAW ) is engaged . \u201d", "Lord PERSON stated :", "\u201c In the context of PERSON , I read this remark as affirming that there can be no room for a balancing of risk against reasons for expulsion when it comes to subjecting someone to the risk of torture . I do not however think that the ORG was intending to depart from the relativist approach to what counted as inhuman and degrading treatment which was laid down in GPE and which is paralleled in the cases on other articles of the LAW in a foreign context . If such a radical departure from precedent had been intended , I am sure that the ORG would have said so . \u201d", "For Lord PERSON , paragraph CARDINAL of PERSON made clear that :", "\u201c ... the desirability of extradition is a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the punishment likely to be imposed in the receiving state attains the \u2018 minimum level of severity\u2019 which would make it inhuman and degrading . Punishment which counts as inhuman and degrading in the domestic context will not necessarily be so regarded when the extradition factor has been taken into account . \u201d", "He went on to state :", "\u201c A relativist approach to the scope of article CARDINAL seems to me essential if extradition is to continue to function . For example , ORG has decided in PERSON v Scottish Ministers ( DATE ) GPE CARDINAL that in GPE the practice of \u2018 slopping out\u2019 ( requiring a prisoner to use a chamber pot in his cell and empty it in TIME ) may cause an infringement of article CARDINAL . Whether , even in a domestic context , this attains the necessary level of severity is a point on which I would wish to reserve my opinion . If , however , it were applied in the context of extradition , it would prevent anyone being extradited to many countries , poorer than GPE , where people who are not in prison often have to make do without flush lavatories . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A minority of their Lordships , Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON , disagreed with these conclusions . They considered that the extradition context was irrelevant to the determination of whether a whole life sentence amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment . They found no basis in the text of LAW for such a distinction . Lord PERSON also considered that the ORG , in PERSON and again in PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . DATE , ECHR DATE ... , had departed from the previous , relativist approach to inhuman and degrading treatment that it had taken in GPE . He stated :", "\u201c There is , I conclude , no room in the GPE jurisprudence for a concept such as the risk of a flagrant violation of article CARDINAL \u2019s absolute prohibition against inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( akin to that of the risk of a \u2018 flagrant denial of justice\u2019 ) . By the same token that no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk of torture , so too no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk of treatment or punishment which is properly to be characterised as inhuman or degrading . That , of course , is not to say that , assuming for example \u2018 slopping out\u2019 is degrading treatment in GPE , so too it must necessarily be regarded in all countries ( see para CARDINAL of Lord PERSON \u2019s opinion ) ...

As a result , since adopting the PERSON judgment it has only rarely reached such a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d", "Therefore , for Lord PERSON , if a mandatory life sentence violated LAW in a domestic case , the risk of such a sentence would preclude extradition to another country .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , despite these different views , none of ORG found that the sentence likely to be imposed on Mr GPE would be irreducible ; having regard to the commutation powers of the Governor of GPE , it would be just as reducible as the sentence at issue in GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ECHR DATE .... All five Law Lords also noted that , in GPE , the ORG had only said that the imposition of an irreducible life sentence may raise an issue under LAW . They found that the imposition of a whole life sentence would not constitute inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of LAW , unless it were grossly or clearly disproportionate . Lord PERSON in particular noted :", "\u201c Having puzzled long over this question , I have finally concluded that the majority of ORG [ in GPE ] would not regard even an irreducible life sentence \u2014 by which , as explained , I understand the majority to mean a mandatory life sentence to be served in full without there ever being proper consideration of the individual circumstances of the defendant \u2019s case \u2014 as violating article CARDINAL unless and until the time comes when further imprisonment would no longer be justified on any ground \u2014 whether for reasons of punishment , deterrence or public protection . It is for that reason that the majority say only that article CARDINAL may be engaged . \u201d", "Lord PERSON added that this test had not been met in GPE \u2019s case , particularly when the facts of the murders for which he was accused , if committed in GPE , could have justified a whole life order . However , Lord PERSON considered that , in a more compelling case , such as the mercy killing of a terminally ill relative , this ORG \u201c might well judge the risk of ill - treatment to be sufficiently real , clear and imminent to conclude that extradition must indeed be barred on article CARDINAL grounds \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Finally , Lord PERSON , Lord PERSON , ORG and Lord PERSON all doubted Lord Justice Laws\u2019 view that life imprisonment without parole was lex talionis . Lord PERSON , ORG and Lord PERSON did not accept his premise that the abolition of the death penalty had been founded on the idea that the life of every person had an inalienable value ; there were other , more pragmatic reasons for abolition such as its irreversibility and lack of deterrent effect . Lord PERSON rejected the view that an irreducible life sentence was inhuman and degrading because it denied a prisoner the possibility of atonement ; once it was accepted that a whole life sentence could be a just punishment , atonement was achieved by the prisoner serving his sentence .", "CARDINAL .

He considered that a supermax prison regime did not amount to sensory deprivation but there was an almost total lack of meaningful human communication . This tended to induce a range of psychological symptoms ranging from panic to psychosis and emotional breakdown . All studies into the effects of supermax detention had found such symptoms after CARDINAL days\u2019 detention . Once such symptoms presented , it was not sufficient to return someone to normal prison conditions in order to remedy them . If supermax detention were imposed for an indeterminate period it also led to chronic despair . CARDINAL of suicides in GPE prisons involved the PERCENT of prisoners held in such conditions .

Professor PERSON recalled that one of the former wardens of ORG had publicly described the prison as \u201c a clean version of hell \u201d . Professor PERSON stated that , despite the evidence set out in the QUANTITY declarations , conditions at ORG had not changed significantly in DATE . Solitary confinement for long periods continued . CARDINAL lawyer , Mr PERSON , had conducted a survey which had found that CARDINAL inmates of ORG had spent DATE or more in \u201c lock - down \u201d conditions there and at previous prisons .", "Contact with staff could be QUANTITY per day . Some prisoners were placed on \u201c single recreation status \u201d , meaning no one else was permitted to be in adjoining recreation cells at the same time . Recreation privileges could be terminated for minor infractions : CARDINAL prisoner was denied outdoor exercise for DATE for trying to feed crumbs to birds . When he challenged this sanction through the grievance process , it was increased to DATE . Upon further appeal he was told that the decision was not punitive but a managerial strategy to impress upon him the importance of adhering to institutional procedures . Indoor recreations were little more than cages with a single pull - up bar for exercise . There was nothing to do in outdoor recreation cages save to pace up and down . There was limited visibility \u2013 all that could be seen was the sky through chain linking . Recreation was frequently cancelled owing to staff shortages .", "The evidence also showed that , despite the consensus in the medical profession that prisoners with mental illnesses should not be held in solitary confinement , ORG continued to house seriously mentally ill prisoners , including those with severe schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . Several inmates were too sick to communicate properly with their representatives ; a report had been received of CARDINAL prisoner who was too ill to write , but was living a cell that he had covered in QUANTITY of rubbish and faeces . Several prisoners had stated in witness statements prepared for litigation in GPE courts , that there were mentally ill prisoners at ORG who , because of their conditions , screamed TIME , making sleep difficult for others . General medical facilities were also inadequate : there were CARDINAL doctors for CARDINAL inmates at ORG , and only basic healthcare needs were met . There were also reports from ORG which indicated that force feeding of hunger strikers took place in an unnecessarily punitive and painful way .", "Religious services were extremely limited CARDINAL NORP inmate had only seen an imam CARDINAL times \u2013 and CARDINAL inmate in a general population unit had received an incident report for intoning the ORG . Books and educational activities were also limited .", "For inmates , particularly those subjected to special administrative measures , telephone calls , and social visits were highly restricted and subject to monitoring . Contact with other inmates was generally prohibited and , when they were not , communication between cells could only be carried out by yelling , which was prohibited . Visits were limited to CARDINAL adult visitor at a time , with no physical contact , and required CARDINAL days\u2019 written notice . Evidence in cases brought by inmates who had been subjected to special administrative measures indicated that letters could be limited to CARDINAL sheets of paper per week and certain family members could be refused clearance to write to or speak with an inmate . Special administrative measures could also mean that an inmate was prohibited from watching news channels on television , from receiving recent newspapers or any NORP publications whatsoever ; CARDINAL inmate received his newspaper with whole sections removed . International telephone calls were expensive and liable to disruption .", "Despite the adoption of objective criteria for placement at ORG , it remained the case that all those subjected to special administrative measures or convicted of terrorism offences were liable for placement , regardless of their security risk or their disciplinary record in other institutions . The placement hearing was window dressing : CARDINAL hearing officer had carried out CARDINAL hearings and never found an inmate to be unsuitable for placement . There was evidence of hearings taking place post facto , in some cases many years after the transfer to ORG had been carried out . Inmates also received CARDINAL hours\u2019 notice of a hearing and did not have the right to legal representation . There was evidence that hearing officers did not read all of the evidence submitted and based their decisions on unreliable evidence . Inmates did not see all the evidence against them . Professor PERSON also provided declarations by NORP clients , in which they stated that they had never been told the reasons for their placement at ORG and had been sent there after DATE , despite DATE of good conduct in other , much less restrictive prisons , both in GPE and elsewhere .", "Although there had been an increase in the number of admissions to the step down program , the fact remained that many inmates were spending significant periods of time in solitary confinement prior to admission , despite having met the criteria for admission for DATE . CARDINAL clients of the ORG had only been admitted to the program after periods of DATE in solitary confinement and only then after commencing litigation against ORG . Another CARDINAL clients had never been admitted , despite their clean disciplinary records and despite periods of DATE at ORG . Even after the changes to procedures governing entry to the program , an inmate \u2019s original crime continued to serve as the basis for placement at ORG ; thus it was possible for an inmate to be unable to sufficiently mitigate the original reason for placement and so gain admission to the program . Moreover , if an inmate had never been told the reasons for his placement , he could not know what he had to do to gain admission to the program . The program required DATE to complete and a prisoner needed DATE of clear conduct in general population before being eligible for step down . Even eligibility for the program did not mean that a prisoner would be allowed into it .", "Conditions in the first phase of the step down program did not differ significantly from general population units . According to CARDINAL inmate , Mr Rezaq , lockdowns occurred frequently in ORG , which meant inmates were confined to their cells , and could DATE or even DATE . Inmates could also be removed from the program at any time without explanation or due process , even for the most minor infractions . Some had been removed from the program without receiving an incident report or were removed after receiving a report for an incident for which they were soon found not guilty . Yet , following such removals , they were either denied re - admission to the program or forced to spend DATE going through it again . The ORG itself had estimated that PERCENT of inmates progressed though the program in DATE . Even successful completion of the step down program might only result in a transfer to a \u201c communications management unit \u201d , such as those housed at ORG or ORG , where conditions remained restrictive .", "According to Professor PERSON , it was difficult to dispute the evidence provided by the Government on special administrative measures ( owing to restrictions contained in the measures themselves ) but , on the basis of public information , she was able to state that the effect of the measures could amount to solitary confinement , even if an inmate was not detained at ORG . The indefinite prolongation of special administrative measures meant that certain NORP inmates had spent CARDINAL in solitary confinement both before and after trial . Challenging such measures was impossible for inmates without access to legal representation . Legal aid was not available and , even if pro bono legal representation was obtained , ORG could still refuse to give the lawyers the necessary clearance ; this had happened to her ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also relied on CARDINAL letters from ORG . The first , dated DATE to the Director of ORG , followed a tour the organisation had been given of ORG . The letter expressed concerns that a number of prisoners convicted of terrorism offences had been sent to the prison based on the nature of their crimes and , despite good conduct since their arrival , had remained in general population units and thus outside the step - down programme for DATE . The letter made suggestions for improvement in respect of recreation , mail , telephone use , the library . It also noted that progress was to be made on better meeting ORG religious needs , such as the provision of a full - time imam and commended the educational programmes available through the prison \u2019s television system .

Compassionate release for the terminally ill or disabled was not automatic and was assessed with reference to additional factors such as the nature of the crime committed and the length of time served . Reduction for substantial assistance to the authorities depended on the initiative of the Government , not the court . Subsequent lowering of the relevant sentencing guidelines could only reduce a sentence if ORG made the change retroactive and might not reduce the overall sentence if the person concerned was convicted of other offences and given consecutive sentences . For presidential commutation , the FALN pardons had only been for those who had been convicted of non - violent crimes and had been offered on the condition that the individuals concerned renounce violence .

In PERSON , cited above , the court held that LAW also prohibited the imposition of life imprisonment without parole on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide . The court found that life imprisonment without parole was an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile and that the remote possibility of pardon or other executive clemency did not mitigate the harshness of the sentence . Although a ORG was not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a non - homicide crime , it had to provide some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation . The court also held that a sentence lacking in legitimate penological justification ( such as retribution , deterrence , incapacitation and rehabilitation ) was , by its nature , disproportionate . Such purposes could justify life without parole in other contexts , but not life without parole for juvenile non - homicide offenders .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under the present statutory framework in GPE and GPE , LAW of LAW DATE , a trial judge can impose a whole life term or order on a defendant convicted of murder . Such a defendant is not eligible for parole and can only be released by the Secretary of ORG . In R v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ORG considered that such whole life terms were compatible with LAW .", "It found that a whole life order did not contravene LAW possibility of compassionate release by the Secretary of ORG . It also found that the imposition of an irreducible life sentence would not itself constitute a violation of LAW but rather that a potential violation would only occur once the offender had been detained beyond the period that could be justified on the ground of punishment and deterrence . The court stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . While under LANGUAGE law the offence of murder attracts a mandatory life sentence , this is not normally an irreducible sentence . The judge specifies the minimum term to be served by way of punishment and deterrence before the offender \u2019s release on licence can be considered . Where a whole life term is specified this is because the judge considers that the offence is so serious that , for purposes of punishment and deterrence , the offender must remain in prison for the rest of DATE . For the reasons that we have given , we do not consider that the GPE court has ruled that an irreducible life sentence , deliberately imposed by a judge in such circumstances , will result in detention that violates article CARDINAL . Nor do we consider that it will do so .", "CARDINAL . It may be that the approach of the GPE court will change . There seems to be a tide in LOC that is setting against the imposition of very lengthy terms of imprisonment that are irreducible . Thus it may become necessary to consider whether whole life terms imposed in this jurisdiction are , in fact irreducible .", "...", "Under the regime that predated LAW it was the practice of the Secretary of ORG to review the position of prisoners serving a whole life tariff after they had served DATE with a view to reducing the tariff in exceptional circumstances , such as where the prisoner had made exceptional progress whilst in custody . No suggestion was then made that the imposition of a whole life tariff infringed article CARDINAL .", "...", "Under the current regime the Secretary of ORG has a limited power to release a life prisoner under LAW DATE .", "...", "At present it is the practice of the Secretary of ORG to use this power sparingly , in circumstances where , for instance , a prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness or is bedridden or similarly incapacitated . If , however , the position is reached where the continued imprisonment of a prisoner is held to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment , we can see no reason why , having particular regard to the requirement to comply with the LAW , the Secretary of ORG should not use his statutory power to release the prisoner .", "CARDINAL . For these reasons , applying the approach of the GPE court in GPE v GPE DATE , we do not consider that a whole life term should be considered as a sentence that is irreducible . Any article QUANTITY challenge where a whole life term has been imposed should therefore be made , not at the time of the imposition of the sentence , but at the stage when the prisoner contends that , having regard to all the material circumstances , including the time that he has served and the progress made in prison , any further detention will constitute degrading or inhuman treatment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides that human dignity shall be inviolable . Article CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c Every person shall have the right to life and physical integrity . Freedom of the person shall be inviolable . These rights may be interfered with only pursuant to a law . \u201d", "The compatibility of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for murder with these provisions was considered by ORG in the Life Imprisonment case of DATE , CARDINAL BVerfGE CARDINAL ( an NORP translation of extracts of the judgment , with commentary , can be found in PERSON , LAW ( CARDINALnd ed . ) , ORG , GPE and GPE , DATE at pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "The court found that the ORG could not turn the offender into an object of crime prevention to the detriment of his constitutionally protected right to social worth . Respect for human dignity and the rule of law meant the humane enforcement of life imprisonment was possible only when the prisoner was given \u201c a concrete and realistically attainable chance \u201d to regain his freedom at some later point in time .", "The court underlined that prisons also had a duty to strive towards the re - socialisation of prisoners , to preserve their ability to cope with life and to counteract the negative effects of incarceration and the destructive changes in personality that accompanied imprisonment . It recognised , however , that , for a criminal who remained a threat to society , the goal of rehabilitation might never be fulfilled ; in that case , it was the particular personal circumstances of the criminal which might rule out successful rehabilitation rather than the sentence of life imprisonment itself . The court also found that , subject to these conclusions , life imprisonment for murder was not a senseless or disproportionate punishment .", "CARDINAL . In the later War Criminal case CARDINAL BVerfGE CARDINAL ( DATE ) , where the petitioner was DATE of age and had served DATE of a life sentence imposed for sending CARDINAL people to the gas chambers , the court considered that the gravity of a person \u2019s crime could weigh upon whether he or she could be required to serve his or her life sentence . However , a judicial balancing of these factors should not place too heavy an emphasis on the gravity of the crime as opposed to the personality , state of mind , and age of the person . In that case , any subsequent review of the petitioner \u2019s request for release would be required to weigh more heavily than before the petitioner \u2019s personality , age and prison record .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of DATE , BVerfG , DATE , ORG considered an extradition case where the offender faced \u201c aggravated life imprisonment until death \u201d ( erschwerte lebensl\u00e4ngliche GPE bis zum PERSON ) in GPE . The NORP government had sought assurances that he would be considered for release and had received the reply that the President of GPE had the power to remit sentences on grounds of chronic illness , disability , or old age . The court refused to allow extradition , finding that this power of release offered only a vague hope of release and was thus insufficient . Notwithstanding the need to respect foreign legal orders , if someone had no practical prospect of release such a sentence would be cruel and degrading ( grausam und erniedrigend ) and would infringe the requirements of human dignity provided for in LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG has found that a grossly disproportionate sentence will amount to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment ( see , inter alia , R v. PERSON ( PERSON ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL SCR CARDINAL ) . In R v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL S.C.R. CARDINAL , the court considered that , for first degree murder , a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for DATE was not grossly disproportionate . Similarly , in R v. PERSON DATE CARDINAL SCR CARDINAL , for second degree murder , a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for DATE was not grossly disproportionate . The court observed that gross disproportionality would only be found on \u201c rare and unique occasions \u201d and that the test for determining this issue was \u201c very properly stringent and demanding \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In Dodo v. the ORG ( CCT CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) [ DATE ] ZACC CARDINAL , ORG considered whether a statutory provision which required a life sentence for certain offences including murder , was compatible with the constitutional principle of the separation of powers , the accused \u2019s constitutional right to a public trial and the constitutional prohibition on cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . The court found none of these constitutionals provisions was infringed , since the statute allowed a court to pass a lesser sentence if there were substantial and compelling circumstances . The court did , however , observe that the concept of proportionality went to the heart of the inquiry as to whether punishment was cruel , inhuman or degrading .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. The ORG ( ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) [ DATE ] ZACC CARDINAL , the court found an indeterminate sentence imposed pursuant to a declaration that the defendant was a \u201c habitual criminal \u201d to be grossly disproportionate because it could amount to life imprisonment for a non - violent offender .

In PERSON v. the Queen [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ORG of ORG considered that a mandatory death penalty for murder by shooting was incompatible with section CARDINAL of LAW , which prohibits torture and ill - treatment in identical terms to LAW . Lord PERSON observed that to deny the offender the opportunity , before sentence is passed , to seek to persuade the court that in all the circumstances to condemn him to death would be disproportionate and inappropriate was to treat him as no human being should be treated . The relevant law was not saved by the powers of pardon and commutation vested by the LAW in FAC , assisted by ORG ; in Lord PERSON \u2019s words \u201c a non - judicial body can not not decide what is the appropriate measure of punishment to be visited on a defendant for the crime he has committed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. the State of GPE [ DATE ] UKPC CARDINAL the appellant had been sentenced to death . With the abolition of the death penalty in GPE , his sentence was commuted to a mandatory life sentence . ORG considered the ORG \u2019s judgment in GPE , cited above , and found that the safeguards available in GPE to prevent PERSON from being without hope of release were not available in GPE . ORG had interpreted such a sentence as condemning PERSON to penal servitude for the rest of his life and the provisions of the relevant legislation on parole and remission did not apply . This meant the sentence was manifestly disproportionate and arbitrary and so contrary to section CARDINAL of LAW ( provisions to secure protection of law , including the right to a fair trial ) . It had also been argued by the appellant that the mandatory nature of the sentence violated section QUANTITY ( the prohibition of torture , inhuman or degrading punishment or other such treatment ) . In light of its conclusion on section CARDINAL , the ORG considered it unnecessary to decide that question or to consider the relevance of the possibility of release under section CARDINAL ( the presidential prerogative of mercy ) . It did , however , find that the safeguards available in GPE ( in the form of the Attorney - General \u2019s powers to recommend release and the President \u2019s powers to commute sentences or decree release ) were not available in GPE . It also acknowledged the appellant \u2019s argument that , as with the mandatory sentence of death it had considered in PERSON , a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment did not allow for consideration of the facts of the case . ORG also considered any differences between mandatory sentences of death and life imprisonment could be exaggerated and , to this end , quoted with approval the dicta of Lord Justice Laws in GPE and Lord PERSON in PERSON ( at DATE and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In State v. PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , ORG held that a mandatory sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for murder amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of section CARDINAL on the grounds that it was disproportionate .", "CARDINAL .

Chief Justice PERSON , for the unanimous court , found the relevant statutory release scheme to be sufficient but observed that if release depended on the \u201c capricious exercise \u201d of the discretion of the prison or executive authorities , the hope of release would be \u201c too faint and much too unpredictable \u201d for the prisoner to retain the dignity required by section CARDINAL .
