SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant [ PERSON ] is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a lawyer .", "In connection with criminal proceedings for misappropriation of assets , brought against the applicant by GPE investigating judge no . CARDINAL , the applicant was awarded legal aid and a lawyer was assigned by the court to assist him .", "At the public hearing of the case the applicant \u2019s officially assigned lawyer raised an objection , as a preliminary issue , on the ground that the applicant had informed her that he no longer had confidence in her ability to represent him because she was specialised in labour law and not criminal law . She requested the judge to suspend the hearing In a judgment of DATE GPE criminal - court judge no . CARDINAL dismissed that objection on the ground that criminal law , as such , did not constitute a specialisation . He added that the applicant , who had not appointed a lawyer of his choice , had not expressed any intention to defend himself either . He also referred to the lawyer \u2019s professional experience . On the merits , the court found the applicant guilty of the offence of misappropriation , sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered him to pay damages to the victim of the offence .", "The applicant appealed against that judgment to ORG . He disputed the judge \u2019s legal classification of the offence with which he had been charged . A new lawyer \u2013 this time one matching his requirements \u2013 was appointed by that court to assist him . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , delivered after proceedings deemed to be inter partes , ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . That judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s officially assigned lawyer on DATE . According to the applicant , the officially assigned lawyer did not send him a copy of the judgment upholding his conviction . The applicant therefore personally contacted ORG asking it to serve the judgment of DATE on him directly , which was done on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with ORG . He relied on LAW ( right to a fair trial ) . In his grounds in support of his amparo appeal , the applicant \u2019s representative stated that the judgment of ORG had been served personally on his client on DATE .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG held the amparo appeal to be inadmissible on the ground that it had been lodged out of time . The court gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c As this court has stated on many occasions ( see , among others , the decisions of ORG , DATE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL ) , service of documents on the representative of a party to a trial shall produce the same effects as service on the represented party where section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( ORG ) does not require personal service for the purpose of calculating the relevant time - period . That is so irrespective of the fact that the rules of ordinary law can impose an additional requirement of serving judgments personally . Consequently , if account is taken of the fact , as can be seen from the file , that the appellate court \u2019s judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE , the amparo appeal of DATE was lodged out of time because it was lodged long after the DATE time - limit provided for by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG for lodging a constitutional appeal . \u201d", "LAW", "\u201c The time - limit for lodging an amparo appeal shall be DATE from service of the decision delivered in the judicial proceedings . \u201d", "Code of Criminal Procedure", "\u201c Final judgments shall be delivered and served on the parties and their lawyers ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
