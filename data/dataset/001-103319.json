The applicant was a security guard who was born in DATE and lived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , together with PERSON and GPE ORG who have also lodged applications with the ORG , was involved in a series of complex commercial arrangements concerning the building of CARDINAL blocks of flats in GPE by a construction company ( \u201c the company \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE and GPE created the above - mentioned company with a capital of CARDINAL NORP lei ( MDL ) . Each of the parties was the holder of PERCENT of the company 's shares . On DATE PERSON sold PERCENT of her shares to GPE and on DATE PERCENT of her shares were sold to PERSON , a NORP national . The relevant documents were registered by ORG .", "CARDINAL .

DATE , on an unspecified date , GPE appealed against the judgment of DATE . He asked ORG to strike the case out of its list on the grounds that Mr PERSON did not have the powers to bring an action on behalf on GPE ORG examined the appeal despite the fact that the appealed decision was final , since it found that the merits of the case had been examined by ORG in GPE ' absence , who had not been legally summoned to that hearing . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and rejected the request to strike the case out of its list of cases . PERSON lodged an appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the appeal on points of law . It quashed the judgment of ORG of DATE and ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered that the case be remitted to the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG joined PERSON 's action to a counter action filed by ORG and ORG , seeking the annulment of all documents which had led to his exclusion from the founding members of the company and for an acknowledgement of his sole ownership of the company 's shares .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed PERSON 's action and upheld in full the action lodged by ORG", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG ordered the opening of a criminal investigation into the alleged forgery of the power of attorney whereby the applicant had represented the above - mentioned CARDINAL individuals ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . A criminal investigation was also opened in relation to the alleged smuggling of the project documentation for the construction site , since it had not been drafted in GPE and had to be registered with the customs when introduced into GPE . The investigation revealed that the project documentation had been brought into GPE by the applicant on DATE . It further appeared that the applicant had declared the value of the project documentation as being MDL CARDINAL whereas it had been estimated at ORG MONEY ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL filed a criminal complaint with ORG about having been excluded from the founders of the company and about being illegally dispossessed of his shares .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the GPE police office opened a criminal investigation against Mr PERSON into the alleged misappropriation of ORG 's assets .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an officer of ORG ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) ordered the opening of a criminal investigation into the allegations made by GPE The CFECC only relied on GPE 's allegations that following the judgment of ORG of DATE S.F. had been excluded from the founders of the company and that PERSON had subsequently sold the company 's shares to third parties , including the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE both criminal investigations instituted against Mr PERSON were joined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal investigation started by ORG office on DATE into the acts of smuggling and forgery was joined to the criminal investigation started by the ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE all the above - mentioned criminal investigations were joined in a single criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert report commissioned by the ORG concluded that it could not firmly establish whether the power of attorney whereby the applicant had represented the above - mentioned CARDINAL individuals ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had properly been signed by the director of the company or whether the signature had been forged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigating judge of ORG granted the ORG 's application for a search warrant to search the applicant 's domicile in GPE . The search was conducted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the applicant was arrested and placed in the remand centre of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the prosecutor applied to ORG for an arrest warrant for the applicant . The application recorded that the applicant lived in PERSON . It further noted that on DATE PERSON had asked ORG urgently to enforce the judgment of DATE , i.e. as soon as it had become final and enforceable . This request had been made without notice to QUANTITY and , in the prosecutor 's view , in order to erase all evidence of an offence . Relying on \u201c investigative information \u201d ( m\u0103suri operativ - investigative ) that the applicant , together with PERSON and Mr PERSON , had executed the orders of Mr GPE against GPE , the prosecutor alleged that the applicant had committed the offence of misappropriation of another 's property . The prosecutor 's application did not refer to any other evidence in support of a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence . Nor did it refer to any reasons for his detention or that he might abscond or put pressure on witnesses .", "CARDINAL . Later on DATE , at TIME , the applicant 's lawyer lodged an application for the applicant 's release on the ground that the period of his detention had ended at TIME that day .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , however , an investigating judge of ORG ordered the applicant 's remand for DATE . The judge gave the following reasons for the applicant 's detention :", "\u201c [ the court ] takes into consideration the character and the degree of the alleged offence ... its seriousness , the necessity to protect public order , the sense of shock which may be caused to society by the applicant 's release , ... the existence of a danger of absconding from law enforcement authorities , the risk of influencing the outcome of the investigation and collusion between the accused and the creation of exculpatory evidence , which result from the nature of the offence ... and the personality of the accused and his conduct during the criminal proceedings .", "... the court dismisses the argument that the applicant had to be released after TIME ... because the delay in the opening of the hearing was due to the examination of other remand warrants and the delay in examining the prosecutor 's request was due to the courts ' efforts to observe the procedural rights of the defence party .", "... at this stage , the court considers that the relevance of the prosecution 's reasoning has priority and will contribute to the normal conduct of the criminal proceedings .", "...", "The court orders the prosecutor to ensure ... the applicant 's proper medical care . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on DATE . The applicant did not , however , complain in his written submissions about the delay in releasing him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police informed the ORG that the applicant had not been living at his given address in GPE for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the applicant was officially indicted on charges of misappropriation of another 's property and forgery . The indictment stated that ORG 's PERCENT shares in the company were worth MDL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , ORG examined the appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE and dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It did not consider the applicant 's arguments about the lack of a reasonable suspicion against him or deal with other submissions in favour of release . However , the court endorsed the reasons given by the investigating judge of ORG for remanding the applicant in custody and stated that he could abscond through the uncontrolled territory of GPE .", "CARDINAL . Still on DATE , at TIME , the prosecutor applied to ORG for an extension of the applicant 's detention for DATE . The grounds for the extension were similar to those relied upon in the initial application for a remand warrant . It further stated that the identity of all the persons who could have been aware of the offence were unknown . An investigating judge of ORG ordered the extension of the applicant 's detention for DATE for the reasons given by the prosecution later on DATE . Relying on LAW of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) the judge further stated that in exceptional circumstances , depending on the complexity of the case , the severity of the offence and the risk of the applicant 's absconding , the detention could be prolonged . He further noted that the criminal investigation was still ongoing and that several other measures had to be taken in order to complete it . The judge however did not consider any of the arguments put forward by CARDINAL of the applicant 's lawyers that the applicant 's wife was DATE pregnant , that he would not abscond and that he did not intend to influence witnesses . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal lodged against the decision of DATE and found that the investigating judge of ORG had observed the correct procedure . It did not adduce any new reasons for the applicant 's detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer made a fresh habeas corpus application , submitting that there was no reason for the applicant 's further detention on remand . He stated that there was no risk of collusion between the accused or of influencing witnesses , since the criminal proceedings had been instituted on DATE and during that period the prosecution had done enough to obtain evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor filed a new application with ORG for the prolongation of the applicant 's detention for DATE . The prosecutor also relied on the risk that the applicant would forge identity papers and documents in order to hinder the investigation and that the identity of all the persons who could have been aware of the offence was unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigating judge of ORG upheld the prosecutor 's request and relying on LAW of the ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention for DATE . The investigating judge endorsed the reasons given by the prosecutor in favour of the applicant 's further detention . As to the habeas corpus application , the investigating judge found that the reasons put forward by the prosecution for extending the applicant 's detention outweighed the reasons put forward by the defence . Again , the applicant 's lawyer 's argument that his wife was pregnant and that therefore he was unlikely to abscond was ignored . Similarly , the investigating judge did not heed the argument that the applicant was willing to give up his passport as an assurance that he would not leave the country . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal without adducing any new reasons . It noted however that the identity of the persons who could have been aware of the offence were unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigating judge of ORG upheld a new request of the prosecution for a prolongation of the applicant 's detention and ordered a further DATE detention . In particular , the investigating judge dismissed the argument that the applicant 's wife was pregnant on the ground that she was on maternity leave and that there was no evidence that she required any assistance or medical treatment . The applicant appealed , invoking again his wife 's poor health . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . Neither the prosecution nor the courts adduced new reasons for the applicant 's further detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation ended and the criminal file was referred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor applied for a further extension of the applicant 's detention for DATE on the ground that the applicant would hinder the proceedings before the court and would commit other offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , ORG upheld the prosecutor 's request in full without relying on any new reasons for the applicant 's further detention . It did not examine the applicant 's contention that the prosecutor had failed to submit any evidence to substantiate his request .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed and argued that the decision had been issued at TIME , after the expiry of the previous remand warrant at TIME Relying on NORP v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , \u015earban v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) he argued that the domestic courts had failed to provide relevant and sufficient reasons for his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer was given the annex with the prosecution 's list of evidence . It included , inter alia , addresses of witnesses , copies of documents related to the company and the construction site , verbatim records of the examination of compact discs with recordings of telephone conversations of ORG with other co - accused and minutes of searches .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . Besides the reasons outlined in the prosecutor 's request , the court stated that although a search had been conducted of the applicant 's domicile , there was no proof that he had been permanently residing there . The applicant 's application for release was considered as an attempt to influence the investigation . As to the applicant 's detention after TIME on CARDINAL DATE , the court found that he had been lawfully detained , since the hearing had been opened at TIME DATE . Finally , the court stated :", "\u201c Moreover , [ the applicant 's ] intention to undermine the normal conduct of the proceedings ... is highlighted by the fact that constant reference is made to cases examined by ORG , and which are not related to the present case . Those cases are totally different from the present case and therefore the declarations are designed to indirectly influence the courts to release the applicant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer made a fresh habeas corpus request , submitting that there was no reason for his further detention on remand . On the same date ORG dismissed it without providing any relevant reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ordered an official medical examination of the state of health of Mr GPE , who was CARDINAL of the applicant 's co - accused in the criminal proceedings . The court also suspended the criminal proceedings pending the medical examination and the delivery of a report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , without resuming the suspended proceedings , ORG upheld a fresh request of the prosecution for a prolongation of the applicant 's detention and ordered a further DATE detention . It also dismissed a new habeas corpus request made by the applicant . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . Neither the prosecutor nor the courts adduced new reasons for the applicant 's further detention .", "DATE . On DATE ORG resumed the criminal proceedings which had been suspended on DATE and the prosecutor requested a further prolongation of detention for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ordered the extension of the applicant 's detention for DATE . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG quashed the extension order . In particular , ORG stated that the applicant had his permanent residence in PERSON , that there was no risk that he would abscond or that he would undermine the conduct of the criminal proceedings by influencing witnesses . However , ORG prohibited the applicant from leaving the city for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the prosecutor 's request that CARDINAL of applicant 's co - accused be examined by a doctor . Accordingly , the criminal proceedings were suspended .", "CARDINAL .
