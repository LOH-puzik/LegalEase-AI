Mr PERSON ( \u201c the applicant \u201d ) was a NORP national , born in DATE , who lived in PERSON , GPE . On DATE , he died and the application was continued by his son Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an action against ORG seeking the annulment of a decision denying him the benefit of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which provided for damages and certain facilities for persons persecuted by the NORP authorities DATE and DATE on ethnic grounds .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG found for the applicant , ordering the defendant to award him the benefits provided for in the above - mentioned PERSON . The decision became final on DATE .", "Accordingly , on DATE the commission responsible for the enforcement of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL issued a new decision confirming the applicant \u2019s status as a refugee and consequently as a beneficiary of that PERSON from DATE ; the decision confirmed that , inter alia , the applicant was entitled to obtain priority free medical assistance and medicines , both when hospitalised and as an outpatient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was diagnosed with cancer and on DATE , he underwent surgery at ORG for the removal of a tumour on the right kidney . Following medical tests , it was established that the tumour had reached stage III and that the lung was also affected . According to the applicant , although he was hospitalised in the oncology ward , the medical staff failed to administer him specific oncological treatment and he was administered only perfusions with vitamins and normal saline solution .", "CARDINAL . In these circumstances , the applicant approached ORG .", "On DATE , by a letter addressed to ORG , Dr GPE , an oncologist from ORG , confirmed a partial remission of the illness in the applicant \u2019s case , and therefore recommended that he continue being treated with ORG and PERSON , which he had started at his own expense in DATE . This recommendation was later reiterated in a letter of DATE , in which Dr. ORG also acknowledged that the Avastin medicine , which had been administered to the patient twice a week from DATE , had been \u201c procured and paid for in full by Mr. PERSON during the entire period of treatment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , as he could not afford to continue indefinitely bearing the costs of the treatment , which was financially burdensome , the applicant notified ORG ( Casa Jude\u0163ean\u0103 de Asigur\u0103ri de S\u0103n\u0103tate Bihor \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and ORG ( Direc\u0163ia de S\u0103n\u0103tate Public\u0103 Bihor ) accordingly on CARDINAL and DATE respectively and sent numerous requests to ORG ( PERSON - \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , seeking to be granted the recommended drugs free of charge .", "On DATE , through a local bailiff , he filed a notification with the ORG requesting , on the basis of the relevant legislation and supporting documents , that funds be made available for the drugs recommended by his oncologist , namely PERSON and Avastin . The notification read as follows in its relevant part :", "\u201c I ask you to take into consideration that in case of failure to grant my request , you will incur civil and criminal liability for causing my death .... The director of ORG , PERSON , has confirmed to me that you have rejected my request . This fact is irrefutable proof of your guilt . ... Considering the urgent nature of the case , I request a solution within a maximum of DATE , any delay causing irreversible trauma , and after the expiry of that term , I shall be obliged to apply for an injunction in this regard and to initiate criminal proceedings because any refusal is tantamount to murder . I enclose the documents certifying my right and your obligation according to the PERSON governing the organisation of ORG , the sole institution able to guarantee my right to life on the ORG \u2019s behalf . \u201d", "The applicant addressed numerous other petitions to the relevant institutions , including the Government of GPE , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . NORP In addition , \u201c in order to illustrate the distress he was suffering \u201d the applicant informed the ORG that since he was unable to pay for the drugs , he had applied to ORG , on the basis of a recommendation made by PERSON , to be included in the experimental trials of ORG for a new drug called PERSON . On DATE , the applicant signed a contract with the aforesaid institution and started receiving treatment with ORG , which obliged him to be present at the clinic DATE . No other information regarding the execution of that contract was submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a liability action against the ORG and the ORG , requesting ORG to order the defendants to provide him with the medicines PERSON and NORP free of charge and with priority for the period recommended by his doctors , as well as with any other drugs prescribed by his doctors ; he also asked to be reimbursed the cost of the drugs already paid for by him from DATE to date . He requested the court to notify the relevant institutions that their failure to do so would have the civil and criminal consequences of putting his life at risk .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claims . On the basis of medical documents and an opinion which attested to a remission of the illness after the use of the drugs ORG and ORG taken together , the court ordered the ORG and the ORG to provide the applicant with the CARDINAL requested drugs free of charge and with priority for the period recommended by the doctors , together with any other medicines prescribed by the doctors ; it also ordered them to reimburse the applicant the cost of the medicines prescribed by the doctors borne so far by the applicant himself .", "The court dismissed the ORG \u2019s defence that according to ORG no . CARDINAL the applicant could not be provided with NORP free of charge , in so far as the drug Avastin was not on the list of drugs available to outpatients and therefore could not be subsidised from ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The court argued that any list of medicines is susceptible of being amended all the time ; otherwise , the use of any new drug proved to have positive effects on the evolution of cancer would be impossible for CARDINAL or DATE after it became available owing to administrative barriers and logistical formalities meant to ensure that its cost could be reimbursed by the ORG ; this delay would have only negative repercussions for the health of the population . Furthermore , the court held that in so far as in the applicant \u2019s case there was no other drug available as a replacement for Avastin , and considering that failure to use it would have repercussions for the evolution of his illness , the ORG authorities should have made it possible to have ORG rapidly included on the list of reimbursable drugs .", "CARDINAL . The ORG and the ORG contested that judgment before ORG and ORG , mainly arguing that the first - instance court was asking them to reimburse the applicant the cost of medicines that were not included on the list of reimbursable drugs . For the same reason , ORG could not be provided free to the applicant .", "On DATE , ORG and ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the first - instance court \u2019s judgment . The court held that the appellants\u2019 contention that the applicant had been treated free of charge with ORG ( the equivalent of ORG ) from DATE until DATE was not supported by evidence and , in any event , that period did not cover the entire time during which the applicant should have been provided with medication free of charge .", "At the same time , noting that the Avastin had already been approved by ORG in DATE , the court considered that nothing prevented the appellants to have initiated legal procedures to have ORG included on the list of reimbursable medicines starting with that moment , especially having in mind that no other equivalent of Avastin with similar therapeutical effects was included on that list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the ORG requesting the urgent enforcement of that final judgment , arguing that the remission of the illness had ceased and the illness had even worsened on account of the delays caused by the passivity of the ORG authorities . He also invoked LAW , requesting the protection of his right to life .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the applicant informed the ORG that the judgment had not been enforced ; moreover , he submitted that the ORG had no intention of complying with the final judgment , as proved by the fact that they had contested its enforcement and also lodged an extraordinary appeal , requesting that it be set aside ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "He further stated that the drug PERSON had been replaced by ORG , which he had stopped taking in DATE as it caused side effects and because the medical tests showed that the cancer had spread since he had been taking that drug . The applicant also informed the ORG that on DATE the ordinary treatment with cytostatics had been stopped with no explanation .", "The applicant also submitted the results of medical tests carried out during his treatment with ORG and PERSON , dated DATE , which confirmed that the disease was in partial remission , and blood test results dated DATE , after the treatment had ceased , which allegedly attested to an aggravation of the illness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG contested the enforcement of the judgment of DATE , which had become final on DATE , alleging that the institution could not provide the applicant with the requested medicine , since it was not entitled to buy and sell drugs and medicine . Moreover , their relationship with pharmacies was CARDINAL of cooperation , and not CARDINAL of subordination , consequently they could not oblige them to provide the requested medicines to the applicant free of charge .", "Concerning the applicant \u2019s pecuniary claims , the ORG considered that although the evidence submitted by the applicant proved that some medication had been bought from abroad , the amounts of money paid were unspecified , and thus they were not able to make any payment in that regard . The ORG also asked that the enforcement of the disputed judgment be suspended pending the contestation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s son informed the ORG that those proceedings had ended on DATE , when the contestation was dismissed in a final judgment ; the ORG submitted that the pecuniary claims had become time - barred , while the obligation to provide the applicant with the medicine in question had been left without any object following the applicant \u2019s death .", "The ORG also informed that their extraordinary appeal against the disputed judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had also been dismissed by ORG and ORG", "No copy of any judgment allegedly given in these proceedings was submitted .", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL provides for damages for persons persecuted on ethnic grounds who are refugees from the territories occupied during the Second World War . LAW ( a ) provides that persons whose cases are regulated by sections CARDINAL \u201c shall benefit from priority free medical care and drugs , both as outpatients and when hospitalised . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
