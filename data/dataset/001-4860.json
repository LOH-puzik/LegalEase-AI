THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP citizen , born in DATE in GPE . He is an elected member of ORG , representing PERSON . He lives in GPE , GPE .", "The applicant is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts as submitted by the applicant may be summarised as follows .", "In the General Election held on DATE the applicant was elected Member of ORG ( \u201c MP \u201d ) for the ORG constituency in GPE . His party , PERSON , which polled PERCENT of the votes cast in GPE in the General Election , is an NORP republican political party committed to the principle that the NORP people have the right to self - determination .", "The applicant made known to his constituents during the electoral campaign that , in line with official Sinn F\u00e9in policy , he would not take the oath of allegiance ( \u201c the oath \u201d ) to the NORP monarchy which MPs are required to swear as a condition of taking their seats in ORG . The applicant did , however , affirm that he would attend the ORG of GPE , the seat of ORG , in order to avail himself of the normal facilities afforded to MPs , namely office accommodation , staff allowances , research facilities , travel allowances , broadcasting services and access to restricted areas for the purpose of making informal contact with other MPs . It was the applicant 's understanding that elected members who did not take the oath were nonetheless entitled to benefit from these services .", "The oath , as set out in LAW of DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , amended by sections CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Promissory Oaths Act of DATE , is as follows :", "\u201c I [ name ] do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen PERSON , her heirs and successors , according to law . So help me God . \u201d", "On DATE the Speaker of ORG ( \u201c the Speaker \u201d ) made the following Statement to the ORG :", "\u201c This ORG has traditionally accommodated great extremes of opinion . I am sure therefore that the ORG would not wish to put any unnecessary obstacle in the way of Members wishing to fulfil their democratic mandate by attending , speaking and voting in the ORG . Equally , I feel certain that those who choose not to take their seat should not have access to the many benefits and facilities that are now available in the ORG without also taking up their responsibilities as Members .", "The present position is that under the terms of LAW , any Member who fails to take the oath or make the affirmation that is required by law and who then votes or sits during any debate after the election of the Speaker is subject to a penalty of [ GBP ] CARDINAL on each occasion and his or her seat is automatically vacated . In DATE CARDINAL of my predecessors ruled that any such Member could not receive a salary and this regulation also applies to allowances .", "In the interests of the ORG and making use of the power vested in the Speaker to control accommodation and services in the ORG parts of FAC and the precincts , I have decided to extend these restrictions . As from DATE Queen 's speech the services that are available to all other Members from the CARDINAL departments from the ORG and beyond will not be open for use by Members who have not taken their seats by swearing or by affirmation ... . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant travelled to GPE together with Mr PERSON , the other ORG MP elected at the DATE General Election and leader of the party . They were officially informed that they would be barred from using any services or facilities if they did not take the prescribed oath .", "On DATE Mr PERSON wrote to the Speaker requesting her to review her decision . The Speaker replied on DATE stating that her decision stood for the reasons set out in the Statement .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG of GPE for leave to apply for judicial review of the Speaker 's decision and for a declaration that LAW , in so far as it required him to swear or affirm allegiance to the NORP monarchy , was incompatible with his constitutional rights as an MP . Mr Justice PERSON heard the application on DATE .", "On DATE Mr Justice PERSON refused the application . As to the applicant 's challenge to the Speaker 's authority to extend the restriction on facilities and services , the judge ruled that the Speaker was acting as a delegate of the ORG and on behalf of the ORG . Furthermore , he pointed out that the government of DATE decided in DATE that the control of the accommodation and services in ORG and its precincts should be vested in the Speaker on behalf of the ORG . The judge further ruled that he was :", "\u201c quite satisfied that ... the Speaker 's action lies squarely within the realm of internal arrangements of ORG and is not amenable to judicial review . Control of its own internal arrangements has long been recognised as falling uniquely within ORG 's domain and superintendence from the ORG 's intervention is excluded ... . \u201d", "As to the applicant 's challenge to the validity of the DATE Act Mr Justice PERSON ruled that , being primary legislation , the court did not have jurisdiction to review it .", "As to the applicant 's claim that the Speaker 's action was not a \u201c proceeding \u201d under LAW , the judge did not rule on the matter , but he said that if it had been necessary for him to do so , he would have held that the Speaker 's decision to introduce the restrictions was a proceeding in ORG and so could not be challenged by way of judicial review under LAW ( see domestic law and practice below ) .", "The applicant did not appeal to ORG , following advice from counsel that an appeal would be to no avail .", "On DATE the Speaker met with the applicant and PERSON , and refused once again to reconsider her decision to restrict facilities and services of ORG to members who had not taken the oath .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Appended to ORG for DATE following the Statement of the Speaker was a list of services to which the new regulations apply , including : legal services , procedural services ( including the tabling of questions , motions and amendments , and public petitions ) , broadcasting services , ORG services , services available from ORG , the provision of passes , special permits and car parking facilities , access to those areas within the parliamentary precincts which are open only to pass holders , the booking of Committee rooms , conference rooms and interview rooms , office accommodation services for members and their staff , computer services , except those available to the public , the allocation of ORG tickets , the sponsoring of exhibitions in FAC , members ' medical services , library and research services , except for those services of ORG generally available to the public , services provided by ORG , payroll and other financial services provided to members and their staff , insurance services , catering services provided for members and their staff , including the sponsoring of banqueting services , police and security advice available within the precincts , services in the members ' post offices and travel services .", "LAW provides that :", "\u201c ... the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in ORG ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of ORG . \u201d", "In ORG v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL FAC , also involving a challenge to LAW of DATE , the court held that the matter related to the internal management of the procedure of ORG and that the court had no power to interfere with the MPs ' decision to exclude the plaintiff from the ORG . In the case of ORG v. Television GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL , ORG ruled :", "\u201c In addition to LAW itself , there is a long line of authority which supports a wider principle ... that the courts and ORG are both astute to recognise their respective constitutional roles . So far as the courts are concerned they will not allow any challenge to be made to what is said or done within the walls of ORG in performance of its legislative functions and protection of its established privileges . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
