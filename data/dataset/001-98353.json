CARDINAL bullet entry wound was found on the left side of the chest . The bullet exit wounds were found on the left parietal region and the right side of the lumbar region .

While they were reflecting on how to proceed , shooting had come from CARDINAL of the flats . As they could not establish from which direction the gunfire was coming , they had decided to raid all the flats . At that moment a man with a pistol in his hand had briefly emerged from CARDINAL of the doors and then gone back inside . The officers had then broken the door to that flat ( occupied by PERSON ) and fired their weapons at random in order to warn the occupants . They had then realised that the gunfire had actually come from the flat on the other side of the landing ( Erdin\u00e7 PERSON 's flat ) and had called for assistance from ORG .", "CARDINAL .

She had heard him shouting \u201c Let me go ! Leave me ! \u201d . She maintained that she had heard noises on the telephone but not gunfire .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with ORG . In the indictment the prosecutor stated that , prior to the operation , the security forces had failed to conduct an investigation or gather information about the suspected persons and had thus failed to plan the operation in a proper manner . The prosecutor noted that officers PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON had broken down the door to PERSON GPE 's flat and entered there without issuing a warning . The prosecutor considered that , although the officers alleged that they had not directly aimed at PERSON , the wounds to PERSON head could not have been the result of random firing . As for the firearm found next to PERSON body , the prosecutor stated that his office had been unable to determine how the firearm had come to be there ; no cartridges or bullets belonging to that firearm had been found at the scene of the incident .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the killing of PERSON , the prosecutor observed in his indictment that the wound to PERSON head could not have been the result of warning shots . Noting that the deceased had only fired once , the prosecutor considered that officers PERSON , PERSON and ORG had exceeded the limits of self - defence by killing him .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor charged PERSON , PERSON and PERSON with the offence of murder . PERSON was charged with murder and with exceeding the limits of legitimate self - defence . Finally , PERSON and ORG were charged with the offence of causing death by exceeding the limits of legitimate self - defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the trial court \u201d ) held the first hearing on the merits of the case . On DATE the applicants and the deceased men 's other relatives joined the proceedings as interveners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the representative for the interveners requested the trial court to order an investigation into the accused police officers ' superiors who had planned and controlled the operation . The trial court dismissed this request , holding that the intervening parties should apply to the prosecutor 's office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court had regard to the time spent by Officer PERSON in detention and also noted that the collection of the evidence was almost complete . Noting that Mr PERSON had a permanent residence , the trial court ordered his release from prison .", "CARDINAL . During the subsequent hearings the trial court heard evidence from the defendants , the applicants , the intervening parties , the police officers who participated in the operation , the deceased persons ' neighbours and PERSON . Mr PERSON changed his previous statement and maintained that Erdin\u00e7 PERSON had in fact fired the PERSON . The trial court also conducted an on - site inspection of the CARDINAL flats and ordered experts to take photographs of the scene of the incident and to draw up a sketch map .", "CARDINAL . During the on - site inspection on DATE , the trial court ordered an expert to draw up a report in order to determine whether the shots had been fired at random and to establish the accuracy of the police officers ' account that they had not been able to establish the source of the firing at the beginning of the operation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert submitted his report to the trial court . He concluded that the police officers had fired their guns at random . The expert also considered that it was probable that the police officers had failed to determine the direction of the shots fired from the PERSON because shots from such a powerful weapon would have caused an echo in the building .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court rendered its judgment . It held that there was no evidence in the case file to prove that there had been a premeditated plan to kill the CARDINAL persons or that the firearms found at the scene of the incident had been planted there by the police officers who had participated in the operation .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the killing of PERSON , the trial court rejected the first applicant 's allegation that the lights had been on in the flat at the time of the incident and that her husband had not had a firearm . The trial court considered it probable that PERSON had had a firearm in his hand as there were armed men in the building . The trial court further noted that the police officers had planned to render PERSON harmless in order to be able to arrest him . It also observed that PERSON had not fired his gun .", "CARDINAL . The trial court observed that the police officers had fired a total of CARDINAL bullets and that PERSON had been shot in the head , whereas the police officers should have aimed at other parts of his body , such as his legs and feet , in order to avoid the risk to his life . The trial court concluded that PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON had exceeded the limits of their powers in resorting to force and had thus caused PERSON death . However , the trial court could not determine which officer had actually killed PERSON and it thus reduced the QUANTITY police officers ' sentences to DATE , before further reducing them to DATE and then suspending them altogether .", "CARDINAL . As to the killing of PERSON , the trial court noted at the outset that the security forces had received information that the deceased and PERSON had been making explosives in their flat with a view to carrying out bomb attacks on the provincial offices of the CARDINAL political parties which formed ORG at the time . The trial court observed that , according to the expert report of DATE , PERSON and PERSON hand swabs revealed traces of antimony . It further noted that an exchange of gunfire had begun between the police officers who had secured the area outside the building and PERSON and PERSON , who had been in the flat . It recorded that CARDINAL bullets had been fired from the PERSON and QUANTITY from the NORP firearm ; both these weapons had been found in PERSON flat . The court noted that a bullet had been fired from the room in the direction of the police officers who had been on the other side of the door .", "CARDINAL . The trial court considered that the police officers , who had been facing CARDINAL persons armed with weapons and bombs in a confined place , could not have been expected to fire at non - life - threatening parts of Mr PERSON 's body . It therefore held that PERSON , PERSON and ORG had remained within the limits of legitimate self - defence . It concluded that there were no grounds for imposing any punishment on those officers for the killing of PERSON .", "CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG . On DATE ORG decision was deposited with the registry of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the judgment of ORG v. GPE ( no .
