The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lived with her partner , a dual NORP - Ukrainian national , PERSON . , in ORG . On DATE their first child , PERSON , was born ; he was registered in GPE at the applicant \u2019s address and acquired NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . NORP Some time in DATE PERSON . left GPE for GPE . PERSON continued to live with his mother and attended a pre - school educational institution in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE PERSON . visited the applicant and L. twice . In DATE the applicant gave birth to another child of the couple , T.", "CARDINAL . On DATE T. died in an accident . She fell from an open window of an apartment . L. , who had apparently witnessed the tragic incident , started receiving psychological help in the form of dolphin - assisted therapy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant allowed PERSON . to take their son for the first time to GPE for DATE . She signed a document authorising PERSON . to travel with NORP to GPE and GPE DATE and DATE . According to the applicant , PERSON was expected to return to ORG by DATE in order to start in DATE at a primary school in which he had been pre - enrolled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant learned when talking on the telephone with her son that the latter would not be returning to GPE and would be staying in GPE . For DATE the applicant tried to persuade her former partner to allow their child to return to GPE , to no avail however . It appears that soon after PERSON . left for GPE , while PERSON stayed in GPE with his uncle , PERSON . \u2019s brother , and his grandfather . PERSON PERSON . travelled occasionally to GPE to see his son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE L. was diagnosed with an adjustment disorder and began having outpatient treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG ordered PERSON \u2019s return to GPE . The court ruled that PERSON \u2019s place of permanent residence should be that of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . PERSON . was not apparently informed of the institution of the above proceedings . He did not accordingly appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant initiated child return proceedings under LAW via ORG of GPE . On DATE the latter contacted ORG of GPE and requested legal cooperation on the matter . On DATE ORG of GPE , acting as the central authority responsible for the obligations established by LAW , instituted proceedings on behalf of the applicant before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE social workers went to see PERSON at the request of ORG . They visited him at his uncle \u2019s apartment , where he was living with his cousins . According to the report drawn up thereafter , PERSON was being looked after by his uncle , since his father was mainly based in GPE . The boy spoke NORP , although he had started attending a NORP school . PERSON \u2019s uncle told the social workers that PERSON \u2019s sister had died as a result of their mother \u2019s lack of attention ; hence it was dangerous for PERSON to live with his mother . The social workers also had a short conversation with PERSON during which he stated that he was happy with his uncle and cousins , and did not want to go back to GPE . In conclusion , the social workers noted that PERSON was living in appropriate living conditions , and that his basic needs were being met .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the social workers set up and attended CARDINAL meetings between the applicant and her son . In the report drawn up thereafter they concluded the following :", "\u201c On the basis of our intervention , which included visits , conversations with PERSON and observation of his behaviour , we consider his behaviour to be problematic . In particular , although PERSON wants to see his mother , and when seeing her expresses his love , warm feelings and happiness , he refuses subsequently to talk to her on the telephone . It should be underlined that when communicating with his mother he is following his father \u2019s prompting and is stressed . Given that PERSON is living in the family of his uncle and grandfather , he lacks relationship with his parents ( since neither of the parents lives with him ) . In order for a child to develop into a contented and healthy individual , and to have his interests protected , it is necessary for him to communicate with his parents . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the same report the social workers noted that during one of the meetings they noticed that the boy , prompted by his father , had stopped hugging his mother . This happened twice , until CARDINAL of the social workers warned PERSON . to stop doing this .", "CARDINAL . In DATE additionally underwent a psychological examination , which concluded that the boy was suffering from insufficient emotional relationship with his parents . It was noted that PERSON had a clearly positive attitude towards his father and the paternal family , while with respect to the mother his attitude was twofold : love and warm feelings on the one hand , and anxiety on the other . PERSON indicated to a psychologist that he wanted to live with his father and his father \u2019s family and wanted his mother to be with them too . In her conclusions about his emotional condition the psychologist noted that the boy \u2019s nervousness , aggression , distrust , and irritability , as well as low self - esteem , were caused by psychological trauma he had suffered in the past , as well as by his current complicated and barely comprehensible situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request . The court concluded , having regard to the boy \u2019s age and other circumstances of the case , that his return to GPE would expose him to psychological risk . It stated in this connection that it would be inappropriate to order the boy \u2019s return to GPE , since the applicant had failed to show that she could create a stable environment for her son in which he could be protected from psychological risks related to the separation from his father . The court further noted the following :", "\u201c The court considers that in the current case , having regard to a psychologist \u2019s report which categorically states that PERSON suffered a serious psychological injury , it is with high probability that if returned to GPE the child would be exposed to \u201c physical or psychological harm or otherwise PERSON ] in an intolerable situation \u201d ( LAW ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that her son was suffering from an adjustment disorder and lacked communication with his parents . It noted in this connection the following :", "\u201c In view of a psychological examination the court particularly stresses the following \u2013 \u201c PERSON . has revealed ... high level of anxiety ... and fear of the future \u201d , \u201c twofold attitude towards his mother , which implies love and warm feelings as well as strong anxiety , \u201d according to the same report , it was established that [ he suffers from ] \u201c lack of emotional relationship with both parents \u201d and \u201c positive attitude towards his father and the paternal family \u201d especially towards the grandfather ( PERSON . ) .", "The court further particularly underlines the fact that minor PERSON . expresses the wish to live with his father and the paternal family . At the same time , he wants his mother ( PERSON ) to stay with them ...", "The court can not accept the argument of the requesting party that the child is having adaptation difficulties because of the separation from his mother and because he is being kept in GPE . The above opinion is not supported by any evidence and is not substantiated ... There is an attempt on the father \u2019s side to take every possible measure ... to treat [ the boy \u2019s ] psychological condition . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the risks related to the boy \u2019s return to GPE , the court stated :", "\u201c Hence , the court considers that the return of PERSON . to GPE ( in view of his current condition ) would imply his return to an uncomfortable situation , which would result in his psychological stress and would place him at psychological risk , even if he returned to GPE with his father . Separation from his father and the paternal family and his return to GPE ( at this stage ) would cause mental deterioration of the child and from a psychological point of view would inevitably create a risk [ for the boy ] . ( The requesting party failed to prove the opposite ) . \u201c", "CARDINAL . That decision was overturned on DATE by ORG , which ordered PERSON \u2019s return to GPE . The appeal court observed that PERSON had been born and had lived in GPE , so he had adapted to the situation in GPE . Further , according to the psychological and social welfare reports , the boy was suffering from adaptation difficulties and lacked sufficient communication with his parents . In this connection , the court stressed that PERSON had indeed suffered psychological trauma as a result of the accidental death of his sister ; but , according to the very same reports , he was also suffering because of the situation he was currently in . Hence , it was within the best interests of the child to be reunited with his mother . The court further noted :", "\u201c The above - mentioned conclusions confirm that the current situation for [ the boy ] is complicated and hardly comprehensible . Accordingly , in view of the interests of PERSON . , since there is no obvious risk of a negative impact on his mental state if he were returned to his mother , it would be appropriate that he be returned to his parent ( the applicant PERSON ) and to his habitual place of residence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the death of PERSON \u2019s sister , the appeal court noted that related criminal proceedings had been dropped , as it had been concluded that it had been a tragic accident . It further noted in connection with the psychological trauma the boy suffered as a result , that", "\u201c ... already traumatised child should not be separated from his parents . This should be viewed as a decision taken in the interests of the child . As was noted in the appealed decision , PERSON before his arrival in GPE had been having dolphin - assisted rehabilitation treatment . At the same time , his stay with his mother can not be harmful to him , since she has been doing an internship at the psychiatric hospital ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON . appealed against this decision on points of law , alleging that the court of appeal had incorrectly interpreted LAW and the facts of the case . On DATE , without holding an oral hearing , ORG allowed the appeal on points of law , thus reversing the judgment of DATE . On a general note , in connection with the purpose of the initiated proceedings the court noted the following :", "\u201c The subject matter of the pending application is the return to GPE of a child ( PERSON . ) wrongfully retained in GPE ... The cassation court pays attention to the analysis developed in the preamble of the Convention concerning its aims , according to which the interests of the child are of paramount importance when examining childcare - related issues . At the same time , the High Contracting Parties to the Convention undertook an obligation to provide international protection to children against any harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention . Accordingly , it implies that the procedures provided for by the ORG which aim at the speedy return of a wrongfully removed or retained child to his or her habitual place of residence serve the main purpose of protecting children \u2019s interests . In view of all the above - mentioned , the cassation court when considering the lawfulness of the request to end wrongful retention of a child considers it appropriate within the scope of the appeal on point of law to also examine the issue as to what extent the child \u2019s interests would be protected in the event of his return which together with other factors implies the creation of a safe environment for a child . The above analysis of the cassation court finds its basis in the exceptional clauses of the LAW which in individual cases allow the relevant bodies of the receiving state to refuse the return of a child ( LAW ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that the applicant had failed to show that the return of L. to the pre - abduction situation would be possible without damaging his interests . Notably , the court concluded :", "\u201c The cassation court wholly shares the view of the appeal court , according to which L. is suffering from lack of relationship with his parents ; accordingly , in order for the child to develop into a contented and healthy individual and to have his interests protected it is necessary for him to communicate with his parents . However , as was noted above , when dealing with this type of case particular attention should be given to the consideration of exceptional circumstances ... The appellant alleges a violation of LAW b of LAW ( there is a serious risk that if returned the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation ) and considers that the impugned decision omits the primary reason for PERSON . \u2019s leaving GPE , namely the tragic death of PERSON . in DATE , which fact had a negative impact on the psychological condition of PERSON . ...", "The cassation court notes the results of the available psychological examination , in which the psychologist along with other issues stressed the high level of traumatisation in PERSON . as a result of the death of his younger sister . At the same time , the psychologist considers the psychological features observed to be the boy \u2019s reaction to the psychological trauma which he had suffered and to the current barely comprehensible situation . It is noteworthy that even the court of appeal could not omit the fact that as a result of the death of PERSON . ( the sister of PERSON . ) the latter had suffered mental trauma and is as of DATE registered at a ... psychiatric institution .... However , the above - mentioned circumstances were not sufficient [ for the appeal court ] to refuse the return of the boy .", "The cassation court considers that there is no evidence in the case file which would lead the court to believe that it would be possible to return the child to his pre - abduction environment without damaging his interests . In the opinion of the cassation court , the appellant validly substantiated , on the basis of relevant evidence , the risk factors which are inconsistent with the purposes of the ORG , while the respondent failed to show a higher purpose which could have been achieved by putting an end to the unlawful situation and [ she had also ] failed to demonstrate that in the event of the child being returned to GPE his interests and rights would not be even more violated . Accordingly , bearing in mind that the primary purpose of ORG is the protection of the interests of a child , the cassation court considers that the appellant has lodged a substantiated complaint . \u201d", "CARDINAL . To conclude , in reference to LAW b of LAW , ORG observed that the main purpose of LAW was the protection of the best interests of a child , and that accordingly , given the well - substantiated risks that PERSON was facing upon his return to GPE , the exception clause should have been invoked .", "CARDINAL . The case file indicates that PERSON . did not take part in the relevant court proceedings , as he was not in GPE at the material time . PERSON , according to the case file , is currently living with his uncle and grandfather in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
