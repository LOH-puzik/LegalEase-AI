The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in R\u012bga .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON was born to the first applicant in GPE . His father was an NORP national , who was never married to the first applicant but who has never disputed his paternity of PERSON . In DATE PERSON \u2019s parents separated and the applicants moved to a separate residence in GPE , GPE . The applicants allege that ever since PERSON \u2019s birth he has in practice been in the exclusive care of his mother , and his father \u2019s participation in his upbringing has been minimal .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the first applicant , on DATE ORG ( Tribunale per i minorenni di Roma ) granted custody of PERSON to his mother because the ongoing conflict between the parents made joint custody unfeasible . However , the court held that the father had a right to have his son stay at his home on specified days of DATE and also whenever the first applicant was travelling outside GPE for a length of time exceeding one week or outside GPE for any length of time . The decision came into force on DATE it was adopted .", "CARDINAL . PERSON \u2019s father appealed against that decision , requesting that joint custody be granted or that he be granted sole custody and that the first applicant be forbidden to take the child abroad or to change her place of residence without the father \u2019s prior approval . ORG ( GPE d\u2019appello di GPE . Sezione per i minorenni ) rejected his request in a decision of DATE , noting , inter alia , that the child was developing well and that it was impossible to ensure his development by granting sole custody to the father . Furthermore , it was noted that the father \u2019s concern that the first applicant might move to GPE and take their son with her was unfounded because a judge in a guardianship hearing ( giudice tutelare , \u201c the guardianship judge \u201d ) had previously refused to issue a passport to PERSON and also because his mother had strictly adhered to the ruling of the first - instance court and had left the child in his father \u2019s care when travelling to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the guardianship judge granted an authorisation to issue a passport to PERSON . On DATE PERSON \u2019s father appealed against that decision . On DATE ORG rejected PERSON \u2019s father \u2019s appeal , because there was no evidence that the first applicant was planning to leave GPE with the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Tribunale ) of NORP ruled that PERSON \u2019s father had to make child support payments . The decision noted , inter alia , that the father had previously avoided financially supporting his son . PERSON \u2019s father failed to make the ordered payments and on DATE the first applicant lodged a complaint about this with the NORP police .", "CARDINAL . It appears that because of PERSON \u2019s father \u2019s failure to financially support the applicants their only income was money which the first applicant \u2019s mother was sending from GPE . However , in DATE the first applicant \u2019s mother informed her that she was no longer able to provide financial support . According to the applicants it was for that reason that they had no other choice but to return to GPE in DATE . The applicants indicate that they subsequently continued to return to GPE for brief periods of time . According to ORG , they have never been back .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was granted NORP citizenship , since it was established that his mother \u2019s permanent residence at the time of his birth had been in GPE . Subsequently , the first applicant registered PERSON \u2019s permanent residence in an apartment in ORG belonging to her .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON \u2019s father requested ORG to grant him interim sole custody of PERSON and to order his return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that court issued a decision in which it upheld the father \u2019s request . The decision noted that the first applicant \u2019s actions had been harmful to the child . The court further held that it did not have jurisdiction to order the child \u2019s return to GPE but indicated that PERSON had to reside with his father . The decision finally provided that a hearing would be held on DATE and that PERSON \u2019s father had an obligation to inform the first applicant of the court \u2019s decision before DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submit that the first applicant was not informed of the hearing that had been scheduled , nor did she receive a summons to it . The applicants further submit that PERSON \u2019s father had never requested full custody , but instead had asked the court to re - establish his rights of contact with the child and to order his return to GPE . The first applicant alleges that she only learned about the adopted decision in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( by what appears to be a clerical error the document is dated DATE ) ORG Ministry of Justice , in its capacity as ORG under LAW ( \u201c LAW ) , issued a request for PERSON to be returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . After receiving the request , ORG ( NORP un \u0123imenes lietu ministrija ) , which is ORG within the meaning of LAW , initiated civil proceedings against the first applicant in accordance with LAW . The R\u012bga City Vidzeme District Court , which had been allocated the case , requested ORG ( PERSON b\u0101ri\u0146tiesa ) to evaluate the applicants\u2019 residence and to issue an opinion concerning the possibility of returning PERSON to his father in GPE . After visiting the applicants\u2019 residence , by a decision of DATE the Orphans\u2019 Court established that the child \u2019s living conditions were beneficial for his growth and development . It further noted that PERSON had adjusted to living in his mother \u2019s residence and that she was ensuring his full physical and intellectual development . Accordingly , ORG concluded that the child \u2019s return to GPE would not be compatible with his best interests .", "CARDINAL . That conclusion was also supported by the findings of a psychologist , whose opinion had been requested by the applicants\u2019 lawyer . In a report dated DATE the psychologist concluded that severance of contact between PERSON and his mother was not to be allowed , in that it could negatively affect the child \u2019s development and could even create neurotic problems and illnesses .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , ORG attested to ORG that if any of the circumstances mentioned in LAW ( b ) of LAW arose GPE would be able to activate a wide - ranging child protection network which could ensure that PERSON and his father received psychological help .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC issued a decision by which it refused the father \u2019s request to return PERSON to GPE . That court based its decision on LAW ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL of DATE concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility ( \u201c the Regulation \u201d ) . The court held that the removal of PERSON had been wrongful within the meaning of LAW and the Regulation , since it had been carried out without his father \u2019s permission . It was further noted that it was not expedient to hear PERSON \u2019s own opinion , since he was DATE at the time and was unable to form an opinion about which of his parents he should live with .", "CARDINAL . The court considered it necessary to assess whether the circumstances provided for in LAW ( b ) of LAW existed . Its conclusion was that those circumstances existed . It noted the ties between PERSON and his mother and the fact that he had settled well in GPE and considered that his continued residence in GPE was essential for his development . ORG found that the provisions of LAW ) of the ORG had not been fulfilled , because it was financially impossible for the first applicant to follow PERSON to GPE if he were returned there . Furthermore , the guarantees provided for by GPE could not ensure that the child would not suffer psychologically and that his mental health would not be prejudiced . Accordingly the court applied LAW ( b ) of LAW and refused the father \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a final decision , by which it rejected the father \u2019s appeal against the decision of ORG . In substance ORG agreed with the conclusions of the first - instance court , adding that the guarantees offered by ORG concerning the protection available to PERSON after his potential return to GPE were too vague and non - specific . It was also mentioned that PERSON \u2019s father had made no effort to establish contact with his son ever since the applicants\u2019 departure from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested PERSON to grant her sole custody of PERSON . On DATE ORG issued an opinion in which it concluded that granting sole custody of PERSON to his mother was in his best interests . ORG indicated among other considerations the fact that PERSON \u2019s father had not seen his son since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL PERSON \u2019s father lodged a request with ORG , which was based on LAW ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL) of the Regulation , to issue an immediately executable decision ordering PERSON \u2019s return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant submitted her observations to that court , in which she acknowledged that she had left GPE because of an ongoing conflict with PERSON \u2019s father and because of her difficult financial situation . She noted that PERSON \u2019s father had never travelled to see his son in GPE ; however , she stated that the applicants were always available to come to GPE to meet PERSON \u2019s father during school holidays . In conclusion , she requested that the court order child support payments in the amount of QUANTITY ( ORG ) per month .", "CARDINAL . In the context of separate proceedings , on DATE ORG made a judgment concerning the first applicant \u2019s request for child support payments and ordered PERSON \u2019s father to pay the first applicant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL plus interest , starting from DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG upheld the father \u2019s request . It considered that the only role left to it by LAW ) of the ORG was to verify whether adequate arrangements had been made to secure the protection of the child from any identified risks within the meaning of LAW b ) of LAW after his or her return . After considering the first applicant \u2019s submissions , the court noted that the father had proposed that PERSON would stay with him , while the first applicant would be authorised to use a house in PERSON for periods of DATE during DATE and subsequently for DATE ( the first applicant would have to cover her own travel expenses and CARDINAL of the rent of the house in PERSON ) , during which time PERSON would be staying with his mother , while the father would retain the right to visit him on a DATE basis . PERSON would be enrolled in a kindergarten which he had attended before his removal from GPE . He would also attend a swimming pool he had used before his departure from GPE . The father furthermore undertook to ensure that the child would receive adequate psychological help and would attend LANGUAGE - language classes for NORP children . The court considered such an arrangement adequate to fulfil the requirements of the ORG and ordered an immediate execution of its decision to return PERSON to GPE and to have him reside with his father . The court also pointed out that it would be preferable if the first applicant accompanied PERSON on his way to GPE but , should that prove to be impossible , his return would be arranged by the NORP embassy in GPE . Due to the urgent nature of the case , the decision was pronounced to be immediately executable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( in what appears to be a clerical error , the date indicated in the document is DATE ) the first applicant lodged a request with ORG to suspend the execution of its decision . She argued that PERSON had not been heard by the tribunal and that ORG had not taken into consideration the arguments which the NORP courts had used in their decisions when applying LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of ORG of DATE . In her appeal she requested that the execution of that decision be suspended ; that the appeal court hear PERSON ; that there be an order that she retain sole custody of PERSON ; and that PERSON \u2019s father be ordered to pay LAW per month in child support payments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a decision in which it rejected the first applicant \u2019s request to suspend the execution of the decision of DATE . That court considered that it was not appropriate to question the child , taking into account his young age and the level of maturity . Furthermore , it considered that LAW did not oblige it to hear the parties in person . It remarked that all of the decisions taken by the NORP courts had been duly taken into consideration . Finally , the court upheld the father \u2019s request to issue a return certificate in accordance with ORG DATE and CARDINAL of the Regulation . The certificate was issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a letter to ORG , forwarding ORG decision of DATE and inviting it to advise the NORP side on \u201c the initiatives that will be taken in order to enforce the return order made by ORG in GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a psychologist issued another report on PERSON \u2019s psychological state . The report concluded that the child had developed certain psychological problems in connection with his father \u2019s request to return him to GPE . It further reiterated the conclusion from the earlier report , that PERSON had strong emotional ties with his mother , the severance of which was impermissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant received information from ORG about the request made by ORG . The first applicant was informed that GPE had an obligation to enforce the DATE decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant submitted a request to FAC , requesting it to indicate interim measures and not to allow PERSON \u2019s return to GPE \u201c until he himself agrees to return to his father in GPE \u201d . Further , she requested the court to require ORG and ORG to surrender their competence to ORG , since that court had already , on DATE , been allocated a still pending case concerning the granting of sole custody of PERSON to his mother , and also because the child \u2019s permanent residence was in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a decision in which it decided not to proceed with the first applicant \u2019s request concerning the question of PERSON \u2019s custody , since it considered that the first applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of DATE , which was pending at the time before ORG , concerned the same subject matter , with the same parties involved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a decision concerning the first applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . The appeal court first of all observed that pursuant to LAW ( CARDINAL) of the Regulation ( see below , paragraph CARDINAL ) it had jurisdiction to decide the question of the child \u2019s return to GPE . It then went on to observe that the first - instance court had correctly implemented the procedure set out in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the Regulation ( see below , paragraph CARDINAL ) , as attested by the reasoned opinion of ORG ( see below , paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The court continued by observing that the decision to grant PERSON \u2019s father sole custody had been motivated by the first applicant \u2019s behaviour when she had chosen to take the child to GPE and by the father \u2019s undertaking to take care of the child in GPE . ORG therefore upheld the decision of ORG and ordered that after the child \u2019s return to GPE he be enrolled in a primary school .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff of ORG charged with the execution of the ORG decision of DATE invited PERSON \u2019s father to provide assistance in the execution of that decision by reestablishing contact with his son . It appears that PERSON \u2019s father has not responded to that request in any way .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE brought an action against GPE before ORG in application of LAW . GPE alleged , in particular , that the above - described proceedings in GPE ( the decision adopted on DATE and the issuing of the return certificate in DATE ) did not conform to the Regulation , in that neither of the applicants had been heard by ORG on DATE , and also that ORG had ignored the decisions of DATE of ORG and of CARDINAL DATE of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a reasoned opinion . It held that GPE had violated neither the ORG nor the \u201c general principles of the ORG law \u201d . In so far as is relevant to the case before ORG , the Commission held as follows .", "CARDINAL . At the outset it reiterated , where GPE was disputing the legality of the actions of an NORP authority with a judicial function , the scope of the ORG \u2019s review was very limited . The ORG could only review matters of procedure , not substance , and it had to respect the decisions made by the NORP courts in the exercise of their discretionary powers .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the argument of GPE that the decision of DATE had been adopted without attempting to obtain PERSON \u2019s opinion , the Commission stressed that it followed from the ORG , LAW on the Rights of the LAW ( \u201c the ORG Convention \u201d ) , LAW and LAW that hearing a child \u2019s opinion with regard to questions concerning that child was a fundamental principle . However , that principle was not absolute . What had to be taken into account was the level of the child \u2019s development . That level was not and could not be defined in any international instruments , therefore the national authorities retained wide discretion in such questions . The Commission held that ORG had used that discretion and indicated in the certificate of return that it had not been necessary for the NORP courts to hear PERSON . Therefore , none of the international instruments that had been invoked by GPE had been breached .", "CARDINAL . GPE further criticised the fact that the decision of DATE had been adopted without duly taking into account the position of the first applicant , and that the decision had been adopted without hearing either of the parties , including the first applicant , who was neither informed of the time of the forthcoming hearing nor invited to take part in it . The ORG noted that the decision of DATE had been adopted in written proceedings , without hearing oral submissions of either of the parties , which was fully in conformity with the applicable NORP procedural legislation . The ORG interpreted LAW ) ( b ) of the Regulation ( see below , paragraph CARDINAL ) in the light of the ORG \u2019s case - law ( referring in particular to ORG B.V. v. the GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , and considered that the use of written proceedings was permissible as long as the principle of equality of arms was observed . The Commission observed that the first applicant had been given an opportunity to submit written observations on equal grounds with PERSON \u2019s father and thus neither the ORG nor LAW had been violated .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , GPE criticised the decision of DATE and the related return certificate for ignoring the NORP authorities\u2019 reasons for refusing to order PERSON \u2019s return to GPE . The Commission indicated that its role was not to analyse the substance of the NORP authorities\u2019 decisions \u2013 it was limited to appraising the compliance with the procedure which led to the adoption of those decisions with the procedural requirements of the LAW . Nothing in the ORG forbade the NORP authorities to come to a conclusion that was opposite to the one reached by the NORP authorities . Quite to the contrary , the ORG considered that the ORG gave the country of the child \u2019s residence prior to the abduction \u201c the final say \u201d in ordering the return , even if his or her new country of residence had declined to order the return . In this regard the ORG noted that ORG , when adopting the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see above , paragraph CARDINAL ) , had referred to ORG , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) of which permits refusal to return a child if the child is well settled in GPE and his or her return is not in his or her interests . The Commission questioned the NORP court \u2019s alleged failure to invoke the \u201c much more binding \u201d LAW , which in their opinion demonstrated that the NORP courts had devoted attention to PERSON \u2019s situation in GPE instead of the potential consequences of his return to GPE . In short , the Commission had \u201c not discovered any indications \u201d that life in GPE together with his father would expose PERSON to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation . What is more , the Commission considered that ORG in its decision of DATE had directly addressed ORG concerns that the measures envisaged for PERSON \u2019s protection upon his return to GPE were too vague \u2013 the NORP court had set out specific obligations on the father which would allow for balanced development of the child and for him to have contact with both parents .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion the Commission conceded that the decision of DATE did not contain a detailed analysis of either the arguments of the first applicant or of those of PERSON \u2019s father . However , it considered that the Regulation did not require such an analysis . Therefore , the exact procedure to be followed in that respect was left to the national ORG discretion . Taking that into account , it was found that neither GPE nor the ORG could dispute the particular formulation of the NORP court \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . LAW , which has been ratified by GPE and GPE , provides , in so far as relevant , as follows .", "\u201c The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where DATE", "a ) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person , an institution or any other body , either jointly or alone , under the law of the ORG in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention ; and", "b ) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised , either jointly or alone , or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention .", "The rights of custody mentioned in sub - paragraph a ) above , may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision , or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that ORG . \u201d", "\u201c The Convention shall apply to any child who was habitually resident in a ORG immediately before any breach of custody or access rights .
