The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of aggravated fraud by ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) and sentenced to conditional imprisonment for DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) requesting , inter alia , that an oral hearing be held . The other defendants and CARDINAL of the complainants also appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having received written observations from the parties , ORG decided to hold an oral hearing . On DATE the parties were summoned to attend the oral hearings which were to take place on DATE , DATE , DATE , and CARDINAL to DATE . It was stated in the decision and in the summons that the applicant was to appear in person at the hearing on all of those days , under penalty of a default fine . His presence was required due to his own appeal as well as the opposing parties\u2019 appeal and in order to be heard by the public prosecutor . However , the hearing of witnesses was to take place between CARDINAL and DATE . Moreover , it was stated in the summons that , if the applicant were to be absent from the main hearing without a valid excuse and despite the penalty of a default fine being imposed , his appeal would be discontinued . As far as the opposing parties\u2019 appeal and the hearing by the public prosecutor were concerned , a new threat of a higher fine could be imposed on the applicant , he could be ordered to be brought to the same or a later hearing , and the case could be decided regardless of his absence . A valid excuse meant circumstances of force majeure or an illness certified by a medical certificate . Work or holiday reasons were normally not considered as valid reasons . ORG was to examine whether the excuse was valid .", "CARDINAL . The summons was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not attend the hearing on DATE but was represented by his counsel . He could not be reached by telephone despite several attempts . The public prosecutor requested that the applicant be brought to the hearing but this was not done . The applicant \u2019s counsel indicated that the applicant could most likely be found at his home but that his presence at the hearing on DATE was not necessary as it had been planned in advance that he would be heard only on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided , on the basis of LAW , section DATE , of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , that the applicant \u2019s appeal was to be discontinued due to his absence . It found that , since the applicant had not attended the hearing on DATE or notified the court of a valid excuse for his absence , he had to be considered to have been absent even though his counsel had been present . It was stated in the decision that an ordinary appeal was not allowed but if the applicant had had a valid excuse that he had not been able to announce in time , he had the right to a reopening of the case on the basis of the same appeal , by notifying ORG in writing within DATE of the decision to discontinue the appeal . If he could not provide a valid excuse , the case would be ruled inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant attended the hearing as planned and was questioned as a witness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant notified ORG in writing that he had had a valid excuse for his absence and that he wanted his case to be reopened . He claimed that the national provision in question , LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , had been too strictly applied . He referred to a ORG judgment in which the court had stated that it was not necessary to summon an applicant to appear in person unless his presence was strictly necessary , for example for questioning . According to ORG , the national provision in question should not be interpreted too strictly . If the applicant was absent from the main hearing but his presence was not deemed strictly necessary , his appeal should not be discontinued due to his absence .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the applicant claimed that the above - mentioned provision most likely failed to comply with the requirements of LAW . When the provision in question had last been amended , the Government had proposed some textual changes in order to reflect better the ORG \u2019s case - law in this respect . These changes were not , however , accepted by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the applicant claimed that , as there were no rules on how national law was to be applied when the main hearing lasted for DATE , a Convention - friendly approach should have been adopted . ORG had set up a procedural plan according to which the applicant was to be heard in person only on DATE . It was not indicated in the summons that even DATE absence would be regarded as absence from the whole main hearing . The applicant \u2019s presence at the hearing on DATE was thus not strictly necessary and ORG should not have discontinued his appeal . The applicant had never intended to discontinue his appeal .", "CARDINAL . In any event , the applicant claimed that he had had a valid excuse as he had been ill . He provided a medical certificate and CARDINAL medical documents to that effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s notification . It found that the medical certificate had been dated DATE after the hearing and that the doctor had thus not examined the applicant \u2019s health on DATE . On DATE , the applicant had not received any treatment in a hospital or in a similar medical institution . The applicant was suffering from a long - term illness and his treatment was estimated to DATE . Despite the applicant \u2019s state of health , he had been able to attend the hearing on DATE . His illness was thus not of a kind to constitute a valid excuse for absence . The applicant had time to prepare himself well in advance for the hearing and also to take the hearing into account when planning his treatment . Thus , the applicant had not shown that he had had a valid reason to be absent from the hearing on CARDINAL DATE and he had no right to have his case reopened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal relied on before ORG and pointing out that ORG had taken no stand on his claims concerning national law and the ORG \u2019s case - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ; Act no . CARDINAL ) , if the appellant is absent from the main hearing , the appeal shall be discontinued . According to LAW , LAW of MONEY no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , a party who , in spite of having been ordered to appear in court in person , sends an attorney in his place without a valid excuse , shall be deemed to be absent .", "CARDINAL . When the current provisions concerning appeals to ORG were amended in DATE and DATE , the following was mentioned in the Government Proposal HE CARDINAL vp . :", "\u201c The provision [ LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ] is interpreted [ by ORG , ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ] to mean that an appeal of an applicant summoned to appear in person is discontinued if he or she is absent from the main hearing even if he or she is represented by counsel . However , ORG has on many occasions stated that it was of crucial importance for the fairness of the criminal justice system that the accused be adequately defended by counsel , in spite of having been properly summoned to appear in person . In its judgments of PERSON and PERSON v. The GPE ( application nos . CARDINAL and GPE , judgment of DATE , points CARDINAL and DATE ) and PERSON v. GPE ( application no . CARDINAL , judgment of DATE , points CARDINAL ) as well as most recently in its judgment Stroek and ORG v. GPE ( application nos . CARDINAL , ORG and CARDINAL , judgment of DATE ) , ORG stated that an accused does not lose this right to be defended effectively by a lawyer merely on account of not attending a court hearing . It is immaterial whether the absence is due to a valid excuse or whether an appeal is possible . It is also immaterial that the defendant was adequately defended in the lower instance . The judgment in the FAC case concerned an action for recovery of a higher court judgment which was given in absentia . The applicant , who was an accused in the criminal proceedings , was represented by her counsel in the recovery proceedings . The higher court \" declared the application void \" . The proceedings were thus similar to those in GPE when an appeal is discontinued . On the other hand , in its judgment of PERSON v. The GPE ( application no . CARDINAL , judgment of DATE , point CARDINAL ) , ORG found no violation when counsel was heard and the case was decided thereafter . In the light of the above ORG \u2019s case - law , it is not entirely clear what should be done regarding an appeal of an applicant who is an accused in criminal proceedings and who , despite being summoned , does not appear in person at the main hearing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , it was proposed that LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW be amended so that an appeal by an applicant summoned to appear in person would no longer be discontinued if he or she were absent from the main hearing but represented by counsel . It was felt that it was better that the applicant in such situations received a decision on material rather than procedural grounds .", "CARDINAL . ORG estimated , however , in its report LaVM CARDINAL/CARDINAL vp . , that as it was debatable whether these amendments were necessary , and since they were causing inconvenience for the functioning of the appeal courts , the amendments should not be adopted . The proposed amendments were thus withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . ORG took a stand on this issue in its judgment of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL ) . It found , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG has in many judgments stated that it was of crucial importance for the fairness of the criminal justice system that the accused be adequately defended , and that he could not be deprived of this right merely on account of not attending a court hearing . According to the ORG , even if the legislature had to be able to discourage unjustified absences , it could not penalise them by creating exceptions to the right to legal assistance ( see GPE v. GPE , judgment of DATE , PERSON v. The GPE and PERSON v. The GPE , judgments of CARDINAL DATE , as well as PERSON v. GPE , judgment of DATE , PERSON v. GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE and ORG v. GPE , judgment of DATE ) .", "......", "CARDINAL . When deciding in what situations a case can be examined only when the applicant is present in person and in what situations the applicant has the right to defend himself through legal assistance of his choosing , one has to distinguish different situations in the criminal proceedings . If the applicant is heard in order to clarify the matter , his presence in person is necessary . When , however , other witnesses are heard or the parties are heard in order to assess legally the act described in the indictment or the defence , it is appropriate that questioning is undertaken and the statements are given by a legal representative . It is also clear that when the applicant exercises his right to question or to give legal statements , he can not be deprived of his right to use legal assistance and that his presence in person in those situations is not necessary . Therefore , the applicant should not be obliged to appear in person under penalty of a default fine unless the outcome of the case might depend on the reliability of his account or his presence in person is necessary for some other reason .", "CARDINAL . According to the provisions concerning the proceedings in appeal courts , an appeal court can not , without any particular grounds , change the district court \u2019s conclusions concerning the evidence if persons meant to be heard as witnesses are absent from the main hearing . The starting point is that a higher instance should have the same possibility to assess the oral testimony as a district court , the correctness of whose judgment is being assessed by the higher instance . This means , inter alia , that the principle of immediate presentation of evidence must be applied also on appeal . It does not follow from the wording of LAW , section DATE , of LAW , nor did it follow from it at the time when ORG examined the case , that an appeal should always be entirely discontinued when the applicant is absent from the main hearing , even though summoned to appear in person . The court which has the right and the obligation to conduct the proceedings can and indeed must then decide whether the examination of some parts of the appeal by hearing only counsel is necessary or reasonable . When considering this , the court must take into account the applicant \u2019s justified legal expectations . If it becomes clear that the applicant \u2019s presence in person is , in spite of the given order , not necessary , his appeal should not in this kind of situation be even partly discontinued due to his absence . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
