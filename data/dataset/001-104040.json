NORP On DATE the first applicant contested that decision in ORG , complaining of an infringement of the principle of secularism , relying in that connection on Articles CARDINAL ( principle of equality ) and CARDINAL ( religious freedom ) of LAW and LAW , and on the principle of the impartiality of public administrative authorities ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG , ORG adopted Directive no . DATE , instructing the competent services of his Ministry to take the necessary measures to see to it that school governors ensured the presence of crucifixes in classrooms ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "On DATE the Minister joined the proceedings brought by the first applicant . He argued that her application was ill - founded since the presence of crucifixes in the classrooms of publicly run schools was based on Article CARDINAL of royal decree no . CARDINAL of DATE ( internal regulations of middle schools ) and LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ( approval of the general regulations governing primary education ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL of DATE ( approving the single text bringing together the legislative provisions in force regarding education and schools ) , in their \u201c specifications \u201d resulting from Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the above - mentioned royal decrees , and of Article CARDINAL of the same legislative decree .", "Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL make municipalities responsible for purchasing and supplying the furniture of primary and middle schools . LAW specifies that each classroom must have a crucifix and LAW that each classroom must have a portrait of the king and a crucifix . Article CARDINAL of legislative decree no . CARDINAL stipulates that provisions not included in the single text remain in force , \u201c with the exception of provisions contrary to or incompatible with the single text , which are repealed \u201d .", "By a decision of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) , ORG declared the question as to constitutionality manifestly inadmissible , on the ground that it was in reality directed towards texts which , not having the status of law , but only that of regulations ( the above - mentioned ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , could not form the subject of a review of constitutionality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application . After ruling that LAW of DATE and LAW of DATE were still in force and emphasising that \u201c the principle of the secular nature of the ORG [ was ] now part of the legal heritage of LOC and the western democracies \u201d , it held that the presence of crucifixes in ORG - school classrooms , regard being had to the meaning it should be understood to convey , did not offend against that principle . It took the view , in particular , that although the crucifix was undeniably a religious symbol , it was a symbol of NORP in general rather than of ORG alone , so that it served as a point of reference for other creeds . It went on to say that the crucifix was a historical and cultural symbol , possessing on that account an \u201c identity - linked value \u201d for the NORP people , in that it \u201c represent[ed ] in a way the historical and cultural development characteristic of [ GPE ] and in general of the whole of LOC , and [ was ] a good synthesis of that development \u201d . ORG further held that the crucifix should also be considered a symbol of a value system underpinning LAW . It gave the following reasons :", "\u201c ... CARDINAL . At this stage , the ORG must observe , although it is aware that it is setting out along a rough and in places slippery path , that NORP , and its older brother PERSON \u2013 at least since PERSON and certainly in the ORG interpretation \u2013 have placed tolerance towards others and protection of human dignity at the centre of their faith .", "Singularly , NORP \u2013 for example through the well - known and often misunderstood \u201c Render unto PERSON the things which are PERSON 's , and unto ... \u201d \u2013 through its strong emphasis placed on love for one 's neighbour , and even more through the explicit predominance given to charity over faith itself , contains in substance those ideas of tolerance , equality and liberty which form the basis of the modern secular ORG , and of the NORP ORG in particular .", "CARDINAL Looking beyond appearances makes it possible to discern a thread linking the Christian revolution of DATE to the affirmation in LOC of the right to liberty of the person and to the key elements in the Enlightenment ( even though that movement , historically speaking , strongly opposed religion ) , namely the liberty and freedom of every person , the declaration of the rights of man , and ultimately the modern secular ORG . All the historic phenomena mentioned are based to a significant extent \u2013 though certainly not exclusively DATE on the NORP conception of the world . It has been observed \u2013 judiciously \u2013 that the rallying call \u201c liberty , equality , fraternity \u201d can easily be endorsed by a NORP , albeit with a clear emphasis on the third word .", "In conclusion , it does not seem to be going too far to assert that , through the various twists and turns of NORP history , the secular nature of the modern ORG has been achieved at a high price , and was prompted in part , though of course not exclusively so , by a more or less conscious reference to the founding values of NORP . That explains why in LOC and in GPE many jurists belonging to the NORP faith have featured among the strongest supporters of the secular ORG . ...", "CARDINAL The link between NORP and liberty implies a logical historical coherence which is not immediately obvious \u2013 like a river in a karst landscape which has only recently been explored , precisely because for most of its course it flows underground \u2013 partly because in the constantly changing relations between GPE it is much easier to see the numerous attempts by the Churches to meddle in matters of ORG , and vice versa , just like the frequent occasions on which NORP ideals have been abandoned , though officially proclaimed , in the quest for power , or on which governments and religious authorities have clashed , sometimes violently .", "CARDINAL NORP Moreover , with the benefit of hindsight , it is easy to identify in the constant central core of NORP faith , despite the inquisition , despite anti - Semitism and despite the crusades , the principles of human dignity , tolerance and freedom , including religious freedom , and therefore , in the last analysis , the foundations of the secular ORG .", "CARDINAL By studying history carefully , from a suitable distance , not from up close , we can clearly perceive an affinity between ( but not the identity of ) the \u201c hard core \u201d of NORP , which , placing charity above everything else , including faith , emphasises the acceptance of difference , and the \u201c hard core \u201d of LAW , which , in a spirit of solidarity , attaches value to the freedom of all , and therefore constitutes the legal guarantee of respect for others . The harmony remains , even though around those cores DATE both centred on human dignity \u2013 there have been numerous accretions of extraneous elements with the passage of time , some of them so thick as to obscure the core , particularly the core of NORP . ...", "CARDINAL It can therefore be contended that in the present - day social reality the crucifix should be regarded not only as a symbol of a historical and cultural development , and therefore of the identity of our people , but also as a symbol of a value system : liberty , equality , human dignity and religious toleration , and accordingly also of the secular nature of the State \u2013 principles which underpin our LAW .", "In other words , the constitutional principles of freedom have many roots , which undeniably include NORP , in its very essence . It would therefore be something of a paradox to exclude a NORP sign from a public institution in the name of secularism , CARDINAL of whose distant sources is precisely the NORP religion .", "CARDINAL NORP This court is admittedly not unaware of the fact that , in the past , other values have been attributed to the symbol of the crucifix , such as , at the time of LAW , the sign of NORP understood as the ORG religion , and therefore used to ORG and consolidate power and authority .", "The court is well aware , moreover , that it is still possible DATE to give various interpretations of the sign of the cross , and above all a strictly religious meaning referring to NORP in general and ORG in particular . It is also aware that some pupils attending ORG schools might freely and legitimately attribute to the cross values which are different again , such as the sign of an unacceptable preference for CARDINAL religion in relation to others , or an infringement of individual freedom and accordingly of the secular nature of the ORG , or at the extreme limit a reference to temporal political control over a ORG religion , or the inquisition , or even a free catechism voucher tacitly distributed even to non - believers in an inappropriate place , or subliminal propaganda in favour of NORP creeds . Although all those points of view are respectable , they are ultimately irrelevant in the present case . ...", "CARDINAL It must be emphasised that the symbol of the crucifix , thus understood , now possesses , through its references to the values of tolerance , a particular scope in consideration of the fact that at present NORP State schools are attended by numerous pupils from outside ORG , to whom it is relatively important to transmit the principles of openness to diversity and the refusal of any form of fundamentalism \u2013 whether religious or secular \u2013 which permeate our system . Our era is marked by the ferment resulting from the meeting of different cultures with our own , and to prevent that meeting from turning into a collision it is indispensable to reaffirm our identity , even symbolically , especially as it is characterised precisely by the values of respect for the dignity of each human being and of universal solidarity . ...", "CARDINAL In fact , religious symbols in general imply a logical exclusion mechanism , as the point of departure of any religious faith is precisely the belief in a superior entity , which is why its adherents , the faithful , see themselves by definition and by conviction as part of the truth . Consequently , and inevitably , the attitude of the believer , faced with someone who does not believe , and who is therefore implicitly opposed to the supreme being , is an attitude of exclusion . ...", "CARDINAL NORP The logical mechanism of exclusion of the unbeliever is inherent in any religious conviction , even if those concerned are not aware of it , the sole exception being NORP \u2013 where it is properly understood , which of course has not always been and still is not always the case , not even thanks to those who call themselves NORP . In NORP even the faith in an omniscient god is secondary in relation to charity , meaning respect for one 's fellow human beings . It follows that the rejection of a non - NORP by a NORP implies a radical negation of NORP itself , a substantive abjuration ; but that is not true of other religious faiths , for which such an attitude amounts at most to the infringement of an important precept .", "CARDINAL NORP The cross , as the symbol of NORP , can therefore not exclude anyone without denying itself ; it even constitutes in a sense the universal sign of the acceptance of and respect for every human being as such , irrespective of any belief , religious or other , which he or she may hold . ...", "CARDINAL It is hardly necessary to add that the sign of the cross in a classroom , when correctly understood , is not concerned with the freely held convictions of anyone , excludes no one and of course does not impose or prescribe anything , but merely implies , in the heart of the aims set for education and teaching in a publicly run school , a reflection \u2013 necessarily guided by the teaching staff \u2013 on NORP history and the common values of our society legally retranscribed in the LAW , among which the secular nature of the ORG has pride of place . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed to the Consiglio di Stato ( Supreme Administrative Court ) , which confirmed that the presence of crucifixes in ORG - school classrooms had its legal basis in LAW of DATE and LAW of DATE and , regard being had to the meaning that should be attached to it , was compatible with the principle of secularism . On that point it found in particular that in GPE the crucifix symbolised the religious origin of values ( tolerance , mutual respect , valorisation of the person , affirmation of one 's rights , consideration for one 's freedom , the autonomy of one 's moral conscience vis - \u00e0 - vis authority , human solidarity and the refusal of any form of discrimination ) which characterised NORP civilisation . In that sense , when displayed in classrooms , the crucifix could fulfil DATE even in a \u201c secular \u201d perspective distinct from the religious perspective to which it specifically referred \u2013 a highly educational symbolic function , irrespective of the religion professed by the pupils . The PERSON held that the crucifix had to be seen as a symbol capable of reflecting the remarkable sources of the above - mentioned values , the values which defined secularism in the ORG 's present legal order .", "In its judgment ( no . CARDINAL ) dated DATE the PERSON gave the following reasoning :", "\u201c ... ORG has accepted on a number of occasions that secularism is a supreme principle of our constitutional order , capable of resolving certain questions of constitutional legitimacy ( among numerous judgments , see those which concern the provisions relating to the compulsory nature of religious teaching in school or the jurisdiction of the courts over cases concerning the validity of marriages contracted according to canon law and recorded in the registers of marriages ) .", "This is a principle which is not proclaimed in express terms in our LAW , a principle which is rich with ideological resonances and has a history full of controversy , but one nevertheless which has a legal importance that can be deduced from the fundamental norms of our system . In reality the ORG derives this principle specifically from ORG , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE of the LAW .", "The principle uses a linguistic symbol ( \u201c secularism \u201d ) which indicates in abridged form certain significant aspects of the above - mentioned provisions , the content of which established the operating conditions under which this symbol should be understood and function . If these specific operating conditions had not been established , the principle of \u201c secularism \u201d would remain confined to ideological conflicts and could be used only with difficulty in a legal framework .", "In that framework , the operating conditions are of course determined by reference to the cultural traditions and the customs of each people , in so far as these traditions and customs are reflected in the legal order , and this differs from CARDINAL nation to another . ...", "In the context of this court and the problem placed before it , namely the legitimacy of displaying the crucifix in classrooms , on the part of the competent authorities acting pursuant to the regulations , what has to be done in practice is the simpler task of verifying whether that requirement does or does not infringe the content of the fundamental norms of our constitutional order , that give form and substance to the principle of \u201c secularism \u201d which now characterises the NORP ORG and to which ORG has referred on a number of occasions .", "Quite clearly , the crucifix is in itself a symbol that may have various meanings and serve various purposes , above all for the place in which it has been displayed .", "In a place of worship the crucifix is properly and exclusively a \u201c religious symbol \u201d , since it is intended to foster respectful adherence to the founder of the NORP religion .", "In a non - religious context like a school , used for the education of young people , the crucifix may still convey the above - mentioned values to believers , but for them and for non - believers its display is justified and possesses a non - discriminatory meaning from the religious point of view if it is capable of representing and evoking synthetically and in an immediately perceptible and foreseeable manner ( like any symbol ) values which are important for civil society , in particular the values which underpin and inspire our constitutional order , the foundation of our civil life . In that sense the crucifix can perform \u2013 even in a \u201c secular \u201d perspective distinct from the religious perspective specific to it \u2013 a highly educational symbolic function , irrespective of the religion professed by the pupils .", "Now it is obvious that in GPE the crucifix is capable of expressing , symbolically of course , but appropriately , the religious origin of those values \u2013 tolerance , mutual respect , valorisation of the person , affirmation of one 's rights , consideration for one 's freedom , the autonomy of one 's moral conscience vis - \u00e0 - vis authority , human solidarity and the refusal of any form of discrimination DATE which characterise NORP civilisation .", "Those values , which have pervaded traditions , a way of life , the culture of the NORP people , form the basis for and spring from the fundamental norms of our founding charter \u2013 contained in the \u201c Fundamental Principles \u201d and the first part \u2013 and especially from those which ORG referred to and which delimit the form of secularism appropriate to ORG .", "The reference , via the crucifix , to the religious origin of these values and their full and complete correspondence with NORP teachings accordingly makes plain the transcendent sources of the values concerned , without calling into question , rather indeed confirming the autonomy of the temporal power vis - \u00e0 - vis the spiritual power ( but not their opposition , implicit in an ideological interpretation of secularism which has no equivalent in the LAW ) , and without taking anything away from their particular \u201c secular \u201d nature , adapted to the cultural context specific to the fundamental order of ORG and manifested by it . Those values are therefore experienced in civil society autonomously ( and not contradictorily ) in relation to religious society , so that they may be endorsed \u201c secularly \u201d by all , irrespective of adhesion to the creed which inspired and defended them .", "As with any symbol , one can impose on or attribute to the crucifix various contrasting meanings ; one can even deny its symbolic value and make it a simple trinket having artistic value at the most . However , a crucifix displayed in a classroom can not be considered a trinket , a decorative feature , nor as an adjunct to worship . Rather , it should be seen as a symbol capable of reflecting the remarkable sources of the civil values referred to above , values which define secularism in the ORG 's present legal order . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
