He thought about earlier incidents of flashing and obscene behaviour and got scared of the consequences . He charged after her and performed the acts described in the indictment . ORG considers that his acts had their origin in an explosion of emotion , combined with a sexual attraction to PERSON According to forensic expert statements , it is established that by the time she was on the road she had already suffered lethal injury . It has not been fully ascertained whether she was dead when he dragged her from the road to the bushes in a field . Here he lifted a CARDINAL stone and hit her at least twice on the head . There was blood on both sides of the stone .

By a judgment of DATE ORG , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , rejected the appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP The majority , Mr Justice Skogstad , joined by PERSON and PERSON , stated :", "\u201c Appeal concerning the procedure", "Apart from the fact that neither the wording of LAW nor the preparatory works suggest that an authorisation to pass judgment on civil claims in spite of a defendant \u2019s acquittal should depend on the reasons for the latter , I can not find any real grounds to support this proposition . Although it is evident that \u2013 in cases like the CARDINAL at hand \u2013 it must be a condition for passing judgment on compensation for non - pecuniary damage that it is clear on the balance of probabilities that the act has been committed [ handlingen er beg\u00e5tt ] , the evidentiary standard is not as strict as that applying to a criminal conviction . I have problems seeing that in cases where the defendant has been acquitted , because it has not been found proven that the act has been committed [ handlingen er beg\u00e5tt ] , should be placed in a somewhat different position than where there are other grounds for acquittal \u2013 as for example where the conduct is not punishable , where it has not been established that the defendant acted with the required criminal guilt , where the defendant is not found to be liable under the criminal law , or where there is self - defence or any other ground of exemption from criminal liability . Should it not be permissible to adjudicate civil claims in criminal proceedings in which the defendant has been acquitted because it has not been established that he has committed the act that was the factual basis for the indictment [ beg\u00e5tt handlingen ] , the consequence would be that the claim must be brought up in separate civil proceedings . However such a lawsuit is both time consuming and expensive [ and ] .... the aggrieved party \u2019s possibilities to pursue such claims will depend on his economic situation . I find no attraction in such a solution .", "I should also point out that if one were to operate a rule whereby an acquittal on the ground that it has not been established that the defendant has committed the act that was the factual basis for the indictment [ har beg\u00e5tt den handling han er tiltalt for ] is treated differently than acquittals on other grounds , it might give rise to difficulties in instances where the case has been tried by a ORG sitting with a jury , as in the present case . A verdict of conviction requires that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL jurors have answered \u2018 yes\u2019 to the question of guilt and , regardless of whether the jury has answered \u2018 yes\u2019 or \u2018 no\u2019 , no grounds are given for the verdict . In most instances one will have more or less well - founded perceptions , but never total certainty , as to why the jury has answered in the negative .", "On several occasions the courts have had to deal with the question whether a civil claim can be adjudicated in spite of the defendant having been acquitted in the criminal case . On those occasions , where the question has been submitted to ORG or ORG , it has not been a condition for dealing with the civil claim in connection with the criminal case that the [ criminal ] court ... has found it established that the defendant has committed the act that was the factual basis for the indictment [ har beg\u00e5tt den handling tiltalen gjelder ] . ...", "In my opinion , in the light of existing legal sources , there can not be any doubt that , under LAW DATE , it is not a condition for adjudicating a civil claim in connection with criminal proceedings that the court in [ the latter ] proceedings has found it proven that the defendant has committed the act that was the factual basis for the indictment [ har beg\u00e5tt den handling saken gjelder ] . ...", "Consequently , no procedural errors were committed when ORG , in spite of [ the applicant \u2019s ] acquittal in the criminal proceedings , passed judgment on the civil claim . ...", "Appeal concerning the application of the law", "The appellant has based his appeal on law on the argument that it would be contrary to the presumption of innocence in LAW if the court , after the defendant has been acquitted in the criminal case , passes judgment for compensation for non - pecuniary damage in the same case . In any event , he submits , it must be contrary to the presumption of innocence to give such reasoning on the compensation matter as done by ORG . ...", "[ LAW ] is primarily addressed to judges in criminal proceedings and its main message is that judges shall not prejudge the defendant as having committed the crime of which he is indicted , or that there shall be no prejudgment through statements by public authorities ( see Frowein / Peukert : \u201c Europ\u00e4ische Menschenrectskonvention \u201d , \u201c ORG \u201d , CARDINAL . edition ( DATE ) page CARDINAL and following , and ORG : PERSON \u2013 Human Rights ( DATE ) , page CARDINAL ) . Both according to legal doctrine and the case - law of the GPE institutions , the provision may also have importance after the criminal case has been terminated ( see LAW : \u201c PERSON of the ORG \u201d ( DATE ) , pages CARDINAL - CARDINAL with further references to practice ) . For instance , in the GPE v. GPE judgment , the ORG stated that if the defendant has been acquitted by a final judgment , the courts might not , in a subsequent case concerning compensation for unjust prosecution , base its judgment on the fact that the accused is guilty . However , how far these points of view go is somewhat uncertain . While it is the accused and the ORG who are parties to the compensation proceedings regarding unjust prosecution , such proceedings can be seen as a prolongation of the criminal case . In my view , however , the presumption of innocence can hardly apply to civil proceedings between the accused and the person who has been prejudiced or has suffered damage by the act [ which was ] the factual basis for a criminal charge in respect of which the defendant has been acquitted [ en handling som siktede er frifunnet for ] . In any event , it must be evident that LAW can not bar the courts \u2013 in a civil case ( for example a case for compensation ; on dismissal or parental responsibilities ) DATE from establishing facts regarding the course of events in question , even if it should disclose the occurrence of a criminal offence and even if the person against whom the claim is directed has been acquitted of the offence in a preceding criminal case ( see , inter alia , PERSON : \u201c ORG med kommentarer \u201d \u201c The ORG with comments \u201d ( DATE ) , page CARDINAL , and ORG , op . cit . page CARDINAL ) . Should the presumption of innocence apply at all to civil proceedings between the aggrieved party and the accused , it must at any rate be a condition for finding a violation of LAW that a decision establishing criminal guilt has been taken . Were the court in a civil case not permitted to base its decision on the fact that the person acquitted of a criminal offence , has in fact committed the act [ beg\u00e5tt handlingen ] , the acquittal would deprive the victim , or the person who has suffered damage , of the possibility to obtain a judicial review of claims that he or she might have against the accused . This would , in my view , be contrary to the fundamental right to a fair hearing in LAW .", "[ The applicant ] has argued that a distinction must be made between cases where a civil claim is being reviewed together with the criminal matter and cases where the claim is examined in separate civil proceedings . I do not agree that there is any basis for making such a distinction . The system whereby civil claims may be raised in the criminal case is based upon well - founded considerations of procedural economy and ... can also benefit the defendant . In criminal proceedings the accused is , as a main rule , entitled to defence counsel paid for by the ORG and , bearing in mind also the thoroughness with which evidence is presented in a criminal trial , the accused , in the event of a civil claim being determined together with the criminal matter , enjoys particular protection against being wrongly judged . If the defendant is acquitted in the criminal case but is ordered to pay compensation for non - pecuniary damage , the accused will be left with a feeling of not having been \u2018 totally ORG . But it should not matter to him whether the compensation claim is determined in connection with the criminal proceedings or in ensuing civil proceedings .", "...", "As mentioned above , the presumption of innocence under LAW can , in my view , hardly be applied in a civil case between the person acquitted and the aggrieved party . Bearing in mind the nature of this case , I do not , however , find it necessary to take a definite stance on this question , ORG did not in my view base its decision in the compensation claim on a finding of criminal guilt , which under any circumstance must be a condition for a violation of LAW . ...", "The appellant has pleaded that the courts in practice will have difficulties in applying different evidentiary standards to criminal conviction and compensation . Moreover , he has submitted that when , as in this case , it is a requirement for making an award of compensation for non - pecuniary damage that it is clear on the balance of probabilities that the the accused has committed the act [ beg\u00e5tt handlingen ] , the evidentiary requirement is so close to that applying to a criminal conviction that this in itself contributes to casting a suspicion of criminal liability . I have difficulties in understanding these arguments . The fact that the evidentiary requirements are different in various relations is nothing special for cases such as the present one . ... [ I]t is based on the general view that a qualified probability is required in order for the court to ground its decision on a fact that is strongly incriminating ... The fact that a stricter standard of proof applies in order to protect the interests of the defendant can not entail a breach of the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The minority of the court , Mr Justice Flock joined by Mr Chief Justice PERSON in the main reasoning and the conclusion , expressed the following opinion :", "\u201c I am ... of a different opinion as to the main issue in the case . In my view , the appeal on procedure ... should be upheld . When a court primarily has found that the defendant was not the perpetrator of \u2018 the act with which the case is concerned\u2019 , the court may not , in my opinion , in the same judgment order the defendant to pay compensation for non - pecuniary damage on the ground that he nevertheless has performed the same \u2018 act\u2019 .", "Under the DATE Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 as noted by the first voting ORG \u2013 it was authorised to pass judgment on civil claims even though the defendant had been acquitted of the criminal act . ... The former [ limitation in this respect ] was repealed . However , in my view , the far reaching application of the new rule made by ORG in this case does not necessarily follow from the statute or from former ORG rulings . Besides , it would be more consistent with the presumption of innocence under LAW , now incorporated into NORP law , if the court did not both brand the defendant as the perpetrator of the act under civil law and acquit him of criminal liability in the same judgment . Against this background , the best solution would be to interpret the possibility DATE and the corresponding duty for the courts DATE under the statute to adjudicate civil claims in the criminal case with the qualification that the most extreme consequences should be avoided .", "Below I shall deal with each of the reasons for my position .", "When the DATE Code improved the possibilities of the aggrieved party to have civil claims determined in connection with the criminal proceedings , some instances were mentioned in the preparatory work of claims that could be adjudicated even though the defendant had been acquitted . This was , inter alia , where the purpose , intent or gross negligence required by LAW had not been proved but where it had been shown that the defendant had displayed sufficient negligence to be held liable to pay compensation . However , the preparatory works did not include ... those instances where the defendant had been acquitted because it had not been established that he or she had performed the act as cited in the indictment . This would be the most frequent reason for acquittal in , for example , cases of aggravated sexual assault against minors ... and where compensation for non - pecuniary damage is a recurrent issue .", "Special questions arise in this kind of acquittal . A conviction and an order to pay compensation are not only different legal consequences based on different aspects of the case , but also , in the same case and on the same evidence , the court assesses the evidence twice with the possibility of reaching different results . Legally , this would be justified by the fact that the evidentiary requirements for criminal conviction are stricter than those with respect to an order to pay compensation for non - pecuniary damage . However , this situation is so special DATE and was excluded under the former legislation DATE that one would expect that the subject be discussed , or at least be explicitly mentioned , in the preparatory works . As this was not the case , it can be deduced that the legislators probably did not have such cases in mind , or at least did not regard them as essential when the rules were amended in DATE .", "It is undoubtedly correct that ORG \u2013 and other courts in our country \u2013 in certain rulings have noted that an award can be made for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage even if the defendant has been acquitted in the same case . ... However , ... I can hardly see ... that there is such an established case - law in this area as to prevent certain limitations being made in the interpretation of the law .", "As regards the presumption of innocence in LAW , it is somewhat uncertain how far this requirement extends in NORP law . ...", "When taking a decision in the present case , one is faced with the need to strike a balance between , on the one hand , the accused \u2019s interests and , on the other hand , those of the victim and his or her closest relatives . It is important to take into account the fact that the DATE revision was intended to strengthen the victim \u2019s position . However , I find that an acquittal for having committed the incriminated act DATE and in particular an act of murder \u2013 must clearly appear from the judgment . This is such a prominent consideration that it should in my view be predominant in the interpretation of the law .", "...", "In following this reasoning , some issues of delimitation will arise as to when the court should abstain from determining civil claims together with an acquittal . The limitation , that is implied in my opinion , on the possibility to adjudicate such claims is inter alia that it must be ascertainable that the acquittal is based on a finding that there is insufficient evidence to show that the accused committed the offence of which he / she was charged . This might be a problem in all cases before ORG where the question of guilt is decided by a jury , without a reasoned verdict . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP criminal law there are CARDINAL basic conditions that must be met in order to establish criminal liability :", "( CARDINAL ) the accused has committed the proscribed act or omission ( actus reus ) which is contrary to a provision of LAW or to a special statutory penal provision in force at the time when the act was committed ;", "( CARDINAL ) there are no exonerating circumstances ( e.g. self - defence ) ;", "( CARDINAL ) the accused has acted with intent ( mens rea ) , unless otherwise expressly stated in the relevant penal provision ; and", "( CARDINAL ) the accused was of sound mind at the time of the commission of the offence .", "CARDINAL .

NORP Under the NORP jury system , when an accused is acquitted the jury is not entitled to disclose whether any of its members held a different opinion , and no records are kept which could disclose that a negative answer as to the applicant \u2019s guilt was not unanimous . The criminal system knows CARDINAL conclusions in a criminal case \u2014 guilt or acquittal ( see Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .
