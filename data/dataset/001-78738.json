AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the Court by Mr T. Fritzsche , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr F. Trauttmansdorff , Head of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the owner of premises of QUANTITY registered in the land register under the no . CARDINAL and situated in GPE . At the time of the events , this property was designated as building land and used for agricultural purposes .", "In DATE the applicant requested the parcelling of this property and the issuing of a permit for a building site ( GPE ) with GPE ( Magistrat ) as she wished subsequently to sell the land . As GPE did not deal with this request , the applicant filed , on DATE , a request for the transfer of jurisdiction ( PERSON ) with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE ORG , referring to a building prohibition ( Bausperre ) concerning the applicant \u2019s premises issued under GPE ( GPE ) on DATE , dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Landesregierung ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG ) arguing in essence that the building prohibition was unlawful . On DATE the ORG declined to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint . By decisions of ORG the building prohibition was twice extended until DATE .", "Meanwhile , in DATE , ORG decided a new building scheme ( GPE ) under the Upper Austria Planning Act ( Raumordnungsgesetz ) which designated a strip of land of QUANTITY of the applicant \u2019s property as public traffic area ( \u00f6ffentliche ORG ) . In DATE this scheme became final . In the respective proceedings the applicant had been consulted and had filed objections . However , she did not challenge the building scheme and its underlying legislation by lodging an individual request for review ( PERSON ) before ORG .", "The city intended to use the concerned strip of land for the urban construction project ORG PERSON , a planned new city area in line with the principles of eco - solar and modern construction . Part of the applicant \u2019s land should serve , more specifically , the future extension of the street running along the applicant \u2019s property which was to be developed into a broad avenue constituting the middle rib of this new city area .", "The applicant offered GPE to buy the concerned land for CARDINAL NORP Schillings ( ORG ) ( PERCENT ( ORG ) ) per square meter . She argued that this price corresponded to the amount offered by building companies for the parcelled land before the issuing of the building prohibition . In DATE GPE declined this offer . It proposed to acquire the part of the applicant \u2019s property designated as public traffic area at the price of CARDINAL ORG ( CARDINAL ORG ) per square meter and to pay later , namely at the time of the actual extension of the street , the differences between this amount and the then prevailing market value for public traffic areas . Furthermore , should the applicant build on her remaining property , she was to transfer another part of her property to GPE without compensation .", "The applicant declined this offer and , on DATE , instituted civil proceedings against GPE . She submitted that the building prohibition concerning her property had been unlawful and had hindered her to sell it . Furthermore , by the designation of parts of her property as public traffic area , GPE had expropriated the area de facto and hindered her to dispose of these and the adjacent plots . As GPE had not realised the town planning project and declined to buy the concerned premises for an adequate price , the applicant claimed CARDINAL ORG ( PERCENT ORG ) in damages ( NORP ) for foregone interests . She further based her claim on the title of unlawful enrichment ( GPE ) .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It found that the building prohibition had been lawful . Furthermore , GPE was under no obligation to buy the concerned premises . Thus , the applicant attempted to obtain compensation for the re - designation of her land although this was not possible according to constant NORP case - law .", "The applicant appealed and argued that GPE acted unfairly because , on the one hand , it had put itself in the position of the exclusive potential purchaser and , on the other hand , had not offered any adequate conditions for a sale . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "The applicant filed an extraordinary appeal with ORG . She submitted inter alia that , in violation of her right to peaceful enjoyment of her property , she had been restricted in the use of it without any compensation . She referred to the case PERSON and PERSON GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , the restriction had lasted for a long time , it was not foreseeable and it had not been checked when and whether the town planning project would finally be realised . She requested ORG to institute proceedings with ORG to review the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of GPE as they did not provide any compensation for loss of value suffered by the issuing of a building prohibition or re - designation of land .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s extraordinary appeal . It found that the building prohibition and the subsequent modification of the building scheme were lawful . Furthermore , it was a normal feature that after re - designation the value of the concerned property changed and there was no reason for special treatment in the present case . GPE was under no obligation to enter into a contract with the applicant . If parts of the applicant \u2019s property should be used for the construction of the planned road and the parties could not reach an agreement on the sale of these premises , the rules concerning expropriation were to be applied in which proceedings the amount of compensation was to be determined . Finally , ORG refused to institute proceedings reviewing the constitutionality of LAW as it found this to be irrelevant for the proceedings at issue . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "In a meeting with the Mayor of PERSON and the municipal councillor ( NORP ) competent for town planning matters in DATE , the applicant was informed that the planned course of the avenue in question might be changed . Until now no further steps have been taken by the competent authorities in this matter . The concerned land is still used for agricultural purposes .", "In GPE land planning is governed by ORG ( Raumordnungsgesetz ) . Building schemes ( GPE ) and any amendments thereto are regarded as decrees ( Verordnung ) . Decrees are addressed to the general public . The lawfulness of decrees can only be reviewed by ORG ) . A person , who is affected by a decree , may seize ORG with an individual request for review of the lawfulness of a decree , if the decree has direct consequences for the situation of the person without it being necessary that an administrative decision is taken ( PERSON , Article CARDINAL of LAW ) . There is no specific period of time within which such request may be filed .", "Section CARDINAL of the Upper Austria Land Planning Act provides that the GPE has to compensate a land owner for the loss of value caused by the issuing or changing of a building scheme , if his or her parcel is not designated as building land although it is suited for building purposes and is surrounded by building land . Furthermore , it has to compensate a land owner the disbursements he / she made to prepare his / her land for building if , because of subsequent changes of the respective building scheme , building later becomes impossible .", "Section CARDINAL of GPE ( GPE ) , in the version applicable to the present case , stipulated that ORG can apply by decree a building prohibition ( Bausperre ) on an area if the respective area zoning plan or the building scheme is to be amended and the issuing of a building prohibition is in the interests of an appropriate and controlled building development . The building prohibition was valid until the establishment of the area zoning plan or building scheme , for a maximum period of DATE . It could , in principle , be extended twice for DATE by decree of ORG . LAW did not provide any compensation to the land owner concerned in case a building prohibition was issued .", "Proceedings concerning the expropriation of land and subsequent compensation are regulated in CARDINAL of GPE . These proceedings are instituted upon request of the concerned authority ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
