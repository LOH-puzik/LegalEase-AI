{"ITEMID": "001-22634", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FRA", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "PAPON v. FRANCE (No. 1)", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant [ Mr PERSON ] is a NORP national , born in DATE and currently in custody in FAC in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , both of ORG . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Director of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of aiding and abetting crimes against humanity and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE ORG ruled that he had forfeited his right to appeal on points of law because he had failed to surrender to custody . Those proceedings gave rise to application no . CARDINAL .", "From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant was held in ORG , initially in the prison hospital and then under normal conditions in a cell in the prison \u2019s solitary - confinement wing . On CARDINAL DATE , on an application by his lawyer , who considered the conditions in which the applicant was being held unacceptable ( particularly the very low temperature in his cell ) , the prison authorities decided to transfer him to FAC in GPE on the ground that he could be provided there with conditions of detention that were more suitable . Since then the applicant has been serving his sentence at FAC .", "The applicant is currently DATE and had a triple heart bypass operation in DATE . During the investigation of his first application for a pardon on medical grounds ( see below ) , it was noted in a preliminary expert report of DATE prepared for ORG at ORG , that the applicant \u2019s heart condition had deteriorated and the recommendation was made that he be immediately transferred to a specialist cardiology unit where it could be decided whether he was in urgent need of a pacemaker . He was fitted with a pacemaker on DATE .", "On DATE PERSON , the head of ORG at ORG prepared a medical certificate at the applicant \u2019s request that read as follows :", "\u201c I , the undersigned , certify that I admitted Mr PERSON to hospital in ORG of which I am the head from DATE .", "I will not go back over the patient \u2019s previous heart problems , for which he was hospitalised and provided with other medical certificates in DATE and DATE .", "The patient is currently suffering from increasingly incapacitating angina . For DATE now he has found it difficult to climb the stairs ( CARDINAL floors ) leading up to the visiting room . This difficulty in getting up stairs , which amounts almost to disablement , has prompted him to stop taking walks , especially as he now has chest pains from time to time even when resting .", "Clinical examination", "The patient \u2019s general condition is good ; he is perfectly aware and lucid . His heart sounds are regular and his blood pressure reading is DATE . He has some oedema of the lower limbs , probably linked to the reduced intake of diuretics , which he does not tolerate well urologically or in terms of hydration . He gets extremely tired when he is dehydrated . His pacemaker is working well and is due to be checked in a few days\u2019 time .", "Laboratory test results", "None of the tests reveals any renal , haematological , or electrolyte anomalies or any biochemical evidence of inflammation . The patient \u2019s anticoagulant treatment is well balanced .", "Scanning results", "X - rays of the lungs are normal . A cardiac ultrasound scan shows that the left ventricle is functioning normally without any pulmonary hypertension . A cardiac scintigram before and after injection of thallium after TIME shows that the CARDINAL low - uptake areas in the posterior and anterior regions are myocardially viable , meaning that the strain on the myocardium remains partly reversible . Neither an exercise test ( even mild ) nor a coronarography were carried out because of the attendant risks .", "General conclusions", "It is likely that the coronary arteries , which have undergone a triple bypass , have become less permeable ; this would explain the recurrence of angina during physical exertion .", "Although there is no congestive heart failure , the patient \u2019s progressive coronary disease means that there is still a worrying risk of his suffering a fatal heart attack and the possibility of sudden death in prison can not be ruled out , even though it is entirely possible that his heart function , which is relatively well preserved in itself , may be compatible with living a good deal longer .", "It appears obvious to us , however , that keeping this CARDINAL-year - old man with a vascular and coronary disease in prison is not likely to lessen the danger of his sudden death . \u201d", "According to the information provided by the ORG , the applicant \u2019s health is monitored by doctors and nurses from the prison \u2019s Outpatient Consultation and Treatment Unit ( ORG ) , which was set up inside the prison under LAW of DATE ( it provides a doctor \u2019s surgery , twice - DATE ORG and DATE laboratory tests and electrocardiographic check - ups ) , and by specialists consulted in hospitals outside the prison ( cardiological consultations in ORG , a period spent in ORG for a cardiovascular check - up and fitting of a pacemaker , and regular checks on the pacemaker in the same hospital ) .", "The applicant is being held in an individual cell in the prison \u2019s \u201c VIP \u201d wing . His cell is QUANTITY . m in area and is furnished with a bed , CARDINAL tables , CARDINAL cupboards , CARDINAL chairs , a television and , at the medical service \u2019s request , a medical chair and an automatic air humidifier . There is an alarm bell at the head of the applicant \u2019s bed linked to the control centre , which is permanently manned by a warder . In CARDINAL corner there is a lavatory and a washbasin ; the shower is not far away and has been equipped with a seat as it does not have any grab bars . The applicant himself is responsible for cleaning and tidying his cell , with the assistance of another inmate once a week if need be .", "The applicant finds it difficult to reach the exercise yard because of the steps leading to it . He has been given permission to walk along the prison landings twice a day . He has regular visits from his family and his lawyers .", "On DATE CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s lawyers applied to the NORP President for a pardon on medical grounds . The application was refused on DATE after an expert medical report had been obtained .", "On DATE the lawyer submitted a further application for a pardon on medical and humanitarian grounds , which was refused on DATE after a medical examination by CARDINAL experts on DATE . Neither of these expert reports was communicated to the applicant .", "On DATE , DATE and DATE the applicant sent letters to the governor of ORG , in which he complained that the light was turned on several times a night at TIME ( letters of DATE and DATE ) and that a warder had refused to allow him to take a walk on the landings ( letter of DATE ) .", "NORP law does not set an upper age - limit for pre - trial detention or the serving of prison sentences .", "However , an offender \u2019s state of health ( in which age may be an aggravating factor ) may be taken into account when an application for a pardon from the NORP President is being considered ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW ) or when it is being decided whether to grant parole under LAW , which provides :", "\u201c Parole is designed to encourage the rehabilitation of convicted prisoners and prevent them from reoffending . Convicted persons serving one or more prison sentences may be granted parole if they have made serious efforts to readjust to society , particularly if they can show that they have engaged in occupational activities or regularly attended an education or vocational training course or have taken part in a work experience scheme or had a temporary contract of employment with a view to their social integration , or that their presence is essential to the life of their family , or that they have to undergo treatment or that they have made efforts to compensate their victims .", "Subject to LAW , parole may be granted if the length of the sentence already served by the prisoner is at least equal to that remaining to be served . However , recidivists covered by ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW may only be granted parole if the length of the sentence already served is at least double that remaining to be served . In the cases provided for in this paragraph , the qualifying period may not exceed DATE ... \u201d", "In criminal law , advanced age is not a bar to prosecution , pre - trial detention or a prison sentence in ORG member GPE .", "Age may , however , be taken into account , together with other factors such as state of physical or mental health , when sentences are being determined . In GPE , in particular , the courts may , in respect of offences punishable with a prison sentence of DATE , substitute another penalty for the custodial penalty in view of the character and the general circumstances of the accused . In CARDINAL countries a sentence of life imprisonment can not be imposed on a person above a certain age : CARDINAL in GPE and GPE and CARDINAL in GPE ; in GPE life imprisonment is reduced to DATE for people over DATE .", "As far as the execution of sentences is concerned , age is rarely taken into account per se but in conjunction with state of health . In GPE , however , prison sentences for minor offences are not executed if the convict is over DATE ( in the case of serious offences , sentences are served in a semi - open prison ) . CARDINAL countries ( GPE and GPE ) make provision for courts to substitute house arrest for a prison sentence where the convicted person is partially disabled and over CARDINAL ( in GPE ) or DATE ( in GPE ) . NORP law also provides for the enforcement of a sentence to be deferred or suspended in the event of illness .", "In a number of countries age is taken into account for DATE which is generally granted sooner once the prisoner has reached a given age , namely CARDINAL in GPE and GPE , and CARDINAL for men and CARDINAL for women in GPE DATE and for pardons .", "There are also several countries in which prisoners are not required to work beyond a certain age ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
