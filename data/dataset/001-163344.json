The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE he started military service in the armed forces of GPE . Medical records dated DATE drafted by a panel of doctors in his military unit in ORG , stipulated that at that time he had problems communicating with others and was autistic , though he had a normal memory and level of intelligence . He was diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia , which he had developed during military service . On those grounds , he was released from military service .", "CARDINAL . Having returned from the army to GPE , by DATE he had been treated in psychiatric institutions CARDINAL times . In DATE he was diagnosed with residual and then paranoid schizophrenia .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant attempted suicide by setting himself on fire . He was admitted to the trauma unit of a hospital .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to a prosecutor \u2019s request for information , on DATE ORG ( GPE rajono psichikos sveikatos centras ) confirmed that the applicant had been attending there since DATE , and continued to be treated there for schizophrenia . In DATE episodes of the applicant \u2019s illness became more frequent . That year the applicant attempted to commit suicide ; he did not accept that he was ill . He was admitted to ORG ( PERSON psichiatrijos ligonin\u0117 ) , where he spent DATE before being released for outpatient care at his own request . Since DATE the applicant stopped attending PERSON Psychiatric Health Centre and taking his medication , because he firmly refused any consultations with the psychiatrists . He would also submit numerous complaints to various authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother asked a prosecutor to initiate proceedings with a view to her son being declared legally incapacitated . According to her , his mental illness started when he was in the NORP army . She and her husband lived in a house separate from him in neighbouring GPE . By DATE the applicant \u2019s condition reached such a stage that he was afraid to leave his apartment or let his parents in , and he did not take care of himself . He even attempted to take his own life by setting himself on fire .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the prosecutor sent the request by the applicant \u2019s mother to ORG , together with an extract from the applicant \u2019s medical records . It was noted that his schizophrenia had worsened and that he had become a danger to himself . He was thus in need of help from others . It was indispensable to ascertain whether there was a basis for declaring him legally incapable , if psychiatrists established that he could not understand or control his actions . The prosecutor relied on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE of the Code of Civil Procedure , and LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered an expert examination to ascertain ( i ) whether the applicant was suffering from mental illness , ( ii ) whether he could understand his actions and ( iii ) whether he could take part in court proceedings . His mother was to be informed of that decision .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the applicant in person and scrutinised his medical records , on DATE a psychiatrist concluded that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia . He was also very mistrusting and had strong feelings of persecution . Psychiatrists took into account the letters by his mother to ORG and the prosecutor to the effect that the applicant did not take care of his DATE needs , and had social and health issues and suicidal thoughts . The psychiatrist thus established that the applicant could not correctly understand or control his actions , and noted that he \u201c could not take part in court proceedings , could not be questioned , and court documents could not be served on him \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a CARDINAL page form sent to ORG on DATE , GPE social services ticked a box to say that they \u201c agreed \u201d with the prosecutor \u2019s request for the applicant to be declared incapacitated . They also indicated that they would not take part in the court hearing , which was scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE attempts were made by ORG to personally serve the applicant with the summons concerning the forthcoming hearing for his legal incapacitation and care . The copy of the summons indicated that it had not been served because , according to his next door neighbour , the applicant was mentally ill and opened the door to no one .", "CARDINAL . At a public hearing on DATE ORG , relying on Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , granted the prosecutor \u2019s request for the applicant to be declared incapacitated , on the grounds that he could not understand or control his actions . The prosecutor and the applicant \u2019s mother were in attendance . The applicant \u2019s mother testified about her son \u2019s history of mental illness . She also stated that he had recently been living away from his parents , but could not take care of himself , did not pay maintenance fees for his apartment , and would not go out or take his medication .", "The ruling stipulated that it could be appealed against within DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that , given the fact that it had not actually been possible to serve the summons on the applicant , the decision of CARDINAL DATE had only been sent to the interested parties in the case , that is to say the applicant \u2019s mother , the prosecutor and social services .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant drafted what appears to be a response to the prosecutor \u2019s request of DATE to incapacitate him . Therein he mentions that he received a copy of the prosecutor \u2019s request on DATE . The letter appears essentially to be a complaint about his treatment in psychiatric hospitals and diagnosis with schizophrenia . He concludes by stating that because of obvious forgery of his medical examination results and clear bias on the part of the prosecutor , the applicant refused to undergo medical examination in GPE . A stamp on the letter indicates that it was received by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having established that the applicant was legally incapacitated , by a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG appointed the applicant \u2019s mother as his guardian and the administrator of his property . The decision was taken at a public hearing in which she , a prosecutor and a representative from social services took part . The ruling stipulated that the applicant had not taken part because of ill - health .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was forcibly admitted to ORG on DATE , after showing signs of agitation and behaving aggressively towards his parents . The police and some firemen had to break down the door of his apartment to get to him . On DATE he consented to treatment until DATE , when he refused any further treatment in writing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) to provide legal aid to the applicant , who was to be forcibly hospitalised . It was granted DATE , and a lawyer was appointed to represent him .", "DATE , in the presence of a psychiatrist and the appointed lawyer , ORG granted a request by the psychiatric hospital for the applicant to be forcibly hospitalised . The court noted that the applicant was absolutely uncritical of his own behaviour , and that his state of mind at that time meant that he posed a danger to himself and others . The ruling was final and not appealable . It indicated that on DATE the applicant had been declared legally incapacitated , and that on DATE his mother had been appointed as his guardian .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted to the court an extract from the applicant \u2019s medical records , which indicated that he had been at ORG from DATE until DATE . The doctor indicated in that record that a copy of the court ruling of CARDINAL DATE had been given to the applicant . It is not clear when that was done .", "The Government submitted that the court decision of CARDINAL DATE had been handed to the applicant by his treating doctor on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant signed a document certifying that his treatment plan from ORG had been explained to him and that he agreed to follow it .", "CARDINAL . Having been released from the psychiatric hospital , on DATE the applicant approached ORG . In his application he wrote that by a ruling of DATE he had been declared legally incapacitated , and that he would need the time - limit for appealing against it to be renewed . He also indicated that in DATE his mother had been appointed his guardian and the administrator of his property . He noted that he had not known about the CARDINAL decisions until DATE , upon his admission to ORG . He also expressed a wish to appeal against them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the request as having no prospect of success . It noted that the applicant fell into the category of people entitled to legal aid ; however , given that the proceedings for his incapacitation had been terminated , his request for legal aid was clearly irrelevant .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the decisions the applicant wished to challenge had been taken in DATE . Given that he had not requested legal aid until DATE , he had missed the deadline for appeal against those decisions . Representing him in such proceedings would have had no prospect of success .", "CARDINAL . As to the appointment of the applicant \u2019s mother as his legal guardian , ORG indicated that he had given no grounds for doubting her ability to perform her duties as guardian and the administrator of his property . Lastly , it observed that guardianship could be revoked at the request of a prosecutor or social services . Given that the applicant himself could not apply to the court with such a request , there was no legal basis for providing him legal assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that ORG give him a copy of the court rulings regarding his incapacitation and the appointment of his legal guardian .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG wrote to the applicant informing him that those court rulings would not be given to him , because his mother had been appointed as his legal guardian and the administrator of his property .", "CARDINAL . In their observations on the admissibility and merits of the case , sent to ORG , the Government noted that at that time the applicant had lived separately in his own apartment . He had been unemployed but had received disability pension . His guardian had helped him with DATE chores . He had also received regular outpatient treatment at FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office that in DATE he had been forcibly admitted to ORG and made to undergo medical treatment . The applicant asked that a pre - trial investigation be opened regarding his allegations .", "CARDINAL . By a final ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the applicant \u2019s complaints about events in DATE were unfounded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
