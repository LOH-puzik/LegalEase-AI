GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE . She is represented before the ORG by the law firm ORG , practising in GPE in GPE .", "The applicant used to work as a bank employee . Since her retirement at DATE on DATE , she receives a pension under the statutory old - age insurance scheme ( gesetzliche GPE ) , an additional pension under a supplementary insurance scheme for bank employees ( GPE ) and an additional DATE allowance granted by her former employer ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE the applicant married a retired civil servant of DATE who - since DATE - received a pension under the old - age pension scheme for civil servants ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE the applicant 's husband died . According to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG Pension Act ( Beamtenversorgungsgesetz , see relevant domestic law below ) a civil servant 's widow , whose marriage has been celebrated after the civil servant has entered retirement , is not allowed to a regular survivor 's pension ( PERSON ) , but to a maintenance allowance ( Unterhaltsbeitrag ) , which is meant to ensure that her overall DATE income reaches at least the amount of the regular survivor 's pension . It is calculated as follows : From the amount of the regular survivor 's pension the competent authorities deduce the widow 's own earned income ( ORG ) and income replacements ( Erwerbsersatzeinkommen ) , with the exception of an allowance ( Freibetrag ) which amounts to PERCENT of the minimum survivor 's pension .", "In the applicant 's case the competent authority deduced the applicant 's whole other income , including her pension , her supplementary pension and the additional payments from the original widow 's allowance . After adding the above - mentioned allowance , this resulted in a remaining DATE payment of CARDINAL DEM [ CARDINAL ORG ] .", "On DATE , following administrative proceedings , the applicant lodged a claim with ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) with the aim to be awarded a higher maintenance allowance . She argued that her own supplementary pension and additional payments could not be regarded as income replacements within the meaning of LAW and could therefore not be taken into account when calculating her DATE allowance as a widow . She further pointed out that under the statutory old - age insurance scheme , additional payments deriving from a private insurance scheme did not diminish the survivor 's pension , and that the same should apply under ORG Pension Act .", "On DATE ORG rejected her claim .", "On DATE , following the applicant 's appeal , ORG ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) quashed ORG judgment and fully granted the applicant 's claim , finding that the term \u201c income replacement \u201d had to be interpreted in the same way as in the relevant provisions on the statutory old - age insurance scheme and therefore did not include the additional payments received under a private pension scheme .", "On DATE ORG ) quashed ORG judgment and rejected the applicant 's claim . According to that court , the relevant provisions had to be interpreted autonomously , because they differed considerably . The statutory old - age insurance only pays pensions and no allowances to widows . Considering the wording as well as the aim of the provision , which was to secure that the widow 's overall income did reach at least the amount of the regular survivor 's pension , that court found that all of the applicant 's DATE income , including her claims under private pension schemes , had to be taken into account . ORG pointed out that the widow 's allowance was merely meant to prevent hardships arising from the fact that the applicant was not entitled to a regular survivor 's pension . It would be in contradiction to this aim not to take payments under a private pension scheme into account .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint . She argued that ORG had misinterpreted the relevant provisions and that its judgment violated her property rights and her right to equal treatment under LAW . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to seek a preliminary ruling by ORG of ORG as to whether the national legal practice on the assessment of income replacements complied with Community law , in particular with the law on equal treatment .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to entertain the applicant 's complaint , finding that it was up to the lower instance courts to interpret the law and that the decision in question did not violate any of the applicant 's rights under LAW . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "Pensions of civil servants and their surviving spouses are governed by ORG , the relevant provisions of which at the material time read as follows :", "", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c A civil servant 's widow ... receives a survivor 's pension .
