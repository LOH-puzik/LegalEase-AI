The applicant is a non - governmental organisation which promotes tolerance and condemns all types of racially motivated discrimination . It was established under NORP law and registered in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the youth wing of ORG ( PERSON ) held a demonstration in the train station square in the town of GPE concerning a public initiative to support the prohibition of the building of minarets in GPE . After the event the party published a report on its website , including the following excerpts :", "\u201c In his speech in front of the ORG government building [ GPE ] , GPE , the president of the local branch of ORG [ \u201c the PERSON \u201d ] , emphasised that it was time to stop the expansion of ORG . With this demonstration , ORG wanted to take an extraordinary measure in an extraordinary time . The NORP guiding culture ( \u201c schweizerische NORP \u201d ) , based on NORP , can not allow itself to be replaced by other cultures , GPE added .

He added further : \u2018 The NORP guiding culture , based on NORP , can not allow itself to be replaced by other cultures .

( Verbal racism ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the popular initiative against the construction of minarets was accepted in a referendum and a constitutional amendment banning the construction of new minarets was introduced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON filed a claim for the protection of his personality rights with ORG ( PERSON ) . He applied , firstly , to have the applicant organisation withdraw the entry in question from its homepage and , secondly , for it to be replaced with the court \u2019s judgment . The applicant organisation replied that the title of the Internet entry had to be considered as a value judgment , which could only lead to an infringement of personality rights if it entailed an unnecessarily hurtful and insulting attack on the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s action . It held that the publication of the impugned article on the applicant \u2019s website had been justified since it had related to a political discussion on a matter of public interest .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , on CARDINAL DATE the Thurgau Cantonal High Court ( Obergericht des Kantons Thurgau ) reversed the first - instance judgment . It held that classifying GPE \u2019s speech as \u201c verbally racist \u201d had been a mixed value judgment , which could lead to an infringement of personality rights if it was based on untruths . ORG concluded that GPE \u2019s speech itself had not been racist . It therefore ordered that the impugned article be removed from the applicant \u2019s website and replaced with the court \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant organisation filed an appeal with ORG ( PERSON ) , reiterating its argument that any interference with GPE \u2019s personality rights had been justified . CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s main aims was to fight racism and to inform the public about hidden and open racist behaviour . Its website stated that public comments would be documented , even if they did not fall within the scope of the prohibition of racial discrimination enshrined in LAW . To fulfil its role of watchdog in that sense , it published articles and interviews concerning current events relating to racism and antiSemitism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant organisation \u2019s appeal , finding as follows ( unofficial translation ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The classification of and commenting on a person \u2019s statements as \u2018 verbal ORG violate that person \u2019s honour . Not only in the context of the criminal offence of racial discrimination ( LAW ) but more generally , the term in question is , in the eyes of the average reader , capable of deliberately debasing the person whose comments have been classified as \u2018 verbally ORG , accusing him or her of behaviour which is frowned upon by society in the form of an act which is , at the very least , questionable in constitutional terms ( cf . LAW III CARDINAL E. CARDINALb / aa p. CARDINAL , CARDINAL III DATE p. CARDINAL and CARDINAL E. CARDINAL.CARDINAL p. CARDINAL ) . The appellant referred to the respondent \u2019s speech at the public demonstration of CARDINAL DATE on its website ... freely accessible on the Internet , commenting on the term \u2018 verbal ORG . It thereby violated the respondent \u2019s honour as part of his personality within the meaning of LAW of LAW . The infringement is unlawful if it is not justified by the consent of the injured party , by an overriding private or public interest or by law ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The main point in dispute is whether the appellant can rely on an overriding interest in classifying the respondent \u2019s comments as \u2018 verbal ORG .", "CARDINAL . The case - law on press statements , on which the appellant relies , distinguishes between statements of facts on the one hand and value judgments on the other , and can be summarised as follows : ...", "CARDINAL . The appellant assigned the respondent \u2019s statements to the section entitled \u2018 verbal ORG ... That was a mixed value judgment . It contains a substantive core and , at the same time , a value judgment . In order to justify the substantive core , it is necessary to examine whether the respondent \u2019s comments were indeed racist .", "CARDINAL . The term \u2018 ORG is understood as \u2018 a ORG which states that \u2018 certain races or nations are superior to others in terms of their cultural GPE , and , on the other hand , a \u2018 certain attitude , manner of thinking and acting towards people of ( certain ) other races or nations\u2019 ( cf . GPE , FAC in Six Volumes , GPE . CARDINAL , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . The adjective \u2018 verbal\u2019 describes racism as \u2018 [ occurring ] with words , with the help of NORP ( cf . GPE , FAC in Six Volumes , GPE . DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . Verbal racism is , therefore , no longer merely a certain attitude , but an attitude in the instant case which was expressed publicly through language ( as opposed to , for example , through deeds ) . \u2018 Verbal racism\u2019 could therefore mean racial discrimination in the criminal sense , as the respondent claims . What is decisive , however , as the second - instance court correctly stated , is that the mere demonstration of a difference between CARDINAL individuals or groups does not constitute racism . Racism begins where the difference amounts simultaneously to denigration of the victims and where the highlighting of differences is ultimately only a means to represent the victims negatively and to show disregard for their dignity .", "CARDINAL . The statements that led the appellant to conclude that there had been \u2018 verbal ORG are the core phrases \u2018 it is time to stop the spread of ORG ... The NORP guiding culture ( \u201c schweizerische NORP \u201d ) , based on NORP , can not let itself be repressed by other cultures ... A symbolic sign , such as the prohibition of minarets , is therefore an expression of the preservation of one \u2019s own identity\u2019 .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . In his public speech , the respondent expressed his opinion on the prohibition of minarets , which , in the opinion of ORG , would not be compatible with freedom of religion and non - discrimination . He has , in that connection , compared his own beliefs ( \u2018 ORG ) with foreign beliefs ( \u2018 Islam\u2019 ) , delimited them ( \u2018 to halt\u2019 , \u2018 preserving one \u2019s own identity\u2019 ) and described his own as worthy of protection and defence ( \u2018 NORP leading ORG , \u2018 not to be repressed\u2019 ) . For the average listener , that does not result in the blanket denigration of the followers of ORG or show fundamental contempt for NORP .", "CARDINAL . On the whole , it can not be said that the comments made by the respondent , as understood by the average listener , could be described as \u2018 verbally ORG . Therefore , the substantive core does not apply and the assessment is not acceptable . It shows the respondent in the wrong light . Therefore , the mixed value judgment , which infringed personality rights , can not be justified by any overriding interest within the meaning of LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . That assessment can not be altered by the fact that in the general interest of informing the public , there is an increased degree of publicity and a reduced level of protection for personality rights for people who engage in a political debate , such as the respondent in the campaign for the minaret initiative ( see BGE CARDINAL II CARDINAL PERSON CARDINALb p. CARDINAL , CARDINAL II CARDINAL E. CARDINALb p. CARDINAL ) . That special framework allows for the assessment of breaches of honour on a somewhat different scale , but it can neither justify the dissemination of untruths nor the publication of value judgments that do not appear to be justified with regard to the underlying facts . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
