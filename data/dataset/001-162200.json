The justice of the peace then held as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant \u2019s ] actions constitute a violation of the regulations on static demonstrations in that no notification had been made [ to the competent authority ] about the possibility of staging a demonstration ... Thus , this demonstration was held without legal grounds . The court takes into account that the applicant \u2019s presence next to the object being picketed , together with other people , directly discloses the expression of opinions and attitudes , and thus takes the form of a group public event , namely a static demonstration . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought re - examination of the case on appeal by ORG of GPE . On DATE the court heard the applicant and upheld the judgment of the justice of the peace , concluding that the applicant had taken part in a public event held without prior notification to the competent authority ; on DATE she had been apprised of the hearing to be held before the justice of the peace but had failed to sign the summons .", "CARDINAL .
