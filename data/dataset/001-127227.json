The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The general pension system of the former GPE ( hereinafter \u201c the SFRY \u201d ) was set up on the principle of territoriality . This meant that each federal entity , namely the CARDINAL GPE ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) and CARDINAL autonomous provinces ( GPE and GPE ) , had their own pension funds , which were independent of federal government and were responsible for the collection of contributions and the payment of pensions to all individuals who had been working on the territory of the respective republic or province . The pension system was based on the \u201c pay - as - you - go \u201d model and the principle of inter - generational solidarity , which was essentially based on the payment of mandatory contributions during DATE of employment and then receiving the pension by instalments once retired .", "CARDINAL . The military pension system differed , in that it was centralised at the federal level . On DATE under , at the relevant time , ORG ( Zakon o mirovinskom i invalidskom osiguranju vojnih obveznika ) a federal pension fund was established for employees of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) with its registered headquarters in GPE . Contributions to this fund were paid from the federal budget , and the fund then paid pensions to military pensioners , irrespective of the location of their military service or where they lived once retired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) declared GPE independent of GPE , and on DATE all relations between GPE and ORG were dissolved . ORG was incorporated into the NORP legal system by ORG , ORG and ORG in GPE as LAW Act ( Zakon o preuzimanju saveznih zakona iz oblasti mirovinskog i invalidskog osiguranja i doplatka za djecu vojnih osiguranika koji se u PERSON primjenjuju kao republi\u010dki zakoni ) , enacted by the ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

LAW laid down conditions for recognition of the right to advance payments of pensions ( akontacija ) to former ORG military personnel , provided that they had terminated their military service prior to DATE , but had not obtained pension rights prior to that date , and that they met all the necessary conditions to be granted a pension under ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

GPE ( Republi\u010dki fond mirovinskog i invalidskog osiguranja radnika PERSON ; hereinafter \u201c LOC ) was assigned to make the necessary arrangements under LAW .", "CARDINAL .

Under that decree all residents of GPE who had been granted pensions in other GPE of the former SFRY , except GPE , which had at the time also dissolved its relations with the SFRY federal government , were entitled to payment of their pensions by GPE . ORG was ordered to pay pensions from the collected contributions which GPE was not paying to pensioners residing in other GPE of the former SFRY due to the ending of financial transfers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG enacted ORG ( Zakon o ostvarivanju prava iz mirovnskog i invalidskog osigurnja pripadnika biv\u0161e PERSON ) , which set aside the DATE Decree ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and part of the DATE transitional legislation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Under this Act GPE assumed responsibility for payment of ORG military pensions obtained prior to CARDINAL DATE , and for the granting of pensions to ORG military personnel whose service in GPE had terminated prior to DATE .", "CARDINAL . Former ORG military personnel who had obtained pension rights under the former SFRY pension regime prior to CARDINAL DATE had the right to have their pension paid by GPE if their pension from the former federal fund was no longer being paid . CARDINAL further conditions were laid down : residence in GPE and that the person concerned was not being prosecuted for certain criminal offences against GPE , listed in section CARDINAL of the LAW . ORG was tasked with enforcement of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Act was set aside by LAW ( Zakon o mirovinskom osiguranju ) , which was enacted on DATE and came into force on DATE . In the period relevant to this case it was amended several times ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . LAW regulated the compulsory pension insurance scheme on the basis of the principle of inter - generational solidarity ( section LAW ) . It established ORG ( PERSON mirovinsko osiguranje ) , which was tasked with the management of pension affairs ( section CARDINAL ) thus replacing PERCENT ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Accordingly , ORG was tasked with the collection of pension contributions and payment of pensions and with the observance of obligations under international agreements on pensions ( section CARDINAL ) . Under LAW payment of pensions abroad was possible only under either an international agreement or a reciprocal agreement ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Pension Insurance Act also provided that funds for payment of pensions to ORG military pensioners should be secured in the ORG \u2019s budget , and that the necessary contributions should be paid to ORG on a DATE basis ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . For all NORP nationals LAW recognised pensionable years of employment in the period prior to PERCENT under ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) as pensionable years of employment ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . By an amendment of CARDINAL DATE the pensions of , inter alia , ORG military pensioners were reduced and ORG was ordered to set the amended levels of their pensions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE and the then GPE ( later GPE and GPE ) signed ORG ( PERSON o socijalnom osiguranju ) , hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , which came into force on DATE . ORG listed the relevant domestic legislation to which it was applicable , namely health insurance and health protection legislation ; pension and invalidity insurance legislation ; legislation on work - related accidents and work - related illnesses ; and unemployment benefits . It was applicable to all persons in the CARDINAL countries who had rights and duties under the relevant domestic legislation . The right to payment of a pension abroad existed irrespective of the place of residence of the pension beneficiaries within CARDINAL of the contracting GPE . ORG was designated the competent liaison authority in GPE concerning all pension issues ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , after the dissolution of the former SFRY , GPE maintained a dual pension system for civilian and military pensioners , and stopped paying ORG military pensions to pensioners residing in GPE . Only in DATE was a pension reform carried out in GPE which had the effect of integrating the military pension fund into the civilian pension and invalidity insurance fund . On an unspecified date the NORP authorities informed the NORP pension authorities of this change . They also indicated that they would pay what formerly were military pensions to pensioners residing abroad under the relevant treaties on social insurance or reciprocal agreements .", "CARDINAL .

Annexe E to LAW dealt with pensions . It was based on the principle of acquired rights , in that rights acquired under CARDINAL system must be acknowledged and respected in another . Article CARDINAL established the said principle in respect of the pension rights acquired under the former republics\u2019 pension regime ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , while LAW dealt with military pensions under the former federal regime ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The latter provision stipulated that the ORG which had recognised the right to payment of the pensions to former SFRY military personnel should continue to pay pensions to all its nationals , irrespective of their place of residence . In cases where a person was a national of CARDINAL republic of the former SFRY , the pension should be paid by the ORG where that person resided . This pension payment regime differed from the regime established for civilian pensions under LAW to LAW , which provided that the ORG which had recognised the pension rights and which paid the pensions should continue with the payments entirely irrespective of the nationality or place of residence of the pension beneficiaries .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant served as a military officer in the ORG DATE , when he retired . On DATE the SFRY federal pension fund for retired ORG employees authorised the applicant \u2019s entitlement to a military pension . At that time the applicant was residing in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG recognised the applicant \u2019s entitlement to a military pension , as established under the former ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It found that the applicant had NORP citizenship and a place of residence in GPE , and that the competent domestic authorities had not instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant for any offence against GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting ex officio , ORG established the amount of the applicant \u2019s pension under LAW . The pension was to be paid to the applicant as long as the necessary requirements existed .", "CARDINAL .

According to the applicant , in DATE he visited his son in GPE , GPE , and decided to stay with his son for a longer period .

He submitted evidence of residence in GPE and details of his bank account in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stopped payment of the applicant \u2019s pension . It found that ORG did not cover ORG military pensions , and that there was no reciprocal agreement with GPE in that respect , as required under the relevant domestic law , for the payment of pensions abroad . Pension payments were stopped with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG of ORG ( GPE vije\u0107e NORP vije\u0107a PERSON zavoda za mirovinsko osiguranje ) arguing that there was no legal ground for his pension to be stopped . He contended that when his pension rights had been recognised under LAW he had obtained the right to receive the pension from ORG , and that his status was therefore equal to that of other old - age pensioners . He also complained that he had not been able to obtain his pension in GPE , since payment of his pension there had been stopped on the grounds that his entitlement to a pension had been recognised in GPE . Finally , the applicant explained that the pension which had been stopped was his only income .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an administrative action in ORG ( ORG ) complaining that ORG had failed to decide on his appeal against the first - instance decision of the GPE office of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In his administrative action the applicant reiterated that by recognising his entitlement to a pension under LAW he had the same status as all other pensioners in GPE who had been receiving pensions from ORG . He explained that he had submitted his request for payment of the pension to GPE under ORG and that the stopping of his pension had been unlawful . The applicant also complained that he and his wife had no other financial means now that his pension had been discontinued .", "CARDINAL . ORG invited the applicant to substantiate his action further on DATE . The applicant complied with this request , and submitted a supplemented administrative action on DATE , reiterating his previous arguments .", "CARDINAL .

ORG of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the first - instance decision of ORG of ORG as ill - founded on DATE , endorsing the reasoning of the first - instance decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE office of ORG resumed payment of the applicant \u2019s pension . It found that the applicant had changed his place of residence to GPE , and that all other requirements under the relevant domestic law had been met .

On DATE ORG invited the applicant to explain whether he wanted to pursue his administrative action of DATE , since ORG of ORG had decided on his appeal in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed ORG that he wanted to pursue his administrative action . Moreover , he indicated that he wanted to extend it to the second - instance decision of ORG of ORG of DATE . The applicant again argued that the change of his place of residence had not warranted in any respect , legal or factual , stopping the payment of his pension , and that therefore depriving him of his pension for the period DATE and DATE had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s administrative action as ill - founded . The relevant part of the decision reads :", "\u201c The reasoning of the impugned decision , and of the first - instance decision , is based on the fact that the plaintiff \u2019s request for payment of the recognised military pension which he had obtained as a ORG employee prior to CARDINAL DATE had been refused , because he had a place of residence in GPE ... and ORG between GPE and GPE did not cover military pensions of former ORG military personnel obtained through the military [ pension ] fund prior to CARDINAL DATE . GPE and GPE and GPE there is no reciprocal agreement in payment of military pensions , so the [ plaintiff \u2019s ] pension can not be paid in GPE ...", "In view of what is discernible from the case file this court finds that there has been no breach of law to the detriment of the plaintiff .", "In this specific case the reasons adduced by the respondent body and the first - instance body are valid . This court finds that it was correctly held by the respondent body that it was not possible for military pensions to be paid abroad ... since it was impossible under either the LAW pension legislation . Payment of a pension abroad is possible under an international treaty or on the basis of a reciprocal agreement , which is not the situation in the present case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) . He contended that there had been no legal ground for stopping payment of CARDINAL of his pension instalments , and that his change of place of residence should not have had any adverse effects on his pension rights . In his view this had created an inequality before the law .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant supplemented his constitutional complaint on CARDINAL DATE , reiterating his previous arguments .", "CARDINAL .
