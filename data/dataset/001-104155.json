The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant became the holder of a specially protected tenancy ( stanarsko pravo ) of a flat in GPE . He lived in the flat with his family until DATE when GPE was occupied . He then fled the occupying forces and went to live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant found a job in ORG and , as an internally displaced person , on DATE he was awarded a flat there on a temporary basis . In DATE the competent authorities terminated his status as an internally displaced person . Following a civil action by PERSON , the applicant was forced to leave the flat in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed DATE following the military operation \u201c Storm \u201d by which GPE regained control of almost its entire territory in DATE on DATE he had visited FAC , where he had found the flat in respect of which he had the specially protected tenancy uninhabitable and in a very bad state of repair . This had been confirmed on DATE by the findings of ORG . He further submitted that he had immediately commenced rebuilding work on the flat with a view to moving into it .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE , while the applicant was working in PERSON , the local authorities , accompanied by the police , entered into the flat , made a list of personal belongings , changed the locks and gave the keys of the flat to a certain PERSON , a local policeman . DATE the Commission for Temporary Takeover and Use of Certain Property of GPE ( PERSON za privremeno preuzimanje i kori\u0161tenje odre\u0111ene imovine PERSON \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) issued a decision letting the flat to GPE and his family on a temporary basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his wife made a request for the purchase of the flat to GPE . In doing so they relied on ORG , which entitled holders of specially protected tenancies of flats in social or state ownership to purchase their flats under favourable conditions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They received no reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG razvitka i obnove ) adopted a decision letting the flat to GPE and his family for their use .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE issued a decision allowing the applicant to live in the flat . The applicant has been living in the flat ever since .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant and his wife brought a civil action against the ORG in ORG ( PERSON ) with a view to obtaining a judgment which would allow them to purchase the flat in accordance with ORG . On DATE the court dismissed their action . It found that the applicant 's flat was owned by the ORG and not GPE and that therefore the plaintiffs should have directed their request for its purchase to the ORG and not to the GPE . Following an appeal by the applicant and his wife , on DATE ORG ( PERSON ORG ) quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case . It found , inter alia , that the fact that the plaintiffs had made their request for the purchase of the flat to the GPE and not the ORG should not have been held against them .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings , on DATE ORG again dismissed the plaintiffs ' action . The court first determined , as a preliminary issue , whether the plaintiffs had retained their specially protected tenancy of the flat in GPE , the existence of that tenancy being a statutory precondition for buying the flat under LAW . In this respect the court found that : ( a ) the plaintiffs had left the flat in DATE and ( b ) in the period DATE , when Vojni\u0107 was liberated , and DATE , when the flat was awarded to GPE , they had been living in PERSON and had only occasionally visited and used the flat in GPE . That being so , the court concluded that since they had not used their flat permanently for living purposes , the plaintiffs ' specially protected tenancy had been terminated . Consequently , they were not entitled to purchase the flat in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the plaintiffs ' appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment , which thereby acquired the force of res judicata . Relying on the finding of the first - instance court that the plaintiffs had left the flat in DATE and had not used it in the period DATE and DATE , the second - instance court expressly referred to section CARDINAL of the Act on the Lease of Flats on GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in holding that the plaintiffs ' specially protected tenancy had been terminated ex lege because after the LAW 's entry into force they had not used their flat for a period DATE . As a result , they had no right to purchase it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint alleging , inter alia , infringements of his constitutional rights to equality before the law , to property and to a fair hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) dismissed the constitutional complaint and served its decision on the applicant on DATE . The relevant part of ORG decision reads as follows :", "\u201c The [ ordinary ] courts established that the flat at issue in FAC had on DATE been awarded to [ GPE ] for temporary use , and that the plaintiffs had in the period DATE and DATE only occasionally visited the flat , which could not be considered use of the flat . The first - instance court therefore dismissed the plaintiff 's action in accordance with section CARDINAL of the Act on the Lease of Flats on GPE , according to which the specially protected tenancy of flats located in the previously occupied , now liberated , territory of GPE was to be terminated by the operation of law if the holder of the specially protected tenancy left the flat and did not use it for DATE following the LAW 's entry into force . The court established that the complainant had not used the flat DATE and DATE and that his specially protected tenancy had [ therefore ] been terminated by the operation of law . Given that his specially protected tenancy had been terminated by the operation of law after DATE , the complainant could no longer be considered the holder of a specially protected tenancy and therefore was not entitled to make a request for the purchase of the flat .", "ORG found that the first - instance judgment was correct and had been rendered on the basis of correctly and completely established facts and the correct application of the substantive law .", "Assessing the arguments raised in the constitutional complaint in the light of LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW , ORG has found that the complainant 's constitutional right to equality before the law was not breached by the contested judgments .", "The legal views expressed in the contested judgments are based on the correct application of the relevant substantive law and on the constitutionally acceptable interpretation of that law . The Constitutional Court finds that the [ ordinary ] courts , relying on the facts established in the proceedings , gave reasons for their views expressed in the contested decisions , which undoubtedly do not result from the arbitrary interpretation or application of the relevant substantive law .", "...", "The content of the constitutional right to a fair hearing guaranteed by LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW is limited to procedural guarantees of a fair hearing . Therefore , assessing the arguments raised in the constitutional complaint in the light of that constitutional right , as well as other constitutional rights guaranteed by LAW , the ORG examines possible procedural breaches in the proceedings before the courts and , on that basis and looking at the proceedings as a whole , ascertains whether the proceedings were conducted in a manner which secured a fair hearing to the complainant .", "Having examined the contested decisions and the first - instance case file , the Constitutional Court finds that the complainant 's constitutional right guaranteed by LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW has not been breached .", "As regards the complainant 's argument concerning the breach of the constitutional right of ownership guaranteed by LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW , it has to be noted that ORG , on the basis of LAW , protects the right of ownership at the constitutional level in such a manner that it prevents restriction or taking of that right by the state authorities , unless a restriction or taking is provided for by law .", "The Constitutional Court finds that the contested judgments are based on the relevant legislation and are well reasoned , and that the complainant 's right of ownership guaranteed by LAW has not been breached . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
