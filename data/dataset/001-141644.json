LATVIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection dismissed (Article 35-3-b - No significant disadvantage);Preliminary objection dismissed (Article 35-1 - Exhaustion of domestic remedies);No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing;Equality of arms)", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and ORG , a commercial company incorporated under NORP law , signed a deed of acknowledgement of debt before a notary . Under the terms of the deed the applicant declared that he had borrowed MONEY ( ORG ) from ORG and undertook to repay that sum with interest by DATE . The document also contained choice of law and jurisdiction clauses according to which it was to be governed \u201c in all respects \u201d by NORP law and the NORP courts were to have non - exclusive jurisdiction to hear any disputes arising out of it .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG brought proceedings against the applicant in LOC ( PERSON , GPE ) , alleging that he had not repaid the above - mentioned debt and requesting that he be ordered to pay the debt together with interest .", "CARDINAL . NORP In an order of DATE ORG summoned the applicant to appear before it . Since the applicant was not resident in GPE , ORG made an ex parte application to the same court on DATE seeking a fresh order enabling a summons to be served on the applicant outside the country , requiring him to appear within DATE from the date of service . In that connection the claimant company \u2019s lawyer produced an affidavit declaring that the defendant was habitually resident at an address in FAC in GPE and that a summons could be served on him at that address . The applicant , for his part , contended that it had been objectively impossible for him to receive the summons at that address , which was simply the address at which he had signed the loan contract and the deed of acknowledgement of debt in DATE and was not his home or business LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be summoned at the above - mentioned address . It summoned him to appear or to come forward within DATE of receiving the summons , failing which all future announcements concerning the case would be posted on the court \u2019s noticeboard . An affidavit produced by an employee of the firm of lawyers representing ORG showed that , in accordance with the court order , the summons was sent by recorded delivery on DATE to the address in FAC in GPE . It also showed that the legal firm had received a post office slip confirming that the letter had been received by the applicant on DATE ( the NORP national holiday and therefore a non - working day in GPE ) . The applicant claimed never to have received the summons .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant did not appear , ORG , ruling in his absence on DATE , ordered him to pay the claimant CARDINAL or the equivalent in NORP pounds ( ORG ) , plus interest at an DATE rate of PERCENT of the aforementioned amount from DATE until payment of the debt . The applicant was also ordered to pay costs and expenses in a gross amount of ORG MONEY , plus interest at an DATE rate of PERCENT . According to the judgment , which was finalised on DATE , the applicant had been duly informed of the hearing but had not attended . The judgment itself made no reference to the fact that it was final or to the available remedies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG applied to ORG ( PERSON pils\u0113tas ORG priek\u0161pils\u0113tas tiesa , GPE ) seeking recognition and enforcement of the judgment of CARDINAL May CARDINAL . In its request the company also sought to have a protective measure applied . It stated that the applicant was the owner of real property in Garkalne ( a district of GPE ) which , according to the land register , was already mortgaged to a bank . Accordingly , fearing that the applicant might seek to evade enforcement of the judgment , it asked ORG to place a charge on the property and record it in the land register . Lastly , it requested that the applicant be ordered to pay the costs . In its request the company gave as the applicant \u2019s place of residence an address in \u010c. Street in GPE which differed from the address previously notified to the NORP court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adjourned examination of the company \u2019s request , pointing to a series of substantive defects which the company was given DATE to correct . In particular , the court noted that the company had omitted to explain why it had referred to the address in \u010c. Street , when the applicant \u2019s presumed address , as it had featured hitherto in the case , was in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted a corrigendum in which it explained , among other points , that according to the data taken from the register of residents ( ORG re\u0123istrs ) , the address in \u010c. Street was the applicant \u2019s officially declared home address . As to the address in FAC , the company \u2019s representatives had assumed it to be the applicant \u2019s actual residence .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG ruled that the corrigendum submitted by ORG was insufficient to remedy all the defects in its request . The court declined to examine the request and sent it back to the company . The latter lodged an appeal with ORG ( PERSON apgabaltiesa ) , which set aside the impugned order on DATE and remitted the case to ORG , instructing it to examine the request for recognition and enforcement as rectified by the corrigendum of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE issued without the parties being present , ORG allowed ORG request in full . It ordered the recognition and enforcement of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE and the entry in the Garkalne municipal land register of a charge on the property owned by the applicant in that municipality . The applicant was also ordered to pay the costs .", "CARDINAL . It was not until DATE that the applicant learnt DATE by chance , according to his account \u2013 of the existence of both the NORP court judgment of CARDINAL DATE and the NORP court order of CARDINAL DATE . He did not attempt to challenge the NORP judgment before the NORP courts . However , he lodged a so - called ancillary appeal ( blakus s\u016bdz\u012bba ) against the above - mentioned order with ORG , while asking ORG to extend the time allowed for lodging the appeal . In that connection the applicant observed that there was nothing in the case file to indicate that he had been summoned to appear at the hearing of DATE or that he had been notified of the order issued DATE . Accordingly , the DATE period laid down by LAW should start running on DATE , the date on which he had become aware of the order in question .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request and extended the time - limit for lodging an appeal . It noted , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... It is clear from the court order of DATE that the issue of recognition and enforcement of the foreign judgment was determined in the absence of the parties , on the basis of the documents furnished by the claimant [ ORG ] . At the same time the order states that it is open to the applicant to appeal against it within DATE from the date of receipt of the copy [ of that order ] , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "The court considers the circumstances to which the applicant , P. ORG , refers , to be established , namely the fact that he did not receive the order ... of DATE until DATE , this being attested to by the reference in the list of consultations [ appended to the case file ] , and by the fact that the order , served [ on the applicant ] by the court , was returned on DATE ... It is apparent from the documents appended to the appeal that the applicant has not lived at his declared address in [ \u010c. ] Street since DATE ; this confirms ... the statement made by his representative at the hearing , according to which the applicant no longer lives at the above - mentioned address .", "Accordingly , the DATE period should ... run from the date on which the applicant received the order in question ...", "At the same time , the court does not accept the view of the representative of [ ORG ] that the applicant himself is responsible for his failure to receive the correspondence because he did not declare his home address promptly , and that the time allowed [ for lodging an appeal ] should not therefore be extended . The fact of not complying with the legislation on registration of residence is not sufficient to justify the potential consequences if the court were to refuse to allow the applicant to exercise the fundamental rights guaranteed by the ORG as regards access to the courts and judicial protection , including the right to appeal against a decision . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his grounds of appeal before ORG the applicant argued that the recognition and enforcement of the NORP judgment in GPE was in breach of ORG ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and and commercial matters ( known as the \u201c GPE I Regulation \u201d , hereafter \u201c the Regulation \u201d ) and of the relevant provisions of ORG . He submitted CARDINAL arguments in that regard .", "CARDINAL . First , the applicant observed that in accordance with LAW corresponding in substance to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , third subparagraph , of ORG ) , a judgment given in default in another Member ORG could not be recognised if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence . In the applicant \u2019s view , those provisions had been breached in his case . The applicant maintained that both the NORP lawyers who had represented the claimant company in ORG and the NORP lawyers who had represented it in the NORP courts had been perfectly aware of his business address in GPE . He observed in that connection that he had had professional dealings with the NORP lawyers , who had telephoned him and sent faxes to his office ; as to the NORP lawyers , he had met them in person . Therefore , they must all have been aware of his business address . Furthermore , the summons could have been sent to the applicant \u2019s home address in PERSON , as he had a residence there that was officially declared in accordance with the law and his property there was entered under his name in the land register , which the lawyers could have consulted . However , instead of having the summons sent to one of those addresses , which were known and accessible , the lawyers had given the courts an address where it was objectively impossible to reach him .", "CARDINAL . Second , the applicant observed that , under the terms of LAW and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sub - paragraph , of ORG , a judgment had to be enforceable in the ORG of origin in order to be enforceable in the Member ORG requested . In the instant case , there had been a threefold breach of those requirements . Firstly , the requesting party had only submitted the text of the NORP court judgment to the NORP court , and not the certificate required in accordance with ORG to the ORG . In that connection the applicant acknowledged that under LAW in which enforcement was sought could , in some circumstances , exempt the requesting party from the obligation to produce a certificate ; however , in the present case , ORG had omitted to explain whether and for what reason it considered that the requesting party could be exempted from that obligation . Secondly , the NORP judgment itself had contained no reference to its entry into force or possible remedies . Lastly , in order to be enforced in accordance with the ORG , a judgment had to be enforceable in the country of origin ; however , none of the documents produced by the company demonstrated that the judgment of CARDINAL May CARDINAL was enforceable in GPE . The applicant therefore concluded that the judgment could under no circumstances be recognised and enforced in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the merits , quashed the impugned order and rejected the request for recognition and enforcement of the NORP judgment .", "CARDINAL . F.H. Ltd. lodged an appeal against that judgment with the ORG of ORG , which examined it at a hearing on DATE . At the start of the hearing the appellant company submitted copies of several documents to the ORG , including the certificate provided for by LAW and by ORG thereto , dated DATE and signed by an acting judge of ORG . According to the certificate , the document instituting the proceedings had been served on the applicant on DATE . The last part of the certificate , intended for the name of the person against whom the judgment was enforceable , had been left blank . When asked to comment on these documents , the applicant \u2019s lawyer argued that they were clearly insufficient to render the judgment enforceable .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE the ORG quashed and annulled ORG judgment of DATE and allowed ORG claims . It ordered the recognition and enforcement of the NORP judgment and the entry in the land register of a charge on the applicant \u2019s property in Garkalne . The relevant extracts from the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ... It is clear from the documents in the case file that the GPE ORG judgment was made final . This is confirmed by the explanations provided by both parties at ORG hearing on DATE , according to which no appeal had been lodged against the judgment , and by the certificate issued on DATE ... As [ the applicant ] did not appeal against the judgment , his lawyer \u2019s submissions to the effect that [ he ] was not duly notified of the examination of the case by a foreign court are of no importance .", "Having regard to the foregoing , the ORG accepts that the judgment of ORG ( GPE ) of CARDINAL DATE should be recognised and enforced in GPE .", "Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides that a foreign judgment may under no circumstances be reviewed as to its substance ; in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , once such judgments have been recognised they are to be enforced in accordance with the conditions laid down by the same PERSON . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the ORG judgment ORG issued a writ of execution ( izpildu raksts ) on DATE . The applicant complied immediately with the terms of the writ and paid the bailiff employed by the claimant company a total of CARDINAL NORP lati ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) , comprising ORG for the principal debt and ORG in enforcement costs . He then requested that the charge on his property in Garkalne be lifted . In CARDINAL orders dated DATE the judge with responsibility for land registers ( PERSON noda\u013cas tiesnesis ) refused the request . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the ORG of ORG which , in an order of DATE , lifted the charge on the property ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
