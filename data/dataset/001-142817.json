NORP The applicant , PERSON is a NORP national . She is of GPE ethnic origin and was born in DATE . The President granted the applicant \u2019s request for her identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON and PERSON , lawyers acting in cooperation with ORG , a non - governmental organisation with its registered office in PERSON .", "The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant gave birth to her second child in the public hospital in LOC ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The delivery was carried out by means of a caesarean section , as had also been the case when she gave birth to her first child . At the time , the applicant was underage . She was not legally married .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when she accessed her medical records , the applicant became acquainted with a document indicating that she had been sterilised during the delivery of her child on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , a surgery record appended to the applicant \u2019s medical records indicates that the applicant underwent sterilisation by tubal ligation due to complications involving abnormally deep attachment of the placenta and imminent risk of rupture of the uterus . The document is dated DATE and signed by Doctor PERSON . The delivery record itself contains no mention of a sterilisation operation having taken place .", "CARDINAL . Neither the applicant nor her legal guardians had been advised of or asked to give their consent to the applicant \u2019s sterilisation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from ORG on DATE . Her second child died of pneumonia DATE .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant was not aware why she was unable to conceive a child , she underwent infertility treatment in DATE following the delivery of her second child .", "CARDINAL . Due to her inability to have more children the applicant has experienced serious physical and mental health problems . She has been ostracised by the GPE community and has experienced relationship difficulties with her husband .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an action for protection of her personal rights under Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW before LOC . She argued that she had been sterilised contrary to the requirements of NORP law and in breach of , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE of the Convention . She sought an apology , CARDINAL in compensation for damage and the reimbursement of her legal costs .", "CARDINAL . In a written statement of DATE a representative of the defendant hospital argued that the sterilisation of the applicant had been medically indicated and that the hospital staff had acted in accordance with the law then in force .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard Doctor PERSON , who stated that he had become the applicant \u2019s gynaecologist in DATE , after the delivery of her second child . He had not been aware of a sterilisation operation having been performed on the applicant . Nurse PERSON stated that she could not remember the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s delivery .", "CARDINAL . An expert appointed by the court noted , in an opinion of DATE , that , according to the applicant \u2019s medical records , tubal ligation had been performed on her on DATE . It had not been a life - saving operation , but it had been medically indicated , as any subsequent pregnancy would have entailed a serious risk to the applicant \u2019s life and health . The opinion further noted that the applicant had undergone a radiologic examination on DATE . It had revealed that the applicant \u2019s fallopian tubes were not blocked and there were no signs of ligation on them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted the opinion of a NORP expert of CARDINAL DATE indicating that her sterilisation had not been necessary with a view to saving her life . The opinion was based on analysis of medical records related to the applicant \u2019s admission to ORG from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the action . With reference to the result of the above - mentioned radiologic examination of DATE , it did not find it established that the applicant had been sterilised .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant \u2019s appeal , on DATE the ORG quashed ORG judgment . It ordered the firstinstance court to obtain further evidence with a view to establishing all relevant facts .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG heard Doctor PERSON , who had been present during the delivery of the applicant \u2019s second child . Albeit he did not remember its circumstances , he stated that he had completed the delivery record and that he would have mentioned the applicant \u2019s sterilisation on its front page had such an operation been carried out . The only reference to the applicant \u2019s sterilisation had been made in the surgery record written by Doctor PERSON , who had died in the meantime . Doctor PERSON was not in a position to explain why Doctor PERSON had made such an entry . She might have mistaken the applicant \u2019s file with that of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL other people on whom they had operated consecutively on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG further established from the hospital \u2019s list of operations performed that Doctors S. and L. had performed CARDINAL caesarean sections on DATE . The applicant was the third patient on whom they had operated .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s gynaecologist highlighted that the report drawn up upon her release from the hospital did not state that the applicant had been sterilised .", "CARDINAL . Upon the court \u2019s request an expert indicated , on DATE , that endoscopic examination by means of laparoscopic chromopertubation would reliably show whether or not the applicant had been sterilised . The reliability of the radiologic examination which the applicant had undergone on DATE amounted to MONEY . The opinion further stated that sterilisation by tubal ligation , as recorded in the applicant \u2019s file , failed for an unknown reason in MONEY of cases .", "CARDINAL . In her submissions , the applicant indicated that she was not willing to subject herself to invasive methods of examination entailing possible side effects and risks to her health for the purpose of proving that she had been sterilised . The medical records clearly showed that this had taken place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . The court held that the evidence available did not permit it to conclude that the sole reason for which the applicant could not conceive a child was a blockage of her fallopian tubes resulting from an operation performed by the employees of the defendant hospital . The burden of proof was on the applicant to show that she had been sterilised . However , she had refused to undergo further medical tests which were necessary to establish in a reliable manner whether she had been subjected to a sterilisation operation , as claimed by her . ORG further concluded that the applicant \u2019s right to claim compensation for nonpecuniary damage had prescribed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . She argued that it was for the defendant hospital to show that its staff had erroneously indicated in her medical records that she had been sterilised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the firstinstance judgment . It held that ORG had established all relevant facts and had correctly applied the applicable law . In particular , as it could not be established beyond any doubt that the applicant had been sterilised by the hospital staff , she could not succeed in her action for protection of her personal rights . The reference to such an operation being performed in CARDINAL of several medical records drawn up in relation to the delivery of the applicant \u2019s second child did not suffice to prove that the operation had actually been performed , given that a subsequent test had shown that her fallopian tubes were not blocked . The fact that the applicant had refused to undergo more reliable tests also had to be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional complaint . With reference to the proceedings leading to ORG judgment of DATE , she alleged a breach , inter alia , of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . The applicant argued that the ordinary courts had failed to comply with their obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances of her sterilisation . In particular , ORG finding that it had not been clearly established that the applicant had been sterilised had been arbitrary and in disregard of the information in the applicant \u2019s medical records . In view of the entry recording her sterilisation in her records , it was for the defendant hospital to show that the applicant had not been sterilised . Asking the applicant to submit herself to invasive medical procedures with possible side effects with a view to proving that she had been sterilised was inappropriate in the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint . There was no appearance of unfairness in the proceedings leading to ORG judgment , in which all relevant facts and arguments had been addressed and which had not been arbitrary . In those circumstances the other complaints made by the applicant were manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a criminal complaint with ORG in LOC . She submitted that she had suffered serious bodily harm as a result of her unlawful sterilisation in LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a police investigator informed the applicant that a criminal investigation had been started on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the investigation the investigator heard the applicant and her legal representative , as well as CARDINAL staff members from ORG . Doctor PERSON had been present during the delivery but he could not remember its circumstances , including whether the applicant had been sterilised . Similarly , PERSON stated that she could not remember the delivery . An expert indicated that sterilisation was not in itself a life - saving operation . It should not be performed without the consent of the woman concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police investigator concluded that no criminal offence had been committed , as it had not been established with sufficient certainty that the applicant had been sterilised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in ORG dismissed a complaint against the investigator \u2019s decision made by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in Pre\u0161ov informed the applicant that no reason had been found for departing from the conclusions reached by the authorities at the lower level . It was particularly relevant that the surgeon who had operated on the applicant had died , and that the period during which the alleged criminal offence could be prosecuted had expired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found no breach of law in the course of the investigation into the applicant \u2019s criminal complaint . The reply contained the following information .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the investigation CARDINAL possible reasons for the applicant \u2019s infertility had been identified , namely either her unlawful sterilisation on DATE or a medical condition affecting her reproductive organs , namely fallopian tube obstruction .", "CARDINAL . Only the surgery record of CARDINAL DATE stated that the applicant had been sterilised . There was no mention of a sterilisation operation in the delivery record , in the other records relating to the delivery and the applicant \u2019s subsequent treatment , in the records of the anaesthesia given to her or in the report drawn up upon the applicant \u2019s release from the hospital . Doctor PERSON , who had operated on the applicant , had died in the meantime . CARDINAL of her colleagues had stated that Doctor PERSON had drawn up the patient surgery records after all of the operations scheduled for DATE had been completed . An expert had found that CARDINAL caesarean sections , CARDINAL of which had been accompanied by the patient \u2019s sterilisation , had been performed in the hospital on DATE . Doctor PERSON had performed CARDINAL of those caesarean sections . It could not be excluded that the entry recording the applicant \u2019s sterilisation in the surgery record had been made erroneously . The expert was not in a position to confirm that the applicant had been sterilised . It was also possible that the applicant \u2019s tubes were blocked by scar tissue . It was relevant in that respect that scars on the applicant \u2019s organs had been noted in the course of the delivery of the applicant \u2019s second child . According to the expert , surgery was required in order to establish why the applicant could not become pregnant .", "CARDINAL . The letter from ORG further indicated that it would be inappropriate to ask the applicant to undergo such surgery . Even if it were thereby established that she had been unlawfully sterilised , no criminal law consequences would arise , as the surgeon involved had died and the period in which the alleged offence could have been prosecuted had expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG . With reference to her sterilisation and the standpoints of ORG and ORG , she alleged a breach of ORG , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW and also a breach of several other international instruments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint as being manifestly ill - founded . The decision stated that ORG could only examine any breaches which had resulted from the unfairness or arbitrariness of the proceedings complained of . As the applicant in her complaint had neither relied on LAW nor made reference to its guarantees in substance , her ORG complaints could not be dealt with in the constitutional proceedings .", "CARDINAL . With a view to describing the overall situation and circumstances in which she had delivered her child , the applicant submitted that she had experienced inferior treatment during her stay at ORG . In particular , patients in the gynaecological and obstetrics ward had been segregated according to their ethnic origin . The applicant had been accommodated in a \u201c Gypsy room \u201d , separate from women who were not of GPE ethnic origin .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant referred to a number of publications pointing to a history of sterilisation of GPE women , which had originated under the NORP regime in GPE in DATE and which she believed had influenced her own sterilisation . She also referred to a number of reports and statements by human rights organisations , both in GPE and abroad , including governmental and inter - governmental bodies , asking the NORP authorities to conduct an impartial and fair investigation of the allegations of forced and coerced sterilisation of GPE women in GPE , or criticising the absence of such an investigation ( for further details see also GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ( extracts ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant considered that her ethnic origin had played a decisive role in the way in which she had been treated . Citing a number of international reports , the applicant submitted that discrimination against GPE in GPE extended to all facets of their lives .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , natural persons have the right to protection of their personal rights ( personal integrity ) , in particular their life and health , human dignity , privacy , name and personal characteristics .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , natural persons have the right to seek the cessation of unjustified infringements of their personal rights and to have the consequences of such infringements eliminated . They also have the right to seek appropriate redress .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that , in cases where the redress obtained under LAW is insufficient , in particular because the injured party \u2019s dignity or social standing has been significantly diminished , he or she is also entitled to financial compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , the following provisions of GPE DATE ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ) were in force .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , medical interventions were to be carried out with the patient \u2019s consent . Such interventions were also permissible in cases where the patient \u2019s state of health prevented him or her from expressing his or her will but where his or her consent could be presumed .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL a sterilisation operation was permissible only with the consent of or upon the request of the person concerned and subject to the conditions set by ORG .", "CARDINAL .
