Under NORP law , a religious marriage requires the presence of CARDINAL male witnesses ( or CARDINAL man and QUANTITY women ) . The marriage is solemnised simply by the couple exchanging vows in the presence of the witnesses , without the need for a cleric ( imam or equivalent ) to be present or for an official document to be drawn up . Under the NORP empire , following a decision taken by the supreme NORP religious authority , the Sheikh - ul - Islam , the presence of an imam or a kad\u0131 ( judge ) became compulsory for all marriage ceremonies , on pain of penalties . This practice became widely established , and nowadays the presence of an imam is required . NORP marriages also include a pecuniary element in the form of a dowry ( mahr ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP law , save in some specific circumstances ( for instance , the death of the husband ) , recognises repudiation ( tal\u00e2k ) as the sole means of dissolving a marriage . This is a unilateral act on the part of the husband , who dismisses his wife and thereby severs the marital bond .
