The applicants ( the second of whom died in DATE ) were at the relevant time employed by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL national TV stations in GPE , ORG . They produced CARDINAL television programmes which were broadcast on CARDINAL DATE at TIME and DATE at TIME respectively . The programmes were called \u201c Convicted of Murder \u201d ( d\u00f8mt for mord ) and \u201c The Blind Eye of the Police \u201d ( NORP blinde \u00f8je ) respectively and dealt with a murder trial in which ORG ) had convicted a person , henceforth called X , on CARDINAL DATE of murdering his wife . PERSON was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) upheld the sentence in DATE . Subsequent to X 's release on probation , he requested ORG ( PERSON ) , on DATE , to reopen the case .", "CARDINAL . At the outset of both programmes it was stated that they had been produced on to the following premise :", "\u201c In the programme we shall provide evidence by way of a series of specific examples that there was no legal basis for ORG 's conviction and that by imposing its sentence , ORG set aside CARDINAL of the fundamental tenets of the law in GPE , namely that the accused should be given the benefit of the doubt .", "We shall show that a scandalously bad police investigation , in which the question of guilt had been prejudged right from the start , and which ignored significant witnesses and concentrated on dubious ones , led to X being sentenced to DATE imprisonment for the murder of his wife .", "The programme will show that X could not have committed the crime of which he was convicted on CARDINAL DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At an early stage in the first programme , \u201c Convicted of Murder \u201d , there is the following comment :", "\u201c In the case against X , police inquiries involved about CARDINAL people . CARDINAL pages of reports were written DATE and CARDINAL witnesses appeared before ORG .", "We will try to establish what actually happened on DATE of the murder , DATE . We shall critically review the police 's investigations and evaluate the witnesses ' statements regarding the time of X 's wife 's disappearance . \u201d", "As part of the preparation of this first programme , the applicants had invited the police in the district of GPE , who were responsible for the investigation of the murder case , to take part in the programme . As certain conditions for giving interview were not complied with , inter alia that the questions be send in writing in advance , by letter of DATE the Chief of Police informed the applicants that the police could not participate in the programme .", "CARDINAL . In the introduction to the second programme , \u201c ORG of the Police \u201d , there is the following comment :", "\u201c It was the police in the district of GPE who were responsible at that time for the investigations which led to the conviction of X. Did the police assume right from the start that X was the killer and did they therefore fail to investigate all the leads in the case , as otherwise required by the law ?", "We have investigated whether there is substance in GPE 's serious allegations against the police in the district of GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Shortly afterwards in the programme the second applicant is interviewing a taxi driver . She explains to the applicant that DATE after the disappearance of PERSON 's wife , she was interviewed by QUANTITY police officers and that during this interview she mentioned CARDINAL observations she had made on DATE ; she had seen a ORG taxi ( which was later shown to have no relevance to the murder ) , but before that she had seen X and his son at TIME . She had driven behind them for QUANTITY . The reason why she could remember the date and time so exactly was because she had had to attend her grandmother 's funeral on that date at TIME", "CARDINAL . The following comment is then made :", "Commentator : So in DATE , shortly after PERSON 's wife disappears and PERSON is in prison , ORG is in possession of the taxi driver 's statement in which she reports that shortly after DATE she drives behind X and his son for QUANTITY ... So X and his son were in GPE [ residential area ] twice , and the police knew it in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The interview went on :", "\u201c Second applicant : What did the police officers say about the information you provided ?", "Taxi driver : Well , CARDINAL of them said that it could n't be true that PERSON 's son was in the car , but in fact I am PERCENT certain it was him because I also know the son because I have driven him to day - care .", "Second applicant : Why did he say that to you ?", "Taxi driver : Well , he just said that it could n't be true that the son was there .", "Second applicant : That it could n't be true that you saw what you saw .", "Taxi driver : No , that is , he did n't say that I had n't seen X , it just could n't be true that the son was with him .", "Second applicant : These were the CARDINAL police officers who questioned the taxi driver in DATE and it was they who wrote the police report .", "We showed the taxi driver her statement from DATE , which she had never seen before .", "Taxi driver : It 's missing the bit DATE there was only ... about the ORG , there was nothing about the rest , unless you have another one .", "Second applicant : There is only this one .", "Taxi driver : But it obviously can not have been important .", "Second applicant : What do you think about that ?", "Taxi driver : Well it says , I do n't know , well I think when you make a statement , it should be written down in any case , otherwise I ca n't see any point in it , and especially not in a murder case .", "Commentator : So the taxi driver claims that already in DATE she had told CARDINAL police officers that she had seen X and his son . Not a word of this is mentioned in this report .", "Second applicant : Why are you so sure that you told the police this , which at that time was DATE .", "Taxi driver : Well I am PERCENT sure of it and also , my husband sat beside me in the living room as a witness so ... , so that is why I am PERCENT certain that I told them .", "Second applicant : And he was there throughout the entire interview ?", "Taxi driver : Yes , he was .", "Second applicant : Not just part of the interview ?", "Taxi driver : No , he was there all the time .", "Commentator : It was not until DATE , DATE , that the taxi driver heard of the matter again , shortly after the \u201c Convicted of Murder \u201d programme had been shown ; even though the taxi driver 's report had been filed as a so called TIME , she was ' phoned by a Chief Inspector of ORG ( PERSON ) who had been asked by ORG to do a couple of further interviews .", "Taxi driver : The Chief Inspector of ORG called me and asked whether I knew if any of my colleagues knew anything they had not reported , or whether I had happened to think of something , and I then told him on the ' phone what I said the first time about the ORG and that I had driven behind X and his son up to FAC , and then he said that if he found out about anything which , otherwise ... or if there was anything , then he would ... then he would get in touch with me again , which he did n't do , not until a while afterwards when he called me and asked whether I would come for another interview .", "Second applicant : When you told the Chief Inspector of ORG in your telephone call that you followed X and his son was in the car , what did he say about that ?", "Taxi driver : Well , he did n't say anything .", "Second applicant : He did not say that you had never reported this ?", "Taxi driver : No , he did n't . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Then the second applicant has a short interview with ORG 's new counsel :", "\u201c Second applicant : Have you any comment on the explanation the taxi driver has given now ?", "X 's new counsel : I have no comment to make at this time .", "Second applicant : Why not ?", "X 's new counsel : I have agreed with the public prosecutor , and the President of ORG , that statements to the press in this matter will in future only be issued by ORG .", "Commentator : Even though ORG 's new counsel does not wish to speak about the case , we know from other sources that it was he who , in DATE , asked for the taxi driver to be interviewed again . So in DATE she was interviewed at GPE police station in the presence of ORG , which is clearly at odds with what ORG previously stated in public , namely that the GPE police would not get the opportunity to be involved in the new inquiries . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The interview with the taxi driver goes on :", "\u201c Second applicant : And what happened at the interview ?", "Taxi driver : What happened was that I was shown into the Chief Inspector of ORG and ORG was there too .", "Second applicant : Was there any explanation given about why he was present ?", "Taxi driver : No .", "Second applicant : So what did you say in this interview ?", "Taxi driver : I gave the same explanations as I had done the first time when I was interviewed at home .", "Second applicant : DATE , that is .", "Taxi driver : Yes .", "Second applicant : And that was ?", "Taxi driver : Well , that I had driven behind X and his son up to Ryets Street .", "Second applicant : What did they say about that ?", "Taxi driver : They did n't say anything .", "Second applicant : The report , which was made in DATE , did you see it ?", "Taxi driver : No .", "Second applicant : Was it there in the room ?", "Taxi driver : There was a report there when I was being interviewed , but I was n't allowed to see it .", "Second applicant : Did you expressly ask whether you could see the old report ?", "Taxi driver : I asked whether I could see it but the Chief Inspector of ORG said I could n't ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . After the interview with the taxi driver the commentator asks :", "\u201c Now we are left with all the questions : why did the vital part of the taxi driver 's explanation disappear DATE and who in the police or public prosecutor 's office should carry the responsibility for this ?", "Was it the CARDINAL police officers who failed to write a report about it ?", "Hardly , sources in the police tell us , they would not dare .", "Was it [ the named Chief Superintendent ] who decided that the report should not be included in the case ? Or did he and the Chief Inspector of ORG conceal the witness 's statement from the defence , the judges and the jury ? ... \u201d", "Pictures of the QUANTITY police officers , the named Chief Superintendent and the Chief Inspector of ORG were shown on the screen simultaneously parallel with the above questions . The questions went on :", "\u201c Why did the Chief Inspector of ORG phone the taxi driver shortly after the TV - programme ' Convicted of Murder ' ? After all , the police had taken the view that the taxi driver had no importance as a witness and had filed her statement amongst the O - reports .", "Why did the Chief Inspector of ORG not call her in for an interview when she repeated her original explanation on the telephone ?", "Why was the taxi driver interviewed at the GPE police station in the presence of ORG , which was completely at odds with ORG public statement ?", "On DATE [ a named ] Chief Constable stated to [ a regional DATE ] : ' all the information connected to the case has been submitted to the defendants , the prosecution and the judges ' Did the Chief Constable know about the taxi driver 's statement , when he made this statement ? Did ORG know already in DATE that there was a statement from a witness confirming that twice X had been in GPE , and that X 's son had been with him both times ? Neither of them have wished to make any statement at all about the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , at the request of ORG 's new counsel , the taxi driver was interviewed by the police again on DATE . She stated that on CARDINAL DATE she had attended her grandmother 's funeral at TIME and that on her way to the funeral around TIME she had driven behind X and his son . She arrived at the funeral at TIME She also explained that she had told the police about this when first interviewed in DATE . Later on DATE the police made an enquiry which revealed that the funeral of the taxi driver 's grandmother had indeed taken place on DATE , but at TIME", "Thereafter , the police held CARDINAL interviews with the taxi driver during which she changed her explanation , inter alia , as follows .", "On DATE she maintained having seen X shortly after TIME but agreed that the funeral had taken place at TIME On her way to the funeral she realised she had forgotten a wreath . Thus , she had had to return to her home and had consequently arrived at the funeral just before TIME", "On DATE she stated that she was not sure about the date or the time when she had seen X and his son . Moreover , she was uncertain whether , shortly after the murder , she had told the police about having seen X. In addition , she explained that during the shooting of her interview , which took place on DATE , the applicant PERSON had suggested that she say something like \u201c where is the other report \u201d when he was to show her the report of DATE .", "On DATE she initially stated that she would exclude having seen X and his son on CARDINAL DATE . She had never before connected this episode to the funeral . She also admitted having made up the story about the forgotten wreath , but had wanted \u201c things to fit \u201d . Later during the interview she maintained having seen X and his son on DATE , but at TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reported the applicants and the TV station to the police for defamation . It appears , however , that the prosecution 's decision as to whether or not to charge the applicants was adjourned pending the decision whether to reopen GPE 's case .", "CARDINAL . This was decided in the affirmative by ORG on DATE after CARDINAL hearings and the examination of CARDINAL witnesses , including the taxi driver . CARDINAL judges ( out of CARDINAL ) in GPE found that new testimonial evidence had been produced on which X might have been acquitted , had it been available at the trial . CARDINAL other judges found that no new testimonial evidence had been produced on which X might have been acquitted , had it been available at the trial . The fifth judge agreed with the latter , but found that in other respects special circumstances existed which made it overwhelmingly likely that the available evidence had not been judged correctly . Accordingly , the court granted a retrial .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , following the television programmes , an inquiry had commenced into the police investigation of ORG 's case . It appeared that the Police in Frederikshavn had not complied with section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of ORG ( Retsplejeloven ) , which was introduced on DATE and which provides that a witness shall be given the opportunity to read his or her statement . Consequently , on DATE the Prosecutor General ( PERSON ) stated in a letter to ORG , that it was unfortunate and open to criticism that the police in GPE had not implemented the above provision as part of their usual routine and informed the Ministry that he had made an agreement with ORG that he would produce a wider set of guidelines concerning the questioning of witnesses , which could be integrated into ORG educational material .", "CARDINAL . X 's retrial ended with his acquittal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants became aware of the fact that they had been reported to the police . On their request , however , they were informed that no decision had yet been taken as to possible charges against them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief Constable in GPE informed the applicants that they were charged with defamation against ORG . On DATE the applicants were questioned by the police in GPE .", "CARDINAL . A request of CARDINAL DATE from the prosecution to seize the applicants ' research material was examined at a hearing in ORG Retten i Gladsaxe ) on DATE during which the applicants ' counsel , claiming that the case concerned a political offence , requested that a jury in the High Court - instead of ORG - try the case . Both requests were refused by ORG ( retten i GPE ) on CARDINAL DATE . In DATE the prosecution appealed against the decision on seizure and the applicants appealed against the decision on venue . At the request of CARDINAL of the applicants ' counsel , an oral hearing was scheduled to take place in ORG of Eastern Denmark ( PERSON ) on DATE . However , on DATE counsel challenged one of the judges in the ORG alleging disqualification and requested an oral hearing on the issue . ORG decided on DATE to refuse an oral hearing and on DATE that the judge in question was not disqualified . It appears that counsel requested leave to appeal against this decision to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) , but to no avail . As to the appeal against non - seizure and the question of venue , hearings were held in the High Court on DATE and DATE , and by a decision of DATE ORG upheld ORG decisions . The applicants ' request for leave to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

However , as counsel for CARDINAL of the parties was ill the final hearings were re - scheduled to take place on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Gladsaxe delivered a CARDINAL page judgment finding that the questions put in the TV programme concerning the named Chief Superintendent amounted to defamatory allegations , which should be declared null and void . However , the court refrained from sentencing the applicants as it found that the applicants had reason to believe that the allegations were true . Also , the applicants were acquitted of a compensation claim raised by the widow of the named Chief Superintendent , as he had deceased before the trial . The judgment was appealed against by the applicants immediately and by the prosecution on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor sent a notice of appeal to ORG , and on DATE he invited counsel for the applicants and the attorney for the widow of ORG to a meeting concerning the proceedings . Counsel for one of the parties stated that he was unable to attend before DATE , and accordingly the meeting was held on DATE . ORG received the TIME of the meeting from which it appeared that counsel for CARDINAL of the parties was unable to attend the trial before DATE , and that he preferred the hearings to take place in DATE . On DATE ORG scheduled the hearings for CARDINAL , DATE and DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment convicting the applicants of violating the personal honour of ORG by making and spreading allegations of an act likely to disparage him in the esteem of his fellow citizens , under LAW , subsection CARDINAL of LAW . The allegations were declared null and void . The applicants were each sentenced to DATE - fines of MONEY ( DKK ) ( or in the alternative DATE imprisonment ) and ordered to pay compensation to the estate of the deceased Chief Superintendent of DKK CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE the applicants sought leave from the Leave to Appeal Board ( Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet ) to appeal to ORG . Before deciding , the ORG requested an opinion from the prosecuting authorities , namely the Chief of ORG , ORG and ORG . On DATE their joint opinion was submitted opposing leave to appeal . However , in the meantime it appears that a lawyer representing the TV station , ORG , contacted ORG , proposing that the public prosecution assist in bringing the case before ORG as , according to the TV station , ORG judgment was incompatible with LAW ( PERSON ) . Consequently , the public prosecutors initiated a renewed round of consultation on this question , and their joint opinion was forwarded to ORG . Having heard the applicants ' counsel on the prosecution 's submissions , on DATE ORG granted the applicants leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL .

By a judgment of DATE , ORG judgment was upheld , though the compensation payable to the estate was increased to DKK CARDINAL . The majority of CARDINAL judges held :", "\u201c In the programme ' The Blind Eye of the Police ' the applicants not only repeated a statement by the taxi driver that she had already explained to the police during their inquiries in DATE that shortly after TIME on DATE she had driven behind X for QUANTITY , but also , in accordance with the common premise for the programmes ' Convicted of Murder ' and ' The Blind Eye of the Police ' , took a stand on the truth of the taxi driver 's statement and presented the matters in such a way that viewers , even before the final sequence of questions , were given the impression that it was a fact that the taxi driver had given the explanation as she alleged to have done in DATE and that the police were therefore in possession of this explanation in DATE . This impression was strengthened by the first of the concluding questions : ' ... why did the vital part of the taxi driver 's explanation disappear and who , in the police or public prosecutor 's office , should carry the responsibility for this ? ' . In connection with the scenes about the QUANTITY police officers they pose CARDINAL questions in the commentator 's narrative , to which the indictment relates ; irrespective of the kind of question , viewers undoubtedly received a clear impression that a report had been made about the taxi driver 's statement that she had seen X at the relevant time on DATE ; that this report had subsequently been suppressed ; and that such suppression had been decided upon either by the named Chief Superintendent alone or by him and the Chief Inspector of ORG jointly . The subsequent questions in the commentator 's narrative do not weaken this impression , and neither does the question as to whether the Chief Constable or ORG were aware of the taxi driver 's statement . On this basis we find that in the programme ' ORG of the Police ' the applicants made allegations against ORG which were intended to discredit him in the eyes of his peers , as described in LAW , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) . We find further that it must have been clear to the applicants that they were , by way of their presentation , making such allegations .", "The applicants have not endeavoured to provide any justification but have claimed that there is no cause of action by virtue of LAW , subsection CARDINAL of LAW \u2013 that a party who in good faith justifiably makes an allegation which is clearly in the general public interest or in the interest of other parties ...", "As laid down in the PERSON v. GPE judgment ( DATE ) there is a very extensive right to public criticism of the police . As in that decision there is , however , a difference between passing on and making allegations , just as there is a difference between criticism being directed at the police as such and at individual named officers in the police force . Even though being in the public eye is a natural part of a police officer 's duties , consideration should also be given to his good name and reputation .", "As stated , the CARDINAL applicants did not limit themselves in the programme to referring to the taxi driver 's statement or to making value judgments on this basis about the quality of the police 's investigations and ORG leadership thereof . Neither did the applicants limit themselves to making allegations against the police as such for having suppressed the taxi driver 's explanation , but made an allegation against the named Chief Superintendent for having committed a criminal offence by way of suppressing a vital fact .", "When the applicants were producing the programme , they knew that an application had been made to ORG for the case against X to be reopened and that as part of ORG proceedings in dealing with the said application , the taxi driver had been interviewed by the police on DATE at the request of ORG 's defence as part of the proceedings to reopen the case . In consequence of the ongoing proceedings for reopening the case , the applicants could not count on ORG and the QUANTITY police officers , who had interviewed the taxi driver in DATE , being prepared to participate in the programme and hence possibly anticipate proceedings in ORG . Making the allegations can not accordingly be justified by lack of police participation in the programme .", "The applicants ' intentions , in the programme , of undertaking a critical assessment of the police 's investigation were proper as part of the role of the media in acting as a public watchdog , but this does not apply to every charge . The applicants had no basis for making such a serious charge against a named police officer and the applicants ' opportunities for satisfying the purposes of the programme in no way required the questions upon which the charges are based to be included .", "On this basis , and even though the exemptions provided in LAW must be narrowly interpreted , and even though LAW protects not only the content of utterances but also the manner in which they are made , we concur that the charges made are not excluded by LAW , subsection CARDINAL of LAW . Indeed , as a result of the seriousness of the charges , we concur that there is no basis for charges to be dropped in accordance with LAW , subsection CARDINAL of LAW . We agree further that there are no grounds for an acquittal under LAW .", "We also concur with the findings on defamation .", "We agree with ORG that the fact that the charges were made in a television programme on the national TV station ' PERSON radio ' and hence could be expected to get DATE as indeed they did \u2013 widespread publicity , must be regarded as an aggravating factor , as described in LAW , subsection CARDINAL . Considering that it is DATE since the programme was shown , we do not find , however , that there are sufficient grounds for increasing the sentence .", "For the reasons given by ORG we find that the applicants must pay damages in compensation in damages to the heir of ORG . In this , it should be noted that it can not be regarded as essential that the nature of the claim for damages in compensation was not stated in the writ of CARDINAL DATE since ORG claim for financial compensation could not relate to anything other than damages in compensation . Due to the seriousness of the allegation and the manner of its presentation , we find that the compensation should be increased to DKK CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The minority of CARDINAL judges who wanted to acquit the applicants held , inter alia :", "\u201c We agree that the statements covered by the indictment , irrespective of their having been phrased as questions , have to be regarded as indictable under LAW , subsection CARDINAL of LAW and that the applicants had the requisite intentions .", "As stated by the majority , the question of culpability must be decided in accordance with LAW , subsection CARDINAL , taken together with LAW , subsection CARDINAL , interpreted in the light of LAW and ORG Human Right 's restrictive interpretation of the exemptions under LAW .", "In reaching a decision , consideration must be given to the basis on which the applicants made their allegations , their formulation and the circumstances under which the allegations were made , as well as the applicants ' intentions in the programme .", "... We find that the applicants had cause to suppose that the taxi driver 's statement that she had seen X on DATE shortly past TIME was true . We further find ... that the applicants had reason to assume that the taxi driver , when interviewed in DATE , had told the CARDINAL police officers of having seen X ... We accordingly attach weight to the fact that it is natural for such an observation to be reported to the police ; that it is also apparent from her explanation in the police report of DATE that she had already told the police about her observations in DATE ; and that her explanation about the reaction of the police to her information that X 's son had been in the car strengthened the likelihood of her having reported the observation at the interview in DATE .", "... It is apparent from the TV programme that the applicants were aware that the Frederikshavn police had not at that time complied with the requirement to offer a person interviewed an opportunity to see the records of his or her statements . The applicants may accordingly have had some grounds for supposing that the report of DATE did not contain the taxi driver 's full statement or that there was another report thereon ...", "We consider that the applicants , in putting the questions covered by the indictment , did not exceed the limits of freedom of expression which a case , such as the present one , relating to serious matters of considerable public interest , should be available to the media .
