The police showed up , trying to seize the provisional share warrants which PERSON and the CARDINAL companies\u2019 proxies were supposed to use to establish their capacity as shareholders , but could apparently not find them . The police were acting on an order issued by the prosecuting authorities in connection with criminal proceedings concerning the genuineness of those warrants , which they had opened pursuant to complaints by PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In view of the failure of the proxies to produce valid share warrants , the polling commission entrusted by the bank \u2019s executive board to check the ORG credentials found that PERCENT of the shares were duly represented and decided to adjourn the meeting for DATE .

It appears that the police were acting on orders from the prosecuting authorities ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Sofia City Prosecutor \u2019s Office ordered the police to assist Mr B.P. in preventing any changes in the status quo in the bank \u2019s management and operations , and to warn Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr DATE , a newly registered member of the bank \u2019s supervisory board , to refrain from any actions in relation to that until the matter had been duly resolved by the competent authorities . It relied on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and reasoned that ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was being verified by ORG , that the record drawn up by the notary public ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) made it apparent that that decision had not been entered in the register of companies , which meant that it did not in fact exist , that Mr B.P. had applied to ORG to reopen the proceedings and annul that decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and that by trying to put the decision into effect Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON DATE were interfering with the bank \u2019s normal business . The prosecutor found that , in view of the possibility for them to dispose of the bank \u2019s documents and assets and imperil the interests of the bank \u2019s depositors , that gave rise to a real risk of irreparable damage .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON appealed to ORG , arguing that the order was unlawful and arbitrary . They pointed out that GPE decision was valid and immediately enforceable , that no appeal lay against it to ORG , and that the prosecuting authorities had no power to stay its enforcement . The question whether a judicial decision had been entered in the register of companies was to be established on the basis of official documents issued by the competent court , not of a record drawn up by a notary public outside his competence . The certificate issued by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) showed that its decision had in fact been duly entered in the register of companies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal . It noted that ORG had been spurred into action by information , given to it by GPE ORG , that ORG decision to make changes in the bank \u2019s registration might have been based on false documents . At the time when GPE Prosecutor \u2019s Office had issued its order , ORG decision had not yet been entered in the register of companies . Proceedings against that decision were pending before ORG . All of that showed that until GPE ORG had completed its inquiry into the matter or until ORG had given judgment , there would continue to exist a risk of changes in the status quo and irreparable damage to the bank .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON appealed to ORG , reiterating their arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It reasoned that it was beyond doubt that the prosecuting authorities were faced with a judicial decision under challenge and with evidence that that decision had been obtained through the use of false documents . Moreover , the decision had been issued in spite of a decision staying the registration proceedings and the existence of pending contentious proceedings . The appellants\u2019 argument that ORG had no jurisdiction to hear a legal challenge against ORG decision was unavailing because the prosecuting authorities were not competent to make pronouncements on such points . Faced with pending judicial proceedings and a pending criminal investigation , they were bound to take measures to prevent changes in the status quo before any judicial resolution of the matter . The appellants\u2019 attempts to change that status quo were premised on rights acquired through a judicial decision based on false documents . It was necessary for the judiciary to check the lawfulness of that decision and for the investigating authorities to gather evidence with a view to uncovering the truth . The bank had to be protected against damage flowing from offences that had already been committed and from the risk of future offences . The prerequisites of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) were therefore in place .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON appealed to ORG , arguing that the prosecuting authorities had acted in a patently unlawful way and in excess of their powers . Their decisions had been based on false findings of fact , and on the finding \u2013 not based on a final conviction \u2013 that offences had been committed by them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the economic crime division of ORG , to whom the case had been assigned , dismissed the appeal . He reasoned that the prosecuting authorities had acted lawfully and within their powers under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG was investigating the making of false documents with a view to obtaining changes in the bank \u2019s registration , and ORG decision had been challenged before ORG . There had therefore been a need to preserve the status quo with a view to ensuring the normal operation of the bank .", "CARDINAL . DATE , DATE , GPE District Prosecutor \u2019s Office ordered the police to take measures to ensure compliance with ORG Office \u2019s order of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the preservation of the status quo in the bank . It noted that criminal proceedings had been instituted against members of the bank \u2019s newly appointed management in relation to documentary offences , and that information existed that a group of persons had tried to enter the bank \u2019s LOC . Mr GPE and the applicants Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON had complained to the prosecuting authorities in relation to that . Since the criminal proceedings concerned allegations of using false documents to obtain judicial decisions to make entries in the register of companies , it was appropriate to maintain the status quo pending the resolution of the case . Indeed , this had already been ordered by the higher prosecutor \u2019s offices , whose decisions were mandatory for the Sofia ORG . The decision did not mention the legal provisions on which it was based .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr PERSON wrote a number of letters to ORG and tried to meet him in person with a view to obtaining the quashing or varying of the above ORG decisions , to no avail . He also lodged complaints with the Minister of ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL companies listed in paragraph CARDINAL above transferred their shares to PERSON by endorsing the provisional share warrants issued in DATE . As a result , he became the owner of PERCENT of the bank \u2019s shares . The companies submitted that PERSON paid part of the GPE price immediately and undertook to pay the remainder when the transfer would be registered in the bank \u2019s register of shareholders . The companies submitted that they could not obtain the remainder of the price because the bank \u2019s former management , who were de facto running the bank by virtue of the ORG decisions outlined in paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above , refused to register the transfer .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE Mr B.P. and PERSON sought revision of ORG decisions of CARDINAL and DATE ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .

Such decisions did not determine disputes between opposing litigants and did not enjoy res judicata . The proper way to contest entries in the register of companies obtained by criminal means was by way of a claim under LAW of LAW DATE aiming to have the entries erased under LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . Mr ORG and PERSON appealed .

In the meantime , Mr GPE and Mr P.B. brought claims against the bank under LAW of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , asking ORG to annul the resolutions of the general meetings of shareholders held on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL judgments of DATE and DATE , ORG allowed the claims and annulled all resolutions adopted by the CARDINAL meetings . It found that the meetings had been adjourned by the polling commission for lack of quorum and had not taken place , and that the parallel meetings had not been valid , chiefly because the persons who had taken part in them had not established their capacity as shareholders on the basis of valid provisional share warrants .", "CARDINAL . Following appeals by the bank , represented by the management appointed in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) and registered by ORG in DATE ( paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , on CARDINAL and DATE respectively ORG quashed those judgments and dismissed the claims . It found that the persons who had held the parallel meetings had in fact represented PERCENT of the bank \u2019s capital . The bank \u2019s records , which fully matched those of the BNB , and a document issued by PERSON in his capacity as executive director on DATE of the meeting , showed that they had indeed been shareholders in it .", "CARDINAL .

It held that , where nominative shares which had still not been issued were concerned , the only way of proving that a person was a shareholder entitled to take part in a general meeting was by producing a valid provisional share warrant . This had not happened at the CARDINAL meetings . They had therefore been held by persons whose capacity as shareholders had not been duly established , and all resolutions adopted by them were unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG , acting of its own motion ( see paragraph DATE below ) , and noting that the resolutions of the general meetings of CARDINAL and DATE had been ultimately annulled by ORG , erased the entries in the register of companies relating to those resolutions .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicants repeatedly asked the BNB to exercise its supervisory powers and take measures to resolve the bank \u2019s situation . On DATE the BNB wrote to ORG with a view to elucidating the effect of the ORG decisions outlined in paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above on the bank \u2019s management , but apparently did not receive a reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG \u2019s deputy - governor in charge of banking supervision noted that Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , who had been duly registered as members of the bank \u2019s executive board , were being prevented from carrying out their duties as a result of the decisions of the prosecuting authorities ( see paragraphs DATE above ) . That made it impossible for the bank \u2019s executive board to function . The attempts to approach the Chief Prosecutor with a view to solving the problem had proved unfruitful . At the same time , a check of the bank \u2019s finances carried out in DATE showed that its credit portfolio was deteriorating due to the ever more frequent failure of its debtors to service considerable loans extended by the bank , and that the bank was not carrying out proper creditrisk assessments . All of that seriously affected its stability and the interests of its creditors and depositors . It was therefore necessary to take urgent measures to solve the problem with the bank \u2019s management . The BNB \u2019s deputy - governor accordingly decided to call a meeting of the bank \u2019s supervisory board on DATE with a view to taking measures , possibly including replacing the members of the bank \u2019s executive board , that could allow the bank to be effectively managed . The order specified that it was immediately enforceable and not subject to judicial review .", "CARDINAL . DATE , DATE , the bank \u2019s supervisory board held a meeting at which it resolved to relieve PERSON of his duties as executive director of the bank and member of its executive board , and to appoint a Mr FAC in his stead . The board noted that Mr PERSON \u2019s removal was not due to any failure on his part but to factors beyond the bank \u2019s control .

On DATE the court upheld that latter request , noting that the general meeting \u2019s resolutions under challenge included the CARDINAL to appoint the supervisory board whose resolution the court was being asked to enter in the register of companies . This registration was therefore to be adjourned pending the outcome of the proceedings against the general meeting \u2019s resolutions .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the BNB repeatedly instructed the bank to take steps to overcome its financial difficulties . On DATE it noted that , contrary to a statutory rule prohibiting banks from exposing CARDINAL of their capital to any CARDINAL debtor , the bank had , DATE , extended a large loan to a company . In spite of the ORG \u2019s instructions to fix that , the bank later had , on the contrary , vastly increased its exposure to that company . It was also overly exposed to other debtors , and faced with a serious deterioration of its credit portfolio , with ever more frequent failures by its CARDINAL principal debtors to service their loans . That required the bank to increase its non - performing loan provisions , but doing so would deplete its capital to a level requiring revocation of its licence . The BNB therefore asked all persons engaged with running the bank to join efforts to remedy its situation , and instructed the bank immediately to bring its exposure into line with the statutory requirements and collect its overdue loans from CARDINAL companies and all of its loans from another company . The ORG also barred the bank from taking in new term deposits , except from shareholders , and warned it that failure to comply with those instructions would lead to harsher measures , including the appointment of special administrators or revocation of its licence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG \u2019s deputy - governor in charge of banking supervision decided to place the bank under compulsory administration and to appoint CARDINAL special administrators to run it for DATE . She noted that it had already been established that the bank \u2019s financial situation had substantially deteriorated and that its capital was below the amount required by law , which called for immediate remedial action ; in particular , the collection of some of the loans extended by the bank . Despite instructions to that effect by the ORG and a warning that failure to act would trigger harsher measures , the bank \u2019s management had not taken such action . A report by an inspector appointed by the ORG showed that the bank \u2019s liquidity was worsening DATE . The bank was therefore at risk of insolvency that its shareholders and management had not taken steps to avert . There was uncertainty in relation to the persons running the bank : those actually doing so no longer featured in the register of companies and were not in law entitled to act on the bank \u2019s behalf , whereas those featuring in the register could not in fact do so because of the decisions of the prosecuting authorities ( see paragraphs DATE above ) . That threw doubt on the reliability of the reports which the bank was submitting to the BNB ; there were reasons to believe that its financial situation was worse than transpiring from these reports . At the same time , the infighting between the bank \u2019s shareholders precluded outside assistance . All that showed that the interests of the bank \u2019s depositors were at serious risk , and the BNB had no choice but to place it under administration and appoint special administrators to run it . The BNB specified that its order was immediately enforceable and not subject to judicial review .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the special administrators invited the bank \u2019s management and shareholders to take steps to resolve the bank \u2019s situation .

Otherwise , the administrators would be bound to notify the ORG that the bank was insolvent .", "CARDINAL .
