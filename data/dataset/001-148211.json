De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently detained in GPE , GPE . When lodging his application he was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE . The latter informed the ORG on DATE that he no longer represented the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted by ORG of causing bodily harm and damage to property because he had hit CARDINAL ticket collectors in the face when they tried to prevent him from evading ticket controls and had damaged their clothes and glasses . He was further convicted of defamation and attempted coercion as he had insulted a prosecutor during CARDINAL of his previous trials and had tried to intimidate her . Moreover , he was convicted of dangerous bodily injury because he had attacked with a knife the neck of a sleeping cellmate of whom he had previously felt humiliated and slightly injured him . Besides , the applicant was convicted of various offences of theft , minor fraud , and trespassing . Adding on another prison sentence imposed on the applicant in a previous judgment of DATE for various offences of defamation , resisting bailiffs , bodily injury and theft , the court sentenced the applicant to an overall prison term of DATE and DATE in a juvenile prison .", "CARDINAL . Besides , the ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s indefinite placement in a psychiatric hospital in accordance with LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . At the time the applicant committed the relevant criminal offences he was DATE . The court decided to apply the juvenile criminal law instead of the criminal law rules applicable to adults because it found , in line with the report of the psychiatric expert PERSON , deputy medical director ( ORG ) of the forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy department of ORG and with the additional psychological expert opinion of psychotherapist PERSON , that the applicant \u2019s development as an adult was delayed , that he was still immature and had therefore to be treated as a juvenile and not as an adult . The court further found , in line with the psychiatric experts\u2019 opinions , that the applicant had committed the criminal offences of causing bodily harm and damage to property , dangerous bodily injury , defamation and attempted coercion while in a state of diminished criminal responsibility ( LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , as he suffered mainly from a \u201c borderline personality disorder of an impulsive type with dissocial components \u201d and also from \u201c adult hyperactivity syndrome \u201d , which limited his ability to control his impulses . With regard to the other criminal offences he was convicted of , the court , in line with the psychiatric experts\u2019 opinion , regarded the applicant as fully liable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE the criminal courts reviewed the applicant \u2019s compulsory confinement in the psychiatric clinic in accordance with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL below ) and found on all QUANTITY occasions that the applicant \u2019s detention in a psychiatric clinic could not yet be suspended on probation . For the purposes of these review decisions , the inhouse psychiatric doctors at ORG issued medical opinions on DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again decided that the applicant still suffered from the psychological disorder which had led to the criminal offences of which he had been convicted in DATE and that he could be expected to commit further offences of a certain gravity if released . The decision was delivered after having heard the applicant on CARDINAL DATE and again on DATE . It was based on the above - mentioned expert opinion of DATE by the in - house psychiatric team at ORG and on a newly commissioned external expert opinion of the psychiatric expert Prof . PERSON , head of the forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy department of ORG , who had delivered his expert opinion on DATE , had supplemented it on DATE and had personally been heard by the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the medical report of DATE the team of in - house psychiatric experts at ORG had expressed the view that the applicant could be expected to commit further crimes if released because he showed no insight into his psychological disorder . The expert opinion had further expressed the suspicion that the applicant might in fact be schizophrenic .", "CARDINAL . In his expert opinion Prof . PERSON had diagnosed the applicant with an \u201c emotionally unstable personality disorder of the impulsive type \u201d and possibly also with \u201c adult hyperactivity syndrome \u201d . O. had further stated that , despite the fact that the personality of the applicant had matured considerably during his confinement , he could not at this stage be expected to abstain from committing any significant crimes if released . Although the applicant had obviously benefited from his placement in a psychiatric hospital and had not committed any criminal offences within the hospital , he was still not psychologically stable enough to be released . The biggest obstacle to his release was that the applicant still had very little insight into the fact that medical treatment was necessary now and in the future after a possible release . His compliance with his treatment had hence not yet been achieved . Furthermore , the applicant would need clearly structured sheltered accommodation if released . The preparations for such accommodation were not yet in place . The expert had further stated that , if the applicant could be further stabilised by psychotherapy , if his compliance with his treatment could be achieved in the future and if a place in adequately structured sheltered accommodation was prepared , the applicant could be released but would need to be prepared over a period of DATE for such release on probation .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the applicant , ORG upheld the decision of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided in accordance with LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) that the applicant could not yet be released because , owing to his ongoing psychiatric illness , he could still be expected to commit crimes of a certain gravity if released . The ORG based its decision on a newly commissioned expert opinion of the internal psychiatric team of ORG of DATE and the oral hearing of the deputy medical director treating the applicant of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The respective medical experts were still of the view that the applicant could be expected to commit further crimes if released , because he still lacked sufficient insight into his psychological disorder . There was still a suspicion that he might in fact be suffering from schizophrenia rather than from a borderline personality syndrome . But as he refused to cooperate fully with the doctors , a clear diagnosis that would allow a more specific treatment was difficult . The idea that the applicant was suffering from schizophrenia was therefore only a presumption which could not be confirmed or refuted . More rapid results from the applicant \u2019s treatment could only be achieved if he complied fully with the medical and psychotherapeutic treatment . As he still had a negative attitude towards the medication and the psychotherapists , sufficient progress to justify his release could not be achieved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision . It based its decision on the above - mentioned external medical opinion of Prof . Dr O. of DATE and DATE respectively and on the internal expert opinion of the psychiatric team of ORG of DATE . The court held that there was still a clear diagnosis of \u201c emotionally unstable personality disorder of the impulsive type \u201d and possibly also of \u201c adult hyperactivity syndrome \u201d . This diagnosis did not contradict the diagnosis of \u201c borderline personality disorder of an impulsive type with dissocial components \u201d established by PERSON at the time of the applicant \u2019s initial compulsory confinement . According to ORG , Prof . PERSON had made it clear before the court that that diagnosis just gave a more precise description of the mental disturbance from which the applicant had already been suffering when he committed the offences of which he had been convicted and when he had been compulsorily admitted , but did not describe a new mental illness .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that the idea that the applicant in fact suffered from schizophrenia was only an unverified presumption . His situation had not changed since the external expert O. had given his opinion on DATE and DATE . According to the statement of the in - house psychiatric doctor , the applicant had still not developed any insight into his psychological illness that would result in full cooperation with regard to his medication . At the same time no structured sheltered accommodation had yet been prepared into which he could be placed after his release . He was therefore still to be expected to commit further crimes of a certain gravity if released . Considering the criminal offences he had committed in the past and the risk that he might again commit similar offences such as causing bodily harm and aggravated bodily injury , his continued detention for DATE by that time was not yet disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . A further appeal lodged by the applicant with ORG was rejected on the ground that domestic law did not provide for such an appeal .", "CARDINAL . A constitutional complaint and a request for restoration of the previous situation lodged by the applicant were of no avail . On DATE ORG declined to admit the constitutional complaint for examination , without giving any reasons , and did not rule on the request for restoration of the previous situation ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with LAW placement in a psychiatric hospital may be ordered in the case of offenders who have acted without criminal responsibility or in the case of offenders who have acted with diminished criminal responsibility in addition to their punishment . The measure must , however , be proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed by , or to be expected from , the defendants concerned , as well as to their dangerousness ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provides that if someone commits an unlawful act without criminal responsibility or with diminished criminal responsibility , the court must order his placement in a psychiatric hospital without specifying a maximum duration , if a comprehensive evaluation of the defendant and his acts reveals that , as a result of his condition , he can be expected to commit serious unlawful acts and that he is therefore dangerous to the general public .", "CARDINAL . Criminal incapacity and diminished criminal responsibility are regulated by ORG , which read as follows :", "LAW Criminal incapacity on account of psychological disturbance", "\u201c Any person who at the time of the commission of the offence is incapable of understanding the unlawfulness of his or her actions or of acting in accordance with any such understanding on account of a pathological mental disorder , a profound consciousness disorder , mental deficiency or any other serious mental abnormality , shall be deemed to have acted without guilt . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL Diminished criminal responsibility", "\u201c If the capacity of the offender to understand the unlawfulness of his or her actions or to act in accordance with any such understanding is substantially diminished at the time of the commission of the offence for CARDINAL of the reasons indicated in DATE , the sentence may be mitigated in accordance with LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
