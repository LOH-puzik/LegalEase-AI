This interference would contravene LAW unless it was \u201c prescribed by law \u201d , pursued CARDINAL or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , and was \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d for achieving such aim or aims .

The Government maintained that the measures taken against the applicant were based on section CARDINAL of the DATE Act .", "CARDINAL . The Commission agreed with the ORG and found that the interference was prescribed by law .", "CARDINAL . The ORG , like the Commission , finds that since the applicant \u2019s conviction was based on section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW the resultant interference with her freedom of expression could be regarded as \u201c prescribed by law \u201d , all the more as the applicant has not disputed this ( see , in this connection , S\u00fcrek ( No . CARDINAL ) v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not express a view on this point .", "CARDINAL . The Government contended that the aim of the interference in issue had been to maintain \u201c national security \u201d and \u201c public safety \u201d . The ORG accepted this view .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that , having regard to the sensitivity of the security situation in south - east GPE ( see the above - mentioned PERSON ( No.CARDINAL ) v. GPE judgment , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and to the need for the authorities to be alert to acts capable of fuelling additional violence , the measures taken against the applicant can be said to have been in furtherance of certain of the aims mentioned by the Government , namely the protection of national security and public safety . This is certainly true where , as with the situation in southeast GPE at the time of the circumstances of this case , the separatist movement had recourse to methods which relied on the use of violence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant pleaded that she should not have been punished for an article which she had not written . She further contended that the impugned article praised democracy and human rights and suggested that intellectuals should be more courageous in defending the latter . She maintained that the article did not advocate recourse to terrorism and violence but , on the contrary , it criticised the waging of terrorism against people . In the applicant \u2019s submission the measures taken against her amounted to an unjustified and disproportionate interference with her LAW right .", "CARDINAL . The Government asserted that the applicant disseminated separatist propaganda since the article in issue encouraged terrorist violence against the ORG . In support of their assertion the Government highlighted certain extracts from the article and contended that the phrase , \u201c we forget the axiom that the only way to oppose a war is to wage a just war \u201d was a clear incitement and encouragement to violence . In the ORG \u2019s submission , the author criticised intellectuals for defining \u201c innocent NORP peasants \u201d as \u201c terrorists \u201d and denigrating their march to freedom .", "In the Government \u2019s opinion , the message which the article conveyed was that the only means for resolving the NORP problem was the maintenance of terrorist activities against the ORG , and that intellectuals should give the necessary support to such activities . The ORG argued that , in the context of a virulent terrorism campaign , the applicant should have refrained from disseminating propaganda aimed at supporting terrorist violence . They further submitted that the applicant had rightly been convicted under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act and that the measures taken against her properly fell within the authorities\u2019 margin of appreciation in this area . The interference was accordingly justified under LAW .", "The Government finally pointed out that the imposition of the final sentence on the applicant had been suspended , following the enactment of PERSON no . DATE of DATE , which aimed at providing for more lenient sanctions for offences committed through the medium of the press .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that the incriminated publication was an article by an intellectual whose statements contained sharp criticism of the policy and action of GPE with regard to its population of NORP origin . The author expressed his view on the NORP question and did not associate himself with the use of violence in the context of the NORP separatist movement . In the ORG \u2019s view , the measures taken against the applicant amounted to a kind of censorship , which was likely to discourage others from publishing similar opinions in the future . On this basis , the ORG found that there had been a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recalls that in its PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE ( Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-VII , pp . DATE , \u00a7 DATE ) and the above - mentioned NORP ( CARDINAL ) v. GPE judgment ( cited above , \u00a7 MONEY ) , it summarised the basic principles established in its case - law concerning LAW :", "( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a NORP society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual \u2019s self - fulfilment . Subject to paragraph DATE , it is applicable not only to \u201c information \u201d or \u201c ideas \u201d that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference , but also to those that offend , shock or disturb . Such are the demands of that pluralism , tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201c democratic society \u201d . As set forth in LAW , this freedom is subject to exceptions , which must , however , be construed strictly , and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly .", "( ii ) The adjective \u201c necessary \u201d , within the meaning of LAW , implies the existence of a \u201c pressing social need \u201d . GPE have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists , but it goes hand in hand with NORP supervision , embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it , even those given by an independent court . The ORG is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a \u201c restriction \u201d is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by LAW .", "( iii ) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction , the ORG must look at the interference in the light of the case as a whole , including the content of the impugned statements and the context in which they were made . In particular , it must determine whether the interference in issue was \u201c proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued \u201d and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are \u201c relevant and sufficient \u201d .", "The ORG notes in this connection that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference ( see the Ceylan v. GPE judgment [ ORG ] , no . ORG , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINAL-IV ) . In doing so , the ORG has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in LAW and , moreover , that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further observes that in the above - mentioned LANGUAGE ( No . CARDINAL ) v. GPE judgment ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) it reiterated that there is little scope under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on questions of public interest . Furthermore , the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen , or even a politician . In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion .", "Moreover , the dominant position which a government occupies makes it necessary for it to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings , particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of its adversaries . Nevertheless , it certainly remains open to the competent ORG authorities to adopt , in their capacity as guarantors of public order , measures , even of a criminal - law nature , intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks ( see the GPE v. GPE judgment of DATE , Reports CARDINAL-IV , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Finally , where such remarks incite people to violence , the ORG authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . Since the applicant was convicted of disseminating separatist propaganda through the review of which she was the editor , the impugned interference must also be seen in the context of the essential role of the press in ensuring the proper functioning of a political democracy ( see among many other authorities , the PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A , no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and the abovementioned S\u00fcrek ( No . CARDINAL ) judgment , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . While the press must not overstep the bounds set , inter alia , for the protection of vital ORG interests , such as national security or territorial integrity , against the threat of violence or the prevention of disorder or crime , it is nevertheless incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on political issues , including divisive ones . Not only has the press the task of imparting such information and ideas , the public has a right to receive them . Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of political leaders ( see the abovementioned PERSON judgment , p. CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG stresses that the \u201c duties and responsibilities \u201d which accompany the exercise of the right to freedom of expression by media professionals assume special significance in situations of conflict and tension . Particular caution is called for when consideration is being given to the publication of views which contain incitement to violence against the ORG lest the media become a vehicle for the dissemination of hate speech and the promotion of violence . At the same time , where such views can not be so categorised , ORG can not , with reference to the protection of territorial integrity or national security or the prevention of crime or disorder , restrict the right of the public to be informed of them by bringing the weight of the criminal law to bear on the media ( see the ORG and PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINAL-IV ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG takes into account , furthermore , the background to cases submitted to it , particularly problems linked to the prevention of terrorism ( see PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . On that point , it takes note of the NORP authorities\u2019 concern about the dissemination of views which they consider might exacerbate the serious disturbances that have been going on in GPE for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the applicant \u2019s review published an article which had been written by an intellectual who had expressed his views on the NORP problem . The impugned article contained a sharp criticism of the ORG \u2019s policy and of the action of their security forces with regard to the population of NORP origin . While alleging that intellectuals and the NORP press are denigrating the \u201c NORP peasants\u2019 freedom march \u201d , the author criticised their overall view of the NORP problem . The author further suggested that the NORP reality should be recognised and peaceful methods tried in order to resolve the NORP problem instead of having recourse to military action . He regretted the shedding of blood in the course of armed conflict between NORP and NORP , since he considered them brother nations . He also expressed his disapproval of all types of chauvinism , including NORP and NORP forms .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes in addition that , although certain phrases seem aggressive in tone , such as the one highlighted by the Government , the article taken as a whole does not glorify violence . Nor does it incite people to hatred , revenge , recrimination or armed resistance . On the contrary , the article is an intellectual analysis of the NORP problem which calls for an end to the armed conflict . In the ORG \u2019s view these are the essential factors which should be considered ( see the PERSON v. GPE judgment , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Furthermore , the ORG observes that the applicant was convicted by ORG not for incitement to violence , but for disseminating separatist propaganda by referring to a particular region of GPE as \u201c NORP \u201d and alleging that the population of NORP origin living in that region was subjected to oppression . In this regard , the ORG considers that the domestic authorities in the instant case failed to give sufficient weight to the public \u2019s right to be informed of a different perspective on the situation in south - east GPE , irrespective of how unpalatable that perspective may be for them . As noted above , the views expressed in the incriminated article can not be read as an incitement to violence , nor could they be construed as liable to incite violence . That being so , the reasons given by ORG for convicting the applicant , although relevant , can not be considered sufficient to justify the interference with her right to freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also observes that , notwithstanding the fact that the imposition of a final sentence on the applicant was suspended , she was nevertheless faced with the threat of a heavy penalty ( see the ORG and PERSON v. GPE judgment , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . For ORG , a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not sufficient in principle to deprive him of his status as a \u201c victim \u201d unless the national authorities have acknowledged , either expressly or in substance , and then afforded redress for , the breach of the Convention ( see the GPE v. GPE judgment [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINAL-VI ) .", "In the instant case , however , ORG suspended the imposition of a final sentence on the applicant on condition that she did not commit any further offence as an editor within DATE of its decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . If the applicant fails to comply with that condition , she will automatically be sentenced for the original offence . In other words , the decision in question did not remove her status as a \u201c victim \u201d . On the contrary , the conditional suspended sentence had the effect of restricting the applicant \u2019s work as an editor and reducing her ability to offer the public views which have their place in a public debate whose existence can not be denied ( see , ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , to be published in DATE ; see also , mutatis mutandis , the ORG v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Reports CARDINAL-VI , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the above considerations , the applicant \u2019s conviction was disproportionate to the aims pursued and , accordingly , not \u201c necessary in a democratic society \u201d . There has therefore been a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained that the presence of a military judge on the bench of ORG which tried and convicted her meant that she was denied a fair hearing , in breach of LAW , the relevant part of which provides :", "\u201c In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him , everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government contested that allegation whereas the ORG accepted it .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s submission , under the rules applicable at the time , the military judges appointed to ORG , such as ORG , were dependent on the Executive and the army as regards their appointment and careers . Such ties made it impossible for military judges to discharge their functions on the bench in an independent and impartial manner . The applicant further stressed that the independence and impartiality of military judges , and hence of the courts on which they sat , were compromised since these judges were unable to take a position which might be contradictory to the views of their commanding officers .", "The applicant stated that these considerations impaired the independence and impartiality of ORG and prevented her from receiving a fair hearing , in violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Government replied that the rules then in force governing the appointment of military judges to ORG and the guarantees which they enjoyed in the performance of their judicial functions on the bench were such as to ensure that these courts fully complied with the requirements of independence and impartiality within the meaning of LAW . The Government disputed the applicant \u2019s argument that military judges were accountable to their superior officers . In the first place , it was an offence under LAW for a public official to attempt to influence the performance by a military judge of his judicial functions ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Secondly , the career assessments of military judges relate only to their non - judicial duties . Military judges have access to their assessment reports and are able to challenge their content before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . When acting in a judicial capacity , a military judge is assessed in exactly the same manner as a civilian judge .", "CARDINAL . The Government added that the fact that a military judge had sat in ORG had not impaired the fairness of the applicant \u2019s trial . Neither the military judge \u2019s hierarchical superiors , nor the public authorities which had appointed him to the court had any interest in the proceedings or in the outcome of the case .", "The Government also impressed upon the ORG the need to have particular regard to the security context in which the decision to establish ORG was taken , pursuant to LAW . In view of the experience of the armed forces in the antiterrorism campaign , the authorities had considered it necessary to strengthen these courts by including a military judge in order to provide them with the necessary expertise and knowledge to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government further submitted that , by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE and PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE , amendments had been made to remove military judges from the bench of ORG with a view to complying with the requirements of the LAW . The ORG stated that ORG are currently composed of civilian judges only .", "CARDINAL . The Commission concluded that ORG could not be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal for the purposes of LAW . The Commission referred in this respect to the FAC v. GPE judgment of DATE ( Reports CARDINAL ) and the reasons supporting that judgment .", "CARDINAL . The ORG takes note of the changes made to the ORG system by virtue of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE and Law no . CARDINAL of DATE . However , for the purposes of the instant case it must confine its consideration to the legislation then in force and to the composition of ORG which tried and convicted the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that in its above - mentioned GPE v. GPE judgment of DATE ( p. CARDINAL ) and in its PERSON v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( Reports CARDINAL-VII , p. CARDINAL ) , it had to address arguments similar to those raised by the Government in the instant case . In those judgments the ORG noted , on the one hand , that the status of military judges sitting as members of ORG did provide some guarantees of independence and impartiality ( see the above - mentioned ORG judgment , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . On the other hand , the ORG found that certain aspects of these judges\u2019 status made their independence and impartiality questionable ( ibid . \u00a7 DATE ) : for example , the fact that they are servicemen who still belong to the army , which in turn takes its orders from the Executive ; the fact that they remain subject to military discipline ; and the fact that decisions pertaining to their appointment are to a great extent taken by the administrative authorities and the army ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant mentioned some of these shortcomings in her observations .", "CARDINAL . As in its ORG judgment , the ORG considers that its task is not to determine in abstracto the necessity for the establishment of ORG in the light of the justifications advanced by the Government . Its task is to ascertain whether the manner in which ORG functioned at the material time infringed the applicant \u2019s right to a fair hearing , in particular whether , viewed objectively , she had a legitimate reason to fear that the court which tried her lacked independence and impartiality ( see the abovementioned GPE judgment , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , and the above - mentioned PERSON judgment , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "As to that question , the ORG sees no reason to reach a conclusion different from that in the cases of GPE . GPE and PERSON , both of whom , like the present applicant , were civilians . It is understandable that the applicant - prosecuted in a ORG for disseminating propaganda aimed at undermining the national security of the ORG and public safety - should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer and member of ORG . On that account she could legitimately fear that ORG might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case . In other words , the applicant \u2019s fears as to that court \u2019s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified . The proceedings in ORG were not able to dispel these fears since that court did not have full jurisdiction ( see the abovementioned NORP judgment , p.CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE in fine ) .", "CARDINAL . For these reasons the ORG finds that there has been a breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that the restrictions on her right to freedom of expression , applied pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Prevention of Terrorism Act DATE , were inconsistent with the legitimate aims set out in LAW and were thus contrary to LAW , which provides :", "\u201c The restrictions permitted under this Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for which they have been prescribed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government did not address these allegations in their memorial .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that the restrictions which were applied to the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression were consistent with the legitimate aims contained in LAW . Accordingly , there had been no violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . For its part , the ORG does not see any reason for departing from the opinion of the ORG . It considers , therefore , that there has been no violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought just satisfaction under LAW , which provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto , and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made , the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not seek reparation for pecuniary damage but claimed ORG CARDINAL in respect of non - pecuniary damage . She alleged that she had to leave her country for GPE on account of the criminal proceedings against her , and was forced to live there as a refugee .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not comment on the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that the applicant must have suffered a certain amount of distress , having regard to the circumstances of her prosecution , trial and conviction . Deciding on an equitable basis , it awards her the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL which she claimed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also claimed the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for her costs and expenses , comprising of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for translations , postage fees and stationery , and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for her lawyer \u2019s fees . She did not supply any particulars in support of her claims .", "DATE . The Government expressed no opinion on the claim .", "CARDINAL . In view of the lack of substantiation of the claim , offset by the fact that the applicant clearly incurred some expenses , the ORG considers it reasonable to award the applicant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL by way of reimbursement of her costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . According to the information available to the ORG , the statutory rate of interest applicable in GPE at the date of adoption of the present judgment is PERCENT per annum ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["18"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
