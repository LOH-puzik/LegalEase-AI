NORP The applicant is an artist who exhibited her work \u201c FAC \u201d in an art gallery in GPE . On DATE the exhibition was opened for invited guests and on DATE it was opened to the public . The work included CARDINAL of photographs of teenage girls or otherwise very young women in sexual poses and acts . The pictures had been downloaded from free Internet pages and some of them were extremely violent or degrading .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police seized the pictures and the exhibition was closed down . On DATE the police seized the applicant \u2019s computer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor pressed charges against the applicant on CARDINAL counts . His decision to press charges was based on ORG ( apulaisvaltakunnansyytt\u00e4j\u00e4 , bitr\u00e4dande riks\u00e5klagaren ) decision to press charges in the matter . He also requested , inter alia , that the seized pictures be confiscated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) convicted the applicant of possessing and distributing sexually obscene pictures depicting children . The court found , by referring , inter alia , to LAW , that everybody had the right to freedom of expression as well as to freedom of the arts unless the exercise of these rights constituted a crime . Finding the applicant guilty was justified for the protection of morals . Moreover , the faces of many of the children or young women in the pictures were clearly recognisable and their reputation and right to private life had to be protected . Even though the applicant \u2019s intention had not been to commit a criminal act but , on the contrary , to criticise easy access to child pornography , possessing and distributing sexually obscene pictures depicting children were still criminal acts . Their criminalisation was based on the need to protect children against sexual abuse as well as against violation of their privacy . As to the sanctions , the court noted that the applicant had intended to provoke general discussion about child pornography . Taking into account also the other circumstances , inter alia , that the crimes were minor and excusable , the court did not impose any sanctions on the applicant . Instead , the court ordered all the pictures to be confiscated .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , requesting that the charges be dismissed . She claimed that her work as an artist had to be equated with the work of a journalist or a scientist , and that she had therefore had a justification for the possession and distribution of the pictures in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld ORG judgment . It found , inter alia , that the protection of the privacy of children took precedence over the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression . The fact that the identity of the children was not known or that the pictures could be illegally obtained elsewhere did not remove the applicant \u2019s criminal liability nor justify her acts .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , reiterating the grounds for appeal already presented before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The LAW of Finland ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag , Act no .
