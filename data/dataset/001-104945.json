CARDINAL of DATE and subsequent modifications must be interpreted to the effect that , in the event of transfer of contributions paid to foreign welfare entities to the NORP obligatory general insurance scheme , as a consequence of international social security treaties and conventions , the pensionable remuneration relative to the employment period abroad is calculated by multiplying the amount of transferred contributions by CARDINAL and dividing the result by the contribution rates for the invalidity , old - age and survivors insurance scheme , as applicable during the relevant contributory period .

By a writ of CARDINAL DATE , ORG questioned the legitimacy of LAW and remitted the case to ORG . ORG gave judgment on DATE , holding , in sum , as follows .", "CARDINAL . Although interpretative , LAW was innovative . There had been no conflicting case - law on the pension regime but a single well established interpretation , according to which the NORP worker could ask to transfer his or her contributions , paid in GPE , to the ORG , in order to obtain the advantages provided by NORP law on invalidity , old - age and survivors\u2019 insurance , including that of remuneration - based pension calculations , on the basis of the wages earned in GPE , irrespective of the fact that the transferred contributions had been paid at a much lower NORP rate .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the laws defining pension remuneration were part of a welfare system which balanced available resources and the services supplied . A change in calculating pensions from the contributory criterion to the remuneration - based one ( \u201c retributivo \u201d ) , was not to the detriment of the financial sustainability of the system . Thus , the changes brought about by the impugned PERSON sought to bring the relationship between pensionable remuneration and contributions in line with the system in force in GPE during the same period of time . The PERSON provided that remuneration received abroad ( used as a basis for pension calculations ) was to be adjusted by applying the same percentage ratios used for pension contributions paid in GPE during the same period . Thus , the norm made explicit what had been in the original interpretative provisions . Consequently , there had been no breach of the principle of legal certainty . Nor was the norm discriminatory since the acquired and more favourable rights of earlier pensioners were , by then , unassailable . Furthermore , the PERSON did not discriminate against people who had worked abroad , because it simply ensured an overall balance in the welfare system , and avoided the situation whereby persons who had made small contributions to a foreign pension scheme could receive the same pension as those who had paid the much higher NORP contributions . The contested PERSON did not provide for any ex post reductions , as it merely imposed an interpretation which could already have been inferred from the original provisions . Lastly , this system still allowed for a sufficient and satisfactory pension , adequate for the lifestyle of a worker . Accordingly , the claim of unconstitutionality of the said PERSON was manifestly ill - founded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
