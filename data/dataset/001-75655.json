DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Snejana Botoucharova", "TEXT": ["The NORP national , Mr PERSON , ( \u201c KFM \u201d ) , was born in DATE and died on DATE . His estate is the applicant in the present case , represented by his son , PERSON PERSON , ( \u201c N \u201d ) , who was represented before the Court by Mr FAC , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , of ORG , and their co - Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "At the time of ORG \u2019s death , he was divorced and had CARDINAL legitimate son , N , born on DATE .", "During his marriage , KFM had a relationship with a married woman , J , who gave birth to CARDINAL sons , B and P , in DATE and DATE respectively . From DATE until her death in DATE , J lived with ORG , who had by then divorced his first wife .", "Following ORG \u2019s death in DATE , B and P requested ORG ( ORG ) , under LAW ( Retsplejeloven ) , to establish their paternity , since in their view their father was KFM and not the man to whom their mother had been married .", "At a hearing before ORG on DATE , B and P testified that they had been told by their mother , PERSON , that ORG was their biological father as opposed to their legal father . Their legal father testified that he had divorced J because he suspected her of adultery and that J \u2019s family had told him that he was not the father of B and ORG testified that ORG had never said anything to him about having children with J and that when PERSON died in DATE , ORG had remarked that things were now settled \u201c with ORG family \u201d .", "By decision of DATE ORG decided , in view of the evidence adduced , that it could not be ruled out that ORG was the biological father of B and P , and that the estate of ORG should therefore be a party to the paternity proceedings in accordance with LAW . Moreover , in accordance with the said provision , forensic genetic tests should be carried out , as they might be expected to produce evidence of considerable weight for or against ORG being the biological father of B and ORG estate appealed against both decisions before ORG of Western Denmark ( ORG ) , which found against it on DATE .", "Accordingly , blood samples were taken from B and P , their legal father , CARDINAL of J \u2019s siblings , and a sister of ORG . N did not wish to participate in the genetic tests .", "Subsequently , on the basis of the samples provided , ORG ( ORG ) found it established that B and P \u2019s legal father , with a probability that exceeded PERCENT , was not their biological father . Moreover , it found that the results suggested that ORG , rather than some random man , was B and P \u2019s biological father , with probability ratios of ORG and CARDINAL respectively .", "CARDINAL testimonies were submitted before ORG by KFM \u2019s siblings , colleagues and acquaintances , all of whom endorsed the notion that ORG was B and P \u2019s father .", "On DATE B died .", "On DATE ORG answered CARDINAL questions put by ORG as to the likelihood of obtaining valid DNA results from the tissue of a deceased person .", "On DATE ORG decided , in accordance with section PERSON ) of ORG , that ORG body was to be exhumed for the purpose of taking DNA samples , as such samples were assumed to be of significant , and probably decisive , importance in establishing paternity , and were the only remaining option .", "ORG estate appealed against the decision before ORG which , by decision of DATE , amended ORG decision . It stated that the estate of the deceased was party to the paternity suit and that it was therefore obliged , pursuant to section CARDINAL ( k ) of ORG , to participate in tests which entailed providing blood samples or similar , if the court decided that such tests were necessary . Furthermore , it followed from section CARDINAL ( l ) of the LAW that the court could decide to use the various measures mentioned in LAW to compel parties to participate in such tests if they refused to do so voluntarily . ORG found , however , that in paternity cases neither ORG nor any other provision of NORP law provided a basis for taking body samples by the use of physical force , as opposed to measures to compel living persons to give samples . Hence , ORG found that tests of the kind ordered by ORG constituted interference with the sanctity of the grave and that such interference was comparable with the measures to compel living persons to give samples . ORG concluded that such interference could not be effected by force for the purpose of obtaining evidence in a paternity suit without an explicit legal basis , which ORG found did not exist in domestic law . Accordingly , ORG refused to order the exhumation of ORG and the taking of samples from his corpse for use in the paternity suit .", "P was granted leave to appeal against the judgment before ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) , which on DATE permitted the taking of biological material from ORG \u2019s corpse . In reaching its decision , ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c By decision of DATE ORG upheld ORG decision that the estate of [ KFM ] was a party to the paternity suit . That decision is not under review by ORG in the present case .", "Since [ P ] was born in DATE , it is the provisions inserted into ORG . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE in chapter CARDINAL ( a ) concerning the proceedings in paternity suits that are applicable , pursuant to the provisions on the entry into force of the Act contained in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Act No . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE amending ORG . The provisions of the said LAW concerning the court \u2019s duty to elucidate the case which are relevant in the present case are broadly similar to the provisions of ORG ( chapter DATE ( a ) ) currently in force . Hence , if the court considers forensic genetic testing of the parties to the case to be necessary , it may order such tests under section CARDINAL ( l ) of LAW , sections CARDINAL ( k ) and CARDINAL ( l ) of the DATE Act and section CARDINAL ( h ) ( CARDINAL ) of the current LAW . The reference therein to the provisions of ORG on measures to require witnesses to comply must be understood as specifying the measures which can be taken against a party who is alive , and are therefore without relevance if the test is to be carried out on a party who is deceased . \u201d", "The majority of ORG ( CARDINAL judges ) went on to state :", "\u201c The fact that ORG does not contain any specific rules on forensic genetic testing of deceased persons should not lead to the existing rules , according to which [ in a paternity case ] the court may decide to compel the parties to undergo genetic testing , being narrowly construed to mean that the [ existing ] legal basis does not cover testing of deceased persons .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW on PERSON \u2019s Inquests , Post - Mortem Examinations and Transplantation , etc . ( PERSON om ligsyn , obduktion og transplantation m.v . ) , interference with a corpse , other than the kind mentioned in LAW ( on post - mortem examinations ) and in chapter CARDINAL ( on transplantation ) , may be carried out only if the deceased person , having turned DATE , consented thereto in writing . According to the preparatory notes ( GPE DATE , till\u00e6g A , spalte CARDINAL ) , the above provision concerns interference with a scientific or educational purpose which is not carried out in connection with a post - mortem examination . It is not mentioned , however , whether the provision applies to other forensic tests under chapter DATE ( a ) of ORG [ that is , to paternity cases ] or to other civil proceedings involving the estate or a surviving relative in which it becomes necessary to carry out forensic tests on a deceased person in order to gather evidence .", "In these circumstances we consider that section CARDINAL of the Act on Coroner \u2019s Inquests , Post - Mortem Examinations and Transplantation does not restrict the legal basis provided by chapter CARDINAL ( a ) of ORG [ to the effect ] that , if deemed necessary , the court may decide that forensic genetic tests should be carried out , even on a deceased party . In its assessment , however , having regard to the principle of proportionality , the court must balance the extent of such interference with the need to elucidate the particular case .", "[ N ] having refused to participate in forensic genetic testing , tests have been carried out on all possible living persons [ in the case ] . In view of the fact that these tests , and the information submitted in the case , have confirmed [ P \u2019s ] allegation that [ KFM ] is his father , and in the light of the content of ORG letter of DATE , we uphold ORG decision of DATE authorising the taking of tissue samples from the deceased [ KFM ] . \u201d", "The minority of ORG ( CARDINAL judges ) found :", "\u201c Without the existence of clear support in section CARDINAL ( g ) and CARDINAL ( l ) of ORG [ No . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , in force at the relevant time , when P was born ] or the preparatory notes , we find it insufficiently established that these provisions confer authority to take blood samples or carry out other tests on the deceased .", "In our opinion it is a matter for the legislator to decide whether it should be possible to carry out such testing , and in the affirmative to indicate the specific conditions governing it . Accordingly , we vote in favour of upholding ORG decision . \u201d", "Following ORG decision , ORG \u2019s corpse was exhumed and tissue samples were taken . However , ORG was unable to make a typological classification of the samples , apparently owing to the time that had elapsed since ORG \u2019s burial .", "On DATE ORG of Holstebro delivered the following judgment :", "\u201c The forensic genetic tests carried out and the content of the written statements corroborate the claim that [ KFM ] is the father of [ B and P ] . The court does not find , however , that the test results and the statements can be given such weight as to prove with sufficient certainty that [ KFM ] had intercourse with the mother at the time of conception . Therefore , the court finds in favour of the defendant [ the estate of KFM ] . \u201d", "Accordingly , N , as the only legitimate son of KFM and sole heir , inherited the estate .", "ORG was amended by Act No . CARDINAL of DATE when a special chapter DATE ( a ) on paternity suits was inserted . The relevant provisions of this chapter read as follows :", "\u201c The court shall ensure of its own motion that the [ paternity ] case is elucidated .

When the circumstances strongly support such action and it can be taken without significant disturbance to the person in question , the court may also take steps to have other tests carried out on these persons , who shall be required to present themselves for tests , provide blood samples , etc .
