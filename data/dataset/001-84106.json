The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born out of wedlock . Her biological mother abandoned her outside the house of a woman who gave her to PERSON . The latter brought her up . Although estranged from her biological mother , the applicant did not lose all contact with her . In DATE , when the applicant was DATE , her biological mother , just before dying , told her the name of her biological father in the presence of the applicant 's son . Her mother died in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG requesting judicial recognition of paternity on the basis of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG Law CARDINAL ( hereinafter \u201c LAW ) . The respondent , whom the applicant claimed was her father , objected to the application and denied paternity . Without going into the merits of the paternity claim , he maintained that the applicant 's claim was time - barred under section GPE ) of the above - mentioned PERSON . The applicant claimed , in reply , that the aforementioned section and , in addition , section GPE ) of the same PERSON setting in motion the period of limitation on the date of entry into force of the PERSON rather than on the date when she acquired knowledge of her father 's identity , were unconstitutional . In particular , she argued that they were contrary to Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( the right to respect for private and family life ) , CARDINAL ( the principle of equality and non discrimination ) and QUANTITY ( the right of access to a court ) of the LAW . The applicant contended that she had been prevented from having recourse to court and from determining through judicial proceedings whether or not she was the respondent 's daughter . She had also been placed in a disadvantageous position with regard to other litigants who happened to acquire information concerning their father within the statutory time - limit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the respondent applied to the court for trial of the preliminary matter of whether the applicant 's claim was statute - barred . On DATE the applicant lodged an application requesting the court to refer the question to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following the agreement of the parties , decided to refer the issue of constitutionality of section GPE ) to ORG under LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of DATE ORG , by a majority ( Judges PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ) , held that sections GPE ) and GPE ) of LAW complied with the relevant provisions of LAW and the Convention . In particular , ORG noted the following :", "\u201c The applicant 's lawyer suggests that the violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW is caused by the fact that the applicant learnt the identity of her natural father in DATE . It was , consequently , objectively impossible to lodge the application for her recognition within the DATE period from the date the PERSON came into force . Therefore , as he concludes , LAW is also violated because the applicant is deprived of access to court to assert her statutory right , a right which originates directly from LAW , which protects private and family life . A further suggestion of the applicant 's lawyer , concerning unfavourable discrimination caused by the different time - limits for the exercise of other rights that are provided for by the PERSON , we will not deal with because it was not pursued .", "...", "The matters raised are extremely serious because they touch on the institution and the function of the family : the most important nucleus of society , the members of which are bound by the deepest and purest feelings of love and solidarity . The ORG considers self - evident the value of the institution of the family , which it also protects in its most powerful statute , LAW . This also regulates the whole range of family relationships \u2013 also on the basis of the criterion of their lawful functioning in society as a whole \u2013 in legislative rules which constitute the basis of the body of law known as LAW .", "The basis of our discussion is Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , corresponding to LAW , which was ratified by ORG by Law No . CARDINAL . Accordingly , the decisions of ORG on the matters with which we are concerned illustrate the approach to be taken , as does our jurisprudence .", "...", "In the recent decision of ORG of ORG in PERSON v. ORG ( DATE ) TIME , we dealt with the provisions of section DATE ) of the same PERSON , according to which the husband of the mother is barred from contesting paternity after DATE has elapsed from the time he is informed of the birth and the circumstances from which the conception of the child resulted . ORG had also addressed the same questions with reference again to Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY .", "We refer to our above decision , the reasoning of which we believe holds in the present case as well without being distinguished on any ground whatsoever . The legal principles , as discussed and adopted , are applicable here too .", "...", "The general principle which emerges from the decisions of ORG is that the right of access to court is subject to legitimate restrictions , precisely so that it can function rationally for all interested parties in the judicial process . The ORG considers that time - limits on the exercise of a right serve fundamental purposes inseparably interwoven with certainty about the rights of individuals and are intended to ensure the finality of the dispute .", "...", "ORG is distinguishable , as the applicant 's lawyer submits , in a situation where the child seeking recognition by its natural father learns his identity after its right has lapsed under the PERSON . In such a case , the lawyer asserts , the right is time - barred , as has happened in the case of the applicant .", "We do not agree with this submission . In the statute of limitations on civil rights the starting point of the time - limit is not the litigant 's knowledge of the particulars on the basis of which he will pursue his right , but the event which created the cause of action . And this is determined , in case of disagreement , by the court according to objective criteria . This principle was applied by ORG in the case of X. v. GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG laid emphasis on the decision of ORG in the case of GPE v. GPE ( decision of CARDINAL DATE , no . CARDINAL , Decisions and Reports CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , in particular the following extract :", "\u201c In the opinion of the Commission it must generally be accepted in the interest of good administration of justice that there are time - limits within which prospective proceedings must be instituted . It must also be accepted that the time - limit is final and that there is no possibility to institute proceedings even when new facts have arisen after the expiry of the time - limit . This is also true for paternity proceedings . ORG is furthermore of the opinion that a time - limit of DATE from the child 's birth as in the present case , is not an unreasonable time - limit for instituting paternity proceedings . Accordingly , the Commission finds that the fact that the applicant was not permitted to institute paternity proceedings does not disclose any appearance of a violation of LAW taken alone . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the provisions of sections GPE ) and GPE ) of LAW not only did not conflict with the provisions of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW but , on the contrary , were in line with the jurisprudence and reasoning which the ORG has adopted in the operation and application of the corresponding ORG . In this regard , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c We also note that the entirety of the provisions of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL which have occupied our attention create not only rights but also obligations . DATE does not operate only on behalf of the person resorting to the court but also on behalf of those who are being sued . All the interested parties before the court have the right to a fair trial in accordance with paragraph QUANTITY of the LAW , and the right to present their case , adduce evidence and examine witnesses , as provided for in paragraph CARDINAL of the same LAW . The right of protection of private and family life is provided for in paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ; in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL , however , interference with that right in accordance with the law is permitted for the protection of the rights and freedoms which the LAW guarantees to any other person . The principle of proportionality and balance of the rights is also based on the spirit and letter of those provisions , as is discussed in the passages we have cited above .", "In the particular question before us , it should not be overlooked that in the period which will have elapsed between the birth of the child born out of wedlock and the submitting of the application for paternal recognition , the putative father could have created his own family . The submitting of an application for paternal recognition and indeed when the putative father is advanced in age will without doubt cause upheaval in his family life . Therefore the recognition of the right to submit an application without time - limits may , on the one hand , have as a consequence the creation of a family for the child but , on the other , lead also to the break - up of another family , the family of the putative father . It is for this reason that the principle of proportionality must play the decisive role . Its correct and commensurate application dictates that the exercise of the relevant right be time - barred after a reasonable time has elapsed since the child 's birth . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , in view of the interesting and novel legal matter raised before it , ORG did not make an order for costs .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , a minority of ORG judges dissented ( Judges PERSON , PERSON , GPE , ORG ) . The minority found that section GPE ) of LAW was contrary to and incompatible with the provisions of LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW since it extinguished the exercise of the family right to recognition of paternity . They therefore considered that the application could not be considered time - barred .", "CARDINAL . The minority , following ORG judgment in GPE v. ORG ( ( DATE ) TIME ) , considered that the setting of a time - limit for the exercise of the civil right to recognition of paternity was acceptable provided that it was not oppressive and left a reasonable margin for the exercise of the right . The creation of an institution for the incorporation into the family of a child born out of wedlock was an obligation of the ORG that was imposed by both LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . They further observed that it was indisputable that the right of recognition of paternity constituted an integral aspect of the family life of the individual which LAW safeguarded . It was equally certain in their view that the exercise of this right by the child might be subject to reasonable time - limits . The crucial question was whether a time - limit for the exercise of the right could be set irrespective of the knowledge of the facts that constituted the right or even the possibility , viewed objectively , of the holder of the right acquiring knowledge of that right .", "CARDINAL . The minority also examined LAW , PERSON . DATE , and in this context stated the following :", "\u201c In civil law the setting of time - limits is related , as a rule , to the moment the cause of action arises . LAW , PERSON . DATE , provides for this . ...", "This principle is subject to CARDINAL categories of exceptions , namely :", "the impossibility of exercise of the right by persons affected by an impediment \u2013 minority ( under DATE ) , mental disturbance , prohibition from administering the individual 's affairs or absence from the country ; and", "the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake .", "In both cases the time - period for the exercise of the right is suspended for as long as the ignorance or impediment exists . The spirit by which LAW is inspired is that the ignorance of or the impossibility of defending rights suspends , within the framework we have explained , the time - limits .", "The subject of paternity belongs to established civil rights which touch on the existence of the individual . The recognition of paternity takes effect against all and marks the framework of the family of the individual ( see PERSON v. PERSON ( ( DATE ) CARDINAL C.L.R. CARDINAL ) .", "The question in the present case is whether the right which the person concerned is ignorant of DATE and , objectively , could not have ascertained \u2013 can lapse before it comes to the knowledge of the person entitled to exercise it . The right under discussion is protected as a fundamental human right by LAW . The question arises whether the extinction of the right , independently of the knowledge or the possibility of acquiring knowledge of its existence , is compatible with the respect for the right to family life , which LAW safeguards and of the right of recourse to court , which LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW safeguard . Taking the question further : is elimination ever possible of a fundamental right , the existence of which the person concerned does not know and about which he does not have the means of being informed ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The minority considered that the decision of ORG v. GPE ( cited above ) did not touch directly on the matter before them , which revolved round respect for the right to family life . They did , however , find that it indirectly shed some light on the point in issue to the extent that it maintained that the separate regulation of the claim by the child for recognition of paternity was a right of a peculiar character which was connected to the particularities of the quest for paternity by the child itself . The ORG 's judgment in the case of ORG and Others v. The GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no CARDINALC , p. CARDINAL ) , in which it was held that the limitations imposed by NORP law on the recognition of paternity constituted a violation of the right to family life , was directly relevant to the facts of the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . NORP The minority finally underlined that :", "\u201c The facts which relate to the paternity of a child relate to the time before its birth , in reality to the time which relates to its conception . Objectively , the child does not know , nor has it the means of discovering the facts surrounding its conception . The only persons who have authentic knowledge of these facts are the parents , each of them , primarily the mother . Chance knowledge , to the extent that the possibility of the paternity of a child is thought likely , may be acquired by third persons to the extent that the facts concerning the paternity of a child are rumoured , without it ever being certain that such possibility will come to the knowledge of the person affected . The setting of a time - limit for the exercise of the right to recognition of paternity , regardless and independent of the knowledge of facts that constitute it , reduces the right to the point of extinction . The core of the right to family life is violated and the right provided becomes only a right by law , and does not obtain respect . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
