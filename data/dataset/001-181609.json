Its registered office is in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , ORG , ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) made CARDINAL calls for tenders for the purpose of making awards for scientific research projects ; CARDINAL call was directed at private entities and the other at public research organisations . ORG announced that in DATE it would finance CARDINAL research hours , which were estimated to amount to CARDINAL NORP tolars ( SIT \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) . The research projects were to be evaluated under LAW . The applicant institute submitted a tender for research in the field of social sciences .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the ORG seems to have joined the proceedings for the CARDINAL tenders , but no formal decision regarding the joinder appears to have been made . On DATE the Ministry decided that the applicant institute would not be awarded any funding .", "CARDINAL . The applicant institute applied to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , seeking the setting aside of the ORG \u2019s decision . The action was granted by a decision of CARDINAL DATE and the case was remitted to ORG for reconsideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant institute lodged another action before ORG on account of the ORG \u2019s failure to adopt a decision within the prescribed time - limit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry again decided that the applicant institute would not be awarded any funding . It explained that the institute \u2019s research programme had been ranked fifth among the research programmes in the field of political sciences and that CARDINAL programmes in that group would receive funding . ORG pointed out that it was presumed that no conflict of interests existed , even when evaluators worked in the same institution whose tenders they were evaluating and that this was a common NORP practice . It was further noted that evaluators had signed a declaration of confidentiality and an undertaking to withdraw in the event that a conflict of interests was found .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to reflect the fact that the Ministry had adopted the decision of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant institute supplemented its action of DATE , which it had originally lodged on account of the ORG \u2019s failure to adopt a decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , with a request that the ORG \u2019s decision be set aside . It further urged ORG to decide that it would be awarded funding . It complained that ORG had joined the proceedings that had initially been intended for consideration of tenders from private research organisations to the proceedings for consideration of tenders from public research organisations , without issuing a formal decision to that effect . It also complained of errors in the evaluation of the competing programmes , because not all of the criteria specified in the Rules on Quality Assessment and Funding of the Public Research Organisation Programme had been taken into account . It argued , inter alia , that the evaluation procedure had been unfair because some of the evaluators had been biased , as they had been evaluating research programmes which were competing with the very programmes in which they themselves participated . This provoked a distortion of the results of the procedure , as shown by the fact that only those research programmes in which the evaluators were leaders or members of research teams obtained financing . The applicant institute expressly requested a hearing at which witnesses could be heard with regard to the alleged procedural errors in the evaluation of the programmes . Additionally , it submitted a letter of DATE which CARDINAL of the witnesses , PERSON , had sent to the Minister of Education , ORG and several other addressees . In the letter PERSON notified them of problems he had detected in the tender proceedings in which he had participated as an evaluator .", "CARDINAL . After the parties had exchanged a number of written submissions , ORG , without holding a hearing , dismissed the action . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE the court gave an extensive account of the proceedings before ORG and the submissions of both parties . The reasons for the decision were given on a single page . Invoking section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Zakon o upravnem sporu \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG chiefly referred to the submissions of ORG . It considered , among other things , that ORG had not acted unlawfully in joining the proceedings . It accepted the ORG \u2019s submission that its decision had been dictated by the nature of the research and infrastructural programmes , taking into account the guidelines of ORG . The court also pointed out that the procedural rules for the evaluation of research programmes adopted by ORG clearly defined the stages of the evaluation procedure , the participants in it and their tasks . Regarding the alleged conflict of interests , the court stated that it agreed with ORG as to why no such conflict existed and cited section PERSON ) of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As to the alleged errors in the evaluation of the competing programmes , the court merely disagreed with the applicant institute that not all criteria had been taken into account and again cited section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . No reasons were given for not holding a hearing . None of the evidence relied on by the applicant institute in their appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was acknowledged or referred to in the court \u2019s reasoning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant institute lodged an appeal on points of law . It complained that ORG had not held a hearing even though the facts of the case had been contested and the applicant institute had explicitly requested a hearing at which witnesses could be heard . It also argued that ORG had failed to address its allegations that errors had been made in the evaluation procedure , and complained that insufficient reasoning had been given for the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal as inadmissible . No reasons were given in its decision on the merits of the applicant institute \u2019s complaints .", "CARDINAL . The applicant institute then lodged a constitutional complaint , arguing , among other things , that the decisions of the ORG and the domestic court had been arbitrary and that the courts had failed to address its allegations that errors had been made in the evaluation procedure . It reiterated that the witnesses it had proposed had not been heard and that no hearing had been held .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant institute \u2019s complaint , finding that it did not concern an important constitutional question or entail a violation of human rights with serious consequences for the applicant institute ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
