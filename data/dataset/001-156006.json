Article CARDINAL ( o ) of the LAW empowers the federal legislature to provide for restrictive measures of this type in relation to convicted persons on whom a sentence has been imposed , which , as follows from LAW ... consist , by their very nature , in deprivation or restriction of the convict \u2019s rights and freedoms , as provided by law . At the same time , both the legislature , in establishing liability for a crime , and the law - enforcement agencies , in deciding on its application to an offender , are required to take into account the nature of the crime , the danger posed by it to the values defended by LAW and the criminal law , its seriousness , its causes and other circumstances in which the crime was committed , and also information about the offender , provided that regulation by those institutions , and their application , correspond to the constitutional principles of legal liability and guarantees to the individual in his or her public relations with the ORG .", "As ORG noted in [ its previous case - law ... ] , the legislative regulation of criminal liability and punishment without taking into account the offender \u2019s personality and other objective and reasonable circumstances which facilitate an appropriate assessment of the social danger posed by the criminal act itself and by the offender , and the application of identical sanctions for crimes that pose varying degrees of social danger , without taking into account the offender \u2019s degree of participation in the crime , his or her conduct subsequent to the crime and in serving a sentence where that has already been imposed , and other [ relevant ] factors , would both be contrary to the constitutional prohibition on discrimination and the principles of fairness and humanism expressed in LAW .", "In setting out criminal sanctions with a range of restrictions , corresponding to the gravity of the crime committed by the convict and the sentence imposed , and also in determining the manner in which that sentence is to be served , the legislature must proceed on the basis that convicts enjoy , as a whole , the same rights and freedoms as other citizens , with the exceptions determined by their individual personalities and the offences committed by them . The conditions for serving sentences , as laid down both in Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and in a range of other provisions of that Code , are intended to tailor sentences to individual offenders and differentiate sanctions and their application , and to create the preconditions for achieving the aims of punishment , which , as stated in LAW , are the restoration of justice , reform of the offender and the prevention of new crimes ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
