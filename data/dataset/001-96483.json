They were represented before the ORG by Mr H .- J. K\u00fchnel , a lawyer practising in LANGUAGE . PERSON Government PERSON ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON Wittling Vogel , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "A sales representative contacted the first applicant at his workplace in DATE and offered the applicants an investment involving the purchase of property financed by a loan . During the subsequent consultations at their home they were offered , in addition to the property , complete financing to be provided by ORG ( \u201c the bank \u201d ) . The sales representative handled both the marketing of the property and the arrangement of finance . In the context of this marketing scheme the sales representative provided prospect information on the investment and used standard form contracts .", "On CARDINAL and DATE the applicants purchased CARDINAL apartments for ORG MONEY ( DEM ) ( CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) plus additional charges ( notary , real estate transfer costs , etc . ) totalling ORG CARDINAL . The purchase agreements were signed before a notary , in accordance with the relevant NORP legislation . On the same dates charges were created on the properties .", "Solely in order to finance the purchase , on DATE the applicants took out a loan of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) from the bank , secured by the charges on the properties which were created by the notarised deeds of CARDINAL and DATE . The loan agreement contained no information regarding the right of cancellation within the meaning of the law on the cancellation of doorstep transactions or analogous transactions ( PERSON , hereafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) . The completed forms of the financing bank were provided to the applicants by the sales representative at their home , where they later signed them .", "The bank paid the loan directly to the company selling the immovable property in accordance with the applicants\u2019 instructions .", "In DATE the applicants realised that the immovable property had been worth PERCENT of its purchase price at the time of purchase . On DATE the applicants cancelled the loan agreement on the basis of Paragraph CARDINAL of LAW . They ceased to pay the DATE instalments under the loan agreement and offered to hand over their rights in respect of the purchased properties to the bank .", "On DATE the applicants applied for legal aid to pursue a claim to establish that they were not obliged to repay the amount of the loan to the bank and to order the bank to give them the notarised deeds . The applicants submitted that the purchase contracts and the loan agreement must be regarded as a single economic unit and that they were therefore merely required to retransfer ownership of the property pursuant to the fourth sentence of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the law on consumer credit ( ORG , hereafter \u201c Consumer LAW \u201d ) . They relied explicitly on the case - law of DATE Chamber of ORG and referred to the corresponding preliminary ruling proceedings then impending before ORG of ORG ( \u201c ECJ \u201d ) . The proceedings before the ECJ concerned the question whether the requirement under NORP law to immediately repay the loan proceeds plus interest at the market rate thereon to the bank upon cancellation of the loan agreement was in accordance with ORG , notwithstanding that the loan would not have been granted at all without the acquisition of the immovable property , served solely to finance it and was paid directly to the vendor .", "On DATE the ORG refused to grant the applicants legal aid . It found that their proposed claim lacked a reasonable prospect of success . It followed explicitly the case - law of the CARDINALth Chamber of ORG and disagreed with the case - law of ORG same court without giving any further reasons . It found that the applicants were obliged by law to repay the loan plus interest at the normal market rate upon the cancellation of the loan agreement . It observed that the impending proceedings before the ECJ were not relevant and , in any event , that ORG opinion was not favourable to the applicants .", "On DATE the GPE / ORG rejected the ORG appeal . It endorsed the arguments given by the lower court and observed that the case - law of ORG concerned the acquisition of a share in an investment fund financed by a loan .", "On DATE the GPE / ORG rejected the ORG allegation that they had not been heard properly .", "On DATE ORG ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) refused to admit the applicant \u2019s complaint . It found that the alleged violation of the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW was not sufficiently serious . The applicants would in any event not suffer a significant disadvantage by the refusal to admit their constitutional complaint . It observed that the impugned decisions were problematic in the light of its case - law regarding legal aid in proceedings concerning a difficult legal question which had not yet been decided by authoritative case - law . In this connection it referred to the deferring case - law of ORG and the impending preliminary ruling proceedings before the ECJ . Nevertheless , it found that the applicants could file a new request for legal aid to achieve their goal . In light of the case - law of ORG which , in the meantime had been enhanced , it was not excluded that the applicants would receive legal aid upon a new request .", "On DATE the applicants again requested legal aid with respect to the decision of the ECJ of DATE in the case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "On DATE the ORG refused to grant the applicants legal aid . It referred to the reasons set out in the decisions rendered in the first set of proceedings and observed that the decision of the ECJ was merely directed at ORG calling for further legislative measures .", "On DATE the GPE / ORG rejected the ORG appeal . It found that the decision of the ECJ of DATE in the case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL was not relevant . That case merely concerned a situation where , if the bank had complied with its obligation to inform the consumer of his right of cancellation , the consumer would have been able to avoid exposure to the risks inherent in investments . It observed that the applicants had concluded the purchase contract DATE than the loan agreement . Thus the bank \u2019s failure to inform them of their right of cancellation had no causal link with the investment .", "On DATE the GPE / ORG rejected the ORG allegation that they had not been heard properly .", "On DATE ORG ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , referring to its decision of DATE in the complaint concerning the applicants\u2019 first set of proceedings , refused to admit the ORG complaint , in which they had also raised the issue of an alleged obligation of ORG to suspend the proceedings and refer the question to the ECJ .", "On DATE the applicants applied for legal aid again with regard to ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and observed that in their opinion the enhanced case - law of ORG was not in accordance with the decisions of the ECJ of DATE .", "On DATE the ORG refused to grant the applicants legal aid . It referred to the reasons set out in the decisions in the previous proceedings for legal aid .", "On DATE the GPE / ORG rejected the ORG appeal . It found that ORG case - law according to which the purchase contracts and the loan agreement can not be regarded as a single economic unit pursuant to LAW was consistent with the decision of the ECJ of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . ORG further found that taking account of ORG case - law and the new criteria set up by it to establish liability of the financing bank for the purchase of the property , the ORG claim lacked a reasonable prospect of success . It again observed in this context that the applicants had concluded the purchase contract DATE before the loan agreement ; the bank \u2019s failure to inform them of their right of cancellation had thus no causal link with the investment . Furthermore , there was nothing to suggest that the purchased property had had a blatant deficiency as the applicants themselves had simply realised DATE after the purchase that its market value had been significantly lower than the purchase price .", "On DATE the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG .", "On DATE the applicants applied again for legal aid . They referred to the decision of the CARDINALnd ORG of CARDINAL DATE to seek a preliminary ruling of the ECJ as to whether the legal effects of the cancellation of a declaration of accession to a property fund under NORP law complied with Community law .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the applicants\u2019 new request for legal aid for lacking a reasonable prospect of success . It found that the new request for a preliminary ruling from the ECJ concerned a different issue and that the applicants had failed to make any submissions which would satisfy the requirements of ORG enhanced case - law . The applicants filed an appeal . The proceedings are apparently still pending .", "In the version applicable at the material time , paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW provided :", "\u201c Where the customer was induced to make a declaration of intention to conclude a contract for a service for valuable consideration :", "CARDINAL . by oral negotiations at his place of work or in a private home ,", "[ ... ]", "that declaration of intention takes effect only if the customer does not give written notice revoking it within DATE . \u201d", "Paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW provided :", "\u201c In the event of cancellation , each contracting party shall return to the other whatever it has received .

A purchase agreement constitutes a transaction linked with the credit agreement if the credit serves to finance the purchase price and both agreements are to be regarded as a single economic unit .

The consumer \u2019s declaration of intention to conclude the linked purchase agreement shall be valid only if the consumer does not revoke ... his declaration of intention to conclude the credit agreement .", "The notice concerning the right of cancellation ... must state that , in the event of cancellation , the purchase agreement linked with the credit agreement will not be valid either ...

If the consumer had been deceived with respect to the profitability of the fund , he would not be obliged to repay the loan but merely to transfer to the bank his share of the funds and his compensation claims .", "On DATE the CARDINALnd Chamber of ORG ( II ZR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) decided to refer the question whether the legal effects of the cancellation of a declaration of accession to a property fund according to NORP corporate law was in accordance with Community law for a preliminary ruling to the ECJ . The application of the corporate law rules resulted in the consumer being bound to participate in the fund \u2019s business developments for the period from his accession to giving notice of its cancellation according to the HWiG. The CARDINALnd Chamber observed that the mere ex nunc effect of the cancellation according to corporate law was justified in its opinion as it safeguarded not merely the interests of the debtees of the fund but also of the other members of the fund who were typically also consumers .", "According to the established case - law of the CARDINALth Chamber of ORG a secured credit agreement and a property purchase contract could , pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL , not be regarded as linked transactions within the meaning of LAW of LAW . In case of the cancellation of a secured credit agreement according to the NORP the consumer was obliged to repay the loan immediately in full , plus interest at the market rate . The cancellation of the secured credit agreement did not affect the validity of the purchase contract for immovable property financed by that credit agreement .", "In its judgment in Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Heininger [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , the ECJ held that ORG DATE to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business LOC ( the Directive ) applied to secured credit agreements , that is to say , credit agreements for financing the purchase of immovable property .", "In its judgments of DATE in Cases C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL PERSON and PERSON v. ORG and PERSON v. PERSON and Others the ECJ held :", "With respect to the judgments of the ECJ of DATE the CARDINALth Chamber of the Federal Court of Justice developed its case - law . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( XI ZR CARDINAL ) it reiterated that a secured credit agreement and the property purchase contract did not constitute a linked transaction within the meaning of Paragraph CARDINAL of the VerbrKrG. It found that the consumer did not have a compensation claim on account of the bank \u2019s failure to inform him of his right of cancellation , if the property purchase contract had been concluded before the loan agreement . In this case informing the consumer of his right of cancellation would not have enabled the consumer to avoid exposure to the risks inherent in investments . Therefore , there was no causal link which would allow the consumer to claim damages . However , it found that in the case of institutionalised cooperation between the seller and the financing bank , when the seller or intermediary salesperson also arranged the finances for the investment , and the information provided by the seller or intermediary salesperson would have been obviously incorrect , the financing bank \u2019s knowledge of the seller \u2019s malicious deceit would be presumed . Under these circumstances the bank would have a duty of disclosure with regard to the profitability of the investment . Non - compliance with this duty would give rise to financial liability on the part of the bank .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure representation by counsel is compulsory for the parties in civil proceedings before ORG , ORG and ORG .", "The conditions for legal aid are laid down in section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure . According to that section , a party who in view of his or her personal and economic situation can not afford the costs for conducting the proceedings is granted legal aid upon application if the intended legal action offers sufficient prospects of success and does not appear wanton ( mutwillig ) .
