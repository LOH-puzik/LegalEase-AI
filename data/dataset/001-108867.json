NORP In accordance with LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , the union \u2019s elected president applied to ORG for the union to be granted legal personality and entered in the register of trade unions .", "CARDINAL . The representative of the ORG opposed the application . He acknowledged that the members of the union were employed by the ORG on individual contracts , but argued that the internal regulations of ORG , approved by Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL , prohibited the establishment of any form of association without the archbishop \u2019s prior consent .", "CARDINAL . The union \u2019s representative pursued his application , pointing out that the statutory requirements for establishing a trade union , as set out in LAW , were fulfilled and that the LAW in question did not bar the professional groups concerned in this case from forming a union .", "CARDINAL . The public prosecutor \u2019s office supported the application , expressing the view that the establishment of the union was lawful and that the ORG \u2019s internal regulations could not prohibit it , as the priests and lay persons concerned were all employed by the ORG and as such were entitled to form an association to defend their rights .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court allowed the union \u2019s application and ordered its entry in the register of trade unions , thereby granting it legal personality .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court based its decision on the provisions of LAW no . CARDINAL , DATE ORG , LAW , LAW .", "CARDINAL . It noted that LAW ( Law no . DATE ) allowed religious organisations to operate independently as long as there was no threat to national security , public order , public health , morals and fundamental rights and freedoms . Noting further that it was not disputed that the union \u2019s members were employed on contracts , it held that as a result , their right to organise , which was guaranteed by labour law , could not be made subject to their employer \u2019s prior consent .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the Church \u2019s internal regulations , the court held that the fact that priests had a duty of subordination and obedience vis - \u00e0 - vis their employer under LAW could not justify restricting a right guaranteed by labour legislation since such a duty did not constitute a measure that was necessary in a NORP society in the interests of national security , public safety , the prevention of disorder or crime , the protection of health or morals , or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others .", "CARDINAL . Reviewing the union \u2019s constitution , the court found that its establishment was not necessarily a manifestation of a dissident faction within ORG with a disregard for hierarchy and traditions , but that , on the contrary , it might encourage employer - employee dialogue regarding the negotiation of employment contracts , observance of working and non - working hours and the rules on remuneration , protection of health and safety at work , vocational training , medical cover and the right to elect representatives and stand for election to decision - making bodies , in accordance with the special characteristics of the ORG and its spiritual , cultural , educational , social and charitable purpose .", "CARDINAL . The NORP appealed against the court \u2019s judgment , submitting that the provisions of domestic and international law on which it had been based were not applicable to the present case . It argued that LAW guaranteed religious freedom and the autonomy of religious communities and that this principle could not be overridden by freedom of association . It further submitted that by acknowledging the trade union \u2019s existence , the court had interfered with the traditional organisation of the ORG , thus undermining its autonomy .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG allowed the appeal , quashed the first - instance judgment and , on the merits , refused the application for legal personality and for entry in the register of trade unions .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that LAW no . CARDINAL guaranteed the autonomy of religious communities and their right to make their own organisational arrangements in accordance with their internal regulations . It further noted that there was no reference to the concept of a trade union in the Statute of ORG , which provided that the establishment , operation and dissolution of religious associations and foundations were subject to the blessing of ORG and that priests had a duty of obedience towards their superiors and could not undertake civil transactions , including those of a personal nature , without their prior written approval .", "CARDINAL . It held that the prohibition on setting up any form of association within the ORG without the consent of the hierarchy was justified by the need to protect the NORP tradition and its founding tenets , and that if a union were to be established , the ORG hierarchy would be obliged to work together with a new body operating outside that tradition and the rules of canon law governing decision - making .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , it noted that under PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , persons performing management functions were not allowed to form trade unions and , bearing in mind that under LAW , priests assumed leadership of their parishes , concluded that they were covered by this ban .", "CARDINAL .
