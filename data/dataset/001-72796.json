{"ITEMID": "001-72796", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FIN", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "PAULOW v. FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , Director in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a businessman and a trader . In the course of his trading activities the applicant has built up a considerable fortune by way of increasing the value of companies which he owns and operates . It is the sale of CARDINAL of these companies , ORG ( \u201c T \u201d hereinafter ) , and the tax levied on the transaction that has led to this application .", "On DATE the applicant sold the shares of T to a company called ORG to be further sold to a party to be later nominated by the buyer . The sales price of the shares was MONEY ( ORG ; MONEY ( ORG ) ) . The buyer company went into liquidation DATE after the transaction . According to the applicant he in no way contributed to the financing of the transaction and did not own any joint undertakings with the buyer . The Government contended that the transaction had been given a form disguising its real nature as a transfer of assets ( taseyhti\u00f6kauppa , skalbolagstransaktion ) . The ORG maintained that the assets of T were transferred to another company also owned by the applicant and the company was allegedly sold at a price significantly exceeding the net amount of the company \u2019s assets .", "In the regular taxation for DATE the applicant was taxed for the capital gains . The tax payable amounted to ORG CARDINAL ( approximately FAC ) . The applicant paid in full the tax levied on him .", "On DATE ORG ( verohallitus , skattestyrelsen ) sent an internal letter titled \u201c Abuses related to avoir fiscal tax rebates \u201d to county tax offices ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninverovirasto , l\u00e4nsskatteverk ) . In the letter it was held that the amount of tax refunds issued in probable abuse of LAW ( laki yhti\u00f6veron hyvityksest\u00e4 , lag om gottg\u00f6relse f\u00f6r bolagsskatt ; DATE , which entered into force on DATE ) was significant in some regions for DATE . The county tax offices were prompted to select the most significant refund recipients so that possible abuses might be addressed in connection with the dividend recipients\u2019 regular taxation . In an accompanying memorandum it was explained , inter alia , that dividend receiving companies were entitled to an avoir fiscal tax rebate and that if it was a loss - making company it would receive a tax refund . The avoir fiscal system was most commonly exploited in connection with so - called balance sheet company transactions , such a company having no tangible assets but only cash assets and receivables . Attention had to be paid to transactions whereby the company \u2019s balance sheet and deferred tax liabilities were transferred to a buyer while the company \u2019s actual business assets were transferred to a new company ( often owned by the vendor ) . The buyer of the balance sheet obtained a tax refund which was paid over to the seller together with the dividends as part of the purchase price . Such transactions could be executed with the intention of not paying any tax .", "From DATE , there was a tax inspection concerning the transfer of shares from the applicant \u2019s company . On DATE , the applicant was sent a preliminary tax inspection report by ORG ( verotoimisto , skattebyr\u00e5n ) .", "On DATE ORG sent an internal memorandum titled \u201c Transfer of assets arrangements and taxation \u201d to , inter alia , county tax offices . In an accompanying letter it was explained that the memorandum discussed transfer of assets arrangements involving so - called balance sheet companies and various principles related to the tax treatment of those arrangements . In order to develop the said memorandum further , county tax offices were invited to express their views on the positions taken in the memorandum .", "On DATE ORG issued a final report . On the basis of that report , ORG found on DATE that there were no reasons to reassess the taxes paid by the applicant for DATE .", "The competent tax agent of GPE ( veroasiamies , skatteombudet ; \u201c the Agent \u201d hereinafter ) however considered that the nature of the above - mentioned transaction was not an \u201c arm \u2019s length \u201d sale , but a transaction intended to benefit the applicant in violation of the Revenue \u2019s right to tax . The Agent appealed on DATE against the decision and recommended to ORG ( verotuksen oikaisulautakunta , pr\u00f6vningsn\u00e4mnden i beskattnings\u00e4renden ) that a re - assessment of tax be imposed making the applicant liable for tax for DATE to the extent of the full sales price of ORG CARDINAL on the grounds that the transaction was a disguised means of taking out dividends , i.e. benefit from the company .", "On DATE the applicant objected to the requests in written observations maintaining that the transaction was a true arm \u2019s length transaction . The applicant , inter alia , criticised the Agent \u2019s arguments insofar as the Agent had claimed that an affidavit made by a managing director of the bank responsible for the financial arrangements for the transactions ( submitted by the applicant previously to ORG ) was unreliable . The applicant also rejected the Agent \u2019s criticism of a statement by a tax expert also submitted previously by the applicant .", "On DATE ORG decided that arrangements violating LAW ( verotuslaki , beskattningslag ) had been undertaken in order for the applicant to be able to transfer the assets of the company to himself with as little tax consequences as possible . It held that the transfer of assets was in fact a disguised means of taking out dividends from company ORG calculated the tax from the entire sales price to cover the amount considered to actually have benefited the seller , i.e. FIM CARDINAL ( MONEY ) , on which a MONEY tax surcharge ( veronkorotus , skattef\u00f6rh\u00f6jning ) was imposed . The tax surcharge totalled QUANTITY . The decision was based on sections CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON demanding quashing of the entire tax decision . The applicant maintained , inter alia , that no such changes had occurred in case law between the report of the tax auditors and the decision of ORG that would have provided the latter with a valid basis for viewing the reassessment of tax issue differently from the tax auditors or ORG . The applicant also emphasised that no discussions took place in connection with the audit about the transaction at issue , and that he had only had an opportunity to provide his response after he received a preliminary report . The applicant further maintained that ORG had reviewed the matter more on the basis of impressions created by the preliminary report than by considering the actual facts of the case and had replaced facts with suppositions . The applicant also claimed that the chairman of ORG was biased . He further maintained that ORG had examined the matter on the basis of the tax authority \u2019s treatment of abuses related to the avoir fiscal system and maintained that nothing was known about the avoir fiscal system and the opportunities it presented for gaining tax - related advantages in DATE . In that context he referred to the first guidelines on abuses being issued by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE ORG submitted to the court a statement from the Agent , and on CARDINAL DATE the applicant submitted his comments on the statement .", "On DATE ORG submitted further documents .", "On DATE , the applicant lodged further evidence .", "On DATE ORG issued an order prohibiting the enforced collection of the taxes in question until DATE ( later extended during DATE ) . This was as ORG was expected to give judgment in cases concerning the imposition of taxes in cases concerning the circumstances in which share transactions constituted a transfer of assets . ORG issued its decisions in these cases on DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal without an oral hearing . It held that there had been no economic business grounds for the transaction at issue , that the measures did not comply with the actual nature and purpose of the matter and in reality the cash assets of the company had been used to pay the purchase price to the applicant . In the circumstances it had to be deemed that the arrangement had been undertaken in order to evade taxes contrary to sections CARDINAL of LAW . It further concluded that the amount of surcharge to be paid was not unreasonable .", "On DATE the applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) repeating his earlier requests and arguments and providing further observations on the findings of ORG , in particular alleging that its decision was not consistent with legal precedent .", "On DATE , the Agent submitted observations , as did ORG Helsinki on DATE . On the latter date the applicant was requested to submit his comments . Following an extension in the time - limit , the applicant submitted his further observations on DATE . The applicant emphasised , inter alia , that the whole proceedings were based on allegations and suppositions as ORG operated on the basic premise that the matter had from the start involved bad faith although not the least shred of evidence has been produced in support of this presumed bad faith .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "The tax imposed together with the tax surcharge and interest on arrears was in DATE approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( verotuslaki , beskattningslag ; DATE , as in force up to and including DATE ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ) contained the general rule applicable to cases of tax evasion , under which taxes may be reassessed so as to correspond to the real nature of transactions , irrespective of their legal form . Pursuant to subsection CARDINAL , the tax payer must be given an opportunity to comment on each relevant point .", "Section CARDINAL , as in force at the relevant time , provided for the taxation of assets taken out of a company as veiled dividends ( peitelty osinko , f\u00f6rt\u00e4ckt dividend ) .", "Under LAW ( as in force at the relevant time and up to and including DATE ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ) a tax surcharge was to be imposed , inter alia , where the taxpayer had , knowingly or grossly negligently , given incorrect information in the tax return or otherwise given wrong information or documents , a surcharge of a maximum of MONEY was to be imposed . The tax surcharge was imposed on that income in respect of which defective or incorrect information had been provided . According to the provision there was no discretion as to the imposition of the tax surcharge in the described circumstances ( see Government PERSON ) .", "Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , ( which was amended on DATE ( Act CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and which was for the first time applied to the assessment of taxes levied for DATE and which Act was in force until and including DATE ) provided , inter alia , that where the taxpayer had , knowingly or grossly negligently , given incorrect information in the tax return or otherwise given wrong information or documents , a surcharge of CARDINAL per cent of the additional amount of taxes was to be imposed , if there were no particular reasons against the imposition of the tax surcharge . The amended provision enabled the local tax offices to use their discretion as to whether or not to impose the tax surcharge .", "Section CARDINAL , as in force at the relevant time , provided that if a taxpayer , due to the fact that he had not given a tax return or he had given a defective , misleading or wrong tax return or other information or document , had not been taxed fully or taxed only in part , the tax which had not been levied for the said reason was to be levied with interest on the arrears and with a tax surcharge . The re - assessment could be conducted within DATE from DATE which followed the termination of the taxation . If possible , the taxpayer was to be given an opportunity to be heard before the reassessment of tax . However , if the hearing of the taxpayer would probably not benefit the decision making , there was no need to give the taxpayer a possibility to be heard . The said section corresponds in substance to section CARDINAL of the existing LAW ( laki verotusmenettelyst\u00e4 , lag om beskattningsf\u00f6rfarande ; DATE , as in force as from DATE ) with the exception of a strict obligation to give the taxpayer a possibility to be heard .", "The provisions concerning appeal contained in LAW ( as amended by LAW effective as from DATE ) were in substance the same as in the provisions in the existing LAW .", "Under section DATE of LAW , as in force at the relevant time , an appeal against a decision on taxation shall , as a first instance , be made to ORG . Appeal from the ORG lay to ORG and then , with leave to appeal , to ORG .", "In the appeals procedure the interests of the ORG or other tax recipients were represented by a tax agent ( ORG , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) : verohallintolaki , lag om skattef\u00f6rvaltningen DATE as in force at the relevant time ) .", "According to the reservation made by GPE in accordance with LAW , as in force at the relevant time , GPE could not guarantee a right to an oral hearing in so far as the NORP laws at the time of the events at issue did not provide such a right . This applied , inter alia , to proceedings which were held before ORG , in accordance with LAW of ORG ( laki l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeuksista , lag om l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tt ) and proceedings before ORG , in accordance with LAW ) of ORG ( laki korkeimmasta hallinto - oikeudesta , lag om h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) and in which the decision subject to appeal was rendered before DATE .
