They drew up reports relating this version of the events . ORG authorities were informed on DATE and no further inquiries were made .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE , however , Colonel PERSON , the commanding officer of the ORG in LOC , was told that evidence given to the LOC police implicated his soldiers .

As their statements differed in some respects , however , Colonel PERSON interviewed PERSON again .

The report stated , inter alia : \u201c ... from the evidence obtained in the course of this inquiry it may be concluded that Captain Serves ... was wholly responsible . He acted outside the scope of his duties , breached instructions and issued orders conflicting with those he had received concerning the use of weapons and ammunition . ... As an officer in command of a ORG unit , he knew that in giving such orders he would be blindly obeyed .

In his commanding - officer report of CARDINAL DATE to the ORG Chief of Staff he mentioned a rumour that the poacher had been \u201c finished off \u201d by Corporal NORP and concluded that PERSON and the applicant bore the responsibility , which was \u201c weighty \u201d in the latter 's case .

A commanding - officer report of DATE gives an account of this and concludes : \u201c The facts which I have reported seem to me to be credible at this stage . In any event , it would appear difficult for me to pursue my investigations now that most of the protagonists are being dealt with by the courts . Keeping deliberately within the strict confines of the commanding - officer inquiry , I confirm that the responsibility lies mainly , as I have already stated , with the CARDINAL officers in question . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On the same dates the investigating judge consequently ordered him to pay fines of MONEY ( ORG ) , ORG CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL respectively . The applicant appealed against those orders to ORG of ORG . His main argument was that as , in its judgment of DATE , the ORG had expressly declared that the preliminary inquiry and the messages of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE on which his DATE charge had been based remained effective , there was incriminating evidence against him such as enabled him to be charged , so that he could not be examined as a witness without his defence rights being infringed and a breach of LAW being committed .

In dismissing the objection that the prosecutor 's application of CARDINAL DATE for a judicial investigation was void because it referred to CARDINAL inquiry reports based on statements obtained , in breach of the rules of criminal procedure and the rights of the defence , from persons against whom proceedings had been brought , ORG stated that ' the fact that the report of the commanding - officer inquiry carried out in connection with separate administrative proceedings was added to the case file so that the parties could present argument on it can not invalidate the judicial proceedings , which alone are governed by LAW and LAW and that ' the application , which was partly based on the commanding - officer inquiry , can not be declared void ' .", "In so holding , the body supervising the judicial investigation did not infringe the provisions relied on in the ground of appeal [ including LAW ] .", "It follows that the ground of appeal can not be accepted . ...", "In dismissing the application for the proceedings to be declared void on the grounds that the investigating judge should not have summoned the appellant to appear before him as a witness or have examined Corporal [ J. ] or Staff Sergeant [ B. ] in that capacity since they had all been implicated by the commanding - officer inquiry , and that certain statements set out in the order transferring the case for submission to ORG , concerning the length of time the accused had each spent in detention , were incorrect and had been taken from documents pertaining to the proceedings that had been declared void , the judges below noted in the first place that when PERSON was summoned before the investigating judge , the investigation had not yet established his precise role , and that it was not until DATE that , in the light of the evidence taken from a large number of witnesses and [ Lieutenant C.
