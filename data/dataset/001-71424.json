{"ITEMID": "001-71424", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "MLT", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "ABDILLA v. MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( GPE ) . He is represented before the ORG by Mrs M.A. Farrugia and PERSON , CARDINAL lawyers practising respectively in GPE and in GPE ( GPE ) . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Attorney General .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant owned a farm and an adjacent portion of land in GPE , close to a road called FAC . According to the original Government development schemes , a small part of this land should have been expropriated in order to widen the road with QUANTITY .", "In DATE the NORP authorities entered into the property of the applicant , demolished parts of it and took QUANTITY of it .", "By LAW of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) , issued in terms of ORG LAW of LAW ) , it was declared that the property taken from the applicant was required for a public purpose .", "LAW was published in ORG of CARDINAL DATE , as required by LAW . At the relevant time , this publication did not transfer the ownership of the land to the Government . In particular , it was provided that the Commissioner of Lands should serve a copy of LAW on the owner of the land , together with a \u201c notice to treat \u201d informing him or her about the amount that the Commissioner was willing to pay . The owner subsequently had DATE to state the amount which he claimed as compensation .", "If the owner and the Commissioner agreed on the amount of the compensation due , either party could request ORG to make an order carrying the agreement into effect . In case of disagreement between the owner and the Commissioner , the latter should file an application with ORG requesting it to determine the amount of compensation due . In either case , a public deed of transfer had to be signed by the ORG and the owner .", "In the present case , until DATE the Commissioner of Lands did not serve on the applicant LAW and the notice to treat . Therefore , the procedure to compensate the applicant and to transfer the legal ownership of the land was not initiated .", "In DATE LAW of the Laws of GPE was amended . Under the new LAW , ownership of the property is transferred upon publication of LAW in the Government Gazette . According to the new rules , LAW should state the amount that the Government will pay as compensation , to be deposited in an interest - bearing bank account . If the owner of the land does not consider this amount adequate , he may institute proceedings before ORG .", "According to a transitory provision of law , when , as in the applicant \u2019s case , LAW had been issued before the entry into force of the DATE amendments , the President should issue a fresh declaration wherein he shall state the amount of compensation which the Commissioner of Lands is willing to pay . According to the information provided for by the applicant on DATE , on that date no such fresh Presidential Declaration had been served on him . As a consequence , the applicant is still the legal owner of the land .", "The applicant alleged that in the meantime one of his neighbours , Mr PERSON , had been planning to develop his property into a petrol station and had been preparing the necessary infrastructures to do so . According to the applicant , PERSON was known as being very well connected with the then current administration . The applicant \u2019s allegations were disputed by the Government on the ground that they were unsubstantiated .", "The original Government development schemes were not followed , and FAC , PERSON was widened and re - aligned differently . According to the applicant , the result of these changes was that motor vehicles were driven into the planned petrol station and evasive action should be taken if a vehicle did not want to enter into it . If a vehicle had continued straight , it would have collided into the wall of PERSON property . Since DATE ORG had requested the road department to re - locate the wall in issue , which was eventually demolished and moved backward .", "The applicant produced a plan which was annexed to LAW . According to the applicant , this document showed that the land was expropriated in such a way to make the main road lead directly into the property of PERSON , thus creating an unnatural series of S bends . The re - alignment and widening of the road directed the traffic into CARDINAL deviations , one to the left into the applicant \u2019s property , then to the right to meet the roundabout alignment and finally to the left again to continue on the main road .", "The Government disputed these allegations . They argued that the description given by the applicant was \u201c charged with poetic licence and substantially misleading \u201d . Relying on CARDINAL photographs and on an aerial view of the area in question , they challenged the view that the taking of part of the applicant \u2019s land was done also in order to facilitate access to the petrol station .", "The allegedly planned petrol station was never opened .", "On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction against the NORP Secretary for ORG and against the Commissioner of Lands . He claimed that he had been deprived of his property illegally and without compensation and alleged a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW of GPE as well as of LAW No . CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that LAW of DATE was null and void and requested to be reinstated in his possession and to be granted a financial compensation for the loss suffered .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims . It held that as the acts complained of took place before DATE ( date of the incorporation of the Convention into the NORP legal system ) , it had no power to decide on the alleged breach of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW No . CARDINAL . As far as the LAW of GPE was concerned , there was no doubt that the applicant could have invoked the alleged breach of LAW ( right to the protection of home ) in front of the ordinary courts , asking them to impede the authorities from demolishing his farm .", "The same could not be said with regard to LAW ( protection of property ) ; however , it was apparent that the expropriation was done for a \u201c public purpose \u201d . This did not exclude the possibility that the expropriation might have involved the interest of third parties , provided that the use made by the said parties was connected with or ancillary to the public interest or utility . In the present case , in DATE the architect of ORG had expressed the view that the realignment of the road was inevitable and in DATE ORG had written to ORG to confirm that the expropriation had to be done . The latter was part of a project involving the entire road linking ORG and the town of GPE .", "It was true that according to the original plan , the applicant \u2019s property was going to be only slightly affected . However , the project was changed and the road went much deeper into the applicant \u2019s land , leading to a petrol station , owned by PERSON ORG could accept that the expropriation was done also in the interests of third parties , but this did not exclude the existence of a public purpose , as there was no doubt that a petrol station was of utility to the public .", "The applicant appealed to ORG .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared that the taking of the applicant \u2019s property before the issuing of LAW of DATE constituted a violation of the plaintiff \u2019s right of property ( guaranteed by LAW ) and granted him a compensation amounting to CARDINAL NORP Liras ( Lm \u2013 approximately QUANTITY ( EUR ) ) . ORG confirmed the judgment of ORG as to the remainder and decided that the legal expenses should be borne CARDINAL by the applicant and CARDINAL by the respondents .", "ORG first observed that LAW was only the commencement of the expropriation procedure , which entailed an interference with the right guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL lasting until the individual was unable to enjoy his possessions or until there was effective transfer of property . Thus , notwithstanding the fact that LAW was issued before DATE , the matter felt within the competence ratione temporis of ORG .", "As to the lawfulness of the expropriation , it was to be noted that the authorities had entered the applicant \u2019s property and demolished his farm already in DATE . This action was illegal as it was taken prior to the issuing of LAW and without prior notification . Moreover , the applicant did not have at his disposal any adequate means of redress , as any judicial action he might have commenced would have been nullified by the issuing of LAW .", "As far as the applicant was complaining that the expropriation was not done for a public purpose , but to serve the interests of PERSON , the Constitutional Court observed that only a deprivation of property effected for no reason other than to confer a private benefit on a private party could not be \u201c in the public interest \u201d . As ORG had pointed out in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , the compulsory transfer of property from CARDINAL individual to another might , depending upon the circumstances , constitute a legitimate aim for promoting public interest . ORG therefore did not see any reason to depart from ORG finding that , after the issuing of LAW , the expropriation pursued a legitimate aim .", "The acquisition of land for public purposes is regulated by LAW of LAW . As amended in DATE , the relevant provisions of this LAW read as follows .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL", "\" ( a ) With respect to land subject to a declaration by the President before the coming into force of this article ... article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Ordinance as amended by this article shall apply ... Provided that the interests as aforesaid shall be calculated on the value of the land on the date of the President \u2019s Declaration or where no such Declaration was issued prior to the coming into force of this article on the date of taking over by Government of the land in question .", "( b ) ( i ) The President may in relation to any land subject of a LAW issued before the coming into force of this article issue a fresh Declaration wherein shall be stated the amount of compensation which the competent authority is willing to pay for the land to which the LAW refers . ...

Such sum shall be freely withdrawn together with any interests accrued thereon by the person or persons entitled to such compensation upon evidence to the entitlement thereto , in a manner satisfactory to the competent authority .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) Where the person entitled to compensation does not accept that the amount deposited is adequate , such person may apply to ORG for the determination of the compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance .
