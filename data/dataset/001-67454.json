The late PERSON heirs PERSON and PERSON are NORP nationals born in DATE and DATE and resident in GPE . The estate of PERSON also acts as an applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are the owners of the real property ORG ( registered as number ORG ; \u201c the ORG mansion \u201d ) in the village of the same name , currently part of the city of Tammisaari ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants claim ownership in the form of a right of permanent usufruct ( in NORP vakaa hallinta - oikeus ; in NORP st\u00e4ndig besittningsr\u00e4tt ) in respect of the property PERSON ( registered as number CARDINAL ) in the village of the same name , also within the city limits of Tammisaari . The property comprises CARDINAL hectares of water and some islands totalling QUANTITY . The islands originally belonged to the NORP Crown ( \u201c Crown land \u201d ; kruununluontoinen maa , jord av krononatur ) .", "CARDINAL . Around DATE the then owners of the ORG mansion ( kartano , s\u00e4teri ) were afforded the right to make use of the ORG - H\u00f6gholm islands in return for an DATE levy ( s\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00f6n\u00e4isvero , stadga or stadgad r\u00e4nta ) . The levy was collected from DATE . That arrangement was maintained by a decision of the ORG of the then GPE on CARDINAL DATE . The decision noted the following :", "( In NORP ) \u201c ... s\u00e5 emedan dessa holmar \u00e4ro p\u00e5f\u00f6rde stadgade r\u00e4ntor och sedan medlet af DATE \u00e5rhundradet op\u00e5taldt innehafts ... pr\u00f6ve VI sk\u00e4ligt f\u00f6rklara desamma skola som hitintills f\u00f6rbliva under sagde s\u00e4teri ... emot erl\u00e4ggande af de f\u00f6rre stadgade r\u00e4ntorne , hvarom anteckning likv\u00e4l b\u00f6r i jordeboken inf\u00f6ras ... \u201d", "( Translation into LANGUAGE ) \u201c ... since these islands are subject to payment of an annual levy and have been made use of in an undisturbed manner since the middle of the last century ... we find it reasonable that they should remain , as heretofore , attached to the said mansion ... in return for payment of the DATE levy , which should be entered into the land register ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . When land taxation was abolished in DATE the duty to pay a levy was replaced by a liability to pay ORG wealth tax ( varallisuusvero , f\u00f6rm\u00f6genhetsskatt ) . Up to DATE the levy had amounted to the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) at DATE \u2019s value .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON - H\u00f6gholm property was formed through a supplementary land - parcelling procedure in DATE . At the same time it was registered as ordinary real property instead of ORG land , the ORG being indicated as its owner . According to the record of the land parcelling the owner description was incomplete , but the property was leased to the ORG mansion . During the land - parcelling proceedings the owners of the ORG mansion submitted that they did not question the ORG \u2019s ownership . However , they claimed that they had a right of disposal ( dispositionsr\u00e4tt in NORP ) .", "CARDINAL . The owners of the ORG mansion made use of the ORG - H\u00f6gholm islands and the surrounding waters in an undisturbed manner until DATE , when ORG granted fishing rights to a third party without PERSON consent .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON initiated proceedings with a view to having his ownership of the PERSON - H\u00f6gholm property confirmed . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( kihlakunnanoikeus , h\u00e4radsr\u00e4tten ) found it established that the claimant and the previous owners of the ORG mansion had been enjoying a right of permanent usufruct in respect of the property , that right having developed into ownership .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment was quashed by ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) on CARDINAL DATE . The appellate court found that the ORG had originally let the islands to the then owners of the ORG mansion . This lease had been maintained in DATE . The ORG had thus never given up its ownership , but had simply tacitly consented to the ORG mansion \u2019s use of the property , initially subject to payment of a rent or levy and later subject to payment of wealth tax .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The registration ( lainhuuto , lagfart ) of the ORG as the lawful owner of the property in DATE was challenged by PERSON in a new civil suit seeking to obtain confirmation of his right of permanent usufruct in respect of the PERSON - H\u00f6gholm property and DATE should that right be deemed to have developed into ownership DATE confirmation of his ownership . PERSON died on DATE and his estate continued the lawsuit .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG confirmed the applicants\u2019 right of permanent usufruct and revoked the ORG \u2019s title to the property .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment was quashed by ORG on DATE on grounds similar to those relied on in its earlier judgment . It found , inter alia , that :", "( a ) the ownership issue had been finally settled in the first set of proceedings ;", "( b ) the first reference to the islands of ORG and PERSON had appeared in a judgment book ( tuomiokirja , dombok ) of GPE in DATE , and a DATE payment had been made in respect of the islands ;", "( c ) it could be deduced from the written material submitted to ORG that the islands had been leased to the owner of the ORG mansion in DATE ;", "( d ) in DATE the owner of the ORG mansion had attempted to transform the islands from ORG land into tax land ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , but the official list of land thus transformed \u2013 drawn up in DATE had not included the islands ;", "( e ) in DATE the ORG had decided that the islands were to remain under the control of the ORG mansion in return for the prescribed payments , rather than the lease being put up for tender for DATE , as had been suggested in the light of the practice with regard to certain other plots of ORG land ;", "( f ) the owners of the ORG mansion had enjoyed undisturbed possession of the islands until DATE , when the ORG had granted a fishing licence to a third party in respect of the waters surrounding the islands ; and", "( g ) a right of permanent usufruct in respect of ORG land continued to be recognised under NORP law , on condition that there was a clear legal basis for the right .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that originally the ORG had leased the islands to the ORG mansion , and that the ORG had upheld that lease in its decision of CARDINAL DATE . The payment of rent ( in NORP vuokranmaksu ) had later ceased and the mansion had paid tax in respect of the property , just as in respect of any other real property belonging to it . The ORG \u2019s decision had not established any right of permanent usufruct in favour of the ORG mansion , and the applicants had not presented any evidence of any other acquisition upon which such a right could be founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , following PERSON death in DATE , PERSON and PERSON had declared that the PERSON - H\u00f6gholm property formed part of the overall estate of the deceased for the purposes of the inventory of his possessions ( perukirja , bouppteckning ) . Inheritance tax was levied inter alia in respect of the PERSON - H\u00f6gholm property .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG requested the applicants to vacate the ORG property . The applicants have apparently not yet complied with the request and no enforcement proceedings have been initiated to date . At the hearing before the ORG on DATE the ORG argued that the letter in question amounted to the termination of the lease . The nature of the letter was disputed by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in DATE ORG ( Nyland ) had certified that the owners of the ORG mansion had covered all the reforestation and other costs relating to the ORG - H\u00f6gholm islands and had also collected the full yield from the forestry activities carried out on the islands .", "CARDINAL . At the time of lodging their application with the ORG the applicants were allegedly still obliged to pay wealth tax on the PERSON - H\u00f6gholm property . In DATE the Government informed the ORG that the taxation authorities would correct the relevant property register ( maatilarekisteri , jordbruksregistret ) with effect from DATE . The ORG would then be indicated as the rightful owner of the PERSON - H\u00f6gholm property .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , there were no regulations in force in DATE governing the transfer of ownership of ORG land , nor was there any consistency in the contracts concerning such transfers . The scope of each contract and the rights contained therein had therefore to be determined in the light of the particular circumstances of each case . As a rule , it was not possible to transfer the ownership of ORG land before it had been transformed into privately owned land ( perinn\u00f6ksiosto , skattek\u00f6p ) . It was nevertheless possible to establish various rights relating to the enjoyment of the property and benefiting private individuals , municipalities or the ORG . For example , the ORG could transfer a so - called permanent and exclusive right of possession in respect of the land , subject to a payment . Such a right required the land to be used for a specific purpose , and the ORG was entitled to regain possession of it either on payment of compensation or without having to redeem it . Over time the ORG \u2019s title to the land could change into an ordinary one , whereas it was not , for example , possible to change the amount of the payment ( stadga ) collected from the holder of a right attaching to the property .", "CARDINAL . Provisions on the procedure for transferring ORG land to private individuals were later included in specific Acts of ORG , such as Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( er\u00e4iden kruununluontoisten tilojen ja tilanosien j\u00e4rjestelyst\u00e4 annettu laki , lag om reglering av vissa l\u00e4genheter och l\u00e4genhetsdelar av krononatur ) . These Acts did not , however , govern all ORG land or all cases where a right of usufruct had been attached to it .", "CARDINAL . In the DATE LAW ( maakaari , jordabalken ORG ) the special characteristics of ORG land are only dealt with in the provisions concerning property registration , the aim being to ensure that the registered data correspond as far as possible to the existing situation . Title may now be established in respect of former ORG land . Any right of permanent usufruct , leasing right or other form of enjoyment of property may also be registered . A title of ownership may not be registered in respect of an estate which is already subject to a permanent right of possession ( see section CARDINALa of the LAW on the Implementation of the Land Code ( laki maakaaren voimaanpanosta , lagen om inf\u00f6rande av jordabalken CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Many scholars have supported the view that the permanent right of possession may be regarded as tantamount to actual ownership . Domestic courts have not accepted this view , preferring to focus on the purpose of the original transaction , even in cases where a right of usufruct was being enjoyed over a long period and in an undisturbed manner . Reference may be made to ORG judgment no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . It was possible to lease land belonging to the ORG , either for a certain period of time or indefinitely . Rights based on such lease contracts have not been transformed into ownership by means of specific legislation to that effect . Nor has the long - term de facto enjoyment of a property been considered to constitute a basis for ownership or a right of permanent usufruct in respect of land subject to a lease contract . The fact that the owner of the land has been passive or has tacitly accepted that another person uses the land does not entail a transfer of ownership . Transfer of ownership requires a transaction .", "CARDINAL . For taxation purposes , leased ORG land has been regarded as the tenant \u2019s possession whenever he or she has been enjoying the right to use the property in spite of the ORG \u2019s formal ownership . Thus , according to the Income and LAW ( laki tulo- ja omaisuusverosta , lagen om skatt p\u00e5 inkomst och f\u00f6rm\u00f6genhet ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ; Act no . DATE , section DATE ; and Act no . CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c [ CARDINAL property for which taxes shall be paid includes the assets of the person liable to pay taxes , subject to the restrictions set out below .", "The assets shall also include :", "( CARDINAL ) any right of usufruct in respect of real property , whether or not its validity has been defined in time or it remains valid during the holder \u2019s lifetime ; any timber - felling rights ; and any other right to make use of real property belonging to someone else . \u201d", "The existing LAW ( varallisuusverolaki , f\u00f6rm\u00f6genhetsskattelagen DATE ) contains a comparable provision ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Anyone wishing to adjust the amount of their tax assessment must make a request to that effect in accordance with LAW ( verotusmenettelylaki , lagen om beskattningsf\u00f6rfarande DATE ; LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , the right to perpetual usufruct did exist in DATE and was explicitly established , given that transfer of ownership per se was prohibited in respect of ORG land . A right of usufruct was granted permanently until DATE , when the ORG Collegium ( in NORP ) decided to let ORG land for a fixed period of DATE following a tendering procedure in the form of an auction . As the right claimed by the applicants in respect of the PERSON - H\u00f6gholm property had been established well before , LAW was irrelevant to this case . The nature of the payment collected from the then owners of the ORG mansion ( in NORP stadga or stadgad r\u00e4nta ) was DATE , which is evidenced by the fact that it was entered in the column of land tax in the land register , and replaced by wealth tax in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The nature of ORG land is described in the relevant preparatory work on the DATE LAW Government PERSON ) . Real property was historically divided into ORG land , exempted land and tax land ( in NORP krono- , fr\u00e4lse- och skattejord ) . Land tax was levied only on ORG land and tax land . The distinction between ORG land and tax land was abolished by the DATE LAW which entered into force on DATE . As is evidenced by section DATE of LAW ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and its drafting history , the concept of perpetual usufruct nevertheless remained recognised and may also be registered .", "CARDINAL . NORP The preparatory work on LAW made clear that in examining historical rights to ORG land it must be established whether the ORG \u2019s intention when preparing the relevant contract was to transfer ownership per se or to grant a right of usufruct in respect of the land . If evidence of a transfer of ownership can not be provided , a right of perpetual usufruct is registered as a special right . For land registration purposes such a right is treated as a leasing right , and its holder may put it up as collateral ( section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ) . A right of perpetual usufruct is nevertheless more extensive than a leasing right in that it entitles its holder to use and possess the land at his or her sole discretion and prevents the landowner from having his or her ownership registered or putting the land up as collateral ( section CARDINALa , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL ) of GPE ( maanvuokralaki , jordlegolagen CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , which is applicable only to agreements made after DATE , a termination of lease must , if the addressee does not give his acknowledgment in writing , be effected in the presence of witnesses or in another demonstrable manner , and must specify the date on which the lease will end ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
