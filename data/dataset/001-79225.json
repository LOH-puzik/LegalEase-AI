The applicants , PERSON and ORG , are CARDINAL NORP companies based in GPE .

PERSON , ORG and GPE were engaged in insurance broking , a commercial activity which , by virtue of LAW as worded until DATE , attracted value - added tax ( VAT ) . They paid MONEY ( ORG ) , ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL and ORG respectively in GPE on their DATE transactions .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , Article CARDINAL - a of the Sixth Directive of the Council of the European Communities dated DATE provided an exemption for \u201c insurance and reinsurance transactions , including related services performed by insurance brokers and insurance agents \u201d . The directive was due to come into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ninth Directive of the Council of the European Communities dated DATE was notified to ORG . It granted GPE an extension of time \u2013 until DATE in which to implement the provisions of Article CARDINAL - a of the Sixth Directive of DATE . Since such directives have no retroactive effect , the Sixth Directive should nevertheless have been applied from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL and DATE and DATE and DATE PERSON lodged CARDINAL applications with ORG seeking , on the basis of the Sixth Directive of CARDINAL DATE , a refund of the ORG it had paid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transferred all the assets of its insurance broking arm to a new company , ORG . ORG nevertheless continued to be registered under the same number at ORG while changing its name to SOGEDEP DATE and to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the CARDINAL applications lodged by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . An administrative circular was issued on DATE which stipulated :", "\u201c ... no further action shall be taken to collect sums remaining due at the date of publication of this circular from insurance brokers who have failed to charge value - added tax on their transactions DATE and DATE and have received supplementary tax assessments as a result . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held in the GPE case that LAW , as worded in the relevant period , was incompatible with the provisions of the Sixth Directive .", "CARDINAL . Considering that the NORP State had acted unlawfully by failing to incorporate into domestic law the provisions of the Sixth Directive within the time allowed , ORG , GPE and PERSON wrote to the authorities on DATE to claim compensation for their losses .", "CARDINAL . In decisions of CARDINAL DATE in the case of ORG and GPE , and DATE in the case of PERSON , the Minister for the ORG rejected their requests on the grounds that they were inadmissible by virtue of LAW of LAW and that the amount of the loss had to be reduced by the amount of employment tax owed by companies exempted from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , GPE and PERSON brought proceedings in ORG against ORG for failing to incorporate the Sixth Directive of CARDINAL DATE into domestic law thereby causing them a loss equal to the amount of overpaid MONEY for DATE , which they claimed should be refunded .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG joined the applicant companies ' applications with those of other claimants , including the PERSON and ORG companies , and declared them inadmissible by virtue of LAW , paragraph CARDINAL of LAW , on the grounds that :", "\u201c The provisions are general in scope and not intended as a bar to the application of Community treaties , regulations , directives or decisions or to the execution of judgments of ORG .", "Their sole purpose is to determine in accordance with the legitimate aim of legal certainty the period in which claims for release from liability to tax , for the recovery of sums paid but not due or for compensation may be made by taxpayers who have not taken any action themselves but have been shown , in a court decision in proceedings to which they were not parties , to have been wrongly subjected to tax . The limitation period laid down in the provisions does not prohibit reasonably diligent claimants from asserting the rights to which they may be entitled by virtue of Community norms .", "It follows from the foregoing the LAW of LAW is not manifestly incompatible with a Community norm of international - treaty status . There is consequently no reason why it should not be applied .", "The provisions of the third paragraph of that Article expressly concern both actions for recovery of sums paid but not due and actions for compensation in respect of loss . There is no reason to consider that the legislature intended to exclude from the scope of these provisions certain forms of action on account of the nature of the alleged losses or of the tax liability concerned .", "If it is not overruled on this point , the judgment delivered on DATE by ORG on the application of the Jacques Dangeville company will be the first judicial decision to have revealed an incompatibility between LAW , as worded during the relevant period , and the Sixth Directive of the Council of the European Communities . Pursuant to the aforementioned provisions of LAW of LAW it was consequently from DATE of that decision that it became possible to determine , in respect of all taxpayers , the period which LAW allowed for actions to be brought on the basis of that incompatibility for repayment of sums paid or not deducted , or for compensation for loss .", "It follows from the foregoing that the claims of the applicant companies relating to taxes paid during DATE are inadmissible and must consequently be rejected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took over GPE following a merger . It is also took over SGAP Exploitation , the same company to which it had transferred its entire business on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and PERSON appealed to ORG against the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE they lodged written submissions in which , in addition to repeating their claims for reimbursement , they again argued that LAW of LAW did not provide a valid defence to their claims , which were for compensation for losses resulting from the ORG 's failure to comply with its obligations under Community law .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile in the aforementioned NORP case , the PERSON d'Etat , hearing an appeal against the judgment delivered by ORG on DATE , gave judgment on DATE , essentially in the following terms :", "\u201c The documents in the file submitted to ORG show that by a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG d'Etat , acting in its judicial capacity , dismissed a claim by PERSON seeking reimbursement of value - added tax it had paid for the period from DATE to DATE , inter alia , on the ground that its liability to that tax had arisen from the application of statutory provisions that were incompatible with the objectives of the Sixth Directive of the Council of the European Communities of DATE . The claim by ORG which ORG examined in the impugned judgment was for payment of ' compensation ' in an amount equal to the amount of value - added tax that had thus been paid , by way of reparation for the ' damage ' which that tax liability had caused the company to sustain , on the ground that that damage was attributable to ORG delay in transposing the objectives of the Directive into domestic law . It follows that , as submitted by the Minister of the ORG , ORG erred in law in holding that the fact that the company ' [ had ] first referred the issue of taxation to the tax court ' did not render inadmissible a claim for reparation in which the only alleged damage was that resulting from the payment of the tax . The Minister of the ORG 's application to have the impugned judgment overturned is accordingly founded to the extent that ORG upheld in part the claims made by PERSON in its submissions . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG d'Etat delivered judgment on an appeal lodged on CARDINAL DATE by ORG against ORG judgment of DATE . The ORG d'Etat did not follow the line it had taken in its judgment of CARDINAL March CARDINAL in the NORP case , but instead declared PERSON 's appeal on points of law admissible , holding that the company was entitled to rely on the provisions of the Sixth Directive and should be granted a release from the contested tax liability \u2013 for which there was no statutory basis as the statutory provisions conflicted with the objectives of the Directive \u2013 for the sums erroneously paid for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant companies ' appeals on the grounds that :", "\u201c The claims lodged by the companies with ORG were for an award of damages ... as reparation , which the Minister for the ORG had refused to make , for the loss ... caused by their wrongly being required to pay value added tax for DATE in the exact amounts mentioned above . It is , however , common ground that as at DATE , when the claim was registered with the court registry , [ the claimants ] had not obtained a release from the said liability to value added tax through a request to the authorities to that end and , in the event of [ their ] request being rejected , an appeal to the tax court in accordance with the specific procedure described in ORG CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Tax Procedure . In these circumstances , the claims were , as the Minister has argued , inadmissible . It follows that [ the companies ] have no basis on which to complain about ORG impugned decision to dismiss their claims as unfounded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a notice of appeal dated DATE and written submissions dated DATE , ORG and PERSON appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was the subject of a takeover by a company called ORG , which on DATE transferred its brokerage and insurance business to a company called ORG . The latter subsequently changed its name to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the ORG d'Etat dismissed the appeals in the following terms :", "\u201c In their submissions , [ the companies ] sought compensation from the ORG in an amount equal to the value added tax they had paid in respect of DATE . These submissions , which in practice amounted to a claim for repayment of the value added tax paid , were inadmissible as they could only be made subject to the conditions and time - limits set out in ORG CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Tax Procedure . This conclusion , which answers a point raised before the courts below and does not involve any assessment of the factual circumstances , shall replace the legally flawed finding that served as the basis for the operative provision in the impugned judgment . The appeal ... must be dismissed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The provisions of LAW of LAW , applicable at the relevant time , read as follows :", "\u201c Claims relating to taxes , contributions , duties , charges , dues , indemnities and penalties of any kind , assessed or recovered by revenue officials , fall within the jurisdiction of the courts where they seek compensation for errors committed in the assessment or calculation of tax , or an entitlement due under a statutory provision or regulation .", "All actions seeking a release from or reduction in tax , or to a right to make a deduction , on the ground that the norm that has been applied is incompatible with a higher - ranking norm , shall be heard and determined in accordance with the rules laid down in the present chapter .", "Where such incompatibility has been established by a judicial decision , an action for the restitution of the sums paid or not deducted or for compensation for loss may only relate to the period following DATE that of the judgment establishing such incompatibility . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG of ORG ) gave the following answer to a question referred for a preliminary ruling on the provisions of LAW CARDINAL of the Code of Tax Procedure :", "\u201c ... Community law does not preclude legislation of a Member ORG laying down that , in tax matters , an action for recovery of a sum paid but not due based on a finding by a national or ORG court that a national rule is not compatible with a superior rule of national law or with a ORG rule of law may only relate to the period following DATE that of the judgment establishing such incompatibility . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
