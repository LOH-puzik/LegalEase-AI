The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , born in DATE . At the relevant time , he resided in GPE , GPE , and was a storekeeper .", "CARDINAL . On TIME DATE , at TIME , he was arrested by the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was brought before a magistrate of ORG . The charge was read out by a police inspector and alleged that the applicant had defiled his minor daughter ( an offence involving sexual acts ) and committed acts of violent assault on her . The applicant pleaded not guilty .", "CARDINAL . After the hearing , the applicant contacted a lawyer who arranged to meet with him DATE , DATE , which was a DATE . On TIME Monday DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed a written application for bail . It stated that the applicant lived in GPE , was employed there , and although he had problems with his NORP wife he had nevertheless very good relations with his in - laws . There was no fear of him absconding . Even if he were to go to GPE , extradition provisions would make it impossible for him to avoid being brought to trial if the Attorney - General decided to indict him . The application further stated that the applicant strenuously denied the charges and was being detained on the basis of mere unfounded allegations . The magistrate before whom he had been brought had no power to order his release . He had not been assisted by a lawyer and his application was being filed with the registry of ORG at the first opportunity . He requested the court to release him as there were no reasons justifying his continued detention .", "The application was immediately sent to the Attorney - General who was given TIME in which to reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , that is on DATE , the Attorney - General , by a declaration in writing , stated his opposition to the applicant \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL . Still on DATE , a magistrate of ORG took the decision to reject the applicant \u2019s bail application . The recollection of the magistrate is that this decision was taken either TIME or early in TIME of DATE . The magistrate in question was not the same magistrate before whom the applicant had appeared on DATE and had not himself examined the applicant . On DATE the registrar of ORG entered the second magistrate \u2019s decision in the court \u2019s records .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second magistrate began hearing evidence and on DATE he ordered the applicant \u2019s release on bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant and gave him a DATE suspended prison sentence . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provides as follows :", "\u201c Any magistrate who , in a matter within his powers , fails or refuses to attend to a lawful complaint touching an unlawful detention , and any officer of ORG , who , on a similar complaint made to him , fails to prove that he reported the same to his superior authorities within TIME shall , on conviction , be liable to imprisonment for a term from DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE in PERSON v. Attorney - General ORG rejected the appellant \u2019s argument that section CARDINAL of LAW only provided for a penalty and not for a remedy . According to ORG , if the way in which this section had been applied were to be examined , the conclusion would be the same as that reached by Chief Justice PERSON . The latter in his academic writings asserted that although habeas corpus is not essentially a part of the ordinary law of GPE , there are in LAW two provisions , namely sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL which , taken together , may be regarded as providing an equally effective safeguard of personal freedom .", "CARDINAL . The parties before ORG referred to the following examples of cases in which section CARDINAL had been invoked .", "On DATE the ORG ordered PERSON to be detained for TIME for contempt of court . The detainee appealed under section CARDINAL of LAW . The Attorney - General , with reference to ORG having invoked section CARDINAL of LAW , requested ORG to order the acting registrar of the court and the Commissioner of Police to bring ORG before the court and order either of them to set him free at once . ORG \u2019s appeal had suspensive effect on the execution of the judgment and , as a result , his continued detention was illegal . ORG acceded to the Attorney - General \u2019s request .", "PERSON , later christened PERSON , invoked section CARDINAL of LAW to challenge his prolonged and indefinite detention further to a removal order . He claimed that his detention , which had started in DATE , had been rendered illegal because of its length and indefinite duration . On DATE ORG ordered that the Attorney - General be notified and , having heard his views , still on DATE , decided to reject the application .", "On DATE PERSON relied on section CARDINAL of LAW to challenge the lawfulness of his prolonged detention pending an investigation into his assets , which had been sequestrated by court order . He claimed that the detention had been unduly prolonged . Moreover , he asserted that he had very little property . On DATE ORG transmitted the case file to the Attorney - General and abstained from further consideration of the application .", "On DATE ORG rejected an application for release by PERSON . It observed :", "\u201c As results from the records several applications have been filed , before this ORG and before ORG , so that the person charged may be released , which applications have always been dealt with expeditiously , which fact makes it manifest in the most glaring manner how superfluous and incomprehensible the first paragraph of the present application is , where it refers to section CARDINAL of LAW . \u201d ( unofficial translation from GPE )", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the Government claimed that if it appeared to the magistrate that the arrest was unlawful the magistrate was obliged to order the arrested person \u2019s release . The magistrate had this obligation by virtue of the provisions of section CARDINAL of LAW . Every person in GPE was assured that an arrest could not last beyond TIME and the appearance before the magistrate ensured that if the arrested person had any submissions to make , he or she could do so in the presence of a totally independent person and not before a representative of the prosecuting authority . In connection with habeas corpus decisions , under section CARDINAL of LAW the magistrate did not need to hear the Attorney - General . However , since this was an adversarial procedure where the prosecution was led by the police , the magistrate was expected to hear the police as parties to the case in observance of the principle audi alteram partem and the principle of equality of arms . This was a power quite separate and distinct from the power to grant bail . If the arrest was found by the magistrate to be unlawful then the magistrate had to order the release of the person arrested and the question of bail did not therefore arise . Only if there was nothing to show that the arrest was unlawful did the question of bail arise .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , read together with section CARDINAL , is considered by the Government to provide an effective safeguard of personal freedom equivalent to habeas corpus ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Section CARDINAL addresses the powers and duties of the police in respect of criminal prosecutions and reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ( CARDINAL ) Every officer of ORG below the rank of inspector shall , on securing the person arrested , forthwith report the arrest to an officer not below the rank of inspector who , if he finds sufficient grounds for the arrest , shall order the person arrested to be brought before ORG ; otherwise he shall release him .", "( CARDINAL ) Where an order is given for the person arrested to be brought before ORG , such order shall be carried into effect without any undue delay and shall in no case be deferred beyond TIME . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The powers of ORG in respect of arrested persons who are brought before it under section CARDINAL of LAW were discussed in extenso in the PERSON case .", "On DATE PERSON , who had been arrested on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence punishable with more than CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , was brought before ORG . He claimed that the prosecution at that stage was obliged to convince the magistrate that the arrest was lawful .", "This request was dealt with by ORG on DATE in the following manner :", "\u201c The procedure which should be followed by ORG as a ORG is set out in sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW . Subsection ( CARDINAL ) of section CARDINAL provides how proceedings should start before this court : it \u2018 shall hear the report of the police officer on oath , shall examine , without oath , the party accused , and shall hear the evidence in support of the PERSON . The time - limit for the conclusion of this inquiry is DATE as indicated in section CARDINAL . In no way is the ORG bound to hear any evidence in support of the report . Moreover , the fact that the prosecuting officers confirm the report on oath is meant to satisfy the ORG that there is a reasonable suspicion for the person charged to be presented under arrest in view of the charges brought against him .", "ORG does not find anything to censure in the fact that the report confirmed on oath consists of a confirmation on oath of the charges ; after all , in this contest , the word \u2018 PERSON means \u2018 ORG . This is the procedure followed in this case and it is the correct procedure .", "Consequently , the ORG declares that the requests of the person charged are unfounded and therefore rejects them . \u201d ( unofficial translation from NORP )", "Mr PERSON lodged a constitutional application arguing that there had been a breach of LAW . On DATE the First Hall of the Civil Court found that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL did not impose any obligation on the magistrate before whom an arrested person appeared to examine whether or not that person \u2019s arrest had been made on a reasonable suspicion . Moreover , the court considered that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL did not impose on the prosecution any duty , on presenting the arrested person , to adduce evidence that the police had a reasonable suspicion at the time of the arrest . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of FAC .", "CARDINAL", "\u201c According to the constant practice of this ORG and according to LAW , this ORG can not consider any circumstances at this stage and has to regulate itself according to the charges brought forward by the prosecution .", "The ORG , furthermore , can not enter into any question to consider ex officio the release from arrest , but first an application has to be filed which has to be notified to the Attorney - General , and after his reply or failing such a reply after the time set by law , it may decide on release under guarantees .", "Therefore what the defence is requesting is outside the functions of this ORG .", "Having regard to sections CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , the ORG declares itself not competent to comply with the request and directs the person charged , that if his request for release is to be considered , he has to comply with what is provided in the sections herementioned . \u201d ( unofficial translation from NORP )", "CARDINAL .
