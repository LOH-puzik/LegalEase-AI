The applicant was born in DATE and currently lives in GPE , in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He owned a house located at DATE FAC in GPE , in GPE ( \u201c the AAR \u201d ) , GPE . The house and its adjacent premises were located on a plot of land of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . Under a contract of DATE ( \u201c the contract of sale \u201d ) , the applicant ceded to PERSON , by then the PERSON Deputy Minister of the ORG , CARDINAL of his house ( \u201c the PERSON estate \u201d ) for the price of CARDINAL coupons ( the provisional NORP currency introduced at DATE for purposes of monetary reform ) . According to the case file , the purchasing power of that sum corresponded to MONEY ( ORG ) at the material time . The contract of sale was certified by a notary . As further disclosed by a written statement of a witness to that transaction , after the signing of the contract PERSON gave the applicant MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in cash . Shortly after the sale of the PERSON estate , the applicant left PERSON and settled , together with his family , in GPE . Allegedly , a reason for that hasty departure was PERSON continuous pressure on the applicant to cede the remaining part of the house .", "CARDINAL . As a result of tensions between the central and local authorities ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) , members of the PERSON government , including PERSON , fled the country in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a civil action against PERSON , requesting that the contract of sale be declared null and void for having been entered into under duress ( \u201c the civil case \u201d ) . In particular , the applicant , referring to the relevant factual circumstances , claimed that the respondent , by then an extremely powerful person in the ORG , had forced him to cede the PERSON estate for a ludicrously small price under threats to his person and family . The applicant also sought an injunction to have the estate attached until after the final resolution of the dispute .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG granted the injunction and ordered the attachment of the PERSON estate . ORG transmitted its decision , describing the facts of the dispute , to ORG for enforcement . In the absence of an appeal , the decision became final after DATE , and , as disclosed by the case file , the relevant attachment record was duly entered in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened a criminal case against PERSON for various offences committed in public office . On the basis of those criminal proceedings , the prosecutor requested the Ajarian High Court to confiscate the movable and immovable property of the accused , including the PERSON estate , under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d , \u201c the confiscation proceedings \u201d ) . According to the prosecutor 's submissions , the PERSON estate measured QUANTITY and was valued at GEL MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG partially allowed the prosecutor 's request , ordering the confiscation of some of PERSON property , including the PERSON estate . The prosecutor appealed against that partial confiscation to ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in the absence of the respondent PERSON , allowed the applicant 's action of DATE . The court annulled the contract of sale , confirmed the applicant 's title to the PERSON estate and ordered ORG , which formed part of ORG , to proceed with the necessary registration formalities . The decision further noted that it would become final DATE after being served on the respondent . There being no appeal within that statutory period , the decision became final on an unspecified date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , relying on the already binding decision of CARDINAL DATE , requested ORG of GPE to discontinue the confiscation proceedings with respect to the PERSON estate .", "CARDINAL . Either on DATE or DATE ORG recorded the applicant 's title to the PERSON estate , amounting to QUANTITY , on the basis of the final decision of CARDINAL DATE ( the case file contains a copy of that official record which bears QUANTITY different dates ) . On DATE the Registry issued another certificate , confirming the applicant 's title to the real estate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , after having conducted a hearing in the presence of representatives of both ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and PERSON , overturned the decision of DATE in the part concerning the confiscation of the PERSON estate , and upheld the remainder . The court acknowledged that the estate , valued at GEL MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) , represented the applicant 's property by virtue of the binding decision of DATE . ORG instructed the Ajarian High Court to examine the issue of discontinuation of the confiscation proceedings concerning the PERSON estate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG addressed a letter to the PERSON prosecutor , demanding clarification with respect to the situation of the PERSON estate . The ORG appeared to be confused by the fact that the estate represented both the applicant 's property by virtue of the binding decision of CARDINAL DATE and yet was an object of the pending confiscation proceedings . Furthermore , contrary to what had been confirmed by the record of DATE and the certificate of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Registry informed the prosecutor that the applicant 's title to the PERSON estate had not yet been formally recorded .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE , the Deputy Minister of ORG confirmed that the applicant was the owner of the PERSON estate on the basis of the final decision of DATE , adding that the process of registration of his property title had been suspended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prosecutor filed with ORG a request to quash the final decision of DATE and to reopen the civil case , under LAW ( b ) of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The prosecutor stated that the confiscation of the PERSON estate , indicated by ORG decision of DATE , had already been confirmed by ORG of GPE . However , the enforcement of the confiscation was impossible owing to the existence of the conflicting decision of DATE . The prosecutor complained that ORG should have involved him CARDINAL party in the civil case which , moreover , should have been suspended pending the outcome of the confiscation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , the applicant submitted written comments in reply to the PERSON prosecutor 's request for quashing . He argued that the prosecution authority , being a party to the confiscation proceedings , had learnt of the decision of DATE in the course of ORG hearing of DATE at the latest . Consequently , the PERSON prosecutor 's request for quashing was belated , as provided by LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG . He further noted that the PERSON estate had never been ORG property and , consequently , ORG could not have been expected to join the prosecutor as CARDINAL party to the civil case . If the PERSON prosecutor had acted with minimum diligence , by having consulted , for instance , ORG prior to the institution of the confiscation proceedings against Mr PERSON on DATE , he would have learnt that the PERSON estate had already been attached , by virtue of the injunction of DATE , in the course of the civil case . The applicant also challenged the prosecutor 's misleading assertion that the confiscation of the PERSON estate had been confirmed by ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . Reiterating the above arguments , the applicant also requested the ORG , on DATE , to open a criminal case against the PERSON prosecutor for abuse of power .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON of ORG summoned the applicant , who was residing in ORG , by telegram to appear on DATE as a respondent in the quashing proceedings brought by the PERSON prosecutor . The applicant telegraphed back on DATE to request adjournment of the hearing in view of his health problems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON summoned the applicant by telegram to appear on DATE \u201c as a respondent in the proceedings brought by a notary public of GPE . The telegram noted that the claimant 's submissions were being dispatched by registered post .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied to the applicant 's criminal complaint of DATE in the following terms :", "\u201c As you already know , ORG has granted the PERSON prosecutor 's request and reopened the case . Consequently , your allegations of abuse of power by the prosecutor are ill - founded , ... and you have the right to plead before the court as a respondent \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant notified Judge PERSON by telegram of his inability to travel from GPE to GPE for the forthcoming hearing on DATE in view of his health problems . He noted that he was sending the supporting medical documentation by post and that the notary public 's submissions had not reached him so far .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received ORG dispatch of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He learnt that the notary public who had certified the contract of sale on DATE had requested , on DATE , the quashing of the binding decision of DATE under LAW ( b ) of the ORG . The notary complained that she should have been involved in the civil case as a respondent , in so far as , pursuant to LAW of DATE , she had been personally responsible for the validity of the contract in question . As to compliance with the statutory time - limit of DATE , the notary claimed that she had first learnt of the existence of the decision of DATE from a local newspaper , PERSON , on DATE . The relevant article , published on the latter date , had described the details of the confiscation proceedings and the civil case , noting the existence of the conflicting interests of the applicant and of the PERSON prosecutor over the PERSON estate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON summoned the applicant by telegram to appear on DATE as a respondent \u201c in the proceedings brought by the notary public . \u201d The applicant telegraphed back on DATE , requesting an adjournment of the hearing in view of his state of health . He also informed Judge PERSON that he was dispatching by post his comments on the notary 's request for quashing . As disclosed by those comments , received at ORG on DATE , the applicant denounced the notary as lacking the requisite locus standi to call into question the outcome of the terminated civil case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against Judge PERSON He complained that , by summoning him by telegraph DATE before the scheduled hearings , without giving him an opportunity to obtain knowledge of and comment on the claimant 's submissions , the judge had breached the principle of the equality of arms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON once again requested the applicant to appear at a hearing on DATE in the reopening proceedings brought by the notary public . Another request for an adjournment followed from the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received by parcel CARDINAL decisions of ORG dated DATE and DATE . As shown by the postmark on the envelope , the parcel had been dispatched by Judge GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , Judge PERSON ruled that the notary public 's request for quashing of DATE was well - founded and that the decision of CARDINAL DATE ought to be annulled and the civil case reopened under LAW ( b ) of the ORG . The judge based her decision on the notary 's written and oral pleadings only and did not explain the reason for having dispensed with the need for submissions from the applicant . Without giving any additional reasons , the judge endorsed the notary 's procedural and substantive arguments , in particular that the request for quashing had been lodged in due time and that the notary should indeed have been involved in the civil case . The operative part of the decision noted that no appeal lay against it .", "CARDINAL . As to the decision of DATE , it concerned the request for quashing of CARDINAL DATE from the PERSON prosecutor . Judge PERSON first noted that , despite having been properly summoned to the oral hearing , the applicant had failed to appear and that his explanation in that regard \u2013 the reference to health problems \u2013 was not substantiated by medical documentation . However , the judge took into account the applicant 's written submissions ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and concluded that the prosecutor 's request for quashing should be rejected as time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON summoned the applicant by telegram to appear as a claimant in the reopened civil case . The judge specified that Mr PERSON and the notary were co - respondents in the case , whilst the PERSON prosecutor had been admitted CARDINAL party . In a telegram dated DATE , the applicant requested an adjournment in view of his persistent health problems . He noted that the supporting medical documents as well as his request for the replacement of Judge PERSON were being dispatched by post .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged with ORG an appeal against the decision of DATE . Referring to the fact that Judge PERSON had summoned him to the relevant quashing proceedings even after DATE , the applicant accused her of having forged the decision in question by backdating it . On DATE he also requested ORG to send him a copy of the ruling by which the notary and the PERSON prosecutor had been permitted to participate in the reopened civil case . As disclosed by the case file , no reply was forthcoming from either court .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant filed numerous letters with the ORG and the judicial and other authorities , complaining that the quashing of the final decision of CARDINAL DATE had violated his property rights . He also requested that Judge PERSON and the notary be prosecuted for abuse of power or that , at least , the judge be removed from further examination of his civil case . Those letters were either left unanswered or , in so far as the criminal complaints were concerned , rejected by the ORG as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant learnt from his sister , who lived in GPE and had frequent contacts with ORG , that Judge PERSON had ruled , on an unknown date , to leave his reopened civil case without examination . On DATE he requested ORG and ORG of GPE to provide him with a copy of that ruling . According to the case file , the courts did not reply .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG informed the applicant that the PERSON estate had been registered as ORG property on the basis of a writ of enforcement issued by the Ajarian High Court on DATE . The applicant then requested , on DATE , additional clarification with respect to that writ , but no reply followed .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , ORG , contrary to the information contained in its previous letter ( see the preceding paragraph ) informed the applicant 's sister that , according to the available records , the PERSON estate had been registered as PERSON property on the basis of the contract of sale .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the LAW concerning the quashing of final and enforceable decisions and the reopening of civil cases , read as follows :", "\u201c Proceedings terminated by a final judgment ( decision ) may be reopened only if there are grounds for bringing either a request to render the final judgment null and void ( LAW ) or a request to reopen the proceedings in view of newly discovered circumstances ( LAW ) . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . A final and binding judgment ( decision ) may be quashed at the request of the interested party , if :", "( a ) A judge who participated in the deliberations in the case was barred from doing so by operation of law ;", "( b ) One of the parties , or its representative in law , had not been invited to participate in the examination of the case .", "CARDINAL . The request to render a final judgment null and void on the above - mentioned grounds shall not be entertained if the requesting party could have referred to those grounds during the proceedings , before the first instance , appeal or cassation courts . \u201d", "Pursuant to LAW ORG , a request for reopening of proceedings should be lodged within DATE after the party concerned learns of the grounds which might either render the final decision null and void or represent newly discovered circumstances within the meaning of LAW . That period was not extendable . LAW CARDINAL further specified that , in a situation envisaged by LAW ( b ) , the period of DATE started to run following the formal notification of the decision to the party to the proceedings or , if appropriate , its representative in law .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG stated that an appeal lay against a decision dismissing a request for quashing .
