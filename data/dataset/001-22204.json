They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON GPE and Mr PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "The first applicant is the editor of a general news magazine , PERSON , and the legal representative of the company that publishes the magazine . The second applicant is a journalist .", "In its edition of CARDINAL DATE the magazine ORG referred in its \u201c Prying Eye \u201d column to what CARDINAL of its journalists called \u201c a new sex scandal between an attractive aristocrat and a banker from this country \u201d and to the existence of pictures immortalising their encounter in a GPE hotel . The rumour was widely repeated in the media , although the persons to whom the ORG story related were not identified .", "On DATE , while on air with the presenter of the Radio CARDINAL programme \u201c Night Carmen \u201d broadcast by ORG , a journalist , GPE , referred to the rumour and identified the Duchess of PERSON and PERSON as the protagonists of \u201c the much - publicised romance between the aristocrat and the banker , both married with lots of children \u201d and gave the names of their spouses .", "In its CARDINAL DATE edition , PERSON , of which the first applicant was the editor , published an article by the second applicant concerning the alleged adulterous relationship . Photographs of the CARDINAL people concerned appeared on the magazine cover with the following caption : \u201c Suspected relationship between ORG and ORG ; a new scandal breaks \u201d . In a CARDINAL - page report that included CARDINAL photographs of the persons implicated in the alleged relationship and photographs of their families , the second applicant referred to the rumours circulating about the romance in the media and said that those involved had been identified by Radio nacio\u00f1al PERSON . A reference was also made to information that had appeared in another report .", "In the article the Duchess of M. \u2019s husband was described as debonair , very chubby and known to his former classmates as \u201c el platillo \u201d ( \u201c the saucer \u201d ) . Then , after giving the names of the children and the occupational activities of both PERSON , the second applicant added : \u201c the family ties make this saga resemble an NORP television series \u201d . He repeated statements made in another magazine that \u201c the mysterious couple \u2019s chosen love nest was a luxury GPE hotel where they were caught by the photographer in CARDINAL compromising situations \u201d , the first at the hotel entrance and the second during a romantic encounter in the hotel corridors . The report was accompanied by the words of lewd ditties containing allusions to women , not only courtesans , but also duchesses who ended up getting the \u201c Booty \u201d ( a reference to ORG \u2019s surname , PERSON ) and instructing LANGUAGE women in the techniques of pleasure and who chased after bankers who were only too happy to oblige , paying scant regard to their qualities since their sole interest was money \u2013 \u201c Booty \u201d ( PERSON ) .", "Furthermore , a second report by the second applicant was published in another edition of the magazine that appeared on DATE under a title that was published on the cover : \u201c The continuing enigma of the banker and the aristocrat : PERSON and the Duchess of PERSON deny any relationship \u201d . CARDINAL large photographs of the couple appeared on pages CARDINAL and DATE . An account was given of the history of the case and references made to an attempt by ORG to have copies of ORG seized and to other judicial proceedings he had brought . The magazine also explained that the compromising photographs had still not been published .", "As a result , the Duchess of M. and her husband brought a civil action before the GPE first - instance judge no . CARDINAL against the applicants and CARDINAL reporters from ORG on the basis of ORG no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE on ORG , Private and Family Life and to ORG One \u2019s Likeness .", "In a judgment delivered on DATE after adversarial proceedings the GPE first - instance judge no . CARDINAL found in favour of the claimants in the civil action , holding that they had been the victims of an unlawful interference with their right to honour and to respect for their private life .", "He gave inter alia the following reasons in his judgment :", "\u201c CARDINAL : honour as an authentic personality right may be offended by acts or interferences ... that entail a loss of esteem for a person either in the eyes of fellow citizens ( the objective aspect ) or in his or her own eyes ( the subjective aspect ) . Under DATE of the current LAW honour is ranked as a fundamental right and even though section CARDINAL of the Institutional Law recognises and protects freedom of expression , that freedom is circumscribed in particular by the right to honour , to private life and to control one \u2019s likeness ...", "...", "CARDINAL : the information provided by ORG and PERSON magazine constitutes an intolerable interference with the PERSON honour which it is for the courts to remedy ... by setting the limits on the rights to impart information and to freedom of expression , the pillars of all democracies . In order to guide judges when they consider a defendant \u2019s conduct unlawful the courts have established a series of principles to assist them in the performance of the delicate task of weighing up the various competing interests or , to coin the NORP - American expression , \u201c balancing \u201d , which entails weighing in the balance the various circumstances capable of being defined in law so as to determine which of the rights in issue must prevail , the right to impart information or the right of others to respect for their honour or privacy or to control the use made of their likeness ...", "CARDINAL : ... As regards the written publication , the representatives acting for the defendants linked to the magazine PERSON cleverly retort that the reports did no more than transmit \u2018 journalistic information\u2019 to its readers , as simple \u2018 scribes of ORG made by others . Although that affirmation is true because the defendants have not produced anything of substance of their own in the magazine , it nevertheless can not serve to justify their conduct as they also had a duty to seek out the truth in a diligent manner ... as the reports did not merely repeat information that had been disseminated by others but were published as items of scandal or sensation .", "CARDINAL : an important detail that concerns all the defendants is the indisputable fact that the claimants are not public figures who , as ORG has indicated , are afforded reduced protection under LAW as regards freedom to impart information on their activities that are of public interest or social utility ... The claimants have not freely chosen to become public figures and , although they have a certain social standing , it is not something they have sought , as it neither appears nor has been proved that they desired publicity ... \u201d .", "After dealing with the content of the reports in another paragraph of the judgment , the judge held : \u201c the intentionally disproportionate use of scandalous or disparaging terms and the use of innuendo about matters for which there is not the least shred of evidence constitute unlawful practices that were clearly perpetrated by the magazine PERSON \u201d .", "As a consequence , the judge ordered the applicants to publish the full text of the judgment in the same column of ORG , using the same typeface as that used in the report , and with an announcement of the judgment on the cover . ORG was ordered to broadcast the text of the judgment on its frequencies in the same programme . The applicants and ORG were also ordered to make reparation for the damage sustained by the victims in an amount to be assessed at the execution stage of the judgment , according to the criteria it laid down .", "The applicants appealed against that judgment to ORG , which , in a judgment of DATE , dismissed the appeal and upheld the impugned decision .", "An appeal on points of law was dismissed by ORG on DATE . It held that the courts below had correctly decided the issues and had not infringed the applicants\u2019 constitutional right to communicate or impart true information . It added that freedom of expression was curtailed by an obligation to omit anything which could be injurious or offensive and was unnecessary in the expression of ideas , opinions or value judgements . The report in question had focused on scandal and sensationalism , without any attempt being made to articulate a healthy public opinion .", "Relying on Articles CARDINAL ( right to a fair hearing ) and CARDINAL ( right to freedom of expression and to information ) of the LAW , the applicants lodged an appeal with ORG . In a decision of DATE , which was served on the applicants on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal as ill - founded . With regard to the complaint under LAW , it held :", "\u201c ... As a practical matter , as regards the so - called \u2018 neutral ORG , this court stated in its judgment no . CARDINAL , which was cited by the appellants : \u2018 when a media body divulges statements made by a third party that suggest that there has been an interference with the rights recognised by Article CARDINAL of LAW , that divulgation is not entitled to the protection of LAW unless the truth of the statements attributed to the third party is proved and the statements ... relate to facts or circumstances of public importance\u2019 . Further , in judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... , it expressly added : \u2018 a report that is neutral in form or content may cease to be so if it assumes an informative character which is in practice incompatible with its function as a mere conduit for the ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment ) . Thus ORG decision on the conflicting constitutional rights in the instant case , which is set out in its judgment upholding the judgments of the first - instance judge and FAC , is consistent with the case - law cited above . ORG ... does not contest that , as a transcription of the information broadcast by Radio nacional , the information published by PERSON enjoyed formal protection as it satisfied the requirement of truth explained in judgmentjudgment on the issue of the freedom to impart information that also led ORG to find that the report in question had overstepped the bounds within which freedom of expression may legitimately be exercised ... That finding is entirely consistent with the constitutional case - law applicable on the subject ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL .
