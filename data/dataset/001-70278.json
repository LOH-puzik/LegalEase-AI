{"ITEMID": "001-70278", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "ACKERMANN AND FUHRMANN v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE and GPE in GPE .", "The first applicant works as a commercial clerk ( kaufm\u00e4nnischer Angestellter ) in a private enterprise . He is unmarried and his DATE contributions to the statutory old - age insurance for employees amounted in DATE to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and in DATE to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "On DATE the first applicant filed a request to be exempted from his obligation to contribute to the statutory old - age insurance for employees ( gesetzliche GPE ) . He argued that the compulsory insurance violated his right to equal treatment as guaranteed by LAW .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG , ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request , finding that the applicant , as an employee , was subject to the obligatory old - age insurance under LAW ( ORG , see relevant domestic law below ) , and that he did not meet the requirements to be exempted under sections CARDINAL or CARDINAL of that same law .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a motion with ORG ( ORG ) with a view to being exempted from the obligatory insurance and to being reimbursed his contributions since DATE , alternatively to reduce his DATE contributions to an acceptable degree and to reimburse the exceeding part .", "He submitted a statement on political , economic and legal aspects of the compulsory insurance scheme . He argued that the obligatory old - age insurance deprived him of the possibility to provide for old age under a private pension scheme , which would yield considerably higher returns on his investments . The pension which he was likely to receive under the statutory old - age insurance was totally disproportionate when compared to his own contributions . This was partly due to the fact that the contributions under the compulsory insurance were not exclusively used to finance contribution - based pensions , but also to finance so called \u201c extrinsic benefits \u201d ( versicherungsfremde ORG , see relevant domestic law below ) , including costs incurred by the NORP reunification .", "He further alleged that he was discriminated against when compared to the older generation who currently profited from higher pensions than those which he himself would receive on reaching pension age . Moreover , he complained about discrimination when compared to the group of earners who were not subject to the obligatory insurance system such as self - employed persons and civil servants .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s motion . It noted , first , that the legal provisions for exemption did not apply to the applicant . Secondly , ORG found that the compulsory insurance did not violate the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . It noted that the legislator had been granted a wide margin of appreciation when taking measures in the social - political area . ORG was obliged to provide for every citizen \u2019s basic needs . Accordingly , the legislator was entitled to limit the risk of social neediness by introducing a compulsory insurance scheme . It followed that the compulsory insurance as such did not violate the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . ORG finally found that the selection of the group of people who were subject to the compulsory insurance scheme was not arbitrary and thus did not violate the applicant \u2019s right to equal treatment .", "On DATE the Baden - ORG of Appeal ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . Confirming ORG reasoning , that court emphasised that the applicant \u2019s arguments did not sufficiently take into account the concept of solidarity . Furthermore , ORG referred to the decisions of ORG ( PERSON ) of CARDINAL DATE and of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) of DATE , according to which the financing of so - called extrinsic benefits did not violate the applicant \u2019s rights . The old - age insurance scheme was based on the idea of solidarity and of social compensation ( sozialer PERSON ) which traditionally included an element of social welfare . Even though pension claims had a personal character , they also had to be seen in a distinctly social context . It followed that the legislator was allowed to limit pension claims and to modify benefits as long as these measures served the public welfare and respected the principle of proportionality .", "ORG further found that the applicant advocated a position which was focused on the interests of an insured person who did not become unfit for work , who did not need rehabilitation measures and whose contributions did not benefit a surviving spouse . This line of argument neglected the principles of insurance and of solidarity in an unacceptable way . It finally noted that , during proceedings , the legislator had raised the tax - based financing of the extrinsic benefits and had stabilised the rates of contribution .", "With his appeal on points of law before ORG , the applicant argued that the insurance system amounted to an expropriation for the following reasons : for the applicant , as a single male , the returns would be lower than his contributions . This was due to CARDINAL factors : the fact that the contributions also covered so - called \u201c extrinsic benefits \u201d , including the costs incurred by the NORP reunification , the principle of social compensation , the fact that the impact of the negative growth of population was not compensated by a capital reserve , and the additional costs incurred by women \u2019s higher life expectancy . He alleged that the legislator had overstepped his competencies under LAW , and that his obligation to contribute to the insurance scheme violated his right to freedom of action and to equal treatment under LAW .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It found , inter alia , that it was acceptable to subject all employees to an obligatory insurance with a view to their typically higher social vulnerability . Accordingly , the obligation did not depend on the individual ORG ability to provide for themselves . The insurance system was justified by the principle of ORG , which obliged the ORG to provide for the risks of life . Obligatory adherence and contributions were necessary to reach this aim , in particular in order to protect the weaker groups of society . ORG did not examine if the assessment of the applicant \u2019s future benefits could violate his property rights , as this could only be examined at the time the applicant actually touched his benefits .", "With respect to the applicant \u2019s complaint about unequal treatment , ORG found that it was justified to limit the obligatory adherence to the group of employees , because these were typically more in need of security . This followed from the fact that employees were typically dependant on exploiting their own capacity to work in order to earn their living . ORG noted that the legislator had applied similar principles to define the group of self - employed persons who were subject to the obligatory insurance ( section CARDINAL of the sixth book of LAW , see relevant domestic law below ) . It further found that the rate of the obligatory contributions did not put an excessive burden on the applicant , which might amount to a violation of his property right .", "The fact that the contributions also covered the so - called \u201c extrinsic benefits \u201d did not lead to a violation of the principle of equality , taking into account that these other responsibilities were related to those of the old - age insurance .", "In DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "The second applicant works as an executive employee in a private insurance company .", "On DATE the second applicant filed a request to be exempted from his obligation to contribute to the statutory old - age insurance for employees and requested to be reimbursed his contributions .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr GPE , BfA ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request .", "On DATE that same authority rejected the applicant \u2019s objection .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a motion with ORG . He alleged that the obligatory adherence to the insurance scheme amounted to an expropriation and complained about unequal treatment when compared to self - employed persons .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s motion , finding that the differentiation between employees and self - employed persons was not arbitrary , but was justified by the different social vulnerability of these groups . ORG further noted that also self - employed persons were increasingly subject to obligatory insurance schemes , for example to the lawyer \u2019s insurance . The current rate of contribution was not excessive and thus did not violate the applicant \u2019s property rights . The applicant had not established a violation of his future pension claims . The mere apprehension that his pension claims might be reduced in the future did not lead to a violation of the applicant \u2019s present property rights .", "On DATE the GPE Social Court of Appeal rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal , referring mainly to ORG decision .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint against the denial of leave to appeal ( Nichtzulassungsbeschwerde ) as inadmissible . It found that the applicant had failed to establish that the subject matter of his motion was of fundamental importance or that the lower court had committed a procedural error .", "On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s complaint .", "GPE is divided into QUANTITY books , namely Book One and then Books DATE .", "The Sixth Book of the Social Code ( ORG ) deals with the public old - age insurance scheme ( ORG ) .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides that all employees are subject to the obligatory insurance .", "Section CARDINAL stipulates that certain groups of self - employed persons are also subject to the obligatory insurance , such as teachers , nursing staff and midwifes , artisans who do not have their own business and persons who mainly work for CARDINAL single customer .", "According to section CARDINAL the following groups of persons are not subject to the obligatory insurance : ( CARDINAL ) civil servants and judges ; ( CARDINAL ) employees of public or clerical entities insofar as they have pension claims under the civil servant \u2019s pension scheme or under comparable church regulations ; ( CARDINAL ) members of religious orders insofar as their maintenance according to the rules of that order is assured .", "Section CARDINAL defines certain groups of persons who are exempt from the obligatory insurance , in particular those who are subject to another obligatory insurance scheme or who have claims which are comparable to those of civil servants .", "The amount of the pension paid under the insurance scheme mainly depends on the amount of the insured person \u2019s income and the time of contribution .", "Besides the pensions and survivor \u2019s pensions which are based on the insured person \u2019s contributions , the insurance also grants benefits which are not based on contributions . These payments , which are also referred to as \u201c extrinsic benefits \u201d ( versicherungsfremde ORG ) , include pension claims based on times devoted to the raising of children ( NORP ) , pensions compensating the effects of war and injustice ( Kriegsfolge- und Wiedergutmachungslasten ) and payments relating to the conversion of pensions following the NORP reunification .", "The general retirement age is DATE ( section CARDINAL ORG ) . From DATE until DATE , women were entitled to a pension by DATE . In DATE the legislator gradually adapted women \u2019s retirement DATE .", "The financing of the benefits under the statutory insurance is organised in a revolving system under which payments made over DATE are financed from contributions received in DATE ( ORG , see section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ORG ) .", "The financing is based on the contributions of the insured persons ( a ) , which are complemented by a tax - financed federal state subsidy ( b ) .", "( a ) The contributions are calculated according to the insured person \u2019s gross wages , which are taken into account up to a certain limit ( GPE ) . This limit is calculated on a yearly basis . In DATE , the limit was set at a yearly income of LAW .", "The contribution rates are also fixed on a DATE basis and developed as follows : DATE : PERCENT , DATE : PERCENT ; DATE : PERCENT ; DATE : PERCENT ; DATE : PERCENT ; DATE PERCENT , DATE : PERCENT , DATE : PERCENT ; DATE : PERCENT of the gross income .", "The contributions have to be paid in equal shares by the employed person and by the employer ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) no . CARDINAL SGB VI ) .", "( b ) The ORG contributes to the expenses by tax - financed subsidies ( section CARDINAL ORG ) . On DATE the legislator introduced an additional state subsidy which was aimed at financing those expenses under the insurance scheme , which were not covered by contributions ( see no . CARDINAL above ) . These additional payments amounted in DATE to DEM CARDINAL.CARDINAL billion . In DATE , the overall subsidies covered CARDINAL % and in DATE PERCENT of the overall spending ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
