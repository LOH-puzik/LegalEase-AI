NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , from the \u201c Documentation and Advisory Centre on Racial Discrimination \u201d ( DACoRD ) , an NGO in GPE ,", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , from ORG , and their Co - agent , PERSON , from ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in GPE . In DATE , when he was DATE , he was granted asylum in GPE as an unaccompanied minor . In that connection he was provided with a travel document in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . He acquired proficiency in the NORP language and eventually graduated from ORG . Currently he is studying at university to become a civil engineer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that on leaving GPE , he lost contact with his family . DATE , in DATE , he regained contact with his parents and siblings , who had been granted residence permits in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant applied for naturalisation . His request was refused on DATE because he did not fulfil all the criteria for being granted NORP nationality .", "CARDINAL . Based on a renewed application , on DATE the then ORG ( Ministeriet for flygtninge , indvandrere og integration ) informed the applicant that his name would be on the next bill of naturalisation , which was expected to be presented in ORG by DATE and to be passed by the ORG in DATE . It was stated that , before the passing of the law , ORG would reassess whether he still satisfied the criteria for obtaining NORP citizenship ( on DATE the tasks pertaining to nationality were transferred to ORG . Henceforth , both ministries will be referred to as \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry informed the applicant that he was not eligible to have his name on the said bill and that he could not at that time become a NORP national . His name was therefore not listed on the bill introduced to ORG on DATE . The applicant was informed that he could not expect to have a re - application examined within DATE . Referring to the principles set out in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , and section CARDINAL of LAW ( Forvaltningsloven ) , it was stated that no grounds could be given for the decision . No appeal lay against the decision by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant noted that section CARDINAL of Circular Letter No . CARDINAL of DATE on ORG contained a possibility of excluding an applicant from being listed in a naturalisation bill for a specific period if ORG ( NORP Efterretningstjeneste , PET ) considered that he or she was a danger to national security . Accordingly , since he was excluded from re - applying for DATE , he was convinced that the Minister of ORG had received information from ORG that the applicant was considered to be a danger to national security , and that therefore a security assessment had been submitted to ORG with a recommendation that the applicant be excluded from being listed in a naturalisation bill for DATE . In his view , though , there was no reason to consider him a danger to national security .", "CARDINAL . Before the Court , the Government have submitted that they can neither confirm nor deny that the decision to exclude the applicant from being listed in the naturalisation bill was taken on the basis of section CARDINAL of the said Circular Letter .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant requested that ORG grant him access to the documents concerning him , which was refused on DATE with the information that ORG would neither confirm nor deny whether it had any information about him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained about that decision to ORG , which upheld it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant \u2019s request of CARDINAL DATE that ORG grant him access to the documents concerning him was granted on DATE for the major part . A few documents were withheld with reference to the \u201c excepted information \u201d set out under LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( Forvaltningsloven ) , which includes considerations for national security or defence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not bring the refusal to grant him NORP nationality , or the refusals to grant him access to information , before the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . DATE set out that \u201c no alien shall be naturalised except by LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , of the LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c The courts of justice shall be empowered to decide any question relating to the scope of the executive \u2019s authority ; though any person wishing to question such authority shall not , by taking the case to the courts of justice , avoid temporary compliance with orders given by the executive authority . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of Act No . CARDINAL of DATE on NORP nationality , NORP nationality may be acquired through naturalisation granted by virtue of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The procedure for applying for nationality involves an interview with the police , preparation of the bill by a Ministry ( currently ORG ) , a debate and a decision by ORG , which is made up of CARDINAL members of ORG , and finally the passing of the bill by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The debates and votes of ORG are confidential and only ORG members can participate in the meetings . The decision to grant or refuse nationality is discretionary and not subject to any form of judicial review ( however , see below ) .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL bills are usually passed per year , in DATE . The passing of naturalisation bills in ORG follows the same procedure as other bills , which means CARDINAL readings of the bill before it is passed by ORG . The LAW is then promulgated in LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The initial examination of applications for naturalisation by Act of ORG is carried out by ORG . When preparing naturalisation bills and assessing whether applicants can be listed in a naturalisation bill , ORG is obliged to adhere to ORG contained in a circular ( ORG om dansk indf\u00f8dsret ved naturalisation ) , in force at the relevant time , as agreed by the majority in ORG ( Circular Letter No . CARDINAL of DATE at the relevant time ) . The guidelines stipulate the requirements that must be satisfied in order for applicants to be listed in a naturalisation bill without prior submission of their application to ORG . Applicants listed in a naturalisation bill therefore have either satisfied the requirements of the LAW or have been exempted from certain requirements following the submission of their application to the ORG . On this basis , the parties in Government who agreed on the Guidelines will vote in favour of the ORG \u2019s naturalisation bill at the readings of the bill in ORG . If an applicant fails to meet CARDINAL or more of the requirements set out in ORG , the Ministry will refuse the application in accordance with the authorisation given to ORG . The decisions by ORG to submit or refuse to submit cases to ORG , as well as the decisions of ORG , are not made pursuant to a statute , but are classified as preparation of a statute . Hence the procedure can not be characterised as an administrative process . Nevertheless , in resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG instructed ORG to comply with international conventions , and the rules of LAW and other principles of public administration to the extent possible , when preparing naturalisation bills .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW , review by the courts of the administration \u2019s general and specific decisions is a common legal remedy . The courts can not review the exercise of administrative discretion ( see , for example , ORG ( ORG ) for DATE , p. CARDINAL ( U.CARDINAL.CARDINALH ) ) , but they can conduct a judicial review of the competence of the authority , the observance of formal rules , and the legal basis of an administrative decision , including whether it is in accordance with GPE \u2019s obligations under the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Thus , in various cases the NORP courts have reviewed whether the administrative authorities\u2019 decision was in accordance with LAW , alone or taken in conjunction with LAW ( see , for example , PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ; PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE and PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , CARDINAL , DATE , referring to ORG , p. DATE , concerning respectively family reunification , the lapse of a residence permit and a deportation order ; moreover , although a decision by ORG ( PERSON ) is final pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( GPE ) , an alien may , by virtue of LAW , bring the case before the courts for a review of the legality of the administrative decision , including the compliance with LAW see , inter alia , PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE , referring to numerous ORG judgments DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) passed a judgment ( U.CARDINAL.CARDINALH ) concerning the right to judicial review under LAW relating to the process of granting nationality . ORG stated , among other things :", "\u201c ORG agrees with the view that the Minister \u2019s decisions to refrain from listing an applicant in a naturalisation bill or to refrain from submitting an application to ORG are elements of the legislative process . LAW , according to which the courts are empowered to decide any questions relating to the scope of the executive authority , does not apply to such decisions as no authority is exercised by the executive , see in this respect ORG judgment , reproduced on page CARDINAL of the NORP Weekly Law report ( GPE ) DATE .", "GPE has acceded to LAW and several other international conventions that may be significant to the processing of applications for or to the grant of nationality . Accordingly , GPE has assumed a number of obligations under international law , compliance with which is assumed , also in the preparatory works of LAW ( Indf\u00f8dsretsloven ) , when ORG and ORG exercise their discretion as to whether NORP nationality should be granted to an applicant , see in this respect PERSON , ORG on Parliamentary Proceedings ( GPE ) DATE , supplement A , column DATE . An applicant who has not been included in a naturalisation Act can therefore request the courts to review whether obligations under international law have been breached , and whether the applicant has a claim for damages or compensation in that connection . Such judicial review will not be contrary to the authority of the ORG or ORG under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) of LAW , regarding the introduction of bills , or under LAW ) on naturalisation by law . By contrast , these provisions precluded any judicial review of claims to the effect that the applicant must be listed in a naturalisation bill or must be granted nationality by an LAW . \u201d ...", "In the case in question , ORG ruled in favour of the appellant and remitted the case to ORG for retrial on the merits ( whether the appellant , on the ground of his diagnosis ( PTSD ) , had suffered discrimination in violation of LAW in conjunction with LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
