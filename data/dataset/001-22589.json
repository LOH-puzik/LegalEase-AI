{"ITEMID": "001-22589", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "JOHANNISCHE KIRCHE & PETERS v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Antonio Pastor Ridruejo", "TEXT": ["The first applicant [ PERSON ] is a NORP religious community ( ORG ) with public - law corporation status ( K\u00f6rperschaft des \u00f6ffentlichen PERSON ) whose governing board ( ORG ) is based in GPE . The second applicant [ PERSON ] is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE ( GPE ) . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE ( GPE ) .", "In DATE the first applicant requested a permit to build a chapel and cemetery on land belonging to it .", "Its request was rejected by the administrative authorities , whereupon the first applicant lodged an application with ORG . At the public hearing before that court it requested an adjournment of the proceedings concerning the cemetery .", "On DATE , after visiting the site of the planned building , ORG rejected the application concerning the chapel on the grounds that the site where it was to be built was in an undeveloped protected zone ( ORG ) and that it was not certain that public services ( PERSON ) could be installed .", "On DATE , after hearing submissions from , among others , the public - health department , the water resources office ( GPE ) , the town of PERSON ( on whose territory the first applicant \u2019s land was ) and other departments which had not given their consent or had done so only on certain conditions , the GPE administrative authorities rejected the request concerning the cemetery , in respect of which the proceedings had been resumed after ORG had given judgment , on the ground that the proposed site was in an undeveloped protected zone and it was not certain that services could be installed on the land because the town of PERSON refused to grant the first applicant a right of access over the adjoining municipal land to the site of the planned cemetery .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the application mainly on the same grounds as those set out in the judgment of DATE , to which it referred at length moreover .", "On DATE , after visiting the site of the planned cemetery , ORG upheld the judgment of ORG of DATE . It noted , among other things , that construction of the planned cemetery was incompatible with the nature of the environment surrounding the site in question , particularly as , since the entry into force on DATE of the legislative decree on the creation of NORP LOC ( LOC GPE ) , any act such as to disfigure the character of the wildlife park \u2013 even locally \u2013 was prohibited . The fact that the first applicant was a religious community did not alter that finding because it could build the cemetery on other land less affected by environmental restrictions . ORG also noted that the lack of services on the land in question was an additional factor militating against the first applicant \u2019s project .", "ORG also decided not to grant leave to appeal on points of law . The first applicant appealed against that decision .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on the ground that it did not raise an issue of fundamental importance . It noted that freedom of religion was limited by the values laid down in the LAW itself . Among those constitutional values was the protection of life \u2019s natural sources ( nat\u00fcrliche ORG ) , as declared in section CARDINAL ) of LAW , which included the creation of protected zones . Additionally , the provisions relating to planning matters applied to everyone without distinction and did not impose more restrictions on religious communities than on other persons or groups of persons . As far as the provisions relating to cemeteries were concerned , it was indisputable that the creation of a cemetery was subject to laws relating to public health and the management of water resources . The freedom of a religious community subject to public law to practise its religion did not compel the authorities to grant that community an exemption from the statutory restrictions relating to the protection of the environment and the countryside . Besides that , the question as to whether such an exemption should have been granted , under the legislative decree of DATE relating to the creation of NORP LOC , concerned provisions adopted by the NORP legislature , that is to say by a Land , and could not therefore be relied on before ORG .", "On DATE ORG , ruling as a panel of CARDINAL judges , decided not to uphold the first applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal . It noted , inter alia , that freedom of religion and freedom to manifest it was not unlimited and could be balanced against other constitutional values , of which section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW was one . It also noted that the first applicant could build the cemetery on other land which was less affected by regulatory restrictions ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
