The former Minister of Food ( ministr v\u00fd\u017eivy ) was authorised to declare , with reference to LAW , which companies had been nationalised , as recorded in ORG ( PERSON list ) . On DATE Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which amended the Decree , was published in ORG ( NORP z\u00e1kon\u016f a na\u0159\u00edzen\u00ed ) .

CARDINAL of DATE , published in ORG , the former Minister of Food declared the ORG nationalised . The nationalisation procedure was closed by an order ( v\u00fdm\u011br ) of the former Minister of Food on DATE which determined the final extent of the nationalisation .

CARDINAL ( z\u00e1kon o p\u0159evodu majetku st\u00e1tu na jin\u00e9 osoby ) ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , the applicants commenced an action for restitution of the Company against ORG and its LAW ( PERSON pro spr\u00e1vu n\u00e1rodn\u00edho majetku a jeho privatizaci ) . They claimed that they were NORP nationals and successors in title to the original owners of the Company and , therefore , persons entitled to restitution under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of LAW . They also claimed that the Company had been nationalised in a way which violated generally recognised human rights and freedoms within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW . They further submitted that the LAW had been wrongly applied to their family \u2019s Company because the nationalisation conditions laid down in the Decree , in particular the condition that the company should have CARDINAL employees , were not satisfied . The applicants argued that the Company had therefore been nationalised pursuant to Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , that is after DATE , the decisive date for restitution under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE CARDINAL ORG ( obvodn\u00ed soud ) found against the applicants . The court held that ownership of the applicants\u2019 property had passed to the ORG by the ministerial decree of CARDINAL DATE , i.e. before the decisive date of CARDINAL DATE specified in LAW . Accordingly , this LAW as well as LAW did not apply to the applicants\u2019 case . The court noted that the order of ORG DATE had only a declaratory character . It stated that the fact that the Decree had been applied to the applicants\u2019 property contra legem , as the ORG had CARDINAL employees , could not influence its finding as to the decisive date of the nationalisation . The court considered in this regard certain documentary evidence , in particular a statement from the former owners of the Company , made in response to a request from the former ORG ( PERSON v\u00fd\u017eivy ) , dated DATE , that the average number of employees DATE and DATE was CARDINAL , and heard the husband of the fourth applicant ( who died before the end of the restitution proceedings on DATE ) . He stated , inter alia , that the trade union council ( z\u00e1vodn\u00ed rada ) had wrongly calculated the number of employees , having erroneously determined the ratio of administrative staff to workers : according to the trade union council \u2019s calculation , there had been CARDINAL administrative staff members per CARDINAL worker .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG ( m\u011bstsk\u00fd soud ) .

On DATE ORG , after a public hearing , dismissed the ORG appeal , finding no violation of the applicants\u2019 rights . ORG recalled that , according to its case - law , nationalisation of property takes place by operation of law under a particular presidential decree if the conditions prescribed by the decree are complied with . Considering the question of the number of employees in the Company at the time of the nationalisation as a crucial point in order to establish whether the Decree had been applied lege artis , ORG decided to complete the taking of evidence and asked ORG ( st\u00e1tn\u00ed okresn\u00ed archiv ) , ORG ( st\u00e1tn\u00ed oblastn\u00ed archiv ) , ORG ( st\u00e1tn\u00ed \u00fast\u0159edn\u00ed archiv ) , ORG ( GPE pr\u00e1ce a soci\u00e1ln\u00edch v\u011bc\u00ed ) and ORG ( PERSON financ\u00ed ) to submit further documentary evidence .", "The documents submitted to ORG contained , in particular , information about the number of employees in the Company DATE in different categories of production .", "These documents included a letter from the former ORG , dated DATE , to the former owners of the Company and to the trade union council , asking them , inter alia , to specify the number of people employed in different sections of the Company .

The trade union council and the national administration ( n\u00e1rodn\u00ed spr\u00e1va ) informed the former ORG that the average number of employees was CARDINAL , and , by letter of DATE , they specified that DATE the average number of employees was CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG , basing its finding particularly on these documents which had not been shown to the parties during the hearing , stated , contrary to the opinion of the lower courts , that the nationalisation had been effected in compliance with the nationalisation conditions established in the Decree , i.e. before DATE .

According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) and ( CARDINAL ) , such redress consists in the surrender of property if the violation in question was caused by an act infringing generally recognised human rights and freedoms , that is , an act in contradiction with the principles referred to in LAW .
