He was represented before the ORG by Mr Jan S\u00f6dergren , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant inherited QUANTITY hectares of property from his father , of which QUANTITY hectares had been included in a joint hunting area in DATE . The provisions in force at the relevant time concerning joint hunting areas and joint hunting area associations were replaced in DATE by a LAW and in DATE by a LAW ( NORP om viltv\u00e5rdsomr\u00e5den ; SFS MONEY ) . By the latter LAW , a joint hunting area was renamed a game conservation area .", "The game conservation area to which the applicant \u2019s property belonged comprised CARDINAL hectares of land or QUANTITY including both land and water areas . Slightly CARDINAL properties or plots thereof were included in the area ; many of them were very small , covering CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s property was situated in the north - east corner of the area .", "The applicant could hunt within the game conservation area , including on his own property , but was obliged to coordinate his hunting with that of the other hunting rights holders . They were all members of ORG in GPE , ( GPE viltv\u00e5rds - omr\u00e5def\u00f6rening ) , ( henceforth ORG ) , and took part in the decisionmaking process .", "The by - laws passed by the ORG stated , among other things , that elk - hunting should usually be conducted in the form of so - called \u201c community hunting \u201d .", "On DATE the applicant requested that the ORG agree to the exclusion of his property from the game conservation area . He wished to have his property registered as a \u201c CARDINAL calf area \u201d which would allow for the shooting of QUANTITY calf DATE . He submitted that being a dairy farmer he had not participated in the hunt for DATE . Moreover , he found that a hunting party consisting of CARDINAL hunters was too big and , referring to his age , fiftyfive at the relevant time , he preferred hunting on a smaller scale .", "Since the ORG objected to the request , the matter had to be decided by ORG in GPE ( ORG ) , which by a decision of CARDINAL DATE refused the applicant \u2019s request and stated , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c ... By letters received by ORG on DATE and DATE respectively , you have requested that part of your property ... be excluded from the game conservation area . In support thereof you have stated that you intend to register a licensed elk - hunting area on the property and hunt individually thereon . This would provide you with more hunting opportunities ...", "Section CARDINAL of LAW is worded as follows :", "Upon application by the property owner or the [ ORG ] , ORG may grant the exclusion from a game conservation area of :", "a property which due to a change in use or for other reasons lacks essential importance for the activity of the area ;", "a property , or several properties with the same owner , which can comprise a separate unit for game conservation , if the remaining properties in the [ original ] game conservation area can continue to constitute a suitable area of this kind .", "... [ ORG observes that ] no change in the way the property is used has come to light . Nor can it be considered that the property lacks essential importance for the activity in the area , since together with a number of other properties , it forms the basis of the activity , which is to promote game conservation through coordination of hunting . In addition , the size of the property is not such as to be a reason for it to be considered to lack essential importance for the activity in question . Accordingly , exclusion can not be granted pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of GPE .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) elk may only be hunted after a licence has been issued by ORG and within an area that the latter has registered ( a licensed area ) . This does not apply if the hunting only concerns elk calves . The size and general nature of a licensed area must be such that it is suitable for hunting elk . ORG may refuse to register an area as licensed ... if it does not allow for the shooting of CARDINAL adult animal per year . ORG considers that effective game conservation within the meaning of LAW can not be conducted in an area smaller than what has been referred to here and referred to in LAW of LAW . Likewise , an area of this kind can not comprise a separate unit for game conservation pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL . of LAW .", "The notion \u201c game conservation \u201d is defined in LAW :", "The game must be conserved so as to", "protect the game species that belong to the game population in the country and naturally occurring bird species that are temporarily in the country ; and", "promote appropriate development of game stocks , taking into account public and private interests .", "Game conservation includes using special measures to ensure that game receives protection and support and that hunting is adapted to the supply of game . The property owner and the person holding the hunting rights are responsible for making sure that the measures are carried out and that adaptations are followed .", "Of course , since your property consists of a unit that is CARDINAL hectares , it can be registered as a \u201c CARDINAL calf area \u201d However , it can not thereby be considered to comprise a separate unit for game conservation pursuant to ORG .", "Accordingly , [ your ] property ] can not be excluded pursuant to section DATE , subsection CARDINAL . of LAW .", "As regards the question whether a decision to refuse [ your request ] contravenes [ the proportionality principle contained in ] LAW , section CARDINAL of ORG and ORG , ORG finds that there are strong reasons to support the view that it would be detrimental to effective game conservation , including elk hunting DATE which must be considered to be an important public interest \u2013 if existing game conservation areas were to be divided into smaller sections . ...", "You have not shown how game conservation could be improved if [ your ] request to exclude the property was granted . ORG considers that even if [ your ] property is part of the game conservation area , game conservation can be carried out , either together with the other partners and hunters , or separately for the individual property . Thus , there are no limitations on the right of disposition over the property in question . On the contrary , there is an important public interest in retaining the property in question as part of the game conservation area . That will maintain the aim of the property owners in forming the area , namely to allow game conservation to be carried out in an efficient manner . Game conservation \u2014 primarily conservation of the elk stock \u2014 is only efficient when it can be carried out in a continuous area that is not divided . In respect of large game , hunting is an important part of game conservation . Properly conducted hunting based on biological grounds can regulate the numbers of these stocks , so that the requirements of the Hunting Act regarding preservation and promotion are fulfilled . ... \u201d", "On an appeal , by a judgment of DATE ORG ( L\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten i Norrbottens L\u00e4n ) upheld ORG decision .", "Leave to appeal was refused on DATE by ORG ( ORG i GPE ) and on DATE by ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) .", "According to LAW , LAW ( ORG ) , which is part of LAW , all citizens are guaranteed , inter alia , freedom of association in their relations with public institutions . This freedom is defined as freedom to associate with others for public or private purposes . LAW , LAW stipulates that all citizens are protected , in their relations with public institutions , against any coercion , such as to belong to a political association , religious community or other association with opinions of a political , religious , cultural or other such nature .", "The rights and freedoms referred to in LAW , section CARDINAL may be restricted by law to the extent provided for in LAW , sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . Restrictions may only be imposed to achieve a purpose which is acceptable in a NORP society . A restriction may never go beyond what is necessary having regard to the purpose which occasioned it , nor may it be carried so far as to constitute a threat to the free formation of opinion as one of the fundaments of democracy . No restriction may be imposed solely on grounds of a political , religious , cultural or other such opinion ( ibid . ) . According to LAW , section CARDINAL , freedom of association may be restricted only in respect of organisations whose activities are of a military or quasi - military nature or constitute persecution of a population group of a particular race , colour or ethnic origin . The negative freedom of association provided for in LAW , section CARDINAL may not be restricted .", "The peaceful enjoyment of possessions is protected in , inter alia , ORG . Pursuant to LAW , section CARDINAL , the property of every citizen shall be so guaranteed that no one may be compelled by expropriation or other such disposition to surrender property to public institutions or to a private subject , or to tolerate restrictions by public institutions on the use of land or buildings , other than where necessary to satisfy pressing public interests .", "A person who is compelled to surrender property by expropriation or other such disposition shall be guaranteed compensation for the loss . Such compensation shall also be guaranteed to a person whose use of land or buildings is restricted by public institutions in such a manner that the ongoing use of land in the affected part of the property is substantially impaired , or the value of that part of the property suffers significant depreciation . Compensation shall be determined according to principles laid down by law ( ibid . ) .", "Hunting is regulated in , inter alia , LAW ( Jaktlagen ; FAC ) . The right to hunt game is attached to the ownership of real property . Thus , section QUANTITY expresses the general principle that it is the person who owns a piece of property who has the right to hunt on that property . It is , however , possible to convey and let hunting rights , with the result that the ownership of land and the right to hunt may be vested in different persons ( see sections DATE ) .", "The right to hunt may be exercised only to the extent that hunting is acceptable from the point of view of game conservation . Thus , all game is in principle protected and may be hunted only if this is permitted under LAW or under provisions or decisions based on the LAW ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Specifically with respect to elk hunting , section CARDINAL of the Act establishes the main rule that , with the exception of the hunting of elk calves , this may take place only if licensed by the relevant ORG and within an area that has been registered by ORG for this purpose ( a socalled \u201c licensed area \u201d ) . Further , it follows from section CARDINAL that a licensed area shall be of such a size and character that it is suitable for elk - hunting . ORG may refuse to register an area as a licensed area if it does not allow for the shooting of CARDINAL adult animal per year . However , even if these conditions are not met , an area may be registered as a licensed area if there are special reasons for this . In addition , an area may be registered as a licensed area allowing for CARDINAL calf to be shot DATE , if the size of the area amounts to QUANTITY .", "The right to hunt is connected with a general obligation to conserve and protect the game within one \u2019s property . Where the right to hunt has been conveyed or let , this obligation lies with the landowner and hunting right holder together . LAW provides , inter alia , that measures shall be taken for the purpose of conserving existing species of wild game and in order to promote appropriate development of game stocks , taking into account both public and private interests . Game conservation includes an obligation to use special measures to ensure that game receives protection and support and to adapt hunting to the supply of game ( ibid . ) .", "With the purpose of coordinating hunting and facilitating game conservation , NORP legislation has for a long time provided land owners with the opportunity to join their properties into joint hunting areas by a unanimous or qualified majority decision . LAW on the Right to PERSON ( Lagen om r\u00e4tt till jakt ; PERSON ) contained provisions on joint hunting areas and joint hunting area associations . These provisions were replaced by a new Act which entered into force on DATE , ORG DATE ( ORG om jaktv\u00e5rdsomr\u00e5den ; MONEY ) . This Act was in turn replaced by LAW ( NORP om viltv\u00e5rdsomr\u00e5den ; SFS MONEY ) , which entered into force on DATE . The provisions of the new Act are in many respects the same as , or similar to , the provisions contained in the old Act . A joint hunting area association existing at the time of the entry into force of the new Act shall be regarded as a game conservation area association in accordance with LAW ( see the transitional provisions of LAW ) .", "The CARDINAL Act provides that CARDINAL or more properties or parts of properties may be joined into a game conservation area , for the purpose of promoting the conservation of game through coordination of hunting and measures to protect the game ( section CARDINAL ) . Where this is done , the property owners concerned shall form a game conservation area association ( viltv\u00e5rdsomr\u00e5def\u00f6rening ) . Those who own land incorporated in such an area are members of the association ( section CARDINAL ) .", "The provisions of the LAW are equally applicable to publicly and privately owned land .

Also with respect to other land , public or private , the right of the PERSON to hunt enjoys special protection . Thus , section CARDINAL of the LAW also provides that the formation of a game conservation area may not entail limitations on the hunting rights of the PERSON .", "The relevant ORG decides on the establishment of a game conservation area upon application from CARDINAL or several of the property owners concerned ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . For such an area to be formed , CARDINAL of the owners , representing CARDINAL of the total area , must agree ( section CARDINAL ) . Another requirement is that the creation of the area shall promote the preservation of the kind of wild game that the coordination is intended to preserve and protect . Finally , it is required that the area be suitable with regard to its size and geographical position . However , no property can be included in a game conservation area if , due to its size or use , it lacks importance for the activity within the area ( section CARDINAL) . Conversely , land that is capable of being retained as a separate unit for the purpose of game conservation can not be included in the game conservation area without the owner \u2019s consent ( ibid . ) .", "As a general rule , the question of whether to form a game conservation area shall be investigated under the guidance of a person appointed by ORG ( section CARDINAL ) .
