On DATE ORG dismissed the application by the childcare authority and ORG to deprive the applicant of his parental responsibility over N. It also dismissed the applicant \u2019s counterclaim to end PERSON \u2019s guardianship over ORG and to return PERSON to him . In taking that decision ORG relied on the report of a psychological examination of the child carried out on DATE by a municipal centre for children \u2019s psychological , medical and social adaptation . The report stated , in particular , that ORG was in the process of developing the basis of his mental and psychological health , for which he needed stability , to be provided first and foremost by constant caregiver figures and a permanent place of residence .

He was aware that his son , who had not seen him for a long time , needed time to get used to him again . He was ready to change his place of work to be able to adapt better to his son \u2019s schedule . He also stressed that he paid child maintenance and supported him financially .

He had committed the murder in front of ORG and had thereby caused him profound psychological trauma . The applicant should not be allowed to see ORG as it would undermine his health and psychological development . It would therefore be against ORG \u2019s interests to resume contact with his father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered a psychological examination of ORG to establish whether it was possible to resume contact between ORG and his father , and if so what form that should take , and the frequency and duration of contact .

It can be assumed that the child is in a state of stress ... Only after a certain time ... the boy relaxed and started talking calmly , and agreed to draw a family . ORG appeared stressed when drawing . On the drawing the boy depicted his mum , dad and himself . However , it is unclear why the whole family was drawn by the boy . This could reflect the child \u2019s wish to have a full family , or it could mean that the murder of his mother has been erased from the child \u2019s memory , which could be a defensive mechanism .", "Having compared ORG \u2019s references from the nursery school dated DATE and the above observations of CARDINAL DATE , it can be noted that the child \u2019s behaviour has changed , showing signs of acute psychological and traumatic distress . This is confirmed by the child \u2019s grandmother , who submitted that the child is agitated ... has difficulty falling asleep , cries in his sleep and has started to show aggression ... In the [ psychological centre ] N. also displayed verbal aggression to other children . [ The psychologist ] therefore came to the conclusion that ORG needed timely psychological or psychotherapeutic assistance to overcome the consequences of a psychological trauma . \u201d", "- reports from ORG \u2019s nursery school , dated DATE , and from his current kindergarten ;", "- the carrying out of a psychological examination of the child , as ordered by the court on DATE , had been impossible owing to ORG \u2019s refusal to allow the experts to have access to the boy , meaning the case material was returned to the court by the expert without enforcement .", "In the light of the foregoing , ORG concluded that it was not in ORG \u2019s interests to resume contact with his father . ORG noted , in particular , that the applicant had not submitted any information about the current state of his mental health , and he had not shown that his mental health had improved or that he did not present a danger to N. Furthermore , ORG took into account the fact that ORG had been brought up by his grandparents from DATE , that he had an established way of life and that he had not seen his father for a long time . The applicant often left on long business trips , which would prevent DATE meetings . Lastly , both grandparents had refused to see the applicant because of their hostility towards him , which made it impossible to organise meetings between ORG and the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal submissions the applicant complained , in particular , that a psychological examination of ORG had never been performed . The finding that it was not in ORG \u2019s interest to resume contact with his father had therefore not been based on the assessment of an expert . He also complained that neither he nor his counsel had been informed of the date of the hearing of CARDINAL DATE . Lastly , he enclosed an expert opinion of CARDINAL DATE , which read as follows :", "\u201c Conclusions :", "CARDINAL . NORP In view of the incompleteness of the data [ failure to examine N. in view of ORG \u2019s refusal to give the experts access to ORG ] , the experts consider that at the present time only short meetings between [ the applicant ] and the child are possible ( not TIME CARDINAL times per month ) in public places on condition that the child has a positive or neutral attitude towards the father .", "CARDINAL . An assessment of whether contact between the child and his father could damage the child \u2019s health or psychological development is impossible given the absence of any data on the child \u2019s psychological stability , his attitude to his father at the present time , or the influence of relatives on the child \u2019s attitude to his father . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that the judge had included a false statement in the case file that he had been informed of the date of the hearing by mobile telephone . He enclosed a list of telephone calls provided by his mobile operator showing that he had not received any calls from the court . He also complained that a letter notifying his counsel of the date of the hearing of DATE had only been dispatched on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied that the fact of the belated notification of the applicant \u2019s counsel had been confirmed . Given that an appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was pending , that issue would be examined during the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an appeal hearing . The applicant and his counsel were both present . ORG upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , finding that it had been lawful , sufficiently reasoned and justified . It noted that an expert opinion could not be obtained because ORG had avoided the experts . It was impossible to take into account the expert opinion of CARDINAL DATE because it had been made after the firstinstance judgment . ORG also found that a notification letter about the hearing of CARDINAL DATE had been sent to the applicant \u2019s address but had been returned to the court as undelivered . The failure to collect the notification letter from the post office had amounted to a waiver of the right to attend the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG refused to refer the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal to the ORG of ORG for examination , finding that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had been lawful , sufficiently reasoned and justified . She noted , in particular , that the expert opinion of CARDINAL DATE could not lead the court to change its findings because the experts had not been able to examine N.", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG of GPE also refused to refer the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal to ORG of ORG for examination , finding that no significant violations of substantive or procedural law had influenced the outcome of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Despite the court \u2019s decisions , the applicant resumed contact with ORG over time , meeting the boy at school , and having telephone and ORG conversations with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought new proceedings against ORG , seeking to have her guardianship of ORG terminated and for ORG to be returned to him . ORG brought a counterclaim to have the applicant \u2019s parental responsibility restricted and to prevent the applicant \u2019s contact with the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application , having regard to the evidence below .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that ORG lived with his maternal grandmother and guardian PERSON and that his housing conditions were adequate . During an inspection of the child \u2019s living conditions , he had explained that he was comfortable living with PERSON , and that they had a trusting and warm relationship . He also explained that he wished to continue living with his grandmother , but maintain contact with his father by meeting him from time - to - time and communicating with him by telephone .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s housing conditions were also adequate .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted the applicant \u2019s submission to the effect that during his absences for work the child would live with his paternal grandparents . It further noted that the conditions at the paternal PERSON house were also suitable and that they were ready to look after PERSON in the applicant \u2019s absence .", "CARDINAL . ORG questioned PERSON , who explained that he lived with his maternal grandparents and that he liked living with them . The boy also submitted that he communicated with his father , who visited him at school and had regular telephone and ORG conversations with him . His father took an interest in his health and his school results . PERSON expressed a wish to remain living with his grandmother because he had got used to it .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that it was clear from school reports that ORG was showing good results at school , that his mental capacity was above average and that he was interested in studying . PERSON was being brought up by his grandmother PERSON , who was actively engaged in ORG school life . The applicant regularly visited ORG at school . After such meetings ORG only talked about computers and computer games , was less interested in studying , and became more sensitive and reserved .", "CARDINAL . Having therefore taken into consideration ORG \u2019s age , the fact that he had been living with ORG from DATE , was attached to her , loved her and had expressed a wish to continue living with her , and that the applicant \u2019s working schedule required long absences , ORG held that the child \u2019s interests required that he continue to live with his grandmother , which would be more favourable to his development .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s counterclaims . It held that there were no grounds to restrict the applicant \u2019s parental responsibility or to ban his communicating with ORG The applicant had positive references from work , the compulsory medical measures he had been undergoing had been lifted and he was no longer under psychiatric supervision . The applicant also cared about his son \u2019s life and health , sought communication with him , maintained contact with him over the telephone and Internet , visited him at school , and made regular child maintenance payments . There had furthermore been no evidence that the applicant had any harmful influence on the child . The ORG emphasised that domestic law provided that a child had a right to communicate with his parents and that a guardian had no right to prevent such communication , except if it was contrary to the child \u2019s interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the above judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the childcare authority carried out a monitoring visit at the child \u2019s place of residence . It was established that ORG did not prevent ORG \u2019s communicating with the applicant . ORG submitted that he saw the applicant during breaks between classes at school and communicated with him over the telephone and by ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
