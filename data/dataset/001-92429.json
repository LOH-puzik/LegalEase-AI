The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been a judge for DATE . By virtue of an amendment to the law on ORG DATE , which came into effect on DATE , the status of a \u201c retired judge \u201d was created ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "On DATE the applicant who had retired on DATE on grounds of ill health acquired the status of a \u201c retired judge \u201d . Under the applicable provisions of domestic law retired judges were entitled , as from DATE , to a special retirement pension equivalent to seventyfive per cent of their last full salary ( s\u0119dziowski stan spoczynku ) DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW entered into force . By a further amendment to the DATE Law of DATE , which came into effect on CARDINAL DATE , retired judges who had acquired the right to a special retirement pension were required to submit a declaration under that LAW . In DATE the applicant made a declaration under the provisions of that Act to the effect that she had never secretly collaborated with the NORP secret services .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on an unspecified date , the Commissioner of Public Interest applied to ORG , acting as the firstinstance lustration court , to institute proceedings in the applicant \u2019s case under LAW on the ground that she had lied in her lustration declaration by denying that she had collaborated with the secret services .

During the proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer . The case file could be consulted by the applicant and her lawyer in the secret registry of the lustration court .

She was questioned by the court and commented on the evidence at the court \u2019s disposal .

The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same court , acting as a court of appeal , upheld the contested judgment , holding that the evidence in the case file was sufficient to find that the applicant had knowingly and intentionally collaborated with the NORP secret services .

In her pleadings submitted to the ORG the applicant argued that a decision to divest her of her special pension was unlawful as the requirements of LAW did not apply to retired judges . Even supposing that retired judges were obliged to make a lustration declaration , they could not be divested of their status under the provisions of LAW . In any event , such a decision could only be given after disciplinary proceedings had been conducted under the provisions of LAW , but no such proceedings had been conducted in her case . She requested that payment of her special pension be resumed .", "CARDINAL .
