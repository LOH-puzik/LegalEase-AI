Turning to the instant case , it should be considered that even if [ the applicant ] proved that her statements directed against Mr PERSON were true or that she had a belief based on a well - founded basis that the allegations were true , that in any event , would not justify the trial court to apply LAW .

The appellate court considers that , in deciding the severity of the criminal measures against the applicant , her particular psychological situation - since the beginning of all criminal proceedings against her - should have been taken into consideration .

The ORG submitted that the courts had failed to take into account evidence pointing to the fact that \u201c the inadequacy of the actions of the police and the prosecution service in respect of herself and her family in the case concerning the kidnapping of PERSON could have led [ the applicant ] to the justified belief that her allegations concerning Mr PERSON had been true and that she had been \u2018 defending a socially justified interest\u2019 \u201d . In this connection , the ORG stated in his appeal that :", "\u201c Furthermore , the courts\u2019 view that the defendant was not defending a socially justified interest because she was participating in her own election campaign and aiming in the first place to achieve her own private objective is not supported by the evidence which was collected and disclosed at the hearing .", "The participation in one \u2019s own election campaign can not be an obstacle to speaking on the subject of ensuring respect for the law by institutions and public personalities .
