He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE and from DATE until DATE the applicant was in pretrial detention in FAC .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s subsequent detention in several other prisons and remand centres is not the subject of the instant application . On an unspecified date , presumably in DATE , the applicant was released and he is currently at liberty .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s description of the conditions of his detention , as reproduced from the materials of his civil action , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . All the cells to which the applicant was assigned in FAC at the material time , with the exception of cell no . CARDINAL , were overcrowded to the point that the applicant had less than the statutory minimum standard of QUANTITY ( m\u00b2 ) of personal space .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had a TIME period of outdoor exercise every day . He spent TIME inside his cell .", "CARDINAL . NORP The toilet annex in each of the applicant \u2019s cells was QUANTITY away from the dining table and was separated from the rest of the cell by a cloth .", "CARDINAL . The cells were infested with cockroaches and other bugs .", "CARDINAL . There was only cold running water in the tap and the applicant had to use it for his DATE toiletry needs and for washing dishes . The applicant had CARDINAL hot shower per week .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained under an ordinary security regime . He was not classified as a \u201c dangerous detainee \u201d . He claimed that during his detention he had frequently and routinely been subjected to a personal check ( kontrola osobista ) by the guards of FAC . In his submission , he had to strip naked in front of a guard and bend over to show his anus . In the applicant \u2019s view the \u201c visual penetration \u201d by the guard could be compared to sexual harassment and he felt humiliated each time he had undergone a personal check .", "CARDINAL . As submitted by the penitentiary authorities in the course of the civil proceedings , the applicant , just like any other detainee in FAC , had been subjected to a body search each time he left or returned to the remand centre \u2019s main wing ( pawilon g\u0142\u00f3wny ) . That practice was aimed at preventing the distribution of dangerous or illicit objects among detainees . It was stressed that body searches had always been performed in an enclosed room and without the presence of unauthorised persons .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant did not give any further details about the practice of body checks . He did not indicate the dates of the impugned incidents or their total number . He did not submit how often he had left the remand centre \u2019s main wing and whether he had been subjected to a personal check when going to his outdoor exercise , a visit or on other occasions .", "CARDINAL . During his detention , the applicant did not file any formal complaints with the penitentiary authorities about the impugned practice of subjecting him to body checks .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a civil action in tort , seeking CARDINAL Polish zlotys ( PLN ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) in compensation for the suffering which he claimed to have experienced in ORG due to the inadequate living conditions and body searches .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s submissions to the domestic court about the conditions of his detention and the manner of performing personal checks by the guards were similar to the above description ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . The applicant claimed that , when he had been detained in FAC , he had felt \u201c traumatised \u201d and had difficulties sleeping .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the respondent party , namely ORG and ORG , asked that the case be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . They submitted that the maximum allowed capacity had , at the relevant time , been exceeded in FAC . As a consequence , the remand centre \u2019s governor , acting under DATE Ordinance , decided to reduce the statutory minimum standard of CARDINAL m\u00b2 . He informed a competent penitentiary judge of that decision . The governor acted , therefore , within the law .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the authorities confirmed , to a large extent , the applicant \u2019s submissions as to the overall living and sanitary conditions in the remand centre . They stressed , however , that the cells had always been sufficiently ventilated and that the furniture , such as tables , could be freely moved around the cell so that detainees could have their meals in a more comfortable atmosphere , further away from the toilet annex . It was also submitted that the remand centre was disinfected twice a DATE by a specialised independent company . Sanitary inspections carried out on a regular basis did not reveal any irregularities .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s body searches , the authorities invoked LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and section CARDINAL of the DATE Ordinance , which laid down the rules concerning body searches of detainees and convicted persons . It was further noted that the applicant , just like any other detainee in FAC , had been subjected to a body search each time he left or returned to the remand centre \u2019s main wing . That practice was aimed at preventing the distribution of dangerous or illicit objects among detainees . It was stressed that body searches had always been performed in an enclosed room and without the presence of unauthorised persons .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the remand centre \u2019s authorities argued that the applicant had not experienced mental suffering due to the conditions of his detention . He had been under the constant supervision of a psychiatrist and neurologist because he had in the past been diagnosed with personality disorders and alcoholism . During his medical consultations the applicant did not complain about any negative effects of his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) gave judgment partly in the applicant \u2019s favour and awarded him compensation in the amount of FAC CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The domestic court established that , at the relevant time , ORG , which had a maximum allowed capacity of CARDINAL places , had been severely overcrowded . For example , as of DATE , CARDINAL detainees and as of DATE , CARDINAL detainees were held there . Throughout his detention in the remand centre , the applicant was assigned subsequently to CARDINAL different cells . In each of those cells , with the single exception of cell no . CARDINAL , the available space per person was below the statutory minimum standard of CARDINAL m\u00b2 . DATE and DATE the remand centre \u2019s governor sent DATE reports to the penitentiary authorities informing them about the rates of overcrowding at any given time .", "CARDINAL . The domestic court further established that , as a result of the overcrowding , not all detainees could fit around the dining table inside the cell . Many had to have their meals sitting on the bed . The table in the applicant \u2019s cell was situated QUANTITY away from the toilet annex . The particular position and certain technical problems with the windows limited air circulation and access to natural light . As a result the applicant \u2019s cells were insufficiently ventilated and lit .", "CARDINAL . It was also confirmed that the toilet annexes in FAC were either not separated from the rest of the cell or separated by a cloth hung over a metal rod which was permanently attached to the walls . In the applicant \u2019s cells the toilet annexes were separated with a bed sheet . In the court \u2019s opinion , such separation did not provide sufficient privacy because the toilet was very near the beds and dining tables .", "CARDINAL . The domestic court also established that , despite the efforts of the remand centre \u2019s administration , the applicant \u2019s cells had been infested with cockroaches .", "CARDINAL . As to the practice of body searches , the domestic court found the explanations provided by the remand centre to be true . In consequence , the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation on this account was considered unjustified .", "CARDINAL . Having analysed the applicant \u2019s medical history , the domestic court agreed that the living conditions in the remand centre had not been the cause of the applicant \u2019s anxiety and sleeping difficulties .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning on the merits , ORG relied on the judgments of ORG of DATE and of ORG of CARDINAL DATE , as well as the jurisprudence of ORG .", "CARDINAL . It concluded that the applicant \u2019s detention in overcrowded cells ( during CARDINAL out of a total of DATE ) , in inadequate sanitary conditions ( cockroaches and the lack of sufficient separation of the toilet annex ) , with insufficient ventilation and lighting , had given rise to suffering and humiliation which had exceeded the inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment . That , in turn , constituted an infringement of the plaintiff \u2019s personal rights protected by LAW ( PERSON ) . Moreover , the domestic court held that the requirement of Article CARDINAL of LAW , namely that the act or omission leading to the infringement of a personal right had to be unlawful , was satisfied in the light of the finding of ORG that Article CARDINAL of LAW was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . In its analysis concerning compensation , the domestic court reiterated that according to LAW of LAW and the established domestic practice , compensation for a breach of a personal right should be \u201c just \u201d and , therefore , it should be of an economically significant value and not merely symbolic .", "CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The domestic court decided not to order the applicant to bear any of the costs of the proceedings ( koszty procesu ) and waived his court fee ( koszty s\u0105dowe ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) dismissed the appeal brought by the respondent party . The appellate court upheld the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . A cassation appeal to ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) was not available due to the low amount of the claim .", "CARDINAL . A detailed description of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning general rules governing the conditions of detention in GPE and domestic remedies available to detainees alleging that conditions of their detention were inadequate are set out in the ORG \u2019s pilot judgments given in the cases of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on CARDINAL DATE ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL respectively ) . More recent developments are described in the ORG \u2019s decision in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on CARDINAL October CARDINAL ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The socalled personal check ( kontrola osobista ) of convicted persons is authorised and defined by LAW of LAW ( NORP karny wykonawczy ) , which in its relevant part reads as follows :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL A convicted person must obey the regulations concerning ... prison order and execute the orders of supervisors and other authorised persons , in particular :", "...", "\u00a7 CARDINAL In cases justified by internal order and security a convicted person will be subjected to a personal check .", "\u00a7 CARDINAL A personal check means an inspection of the body and checking of clothes , underwear and footwear as well as [ other ] objects in a [ prisoner \u2019s ] possession . The inspection of the body , checking of clothes and footwear shall be carried out in a room , in the absence of third parties and persons of the opposite sex and shall be effected by persons of the same sex . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Moreover , section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of the Ordinance of the Minister of ORG of CARDINAL DATE on the security of the establishments of ORG ( ORG w sprawie sposob\u00f3w ochrony jednostek organizacyjnych PERSON ) , authorises a personal or cursory ( kontrola pobie\u017cna ) check of a convicted person in a detention facility in order to find dangerous or illicit objects or to foil an escape , or in any other justified cases ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
