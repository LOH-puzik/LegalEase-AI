ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "C. Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON was born in DATE and died in DATE . He was an NORP citizen and lived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the carabinieri reported the applicant to the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office for various alleged offences , including fraud , committed before DATE . They said that they had not questioned the suspect because they had failed to contact him at his last - known address . In fact , his flat , in via PERSON , had been closed and his furniture seized by the judicial authorities ; the manager of the building , who was also the administrator appointed by the court in the attachment proceedings , was unaware of Mr. PERSON \u2019s new address .", "On DATE , the investigating judge issued a \" judicial notification \" ( comunicazione giudiziaria ) intended to inform the applicant of the opening of criminal proceedings against him . A bailiff attempted to serve it on Mr. PERSON at the address - via Fonteiana - shown in ORG records , but without success : he had moved - DATE according to the carabinieri and DATE according to the police - and had omitted to inform FAC of his change of residence as required by law .", "CARDINAL . ORG Meanwhile Mr. PERSON , when renewing his driving licence in DATE , had given , as his current address , that shown in ORG records ( via Fonteiana ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , after unsuccessful searches at the latter address , the investigating judge declared the accused untraceable ( irreperibile ) , appointed an official defence lawyer for him and continued the investigations . Thereafter , in pursuance of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , all the documents which had to be served on the applicant were lodged in the registry of the investigating judge , the defence counsel being informed in each case .", "On DATE and CARDINAL May and DATE , the investigating judge issued CARDINAL arrest warrants which were not executed because the competent authorities still did not know where Mr. PERSON was living . It should , however , be noted that the address indicated on the warrants was via PERSON . On each occasion , the carabinieri drew up a report of fruitless searches ( vane ricerche ) . Mr. PERSON was thenceforth regarded as \" latitante \" , that is as a person wilfully evading the execution of a warrant issued by a court ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was committed for trial .", "A first hearing was held by ORG on DATE . Although he had been informed of the lodging of the summons to appear ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the accused \u2019s officially - appointed defence counsel did not appear , with the result that the court had to appoint a replacement and postponed the hearings until DATE . On DATE , a new lawyer was officially assigned , because the CARDINAL appointed on CARDINAL May did not appear either . The court adjourned the trial and concluded it on DATE , after appointing , during the sitting and again for the same reason , another official defence lawyer . It sentenced Mr. PERSON to DATE imprisonment ( reclusione ) and a fine ( multa ) of CARDINAL GPE . The public prosecutor had called for sentences of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of CARDINAL GPE and the officially - appointed defence counsel had agreed with his submissions .", "The judgment was lodged in the registry on DATE and a copy was served on the lawyer . It became final on DATE , as he had not entered an appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the public prosecutor \u2019s office issued an arrest warrant . The applicant was arrested at his home in GPE , CARDINAL via Pian Due Torri , on the following DATE . On DATE , he raised a \" procedural objection \" ( incidente d\u2019esecuzione ) as regards this warrant and at the same time filed a \" late appeal \" ( appello apparentemente tardivo ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He appointed a lawyer and instructed him to draft the grounds of appeal . However , he submitted them himself on DATE and lodged a supplementary memorial on DATE . On DATE and DATE , he appointed new lawyers .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG dismissed the \" procedural objection \" and ordered that the papers be sent to ORG for a ruling on the \" late appeal \" .", "Mr. PERSON maintained that he had been wrongly declared \" latitante \" and that the notifications of the summons to appear and of the extract from the judgment rendered by default were therefore null and void .", "He explained that , as he had received notice to quit from his landlord at DATE , he had left his flat in via Fonteiana and , before finding a new one , had lived in a hotel . He pointed out that his new address ( via Pian Due Torri ) was known to the police since , on DATE , they had summoned him to the local police station for questioning ; the same applied both to the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office , which , on DATE ( that is to say , DATE before adoption of the judgment ) , had sent him a \" judicial notification \" concerning other criminal proceedings , and to various public authorities , which had served documents on him , using the notification service of FAC .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON \u2019s appeal was examined together with an appeal that had been entered by his co - accused . ORG heard Mr. PERSON both on the merits of the case and on the fact that he had been treated as \" latitante \" .", "The public prosecutor attached to ORG also submitted that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE should be set aside ; in his view , Mr. PERSON should not have been regarded as \" latitante \" .", "On DATE , ORG confirmed the conviction of the co - accused . As to Mr. PERSON , it held that his appeal was inadmissible for failure to observe time - limits . It ruled that the time - limit for filing the grounds of appeal - DATE , under LAW had begun to run on DATE , the date on which the arrest warrant had been served , whereas the memorial had not been submitted until DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON lodged an appeal on points of law but it was dismissed by ORG on DATE . It accepted that ORG had wrongly declared the \" late appeal \" inadmissible for failure to file the grounds in time : it should first have determined whether , as the appellant alleged , the first - instance proceedings were void . However , ORG concluded that this was not so : it considered that Mr. PERSON had rightly been declared first to be \" irreperibile \" and then to be \" latitante \" . It added that ORG should have declared the appeal inadmissible as out of time , since it had been lodged at a time when the judgment under appeal had already become final .", "Mr. PERSON , who had been in custody since DATE to serve his sentence , as well as other suspended sentences previously passed on him , died in prison on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG LAW lays down the methods for notifying an accused person who is not in custody of the various documents pertaining to the investigations and the trial .", "When the first procedural step involving the presence of such an accused is taken , the court , the public prosecutor \u2019s office or the official of the criminal investigation department must ask the accused to indicate the place where notifications should be made or to elect an address for service ( Article CARDINAL , first paragraph ) . If he does not do so , LAW applies ; this provides , inter alia , that if the first notification can not be made to the party concerned in person , it is to be delivered , at his place of residence or of work , to a person living with him or to the caretaker . If those CARDINAL places are not known , notification is to be left where the party concerned is living temporarily or has an address , by delivery to CARDINAL of the above - mentioned persons .", "CARDINAL . ORG LAW does not define the concept of \" irreperibile \" . Nevertheless , according to the relevant rules , it may apply to any person on whom a document concerning criminal proceedings opened against him has to be served and whom it has not been possible to trace because his address was unknown . The mere establishment of this fact - the question whether there has been a wilful evasion of the investigations being irrelevant in this context - is enough for this purpose . According to LAW , the bailiff has to inform the judge who ordered the notification . The latter , after directing that further searches be conducted at the place of birth or last residence , will then issue a decree ( decreto ) to the effect that notifications shall be effected by being lodged in the registry of the court before which proceedings are in progress . The defence lawyer must be informed immediately whenever a document is so lodged ; if the accused has no lawyer , the court has to assign one to him officially .", "CARDINAL . ORG This system of notification is also used if the accused is \" latitante \" ( LAW ) .", "According to the first paragraph of LAW , any person wilfully evading execution of , inter alia , an arrest warrant shall be regarded as being \" latitante \" . The third paragraph states that whenever classification as \" latitante \" entails legal consequences , these are to extend to the other proceedings instituted against the person in question . If he does not have a lawyer of his own choosing , an official appointment will be made .", "ORG has consistently held that an intention to evade arrest is to be presumed where adequate searches by the criminal investigation police have been unsuccessful . This presumption exists even if the person in question , after moving and failing to make the statutory declaration of change of residence , has not resorted to any special subterfuges to avoid arrest ( ORG , DATE , no . CARDINAL , PERSON , no . CARDINAL ; FAC , DATE , no . CARDINAL , Repertorio DATE , no . CARDINAL ; PERSON delle decisioni penali , DATE , no . DATE ) . In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG specified , however , that the presumption can be rebutted and is thus not irrefutable .", "The term \" adequate searches \" leaves the criminal investigation police with a measure of discretion as to the steps to be taken ; this discretion is however limited , in that the person concerned must be sought at the residence indicated in the arrest warrant ( ORG , DATE , no . CARDINAL , massima no . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Although trial by \" contumacia \" ( by default ; Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW ) is classified as a special form of proceedings , the ordinary procedure is followed ( LAW , first paragraph ) . Such a trial is held when the accused , after being duly summoned , does not appear at the hearing and neither requests nor agrees that it take place in his absence .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under NORP law , an accused who fails to appear ( contumace ) has the same rights as an accused who is present . He is , for example , entitled to be defended by a lawyer - who will be officially assigned to him by the court if he has not chosen CARDINAL himself - and to lodge an ordinary appeal or an appeal on points of law against the judgment concerning him . The time - limit for entering such an appeal begins to run only from DATE on which he was notified of the decision by means of service of an extract from the judgment . However , in the case of a person who has also been declared to be \" irreperibile \" or \" latitante \" , time begins to run from the date of the lodging of the judgment in the registry of the court that rendered it .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to NORP case - law , individuals who have not entered an appeal and who consider that the notification of the judgment was irregular can lodge a \" late appeal \" . The time - limits to be observed are the same as for the ordinary appeal ( DATE for giving notice of appeal and DATE for submitting the grounds ) , but both start to run from the date when the person in question had knowledge of the judgment . Nevertheless , in the case of a person regarded as \" latitante \" the court hearing the appeal can determine the merits of the criminal charge only if it finds that there has been a failure to comply with the rules governing declarations that an accused is \" latitante \" or governing service on him of the documents in the proceedings ; in addition , it is for the person concerned to prove that he was not seeking to evade justice .", "CARDINAL . ORG LAW provides , inter alia , that proceedings shall be null and void if the rules on the participation , assistance and representation of the accused have not been observed . Failure to serve a summons to appear at the hearing and the absence , at that stage , of the accused \u2019s defence counsel constitute grounds of incurable nullity , of which the court must take notice of its own motion at any point in the proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
