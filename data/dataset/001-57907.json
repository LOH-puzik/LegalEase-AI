Mr Schouten is a GPE national who lives in GPE . He made his application in his capacity as sole managing director of ORG mevrouw ORG ( \" Breevaart \" ) , a limited liability company under GPE law which has its registered office in PERSON Ambacht . ORG , the ORG and the company PERSON having apparently accepted that for present purposes PERSON may be identified with the company , the ORG will hereinafter generally refer to PERSON only .", "CARDINAL . Breevaart owned a physiotherapy practice , including the practice \u2019s premises and equipment . When PERSON \u2019s then sole managing director and shareholder died in DATE , the practice was carried on by CARDINAL physiotherapists who had been her associates . PERSON , having apparently become managing director of the company , entered into an arrangement with the physiotherapists . Under this arrangement , PERSON concluded contracts with the various health - insurance funds ( ziekenfondsen ) but the physiotherapists themselves invoiced the health - insurance funds . PERSON was entitled to PERCENT of each fee for making the LOC and equipment available to the physiotherapists . The physiotherapists were entitled to separate remuneration for DATE running of the practice ; the funds made their payments to PERSON , from whom the physiotherapists received the sums due to them .", "In DATE the physiotherapists bought the practice , including the premises and the equipment , from the company , and in DATE they formed a partnership . Both these operations were made retrospectively effective from DATE . The arrangement with PERSON thus ceased to be valid .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE ORG - being ( Bedrijfsvereniging voor de Gezondheid , Geestelijke en Maatschappelijke Belangen - \" the ORG \" ) sent PERSON a demand for payment of contributions in respect of the physiotherapists under LAW ( PERSON ) , ORG ( GPE ) , LAW ( PERSON ) and ORG ( Wet op de arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering ) for DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE CARDINAL Mr Schouten lodged an objection to the ORG \u2019s demand and requested formal confirmation ( voor beroep vatbare beschikking ) of its decision , with a view to lodging an appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG gave such confirmation on DATE with the reasons for its decision .", "Basing itself on the circumstances outlined in paragraph CARDINAL above , the ORG took the view that , although the contractual relationship between the physiotherapists and PERSON could not be classified as a contract of employment , it was the \" social equivalent \" ( maatschappelijk gelijkgesteld ) of such a contract .", "The physiotherapists were thus regarded not as independent practitioners but as employees of PERSON , who consequently was under a legal obligation to pay social - security contributions for them . As to the DATE , the ORG did not consider itself bound by the retrospective effect of the CARDINAL agreements .", "CARDINAL . Mr Schouten appealed to ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE , without setting out any grounds . He asked for an extension of time for submitting such grounds until DATE ; the reasons given were , firstly , that in view of the DATE holidays it would not be possible to prepare the necessary documents and , secondly , that proceedings in another case pending before ORG ( Centrale PERSON ) raised very similar issues and he wished to be able to amend his reasoning in the light of the judgment in that case .", "An extension was granted until DATE .", "The ORG withdrew its claims concerning DATE in a letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr Schouten supplemented his notice of appeal with a statement of grounds on DATE . In addition to making submissions relating to the independence of the physiotherapists he argued that the ORG \u2019s decision was vitiated because LAW had been violated : firstly , the lapse of DATE and DATE - between the request for formal confirmation of the ORG \u2019s initial decision and delivery of that confirmation had been longer than could be considered \" reasonable \" , and secondly , the fact that by withholding formal confirmation an occupational association ( bedrijfsvereniging ) could delay an appellant \u2019s access to a tribunal indefinitely constituted a breach of the principle of \" fair play \" .", "CARDINAL . The Appeals Tribunal held a hearing on DATE and delivered its judgment on DATE .", "It held that , although the contractual relationship between Mr Schouten and the physiotherapists could not be classified as an \" employment relationship \" , it should , under the case - law of ORG , be considered the \" social equivalent \" of CARDINAL ; the physiotherapists were therefore to be regarded as Mr Schouten \u2019s \" employees \" for the purposes of the relevant social - security legislation and PERSON was therefore required to pay contributions for them .", "As to PERSON arguments based on LAW , ORG held that it was wrong for an administrative authority to withhold formal confirmation without good reason , especially if it did so for a very long time , as the ORG had done in the instant case . Nevertheless , even if LAW ) were applicable and had been violated , the applicant could not derive from it rights which were at variance with binding provisions of GPE law ( dwingend recht ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr Schouten lodged a notice of appeal with ORG on DATE , requesting an extension of time for filing his arguments ; the reason given for this request was the need to obtain and study a copy of a judgment of ORG itself which had been cited in the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Mr Schouten filed his written arguments with ORG on DATE . He argued , inter alia , that ORG had erred in not considering the case under LAW ) ; the LAW was directly applicable in the GPE , taking precedence over national law , and not only had formal confirmation not been provided within a \" reasonable time \" but the fact that appellants were subject to strict time - limits to request formal confirmation whereas occupational associations were subject to none for responding resulted in clear procedural inequality . The conduct of the FAC , which was open to criticism , should be sanctioned and the obvious sanction was to quash its decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE .", "It found that at the material time the physiotherapists could properly be treated as \" employees \" for the purposes of the relevant social - security legislation .", "Referring to its previous case - law , it further held that it was unnecessary to address the question of the applicability of LAW . The wording of LAW ( article CARDINAL ) was of no help in the matter , and the tribunal was not aware of \" any relevant decision of ORG . In any case , where formal confirmation of a decision had been delayed , ORG had regard primarily to general principles of good governance ( algemene beginselen van behoorlijk bestuur ) and , where necessary , to the principle of \" fair play \" .", "ORG agreed with PERSON that it had taken the FAC a very long time to provide formal confirmation of its decision . The excuses advanced by the FAC - an investigation into PERSON practice , and in general an excessive number of cases involving physiotherapy practices - were not in themselves sufficient ; since LAW ( Beroepswet ) did not provide for interim measures or an appeal in the event of failure to react within a reasonable time , such delay seriously impeded access to a tribunal . However , it did not appear from the case file that PERSON had sought to obtain the formal confirmation sooner .", "PERSON had not in his appeal relied on a general interest in legal certainty or cited a financial interest , namely that the ORG could claim interest ( rente ) on the sums due . In any event , while those sums remained unpaid , any interest payable to the ORG was to some extent offset by the - admittedly lower - interest that PERSON could obtain on the sums in question in the meantime .", "The right of access to a tribunal was relevant only in relation to the dispute over the fixing of the social - security contributions . The right in question \" could not automatically be transposed \" in such a way as to deprive the ORG of the right to fix such contributions . PERSON application to have the decision in question set aside , despite the fact that the contributions themselves had been fixed in due time , therefore had to be refused .", "Finally , ORG found no violation of the principles of \" fair play \" and \" equality of arms \" , since it did not appear that while the ORG was preparing its decision or in the course of the proceedings PERSON had not had sufficient opportunity to put forward his arguments . The inequality as regards time - limits did not in itself constitute a breach of those principles as in such cases decisions had to be taken with due care .", "The appeal was therefore dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON is a GPE citizen born in DATE . He lives in GPE where he works as a physiotherapist .", "CARDINAL . ORG Until DATE Mr PERSON had an arrangement with a number of other physiotherapists which in its essentials was identical with that of Mr Schouten ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "On DATE a contract of employment between Mr PERSON and the other physiotherapists entered into force and the above arrangement came to an end .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE the ORG sent PERSON a demand for payment of contributions in respect of the other physiotherapists under LAW , ORG , LAW and LAW for DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a letter of CARDINAL DATE PERSON lodged an objection to the ORG \u2019s demand and requested formal confirmation of its decision , with a view to lodging an appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG gave this confirmation on DATE . Its reasoning did not differ materially from that indicated in the case of PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed to ORG on DATE , asking to be allowed until DATE to supplement his notice of appeal . The reasons he gave were , firstly , that he wished to submit figures calculated by an accountant and to refer to a judgment in a case then pending before ORG in which similar questions were being addressed and , secondly , the approach of DATE . This request was allowed . PERSON supplemented his notice of appeal on DATE .", "The ORG submitted its reply on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG At ORG hearing ( the date of which is not known ) the applicant stated that he expected the case to be taken to ORG and he requested the tribunal to give as detailed a judgment as possible .", "CARDINAL . The Appeals Tribunal gave judgment on DATE .", "Referring to ORG case - law , ORG ruled that under the relevant social - security legislation Mr PERSON was liable to pay contributions for the other physiotherapists .", "The delay in question had not , in ORG view , caused PERSON any prejudice , and the principles of \" fair play \" and a \" fair hearing \" had therefore not been violated .", "As regards PERSON arguments concerning the determination of his rights within a \" reasonable time \" , ORG inferred that he assumed that under LAW ) time - limits were \" absolute \" . However , the case - law of ORG indicated that the factual situation was of relevance in deciding whether a given decision had been taken within a reasonable time . Exceeding what might generally be considered a reasonable time in the determination of a dispute could not have the effect that an administrative authority which complied with legal time - limits was deprived of its right to claim social - security contributions . In any case , although a speedier decision would have been preferable , the lapse of time in issue did not go beyond what was reasonable for the purposes of LAW ) .", "ORG added that the approach adopted by the ORG in cases of this nature had given rise to an unnecessary number of appeals , partly because of the \" persistent attitude of the interested parties \" , but that it did not appear , in this case or others , that the ORG had made statements or acted in such a way as to create legitimate expectations on the basis of which ORG could decide that rights to demand payment of social - security contributions over the relevant period had lapsed .", "The appeal was accordingly dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON lodged an appeal with ORG on DATE .", "He contested the assertion that the delay in sending him formal confirmation of the ORG \u2019s decision had caused him no prejudice . He submitted that by the time he was finally allowed access to ORG , the case - law had already been established and was difficult to change ; the case - law in relation to physiotherapists might have developed differently if the right arguments had been adduced at an earlier stage . If he had been CARDINAL of the first to appeal , the substance of his arguments would have been addressed and would not have met with a standardised response .", "Lastly , he reiterated his arguments based on the principle of \" fair play \" . Since an appellant had to observe a time - limit of DATE , whereas the defendant administrative authority could stall proceedings indefinitely , it was possible for the latter to choose \" pilot cases \" which would then form the basis of a body of case - law favourable to the defendant administrative authority and providing precedent for other cases .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following a hearing on DATE , at which PERSON was not represented , ORG gave judgment on DATE .", "It rejected PERSON arguments concerning the independence of the other physiotherapists and found that the relationship between them and PERSON was such as to require him to pay social - security contributions for them .", "As to PERSON arguments based on LAW ) , it left open the question whether the case concerned \" civil rights and obligations \" ; in cases of this nature the reasonable time requirement did not apply to the phase preceding appeal to an administrative tribunal under LAW . It recognised that procrastination by an administrative authority might possibly hinder an appellant \u2019s access to a tribunal but expressed no opinion as to whether such a right of access flowed directly from DATE ( article CARDINAL ) .", "There was nothing in the file to suggest that the applicant had taken any action to expedite delivery of the formal confirmation . In view , inter alia , of the necessity for further investigations and correspondence and the fact that it appeared that the delay was connected with the large number of requests for formal confirmation , ORG came to the conclusion that the ORG , in not providing such formal confirmation until DATE - far too long after the applicant \u2019s request - could not be said to have actually hindered any attempts by the applicant to obtain access to a tribunal earlier .", "As to the argument that the delay in providing formal confirmation had been prejudicial to his procedural position , ORG noted that PERSON case raised no issues that had not been addressed in earlier cases .", "Furthermore , the ORG \u2019s demands for payment of contributions for DATE , DATE and DATE , based as they were on binding legal provisions , did not violate any general principle of good governance in such a way that the ORG should thereby have divested itself of its legal obligation to make such demands .", "The appeal was accordingly dismissed . However , ORG judgment had been based on figures which were corrected by the ORG of its own motion in the course of the proceedings before ORG , so that as a matter of form the judgment of ORG had to be partly set aside .", "CARDINAL . ORG Pursuant to LAW ( Organisatiewet sociale verzekeringen ) it falls to the occupational associations to implement ORG , ORG , LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL occupational association exists for each of the various sectors of economic life . An occupational association is an association ( vereniging ) under private law set up by ORG and employees\u2019 organisations considered by ORG ( Minister PERSON ) to be sufficiently representative of the sector concerned ; its purpose is defined as being to implement the relevant social - security legislation , it must be a non - profit - making body and its statutes must satisfy certain requirements ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ) .", "An employer is automatically a member of the occupational association corresponding to the sector of the economy to which the work carried out by his employees belongs ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The occupational associations are supervised by ORG ( Sociale Verzekeringsraad ) . This body has legal personality under public law ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ) . Its president and CARDINAL of its members are appointed directly by the Minister of ORG and Employment for a term of DATE ; CARDINAL of its members are appointed for the same term by ORG organisations and CARDINAL by employees\u2019 organisations , the organisations in both instances being those considered by the Minister to be sufficiently representative ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)-(CARDINAL ) of ORG ) .", "ORG is empowered to adopt regulations for co - ordinating the implementation of the social - security legislation ( section CARDINAL of ORG ) ; it also has the power to recommend to the Minister of ORG and Employment the suspension or annulment of decisions of occupational associations ( section CARDINAL ) . It is responsible to the Minister and must follow his instructions ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Employers must provide the occupational associations with information concerning the wages ( loon ) paid to their employees ; the occupational associations then determine the contributions to be paid under the relevant social - security legislation in respect of each employee . These contributions are paid by the employers to their respective occupational association ( section CARDINAL of ORG ( Co - ordination ) LAW ) .

Wages shall include entitlements - whether conditional or coming into existence in the course of time - to CARDINAL or more benefits or grants ( uitkeringen of verstrekkingen ) , in so far as these are not covered by contributions paid by the employee . \"", "This definition is virtually identical with that given in LAW ( Wet op de loonbelasting ) , the only difference being that the latter LAW also includes in its definition everything enjoyed under an employer / employee relationship which no longer exists .", "CARDINAL . ORG If , for whatever reason , the employer does not pay the contributions within a time - limit set by the occupational associations , the latter may charge interest on the outstanding amount . This interest is calculated at the statutory rate , which in DATE has fluctuated CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL of ORG - ordination ) Act ) .", "According to the case - law of ORG , the interest is to be calculated from DATE on which the occupational association fixed the amount to be paid , not DATE on which the amount was notified to the employer ( judgment of ORG of DATE , PERSON , ( Social security reports - RSV ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the relevant time , section CARDINAL(d ) of ORG , section CARDINAL(d ) of LAW , section CARDINAL ) of ORG , and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG taken in conjunction with section CARDINAL ) of ORG empowered the Minister of ORG and Employment to define as work relationships , by delegated legislation , several types of relationship that could be considered the \" social equivalent \" thereof .
