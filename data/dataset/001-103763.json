PERSON was granted an old - age pension in DATE and PERSON in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE they moved from what is DATE GPE ( \u201c the Federation \u201d ) to what is DATE PERSON ( each of the Federation and PERSON being an \u201c Entity \u201d ) . While they were internally displaced , they received their pensions from ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Having returned to ORG respectively , the applicants unsuccessfully sought to have their pension entitlements transferred from ORG to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . Therefore , in DATE they lodged applications with ORG , a domestic human - rights body set up by ORG CARDINAL to ORG for Peace in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a landmark decision concerning CARDINAL applicants , including CARDINAL of the applicants in the present case ( PERSON ) and the applicant in PERSON ( cited above ) , who had been granted pensions in what is DATE the Federation before the war , who had then moved to what is DATE PERSON during the war , and who , for that reason only , continued to receive ORG pensions despite their return to the Federation after the war ( pursuant to ORG , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They were thus treated differently from those who had stayed in what is DATE the Federation during the war . ORG considered that difference in treatment to be discriminatory and an obstacle to the return of displaced persons to their pre - war homes ( ORG pensions were normally lower than ORG pensions , and the cost of living was normally higher in ORG . Furthermore , it held that the situation complained of had racist connotations ( given the nature of the war , the population that had moved from what is DATE the GPE to what is DATE PERSON during the war had primarily been NORP , and those who had stayed were mostly Bosniacs and NORP ) . ORG ordered ORG ( a ) to take all necessary legislative and administrative actions by DATE to ensure that the applicants were no longer discriminated against , particularly in comparison to those pensioners who had remained in what is DATE the Federation during the war ; and ( b ) to compensate the applicants for the difference between their ORG pensions and the amount they would have received from ORG from DATE of their application to ORG until DATE the GPE \u2019s compliance with the order under ( a ) above .", "CARDINAL . Having assessed that her pension from ORG would have been lower than the nominal amount of her pension from ORG , on DATE the ORG informed PERSON that she would not be paid any compensation . ORG disregarded the fact that , at that time , pensioners in PERSON , as opposed to those in the Federation , did not receive the nominal amount of their pensions , but only a fraction thereof , owing to fiscal difficulties in that Entity .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON \u2019s case was still pending when ORG ceased to exist on DATE . ORG GPE ( \u201c the Constitutional Court \u201d ) took over his case and on DATE delivered a judgment similar to that in PERSON case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to pay Mr MONEY ( BAM ) by way of compensation for the difference between the sum which he had received from ORG DATE and DATE and the sum which he would have received from ORG in DATE . It also decided to continue paying any such difference in the future . In DATE , for example , the applicant received BAM CARDINAL from ORG and BAM CARDINAL from ORG .", "CARDINAL . After the ORG judgment , cited above , ORG revised its practice and agreed to compensate PERSON for the difference between the sum which she had actually received from ORG ( rather than the nominal amount of her ORG pension , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the sum which she would have received from ORG in DATE . In order to determine the amount due , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG asked ORG to indicate the sums actually paid to PERSON . ORG failed to respond . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG sent letters to PERSON ( one to an address in GPE and the other to an address in GPE ) , but they were returned as undeliverable ( addressee unknown ) . In DATE the applicant finally provided the necessary information and in DATE ORG paid PERSON CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( that is , BAM CARDINAL for DATE , BAM CARDINAL for DATE and BAM CARDINAL for DATE ) . Since DATE the applicant had apparently been receiving more from ORG than she would have received from ORG ( in DATE she thus received BAM CARDINAL from ORG whereas she would have received BAM CARDINAL from ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that its decision in PERSON case of DATE had not been enforced , because he had not yet been granted an ORG pension ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to official figures , the average pension has always been lower in LOC than in the Federation . That difference has , however , decreased : while in DATE the average pension was BAM CARDINAL in PERSON and BAM CARDINAL in the Federation , in DATE the figures were BAM CARDINAL in ORG and PERSON in ORG . Furthermore , pensioners in PERSON now receive , as do those in the Federation , the nominal amount of their pensions ( until recently , the former , as opposed to the latter , were only receiving a fraction of their nominal pensions owing to fiscal difficulties in that Entity ) .", "CARDINAL . The Pension Agreement between the local pension funds entered into force on DATE . Pursuant to LAW , persons who were receiving pensions from , for example , ORG on DATE will continue to receive their pensions from that ORG , even if they subsequently move to the GPE .", "CARDINAL . All pensioners living in CARDINAL Entity have equal access to health care , regardless of whether they receive their pensions from that Entity or from the other Entity ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Pensions are not taxable in either of the ORG , regardless of whether they are received from the ORG concerned , from the other ORG or from abroad ( see LAW DATE and LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The former ORG and ORG rendered CARDINAL decisions concerning CARDINAL pensioners ( including the present applicants ) who had been granted pensions in what is DATE the Federation before the war , who had then moved to what is DATE PERSON during the war , and who , for that reason only , had continued to receive ORG pensions despite their return to the Federation after the war . They held that this amounted to discrimination and ordered that some general measures be taken by ORG see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG considered that the full enforcement of those decisions required that the applicants be granted ORG pensions and that the applicable legislation be amended so as to render all others in that situation eligible to apply for ORG pensions ( see decisions CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE and GPE of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In contrast , as regards those who had been granted pensions in what is DATE the Federation before the war , who had moved to what is DATE PERSON during the war and who had not returned to ORG after the war , the same bodies held that the fact that they received ORG pensions ( instead of higher ORG pensions ) did not amount to discrimination ( ORG decision CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE and ORG decision ORG of CARDINAL DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "6", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
