On CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the applicant company , jointly with the second and third applicants , to pay customs duties , valueadded tax and excise in the amount of CARDINAL ( ORG ) for DATE , DATE and DATE . These import taxes were levied because the diesel imported from GPE had been removed from the tanks of the trucks and transferred to a container for purposes other than the repair of the vehicles in question . Apparently this decision was not appealed against .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor brought charges against the second and third applicants for aggravated tax fraud ( t\u00f6rke\u00e4 veropetos , grovt skattebedr\u00e4geri ) concerning the time DATE .
