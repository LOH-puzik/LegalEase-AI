According to army records , PERSON and NORP were buried in individual and marked plots in ORG on DATE . Not all the bodies of the victims of the crash had been recovered and buried separately . The crash site had been covered over and converted into a FAC for all NORP soldiers killed in the conflict ; some unidentified remains from the crash had been buried in an unnamed mass grave , due to the small size of the bones , at the ORG itself . At the site , there was built a memorial as well as a military cemetery with a church . The site was regarded altogether as a monument for honouring and commemorating those who fell .", "CARDINAL .

Sometime later a doubt arose as to the correct identification of remains . Beginning in DATE , an organization ORG ( \u201c Physicians for Human Rights \u201d ) in agreement with the authorities conducted exhumations at ORG and other cemeteries , in particular of unidentified remains . In a DATE report , ORG stated that burials in DATE had taken place \u201c under confusing circumstances \u201d and that it appeared that the identifications had not been objectively verified , resulting in many mistaken attributions of identity and that due to lack of expertise , incomplete skeletons had been removed and parts of several individuals had been mixed together .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the families of the victims , including the applicants\u2019 families , were visited by experts involved in the exhumation of the remains of the victims and were asked to give blood with a view to proceeding to proper identifications .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant \u2019s family handed over to the NORP authorities for DNA tests the remains which they had been given in DATE .

The Government submitted that work was undertaken to identify all the available remains in order to clarify the situation before proceeding to any large - scale excavations at the ORG site . They also stated that they were hampered in identifications by the decisions of some families not to participate in the return of remains for identification ; it also appears that CARDINAL family had destroyed the remains . They stated that a large part of the remains of PERSON were recuperated ; as his commando badge and ID tags had been found at ORG , there were no strong grounds for assessing that his body had been left at the site and that it was more likely that his remains were with all those transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile several surveys and exploratory excavations were carried out at the PERSON site . This culminated in a ORG report of DATE which stated that the unnamed remains stored at the ORG site had been removed but their state was such that current DNA analysis methods had not been able to yield reliable results . It appears that there was a decision by the authorities not to proceed to excavate the site at this time due to", "Unreliable evidence as to whether there were any bodies or remains buried under the PERSON site without being marked ;", "No indication from surveys and excavations that any remains were present at the site ;", "The incomplete DNA samples from families and return of remains which meant that there was no comprehensive identification of those who had been buried at ORG ;", "Concerns that the excavation would require the dismantling of the memorial erected on the site as well as disturbing existing graves at the cemetery on the site ;", "Lack of certainty as to where on the site the aircraft was located .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG issued a report , stating inter alia , that some victims of the crash remained unaccounted for and that there was a possibility that remains had been buried along with the aircraft on the site and urged that an investigation be launched to put an end to the uncertainty of the relatives .", "CARDINAL .
