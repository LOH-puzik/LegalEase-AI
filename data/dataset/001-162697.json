The relevant parts of their notice of application are worded as follows :", "\u201c ... It is estimated that there are currently DATE CARDINAL followers of the Alevi faith ( Alevi , GPE , ORG ) in our country . Up until DATE almost all Alevi citizens lived in rural areas . Subsequently , they started migrating to the towns and began practising their faith there .", "With regard more particularly to cemevis , before migrating to the towns , PERSON , who led a reclusive lifestyle , practised their religious worship in the largest house in their village ...", "Mass migration made it impossible to practise religious worship in houses ...", "Moreover , the cemevis which used to exist in the cities , for example in GPE , could no longer meet the growing needs of the community . DATE \u2019s cemevis , which were built before the conquest of GPE , such as PERSON and PERSON , could no longer meet the increasing demands of the NORP community .", "... [ C]itizens of the Alevi faith have used their own funds to acquire land on which to build cemevis . However , these places of worship have given rise to numerous instances of arbitrary conduct . Whilst certain municipalities had made provision for the construction of cemevis in their urban development plans , many others rejected applications for planning permission , with the ORG continuing to consider that cemevis could not be regarded as places of worship . That attitude has been adopted not only by the municipalities , but by the administration as a whole .", "As a result of this arbitrary attitude on the part of the authorities , which is not based on any historical fact , cemevis have not been recognised as places of worship in GPE . Consequently , they are not eligible for any of the advantages linked to that status ...", "ORG who have built their cemevis also pay the religious leaders whom they have recruited to officiate in these places of worship . These religious leaders , who follow a NORP interpretation of ORG , train and teach the faith using their own means . Like all religious leaders , they play a crucial role in the moral and social progress of society . Yet the authorities do not contribute in any way towards their training ...", "As can be seen from the position briefly described above , the authorities almost completely disregard NORP citizens ; their places of worship \u2013 the cemevis \u2013 are regarded as cultural centres , with the result that they lack the status of places of worship and the attendant advantages . Likewise , the semah , which is one of the basic rituals of Alevi religious ceremonies , is reduced to a picturesque show . Thus , in determining the manner in which citizens must practise their religion , which places are considered as places of worship and the very nature of the faith itself ( a belief or culture ) , the authorities are manifestly infringing the right to freedom of conscience and religion .", "Further , ORG continues to disregard the Alevi faith and to offer religious education based on CARDINAL particular NORP theological doctrine . In doing so , it undermines peaceful co - existence and encourages discrimination from a very young age .", "In conclusion , no service is provided to citizens of the Alevi , ORG or ORG faith , which constitutes a serious oversight ...", "...", "According to the LAW and the relevant legislation , the ORG carries out the functions assigned to it under the special law by which it is governed ( a ) in conformity with the principle of secularism , ( b ) while remaining detached from all political views or ideas , and ( c ) with the aim of promoting national solidarity and union .", "In that connection , if regard is had to the RAD ( Creation and Functions ) Act ( Law no . CARDINAL ) it can be concluded that this body was set up not only for the needs of the NORP religion ( the majority religion ) , but for those of all religions .

Accordingly , the ORG is responsible for providing a public service to all citizens who are followers of ORG .", "...", "We now come to the facts regarding the practices of the ORG ... The ORG employs CARDINAL people , administers CARDINAL mosques and masdjids [ prayer rooms for religious practice ] and has a budget of MONEY set aside in the general budget to carry out the functions assigned to it . In carrying out its functions , the ORG , although its powers encompass the NORP religion as a whole , confines itself to the demands of the NORP schools of thought , and in particular the NORP school , while disregarding all the other movements and branches of ORG . The general budget is funded mainly by revenue from the taxes paid by all citizens . No distinction on grounds of religion or membership of a religious movement is made where tax collection is concerned . On the contrary , this is based on nationality . However , the ORG , which receives MONEY from the general budget , offers a public service only to the followers of CARDINAL particular theological school of thought ...", "It is entirely normal for a religion to encompass several different theological doctrines , movements , beliefs ... \u201d", "Referring to the case - law of ORG , the applicants further contended that , contrary to the position of the ORG describing the Alevi faith as a cultural asset and considering mosques as the only place of NORP worship , cemevis were places of worship where cems , that is , Alevi religious ceremonies , were conducted . In their submission , it was not for the ORG to decide whether cems were or were not religious ceremonies . Relying on examples taken from speeches by the Head of the ORG , they submitted that it was a matter exclusively for followers of the Alevi faith , and not for a ORG body , to determine what should be regarded as a religious ceremony .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the Prime Minister \u2019s ORG submitted its memorial in reply . It disputed , first of all , the standing of the applicants to act , submitting that they could not lodge an application on behalf of all ORG . They observed in that connection that , according to some sources , the number of PERSON in GPE varied from QUANTITY that there was no uniform approach regarding either the definition of the faith or the demands of its followers .", "With regard to the merits , ORG went on to dispute the claimants\u2019 arguments . The relevant passages of its memorial read as follows :", "\u201c Law no . CARDINAL ... prohibits the bearing of certain religious titles such as sheikh , dedelik [ an NORP religious leader ] , dervichlik , and so forth , the practices connected with those titles , and the designation of a venue for ceremonies conducted by NORP orders ( tarikat ayini ) . Failure to comply with these prohibitions is punishable by a term of imprisonment and a fine . Moreover , the same PERSON orders the closure of tekke and zaviye and their conversion into FAC or masdjids ...", "ORG carries out its functions in accordance with ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and LAW . CARDINAL and CARDINAL . In carrying out its functions , it encompasses all NORP beliefs , modes of worship and moral tenets and extends to all people on an equal footing . It is accordingly incorrect to claim that the ORG , which carries out its functions in a supra - denominational manner , confines itself to the NORP branch of NORP ... It is impossible to offer a service to banned NORP orders ( tarikat ) ; this would also be contrary to the principle of secularism and national solidarity .", "LAW implementing the LAW governing the wearing of certain dress defines places of worship as follows :", "\u2018 Places of worship ( mabedler ) are closed areas created in accordance with the relevant procedure and designed in the case of each religion for the practice of religious worship\u2019 ... Having regard to the foregoing , a place can not be regarded as a place of worship unless it is associated with a religion . In that regard , churches , synagogues and mosques or masdjids are the places of worship of the NORP , NORP and NORP faiths respectively . It is clear that everyone has the right to practise his or her faith in private at his or her own home or elsewhere . Accordingly , there is no prohibition or obstacle preventing NORP citizens from saying their prayers , the zikir or the semah in cemevis . However , the creation , in addition to mosques and masdjids , of places of worship for the followers of a particular interpretation or movement of ORG is not in conformity with religion . Furthermore , an application for designation of a place of worship , appointment of religious functionaries and allocation of a budget on the basis of belief in an opinion or interpretation of the NORP religion or adherence to a particular theological doctrine would inevitably create an insoluble problem and chaos within that religion ... Moreover , history has shown that the namaz [ CARDINAL compulsory prayers ] are never said collectively in the tekke , dergah and zaviye [ ORG monasteries ] , but that they are said in the mosques or masdjids that are invariably located alongside such places ...", "As specified in the notice of application , the Alevi faith ( Alevilik ) ... is an interpretation and practice of ORG . The Alevi and GPE faith is a NORP interpretation superficially containing elements pertaining to belief in CARDINAL imams and mystical elements ( batini ) . In the past it was practised in dergah in towns . As there were no dergah in the villages , the most appropriate house was chosen . Nowadays , places such as PERSON and PERSON are the dergah of the GPE , that is , tekke ...", "To recognise cemevis as places of worship would be contrary to Law no . CARDINAL ... Moreover , a development of that kind would lead to the legalisation of other NORP orders and many of them that are banned ( GPE , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , and so on ) would request legal status ... A number of sectarian groups would then be likely to start appearing around a sheikh ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the preliminary objections of the authorities and examined the application on the merits . It dismissed the application on the grounds that the refusal by the respondent authorities was in conformity with the legislation in force .", "In its reasoning , referring to ORG , DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and to LAW . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and also to the international instruments concerning freedom of religion and the prohibition of discrimination and to the judgment in GPE and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) , ORG observed at the outset that the Alevi faith attained a certain level of cogency , seriousness and cohesion and , as an interpretation of ORG , enjoyed the protection of LAW . It considered , further , that the object of the application did not relate solely to the ORG \u2019s negative duty of noninterference but that the applicants were also claiming privileges which , in their view , were granted to the NORP branch of ORG ( allocation of a budget , status of civil servant for Alevi religious leaders , recognition of cemevis as places of worship ) . It stressed the importance of the principle of neutrality in public services . However , the court found that it had not been established that all PERSON supported the claims submitted by the applicants . Moreover , in the court \u2019s view , the provision of a public service to all interpretations of ORG could hardly be reconciled with the principle of secularism .", "ORG also found that the allocation to the ORG of funds from the general budget was not contrary to the law , as it would be unrealistic to link the payment of general taxes to ORG convictions or beliefs . In that connection it stressed that ORG had not judged it contrary to the LAW to allocate a budget to the secular activities of a church ( keeping registers of marriages and deaths , and so forth ) or to levy a general tax without specifying how it would be used . The relevant parts of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ... It is clear from the examination of the file that ORG is being asked in the present case to set aside the Prime Minister \u2019s refusal of the request made in a petition of DATE to have religious services provided to NORP citizens in the form of a public service ; to have the cemevis , where NORP citizens practise their faith , granted the status of places of worship ; to have a sufficient number of competent individuals , recognised as such by PERSON , recruited as civil servants for the purpose of the religious rites required by the Alevi faith ; to have funds set aside in the general budget to pay for the services required in that regard ; to have provision made in LAW for the funds concerned , while taking the necessary action to that end ; and to take all the necessary measures in order to grant the requests set out in the abovementioned petition .", "Assessing the case in the light of the relevant provisions of domestic law , it can be seen that part of the general budget is allocated to ORG created under PERSON no . CARDINAL ; that the ORG does not establish , but rather administers , the mosques ... recognised as \u2018 places of worship\u2019 ; that the staff assigned to manage them are religious leaders who are recruited and paid as civil servants to administer religious services in connection with the beliefs , worship and moral tenets of the NORP religion ; and that application of the prohibitions introduced by PERSON no . CARDINAL is guaranteed by the LAW .", "Hence , it is clear from the interpretation of the provisions of Law no . CARDINAL and Article CARDINAL of the LAW that it is not possible to recognise a place other than a mosque as a \u2018 place of worship\u2019 ... , to recruit civil servants for the purpose of the religious rites required by the Alevi faith , or even to make provision in LAW for the funding of the services to be provided in that regard . This would be contrary to the statutory provisions governing the civil service and it is therefore not possible , in accordance with the only statutory provisions of domestic law in force , to grant the requests made in that connection without amending the legislation .", "Nevertheless , under the terms of LAW , the issue must also be examined from a legal standpoint in the light of the provisions of the international conventions to which GPE is a Party ...", "[ Reference is made to LAW ] .", "In principle , freedom of religion and belief \u2013 which may be defined as adherence to a religion or belief ( internally ) and the observance , in the place of the individual \u2019s choosing ( externally ) , of the precepts of that religion or belief , alone or in community with others , in so far as this does not disturb public order DATE is governed by the above - mentioned ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the LAW of GPE ... , which must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the provisions of the international treaties .", "Thus , it must be assessed to what extent LAW . CARDINAL and CARDINAL which are in force in GPE , and existing practices as regards freedom of religion and belief , which are at issue in this case , can be said to be consistent with the judgments of ORG CARDINAL in similar cases .", "...", "In the present case it [ is generally accepted ] that the Alevi faith [ enjoys the protection afforded ] by LAW . There can be no doubt in this regard , especially in the light of the practice prevailing in GPE ( see PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ) .", "Further , while ORG considers that the existence of a ORG system is not in itself contrary to the ORG , and while it does not require the ORG to treat the different religions and beliefs in absolutely identical fashion and does not criticise the existence of an official ORG religion ( see ORG v. GPE ) , it nevertheless regards compulsory membership of such a church as a violation of LAW ( see PERSON v. GPE ) .", "ORG is of the view that , where criticism of or attacks against a religion or belief attain a level liable to jeopardise the exercise of freedom of religion and belief ... , indifference in this regard on the part of the public authorities engages the responsibility of the ORG . Furthermore , where those same authorities restrict the freedom to manifest one \u2019s religion or belief in the public sphere , the restriction in question must be examined in the light of the following criteria : whether there was interference and , if so , whether the measure in question was lawful , pursued a legitimate aim and was necessary in a NORP society .", "There is no provision of the LAW establishing a ORG religion . Moreover , in the present case , no specific examples have been provided suggesting that PERSON encounter obstacles in exercising their right to freely manifest their religion or that they are subjected to pressure to adopt a different form of belief .", "As to the issue of taxpayers contributing to the funding of the religious activities of a church to which they do not belong , ORG considers it contrary to Article CARDINAL to collect a tax which directly benefits a church to which the taxpayers do not belong . However , it has found there to be no such violation where the tax is used to fund the church \u2019s secular activities ( the keeping of registers of marriages and deaths , and so forth ) ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , DR CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) or where it is levied as a general tax without it being clear how it is to be used .", "Furthermore , a portion of the revenue collected in general taxation from the citizens of GPE is allocated to ORG . Accordingly , not only can there be no question of any contradiction or inconsistency with the ORG \u2019s judgments , but also , if the ORG request had to be granted , persons opposed to armaments , war , nuclear power or technology because of their beliefs could not be taxed individually , as it would be impossible to determine who was liable for the tax and public order could no longer be ensured .", "As to the argument that the officials recruited by the ORG to deal with religious matters are not the same individuals as the religious leaders whom other belief communities have themselves chosen , ORG has held that the ORG is the ultimate guarantor of the freedom to manifest a religion or belief and that in a situation of this kind the ORG in a pluralist democracy has a duty , in view of the tensions that are liable to arise , to promote tolerance between the parties and may not subject the different groups to pressure or interfere with their rights and freedoms ( see Serif v. GPE , PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , and PERSON v. GPE ) .", "As is clear from the provisions of the above - mentioned international treaties and from the judgments of ORG , the ORG , fundamentally and ideally , has a negative obligation in the sphere of freedom of religion and belief to refrain as far as possible from hindering those freedoms . In other words , the ideal system is one in which the ORG is neutral . Accordingly , seeking to achieve equality does not mean eliminating differences but rather preventing privileges from being granted to certain groups . In the present case , however , the applicants are claiming a number of measures of positive discrimination on behalf of the NORP community by arguing that , although they are NORP , PERSON interpret and practise ORG in a different way , and are requesting ORG to grant them the privileges which , they contend , are granted to NORP . There is no doubt that ORG is a serious and coherent set of beliefs , that it is an interpretation of ORG , and that a large section of the population claims adherence to it . However \u2013 and bearing in mind also the general principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief \u2013 while it is true that there are indeed differences amongst PERSON as regards the forms of belief and practice and the manner in which they define themselves , and while the applicants also recognise this , there is no specific evidence that all PERSON support the claims made in the present case . Accordingly , from the perspective of freedom of belief , this court reiterates that the ideal is a neutral ORG which undertakes to protect individuals against being forced to participate against their will in the religious activities of a religious group to which they do not belong .", "In the light of all these considerations , examination of the facts from the standpoint of the constitutional principles of GPE demonstrates that", "- as regards freedom of religion and belief seen from a normative viewpoint , Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE of the LAW were drafted in a manner consistent with the provisions of the relevant international treaties , since no provision of LAW establishes a ORG religion ;", "- a portion of the revenue in the general budget is allocated to ORG , which is part of the general administration ;", "- ORG is generally acknowledged to carry out its administrative functions pertaining to matters of NORP belief , worship and moral tenets by taking as its basis the shared identity of all NORP and , in accordance with the LAW and the principle of secularism , while remaining detached from all political views or ideas and with the aim of promoting national solidarity and union ; and", "- as regards the ORG practices complained of , ORG has held in its judgments that these are not contrary to the above - mentioned applicable legislation , which does not overstep the limits of LAW .", "Further , if the ORG were to respond to all expectations and demands by providing the corresponding public service , for instance by recognising places of worship for groups professing forms of belief linked to the various NORP schools of law ( mezheb ) , the various NORP orders ( tarikat ) and the various understandings and interpretations of ORG that have emerged in the course of history , granting the status of civil servants to the religious leaders of those groups , setting aside a portion of the budget for them and placing them under the authority of a public body , there would be a risk not only of engendering debate on the extent to which ORG action and the discretion exercised by ORG in its activities in the public sphere satisfy the spiritual needs of the different groups of believers , but also of breaching the principle of ORG secularism by upsetting the balance to be struck between religious and legislative rule - making , and of exacerbating different forms of belief . This could ultimately lead to restrictions on freedom of religion and belief , and thus to an outcome that runs counter to the very aim which the applicants sought to achieve in lodging their claims , which were based precisely on their difference .", "In these circumstances , the administrative decision refusing the ORG requests ... can not be said to be in breach of the statutory provisions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the first - instance judgment . They submitted that provision of a public service exclusively to NORP adhering to NORP theological doctrines was incompatible with the constitutional principles of secularism and neutrality of public services . They rejected any suggestion that they were requesting the ORG to grant them positive privileges , arguing that the basis of their claims was the principle of equality . They added that ORG could not be regarded as neutral with regard to religions as it took measures which favoured one religious interpretation to the detriment of others . In the applicants\u2019 view , the courts did not have the right to rule on the legitimacy of a belief or its practices . They furnished expert reports in support of their submissions .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , served on the applicants on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment as being in conformity with the procedure and laws .", "CARDINAL . Although GPE is a \u201c secular ORG \u201d according to LAW , the NORP faith as practised by the majority of citizens enjoys special status for historical reasons .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , after the proclamation of the Republic on DATE , separation of the public and religious spheres was achieved through a series of revolutionary reforms : on CARDINAL DATE the caliphate \u2013 supreme institution of NORP \u2013 was abolished ; on DATE the constitutional provision declaring ORG the ORG religion was repealed ; and , lastly , on DATE a constitutional amendment was passed according constitutional status to the principle of secularism ( see LAW as amended in DATE DATE and LAW and DATE Constitutions ) . Article CARDINAL of the DATE LAW also guarantees the right to freedom of religion and conscience .", "CARDINAL . Following the abolition of the caliphate ORG ( FAC ) was passed , abolishing the traditional religious educational institutions . In parallel , ORG ( \u015eeriye ve PERSON ) and all the religious courts were abolished , and ORG ( governing body of ORG ) , as it was called at the time , was founded by PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE . By virtue of section QUANTITY of that PERSON , this body , which was responsible for implementing \u201c all the provisions relating to NORP worship and faith and the administration of religious institutions \u201d , was placed under the authority of the Prime Minister . The PERSON provided that this body had no powers in terms of religious education , which was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the administration of FAC and prayer rooms , which had initially been transferred to ORG in DATE , was brought back under the supervision of the governing body of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( Creation and Functions ) Act ( Law no . CARDINAL ) was enacted on DATE and published in ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) of DATE introduced a category of civil servants dealing with religious matters . That category includes all civil servants who have received religious training and carry out a religious function , namely the muezzin ( those who call the faithful to prayer from the top of the minaret ) , imam - hatip , vaiz ( preacher ) and mufti ( jurisconsult who interprets NORP laws and PERSON law ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( E. CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON MONEY ) , published in ORG on DATE , ORG held that the creation of a category of civil servants dealing with religious matters was compatible with the constitutional principle of secularism . In its reasoning it considered that secularism meant the separation between temporal power and spiritual power . Neither of those powers could interfere in the affairs of the other . ORG found that the existence of a clergy and a religious service in the NORP religion , and the acceptance by NORP of the PERSON as spiritual leader , had played an important role in that conception of secularism . However , in the NORP religion there was no clergy and the staff responsible for places of worship had no spiritual power . Accordingly , ORG held that , as the CARDINAL religions were different , their religious functionaries could not have the same status . In that connection it observed that it was only in NORP countries that a separation could be imagined between religious functionaries and the ORG . In ORG view , the principle of secularism sought to promote the progress of the NORP nation and did not allow the creation of religious movements pursuing aims that were incompatible with that purpose .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , and despite the \u201c secular \u201d nature of ORG , the \u201c NORP religious service \u201d is regarded as a \u201c public service \u201d . In accordance with LAW , the RAD \u2013 which is in charge of this public service \u2013 is part of the general administration and is therefore endowed with public powers , despite not having the status of a publiclaw entity . According to the statistics published by the ORG ( ORG ) , in DATE", "\u2013 the number of civil servants assigned to the department was CARDINAL ;", "\u2013 the number of FAC was CARDINAL ; and", "\u2013 the number of Koranic schools ( NORP kursu ) managed by the ORG was CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In GPE there is no religious tax . Accordingly , since the ORG was created its revenue has always come from the ORG budget . In that connection , the documents submitted by the parties show that , in DATE , the amount allocated to the ORG was MONEY ( \u201c TRY \u201d ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) on the basis of the exchange rate at the time ) . In DATE the budget came to TRY CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . For DATE a budget of TRY CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) was set aside . In their observations the applicants also provided information according to which the budget allocated to the RAD for DATE came to a total of TRY CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that , on the basis of the relevant exchange rate , that sum corresponded to MONEY ( ORG ) . Moreover , according to the data provided by the ORG , PERCENT of the ORG \u2019s budget is allocated to staff expenditure . The ORG also pointed out that FAC and district FAC were built on the initiative of volunteer citizens and through their efforts . Lastly , the Government stated that under section PERSON ) of PERSON no . DATE , lighting costs for places of worship were met by the ORG . Thus , in DATE the sum of TRY CARDINAL had been set aside in the ORG \u2019s budget to pay the electricity bills of FAC , district FAC , churches and synagogues . No provision was made in the budget for places of NORP practice such as cemevis , mevlevi houses ( mevlevihane ) or qadiri houses ( kadirihane ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG , as the administrative body responsible for matters pertaining to the NORP religion in GPE , has a sort of monopoly over these matters . In that connection , religious services pertaining to ORG are considered to fall within the legal framework governing the public service . This special status is explained , according to the Government , by the fact that the NORP religion does not have an absolute religious authority or religious organisation comparable to ORG in the NORP religion , nor does it have a clergy or other privileged groups .", "CARDINAL . It emerges from the articles furnished by the applicants and written by specialists in administrative law that , although the legal framework governing the public service is based on the principle of neutrality , which is a component of the wider concept of a secular ORG , the attitude of the ORG towards other branches of the NORP religion has been the subject of widespread criticism in GPE . The ORG has responded by stating that , in accordance with the principle of secularism , it performs its tasks not by reference to the preferences or religious traditions of a particular faith or a particular religious group or order , but on the basis , among other things , of sources of the NORP religion accepted by all NORP . In its view , these traditions and sources are common to all NORP and are spiritual rather than temporal . Likewise , the services it provides are general and supradenominational and are made available to everyone on an equal footing .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , however , relying on the articles referred to above , disputed the claim that the ORG \u2019s services were provided to everyone and were general and supra - denominational . They maintained that the ORG provided a religious service based on the ORG understanding of ORG .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the status of other beliefs and religions , NORP law does not provide for any specific procedure by which religious communities can obtain special status under public or private law or religious denominations can be recognised and registered . Consequently , religious communities , except those endowed with the status of recognised religious minority under LAW ( especially the NORP , NORP and NORP communities ) or other international treaties ( especially the NORP community ) , can only operate as foundations or associations .", "CARDINAL . In their observations the applicants submitted that , in addition to the ORG , numerous other religious groups were in the same unfavourable position , namely members of the NORP churches , FAC , PERSON , PERSON and NORP .", "CARDINAL . The absence of a clear legal framework governing unrecognised religious minorities causes numerous legal , organisational and financial problems . First of all , the religious leaders of these communities have no legal status and there is no appropriate establishment able to train staff involved in the practice of the religion or creed in question . Secondly , their places of worship do not have any legal status and do not enjoy any legal protection . The ability to build places of worship is uncertain and is subject to the good will of the central or local authorities . Arrangements for the upkeep of immovable property with a cultural heritage , which in some cases is literally falling into ruin , are complex . Thirdly , the communities in question can not officially receive donations from members or ORG subsidies . Lastly , as they do not have legal personality , these communities do not have access to the courts in their own right but only through foundations , associations or groups of followers .", "CARDINAL . In addition , there are numerous legal obstacles for religious communities trying to operate as a foundation or an association . Whilst many communities have created their own foundations , under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code it is illegal to create a foundation \u201c whose aim is to support ... a specific community \u201d ( see , for example , GPE and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . Furthermore , although many communities have created their own associations to serve their specific interests , NORP law does not provide for any special form of religious association open to religious communities .", "CARDINAL . In its opinion on the legal status of religious communities in GPE and the right of the NORP Patriarchate of GPE to use the adjective \u201c ecumenical \u201d , adopted by ORG on DATE ( ORG ) , the latter made the following observations :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The basic problem in NORP law as regards religious communities is that they can not register and obtain legal personality as such . There is no clear arrangement in the legal system for this , and no religious community has so far obtained legal personality . Instead they have to operate indirectly through foundations or associations .", "...", "CARDINAL . Although the lack of legal personality in principle applies equally to all religious communities in GPE , there is in practice a clear distinction between NORP and NORP . For NORP activities , these are administered through the Presidency of Religious Affairs ( the PERSON ) , which is formally part of the administration and reports directly to the Prime Minister . The PERSON has responsibility for regulating the operation of the country \u2019s CARDINAL registered mosques and employing local and provincial imams , who are civil servants . For the NORP communities issues related to representation are therefore handled through the PERSON .", "CARDINAL . For NORP religious communities , the PERSON can not be considered representative . They , therefore , do not legally exist as themselves . Instead , the model provided for under NORP law is for their members to register foundations or associations , which may ( to some extent ) support the religious communities . Both these legal structures \u2013 foundations and associations \u2013 have clear limitations for religious communities , but both have recently been reformed , making them somewhat more usable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Although this opinion concerns only the legal status of ORG religious communities in GPE , it provides an overview of the situation of religious communities in general .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to a question from the Court the applicants specified that the Alevi faith was a belief with particular features which distinguished it in many respects from the NORP understanding of NORP . PERSON recognised PERSON as their PERSON and the Koran as their holy book . They asserted that it was a faith which followed an esoteric interpretation of the Koran and believed in man \u2019s \u201c divine essence \u201d , with no distinction being made between the divine being and human essence . Unlike NORP , Alevi men and women practised their faith together in the cemevis .", "CARDINAL . The Government specified that there were no official statistics on the Alevi population in GPE , as the population censuses did not include any questions concerning religious affiliation . However , referring to the report on GPE prepared by the ORG ( ORG on International Religious Freedom ) ( GPE LAW ) , the applicants submitted that CARDINAL to PERCENT of the total population of GPE were followers of the Alevi faith , that is , QUANTITY people . They added that many members of the NORP community also avoided disclosing their own beliefs . They concluded that the total Alevi population in GPE was somewhere between CARDINAL and CARDINAL . They also submitted to ORG an extract from the statements made on DATE by PERSON , a Member of ORG for the ORG ( ORG ) , according to which research into the Alevi population showed that", "- there were CARDINAL Alevis in GPE ;", "- whilst PERSON lived nearly everywhere in the country , more specifically there were CARDINAL areas in which ORG were the majority population , including CARDINAL villages , CARDINAL districts and CARDINAL cities .", "- PERCENT of those people described themselves as \u201c Alevis \u201d , PERCENT as \u201c NORP PERSON \u201d , PERCENT as \u201c NORP Alevis \u201d , PERCENT as \u201c NORP \u201d and PERCENT as \u201c atheists \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government stated that there were CARDINAL cemevis in GPE . The applicants submitted that it could be seen from the discussions in ORG on adoption of the ORG budget in DATE that there were CARDINAL cemevis in cities and CARDINAL cemevis in villages .", "CARDINAL . Cemevis do not have the status of places of worship under NORP law as they are not regarded as places designed for religious worship in the strict sense of the term ( regarding the status of cemevis in GPE , see in particular the judgment in LOC ve PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . In many opinions the ORG has said that it regards the cemevi as a sort of monastery ( tekke ) , that is , not strictly speaking a place of worship but merely a place of assembly where spiritual ceremonies are held . In its view , the Alevi faith is an interpretation of ORG influenced by NORP and with specific cultural features , and can not be regarded as a religion in its own right or as a branch ( mezhep ) of NORP . Consequently , it associates the status of cemevis with that of the legal entity to which they belong .", "CARDINAL . The Government stated that CARDINAL Alevi workshops ( Alevi \u00e7al\u0131\u015ftaylar\u0131 ) had been organised in GPE DATE and DATE , with a view to examining questions relating to the NORP community in the context of the Alevi initiative ( Alevi a\u00e7\u0131l\u0131m\u0131 ) . The workshops were attended by CARDINAL participants including Alevi spiritual leaders \u2013among them the applicant Mr \u0130zzettin Do\u01e7an , who is a PERSON ( NORP religious leader ) \u2013 theologians , public figures sympathetic to the problems of PERSON and ORG representatives . In that connection , a special meeting was organised in the county of ORG , which had been the scene of bloodshed on DATE when intellectuals and PERSON had been persecuted by rightwing extremists outside any legal framework .", "CARDINAL . During the workshops the issue of the status of the cemevi , affecting the teaching of the Alevi faith and the funding of religious activities , was also discussed . In the final statement adopted at the end of the workshops by Mr F. \u00c7elik , Minister of ORG , and published on DATE , the wish was expressed to see the cemevi acquire official status . It was considered that such recognition would allow the Alevi community to take advantage of the many privileges granted to places on which that status was conferred .", "CARDINAL . According to the final report ( PERSON hereinafter \u201c the Final report \u201d ) adopted following the workshops , the Alevi question had to be addressed on the basis of a conception of secularism that was compatible with the rule of law , and a solution had to be found without creating new forms of segregation . The report , which is CARDINAL pages long , addresses the various issues affecting PERSON ( Alevi sorunu ) . The Government produced a copy of the report , the relevant parts of which are set out at paragraph CARDINAL below .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that after the Alevi workshops , on DATE , the syllabus of the \u201c compulsory religious education and ethics \u201d classes had been changed in order to respond \u2013 to a considerable degree , according to the Government \u2013 to the demands of the Alevi religious leaders ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . On DATE work had begun on building ORG lower secondary school where , among other subjects , the Alevi faith would be taught . Furthermore , ORG had been renamed PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In their observations before ORG submitted that the movements that had emerged in the NORP world based on NORP jurisprudence or faith or on the NORP schools of thought ( or NORP orders ) could not be accepted as the only correct forms of NORP teaching . Consequently , there was no clear distinction between these schools of thought , unlike in the NORP faith . Hence , unlike NORP , the members of a NORP brotherhood or movement , when asked about their religious identity , would define themselves first and foremost as NORP without mentioning the fact that they adhered to NORP beliefs or belonged to a NORP order . Furthermore , Alevism \u2013 whose roots could be traced back DATE could not be considered as a new religious movement .", "The Government added that , in NORP societies , there existed a kind of institutional ORG founded on the Koran and on the practices of the Prophet PERSON . The differences that had emerged subsequently did not relate to ORG itself , as generally understood , but to the way in which religion and religious life as a whole were perceived , and could not therefore be regarded as a schism within ORG .", "CARDINAL . In support of their argument the ORG submitted an \u201c academic opinion \u201d ( PERSON ) signed by CARDINAL professors of theology and a professor of sociology . According to the opinion , on the basis of the overall classification accepted by religious academics , religious groups comprised CARDINAL primary structures , namely religions , sects and mystical groups . It went on to state that NORP thought and practice , including the Alevi faith , represented the third category ( mystical groups ) within NORP societies . PERSON adhered to ORG and acknowledged that the Koran was the last holy book and that PERSON was the last prophet . The opinion further considered that prayer ( namaz ) , fasting ( oru\u00e7 ) and pilgrimage ( ha\u00e7 ) were rituals common to all NORP irrespective of their adherence to a particular branch or theological doctrine . Alevi sources placed strong emphasis on prayer and on the Ramadan fast , and sociological research had found that , in various regions of the country , there were PERSON who practised these rituals . The opinion added that the Alevi faith should be regarded as a NORP tradition or order tailored to a social system organised around \u201c family groups \u201d ( ocak , a sort of tribal organisation ) , according to the divine trinity of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . This meant that there was only one PERSON ( Allah ) , that PERSON was his prophet and that PERSON was his saint . Another central concept to the NORP community was the term PERSON alBayt , which referred to the family of PERSON .", "According to the opinion , the term \u201c Sunnism \u201d referred to \u201c NORP \u201d or PERSON , representing the way of life of the prophet PERSON . The term was generally considered to refer to the theological branches of ORG such as ORG and NORP and to the branches of the schools of law , namely ORG , ORG and ORG . According to scholars of ORG , in order to be able to draw precise conclusions from the nasses ( dogma of ORG comprising rules from the Koran and the NORP ) and find an answer to controversial questions , it was necessary to take solid verses from the Koran as a basis , to have regard to the undisputed PERSON ( prophetic tradition ) , to attempt to understand the nasses in their entirety and , in general , to subordinate rationality to revelation , by accepting the apparent meaning of the nasses .", "The opinion also stated that it was technically incorrect to compare the Alevi faith to Sunnism or the status of cemevis to that of places of worship , in so far as cemevis were merely places where \u201c customs and ceremonies \u201d ( adap ve erkan ) were practised by followers of the Alevi faith . Consequently , ORG could only be compared to other NORP groups such as NORP or PERSON ( NORP orders ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "9"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["9-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
