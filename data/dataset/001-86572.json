It is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant applied to the Government , under section CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , for a permit to provide betting and gaming services in GPE .", "By a decision of DATE , the ORG rejected the application . The decision , prepared by ORG in consultation with ORG ( Statsr\u00e5dsberedningen ) and several other ministries , was signed by PERSON , the Minister for Finance , on behalf of the Government . The Government noted that betting and gaming in GPE was essentially reserved for the ORG , certain non - profit making organisations ( folkr\u00f6relserna ) and the equestrian sports , and that the profits should be to the benefit of the public or for public utility purposes . They did not find that there were reasons to deviate from those principles and grant a permit to the applicant by way of an exception under section DATE .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) for a judicial review of the ORG \u2019s decision under LAW ( NORP om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa f\u00f6rvaltningsbeslut , GPE ) . The applicant claimed that the impugned decision should be quashed as it was contrary to ORG DATE of LAW , the latter guaranteeing the free movement of services . It also requested the court to hold an oral hearing .", "On DATE ORG , sitting with CARDINAL judges , decided not to hold a hearing in the case .", "Stating that CARDINAL of the judges had previously , at ORG and ORG of ORG , dealt with the question whether LAW was in conformity with Community law , the applicant , on DATE , challenged their impartiality and moved for their disqualification from the case . CARDINAL of the challenged judges was later replaced and , before the ORG in the instant proceedings , the applicant stated that it had been clarified that there were no grounds to question the impartiality of another judge . Of relevance to the present case is thus only the alleged partiality of CARDINAL of the judges , Mr PERSON . The applicant stated in its plea for disqualification that he had been Director - ORG ( expeditions- och r\u00e4ttschef ) in ORG DATE , when he had allegedly been responsible for the preparation and enactment of LAW as well as a new rule which criminalised violations of that LAW \u2019s prohibition on the promotion of foreign lotteries . Within the scope of that work , the question whether NORP lottery legislation was contrary to ORG law had been investigated , leading to the ORG taking the view that it was not .", "It is true that Mr Dexe held the above - mentioned position in ORG DATE . However , responsibility for LAW was transferred to that ministry only on DATE , DATE after it had been prepared . The new rule on criminalisation was , however , elaborated and introduced during Mr Dexe \u2019s period of service within ORG . In its proposal for introducing , inter alia , this rule , the Government investigated its conformity with ORG law . The decision to propose the amendment was taken by CARDINAL ministers of the Government , none of whom was PERSON , at a Government meeting held on DATE . PERSON was Minister for Finance DATE . Previously , he had not been a member of the Government or employed in the Government offices .", "On DATE ORG , sitting without the challenged judges , rejected the applicant \u2019s plea for disqualification . It stated the following :", "\u201c Decisions concerning Government bills are political decisions . Being a civil servant and not a political appointee , ORG at a ORG has no decisive influence on the contents of the proposals that the ORG presents . Consequently , the contents of a Government bill do not reflect the personal opinion of ORG on a legal issue ; indeed , his opinion may differ from that of the Government . Accordingly , the duty of ORG to see to the drafting of legislative proposals , on the basis of positions taken by politicians , can not be held to mean that he has thereby concerned himself with the matter in a manner that could provide grounds for disqualification when dealing with cases relating to the application of the legislation . In light of these considerations , ORG finds that PERSON previous employment as Director - ORG at ORG does not constitute a circumstance that entails disqualification in the case . Nor has any other circumstance come to light that disqualifies PERSON . The objection that he is disqualified must therefore be dismissed . \u201d", "On DATE ORG altered its decision of DATE and granted the applicant \u2019s renewed request for an oral hearing . The hearing was held on DATE .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG , sitting with CARDINAL judges , including Mr Dexe , upheld the ORG \u2019s decision . The court stated that , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( R\u00c5 DATE ref . CARDINAL ) , it had already examined the conformity of the NORP lottery legislation with ORG law , as interpreted by the jurisprudence of ORG , and considered that there were no reasons to come to a different conclusion in the applicant \u2019s case . The court had noted in the earlier case that , as regards betting , ORG had accepted extensive restrictions on the freedom to provide services on the territory of other ORG member states . The court had found therefore that the NORP lottery legislation , which required a permit for essentially all forms of betting and gaming , and its main objectives , namely the protection of the individual and the public , and the principle that profits should benefit the public or be for public utility purposes , were acceptable to ORG . The court had further considered that the implementation of the lottery legislation met the requirements laid down by ORG for restrictions on the freedoms enshrined in LAW . Thus , while the court considered that the ORG \u2019s reasoning in the decision of DATE could be seen as misleading and incomplete in light of the object and purpose of LAW and the examination made by the court in the above - mentioned judgment , the challenged decision was contrary neither to LAW nor to ORG law as it had been developed thus far through the jurisprudence of ORG .", "LAW is applicable to lotteries , including betting , which are arranged for the general public .", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW provides that , save for some exceptions not relevant to the present case , the organisation of betting and gaming requires a permit . Under LAW , a permit to arrange betting and gaming of the type provided by the applicant may be given to a NORP non - profit making association which fulfils certain requirements , inter alia that it conducts activities whose main objective is to support public utility purposes within the country . If there are special reasons , a permit may be granted also to a legal person which is not a non - profit making association or to a legal person whose main objective is to support public utility purposes outside the country . Further conditions are laid down in LAW .", "According to sections DATE , applications for a permit to organise betting and gaming are determined by a municipal committee and , in some cases , the country administrative board and ORG ( Lotteriinspektionen ) .", "The Government may grant a permit by virtue of section CARDINAL :", "\u201c The ORG may grant a special permit to arrange a lottery in other cases and according to other procedures than as provided in this LAW . ... \u201d", "The Government is thus authorised to grant a permit in situations where the requirements of section CARDINAL are not fulfilled . The preparatory works mention the need to issue permits in specific situations . As examples of permits issued under LAW , reference is made to lotteries arranged by the savings banks in order to encourage savings and to the CARDINAL companies wholly or partially controlled by ORG , ORG and ORG , which have obtained permits to arrange certain games , including sports and horse betting . The preparatory works do not provide any other directives on how to apply this provision ( Government PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) .", "The NORP lottery legislation \u2019s compliance with ORG law , notably LAW , is under investigation by ORG . On DATE the ORG issued a reasoned opinion , the second step of the procedure laid down in LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
