The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . She stood as a candidate for the elections to the legislative assembly of LOC scheduled for DATE . CARDINAL of her competitors was PERSON , a local businessman .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL minority shareholders and former employees of the local department store \u201c Oktyabrskiy \u201d asked the applicant to finance a campaign against PERSON , the majority shareholder of Oktyabrskiy and the chairman of its ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arranged for the printing of CARDINAL copies of the following leaflet , drafted by the shareholders :", "\u201c The Truth about K[. ]", "We , shareholders of the Oktyabrskiy department store , have suffered from K[. ] We are CARDINAL employees taken hostage by that voracious big wheel . K[. ] :", "DATE depreciated our stock ;", "\u2013 coerced us into selling the stock for a song , threatening us with dismissal ;", "\u2013 forced CARDINAL employees to resign by not letting them work ;", "\u2013 paid a miserable salary and often paid us with rotten groceries ;", "\u2013 having ousted the shareholders by unlawful means , he has become the department store owner .", "For DATE we have been fighting for our rights in courts and other instances . The law - enforcement agencies are still powerless . In GPE and its region many people have suffered because of K[. ] \u2019s unlawful conduct ; but everyone is silent and money does not smell .", "We , as victims of K[. ] \u2019s conduct , propose to write a book entitled \u2018 The story of K[. ] \u2019s dark ORG . Let it include the story of everyone who has met that terrible man on his or her way and become his victim . His fortune was made from our tears . Do not taint yourself by supporting this man . Whatever he undertakes is damned : DATE the renovated city hall is flooded with sewage , and the ORG did not come to bless ORG on the left bank which had been built in breach of NORP canons .", "We have suffered much harassment , repression and many a misfortune because of this man . Do not trust his promises , they build on our sorrows and lack of rights .", "Voters ! Sign your fair judgment of K[. ] ! Say \u2018 no!\u2019 to the fortune made from the woes and tears of simple people .", "We are firmly convinced that a man who breaks the PERSON should not be a parliamentarian and lawmaker .", "On behalf of the shareholders : PERSON F[. ] , L. K[. ] , ORG A[. ] \u201d ( emphasis added ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was elected a member of the legislative assembly of LOC .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON challenged the election results before ORG . In particular , he claimed that by publishing the leaflet the applicant had resorted to unlawful electoral campaigning . The parties to the proceedings were PERSON and the electoral commission . The applicant was cited CARDINAL party .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected PERSON application . It found that the leaflet had called on electors to vote against Mr K. , which was a permissible form of electoral agitation . The publication of that leaflet had not breached the electoral laws . If PERSON believed that the leaflet contained untrue information damaging to his honour and reputation , it was open to him to bring defamation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON sued the applicant and the CARDINAL signatories of the leaflet for defamation . He submitted that the italicised extracts above were untrue and that the leaflet had damaged his reputation and gravely affected the voters\u2019 freedom of choice . He claimed compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant produced her evidence , including the original leaflet bearing QUANTITY signatures , the decision to issue additional shares taken by ORG of the Oktyabrskiy department store under the chairmanship of PERSON , and an official document showing that the flooding of the ground floor of the city hall had been due to a construction defect which had subsequently been corrected . Several of the minority shareholders had given oral testimony to the court , confirming the information contained in the leaflet .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE allowed Mr PERSON \u2019s claims , finding that the defendants had failed to prove the truthfulness of the contested extracts .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , the court referred to the judgment of ORG of DATE . It found that it was bound by the finding contained in that judgment that the applicant had failed to prove the truthfulness of the statements in the leaflet .", "CARDINAL . The court further found as follows .", "( a ) The decision approving the issue of CARDINAL additional shares had been adopted by a general meeting of shareholders rather than by PERSON personally . That decision had previously been found lawful by a court . Although PERSON was a majority shareholder , the fact that he had a decisive vote in certain issues \u201c did not imply the unlawfulness of the decisions taken . For that reason the accusation blaming PERSON for the depreciation of the shares and the ousting of shareholders , as if it were unlawful conduct , was unsubstantiated . The defendants had failed to prove that PERSON had acted unlawfully \u201d .", "( b ) It had not been shown that the depreciation had been the result of Mr K. \u2019s conduct rather than of another cause . Moreover , the defendants had sold their shares for MONEY each .", "( c ) That there had been compulsion to sell shares had not been established . PERSON , being the chairman of ORG , had suggested that shareholders should sell their shares at the price of MONEY each . There was no evidence that he had resorted to extortion , violence or threats of violence .", "( d ) The allegation that PERSON had \u201c forced CARDINAL employees to resign by not letting them work \u201d was also unsubstantiated . PERSON had not personally signed any dismissals . The employees had resigned of their own free will and the resignations had been countersigned by the director general , PERSON There had therefore been no causal link between PERSON actions and the dismissals of the employees .", "( e ) The defendants had failed to prove that PERSON had been personally responsible for the payment of \u201c a miserable salary \u201d . The salary of the employees of the Oktyabrskiy department store had been comparable to the average salary in the region . Moreover , \u201c the notion of a miserable salary [ was ] subjective and the fact that such a salary [ had been ] paid did not imply that it was a consequence of PERSON conduct . The unlawfulness of his conduct had not been proved \u201d .", "( f ) The defendants had not submitted any evidence proving that shareholders had been ousted by unlawful methods or that PERSON had obtained the ownership of the Oktyabrskiy department store unlawfully .", "( g ) The allegation that \u201c whatever [ Mr K. ] undertakes is damned \u201d was a \u201c violation \u201d . The statement that the city hall was flooded DATE was untrue as additional construction works in the city hall had fixed the flooding problem . As to the statement about the church , the Prior of the church had confirmed that it had been built in compliance with NORP canons . Moreover , PERSON had received a \u201c letter of benediction \u201d for its construction .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded as follows :", "\u201c The leaflet was clearly intended for [ electoral ] campaigning and essentially purported to induce , and has induced , voters to take part in the election and vote against the candidate Mr K[. ] , which is not prohibited under election law .", "It has been established that [ the applicant ] was not the source of the information in the leaflet , or its author ; she merely disseminated it . As to the words , expressions and statements about [ Mr K. \u2019s ] property and fortune and the way it was made , they reflect the opinion and civic position of a micro - community of shareholders and former employees in respect of an existing dispute between them and the joint stock company of which Mr K[. ] is one of the directors . A judicial dispute concerning these matters is pending before ORG ...", "As the court considers it proven that the dissemination of statements by the defendants has damaged Mr K[. ] \u2019s honour , dignity and professional reputation , it awards him MONEY against [ the applicant ] in compensation for non - pecuniary damage ... The court takes into account the nature of the statements disseminated and the fact that the leaflet was signed not only by the defendants , but also by CARDINAL other persons , which substantially reduced the defendants\u2019 liability for the nonpecuniary damage incurred by the plaintiff . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the operative part of the judgment the court cited the italicised statements in the leaflet and pronounced them untrue and defamatory .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment . She submitted that ORG had incorrectly considered itself bound by the judgment of DATE , which had concerned a dispute involving a different cause of action and different parties . It had concerned a dispute over the election results between PERSON and the electoral commission ; the applicant had been a third party to that dispute . The issues relating to defamation or compensation for non - pecuniary damage had not been examined in the judgment of DATE . The applicant further maintained that the defendants had submitted evidence proving the truthfulness of the contested allegations . In particular , the witnesses had confirmed that all the statements contained in the leaflet were true . ORG findings had been contradictory . In particular , although ORG had found that PERSON PERSON , being the majority shareholder of the Okrtyabrskiy department store , had influenced its policy , it had also found , conflictingly , that PERSON had not been personally responsible for the impugned omissions . In conclusion , the applicant submitted that the judgment of DATE had violated her right to impart opinions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE on appeal . It held as follows :", "\u201c The conclusions of the [ ORG are correct , as it can be seen from the contents of the entire contested text that the authors presented Mr K[. ] , a candidate for election to the legislative assembly of ORG and head of [ the Oktyabrskiy department store ] as disreputable , as someone who infringes the PERSON and moral principles , who builds his fortune unlawfully and who harasses the shareholders of the Oktyabrskiy department store in various ways ...", "The [ ORG allowed the claims as the defendants had not submitted evidence showing that the allegations contained in the leaflet were true . Moreover , the assessment of Mr K[. ] \u2019s personality was formulated in clearly insulting terms . ...", "... the [ ORG correctly considered the finding made in the judgment of ORG of DATE that [ the defendants ] had failed to prove the truthfulness of the statements contained in the leaflet ... as evidence established by the courts ...", "[ The applicant \u2019s ] arguments that the present case has a different cause of action and that the parties have different procedural status can not warrant the re - establishment of a fact that has earlier been established by a court . As ORG made an assessment of the truthfulness of the allegations contained in the leaflet , the courts are bound by that judgment ... in the determination of the present case .", "[ The applicant \u2019s ] argument that ... the judgment violates ORG constitutional right to freedom of thought , speech and information is unfounded . The views of a citizen or a group of citizens on a certain issue , if they are distributed in written form , must be formulated in proper language .", "The expressions used in the leaflet , such as \u2018 voracious big ORG , \u2018 that terrible man\u2019 , \u2018 his fortune was made from our ORG , \u2018 whatever he undertakes is ORG , \u2018 the story of K[. ] \u2019s dark ORG are clearly insulting , are formulated in cynical terms , give an assessment of the plaintiff \u2019s personality and contradict the socially acceptable norms of conduct and religious principles ...", "The appeal must be dismissed because the [ ORG ] correctly assessed the evidence , rightly concluded that the statements in the leaflet were untrue and gave judgment in accordance with the substantive and procedural rules .", "However , the operative part of the judgment must be clarified . Since essentially the entire leaflet contains untrue statements damaging to Mr K[. ] \u2019s honour , dignity and professional reputation , the list of statements that were found to have been untrue must be deleted from the operative part .", "d untrue statements damaging to Mr K[. ] \u2019s honour , dignity and professional reputation set out in a deliberately insulting form , the degree of anguish experienced by the victim , the [ ORG ] considers it appropriate to increase , in accordance with LAW , the award in respect of non - pecuniary damage to MONEY against [ the applicant ] and to MONEY against [ the other defendants ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It is prohibited to abuse the freedom of the mass media , in particular , by encouraging social , racial , ethnic or religious hatred or enmity , by calling for the usurpation of power or forcible change of the constitutional foundations of GPE or breach of the territorial integrity of GPE , by advocating war or by abusing the freedom of the mass media in any other way ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

The aggrieved person may also claim compensation for losses and non - pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the dissemination of such statements .", "CARDINAL . Resolution No . CARDINAL of ORG of GPE of DATE ( amended on DATE and in force at the material time ) provided that in order to be considered damaging statements had to be untrue and contain allegations of a breach of laws or moral principles ( commission of a dishonest act , improper behaviour in the workplace or in everyday life , etc . ) . \u201c Dissemination of statements \u201d was understood as meaning the publication of statements or their broadcasting ( section CARDINAL ) .
