{"ITEMID": "001-79618", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "ERDEL v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The applicant is a practising lawyer and a member of the political party called the NORP ( ORG der DATE hereafter referred to as ORG ) . As the party is generally considered to be populist and right - wing , it has been under scrutiny by the offices for the protection of LAW ( PERSON ) in various GPE ( L\u00e4nder ) . In the general elections in DATE PERSON won PERCENT of the votes . The party has not been declared unconstitutional by ORG pursuant to LAW .", "The applicant held the position of lieutenant on the reserve list ( ORG ) and was called up for service in the NORP army ( GPE ) in a tank battalion ( ORG ) on DATE . By order of ORG , ORG ( ORG ) revoked the applicant \u2019s call - up order ( Einberufung ) on DATE . An objection by the applicant was dismissed on DATE by ORG ( Wehrbereichsverwaltung ) . It reasoned that the revocation of the call - up order released the applicant from an obligation and therefore constituted an administrative act which resulted in a benefit ( beg\u00fcnstigender PERSON ) . Moreover , the revocation did not mean that the applicant was generally excluded from all future military exercises , but that he would no longer be considered for regular reserve trainings . The applicant would however keep his rank as a reserve officer . Because of incidents that had occurred against an extremist background , which had remained few but were taken seriously , the NORP army currently used its discretion regarding call - ups ( Einberufungsermessen ) in such way that it would only choose command personnel ( PERSON ) for army reserve trainings ( ORG ) who were not only free from any suspicion of supporting anti - constitutional movements , but were also expected to take immediate action against such movements . Even though it could not be presumed that every member of PERSON opposed the free democratic order , the DATE report of ORG ( PERSON ) had concluded that certain groups and wings within the party did so .", "On DATE ORG dismissed an action brought by the applicant , finding that the revocation was permissible under LAW ) . It considered the revocation to be an administrative act which resulted in a disadvantage ( belastender PERSON ) as the applicant considered the revocation discriminatory . ORG further held that ORG had not overstepped its discretion when asserting that the NORP army , as an institution which relied heavily on security , expected its personnel not only to step in to protect the free democratic order but also to take immediate action against anti - democratic activities . ORG conclusion that the applicant did not fulfil those requirements was not subject to legal challenge . Even though the applicant had never given cause for complaint while serving in the NORP army , the authorities had acted reasonably in basing their decisions on the fact that , since offences attributable to right - wing elements had been committed in the NORP army attracting publicity and severely harming the army \u2019s reputation , reserve officers who had a right - wing background would no longer be chosen for army reserve training in order to prevent further offences .", "On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant on points of law . It found that the revocation had been lawfully based on LAW in conjunction with section CARDINAL of LAW which provided that a soldier must recognise the free democratic order within the meaning of LAW and act at all times in such a way as to uphold it . The NORP army was not prevented from taking into account the applicant \u2019s membership of ORG when deciding upon his status as a reserve officer despite the fact that ORG had not itself declared the party unconstitutional pursuant to LAW . ORG referred to ORG settled case - law in that connection . Until ORG declared a political party unconstitutional pursuant to LAW , a party and its members and functionaries could not be hampered in their political activities . While that provision would therefore protect a reserve officer \u2019s political activities for his party independently of his military status , it could not prevent the NORP army from drawing consequences from his membership of that party for his status in the army . Moreover , the above decisions had not violated the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights . The NORP army was conceived as an army in a democratic ORG . It could only serve its purpose if its integrity as a part of the democratic order was beyond doubt . Consequently , it could not allow this order to be undermined by its soldiers or tolerate any criminal offences with an extremist background . LAW provided that every soldier had to defend the free democratic order . It was therefore compatible with LAW for a reserve officer to have his call - up order revoked on grounds of his party membership provided that there were sufficient reasons to believe that the party \u2019s loyalty to LAW was in doubt . The Federal Administrative Court stated that such reasons were made out if a party was under scrutiny by the offices for the protection of LAW . However , both the authorities and the administrative courts had to satisfy themselves that such reasons really existed . As the respective decisions in the present case had referred to the DATE report of ORG , this had been the case . As the NORP army enjoyed a certain margin of appreciation with regard to decisions concerning its human resources , it was sufficient to establish an initial suspicion ( GPE ) that the party was disloyal to LAW .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant . It reasoned that the assertion that the applicant \u2019s membership of ORG precluded him from being called up for service in the GPE army could not be challenged from a constitutional point of view . ORG took note of the fact that ORG had had regard to the DATE report of ORG which had stated concerns about some of the party ORG loyalty to the LAW . At the same time several criminal offences with a right - wing extremist background which had been committed by members of the NORP army had attracted widespread publicity and had considerably damaged the NORP army \u2019s reputation . ORG found these considerations reasonable and not extraneous . It had therefore not been necessary to determine whether or not the applicant himself was attracted to right - wing ideas or had participated in anti - constitutional activities .", "The relevant provision of LAW is worded as follows:-", "\u201c CARDINAL . Parties which , through their aims or the conduct of their members , seek to damage or to overthrow the free democratic constitutional system or to endanger the existence of GPE shall be held to be anti - constitutional . The ORG shall determine the question of anti - constitutionality . \u201d", "The relevant provisions of LAW ( Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz ) read as follows:-", "\u201c CARDINAL . A lawful , non - beneficial administrative act may , even after it has become non - appealable , be revoked wholly or in part with effect for the future , except when an administrative act of like content would have to be issued or when revocation is not permissible for other reasons .", "CARDINAL . A lawful , beneficial administrative act may , even when it has become non - appealable , be revoked wholly or in part with effect for the future only when : ...", "...", "CARDINAL . the authority would be entitled , as a result of a subsequent change in circumstances , not to issue the administrative act and if failure to revoke it would be contrary to the public interest . ... \u201d", "The relevant provisions of LAW ( Soldatengesetz ) read as GPE", "\u201c Soldiers shall be appointed and employed on the basis of their suitability , qualification and capabilities regardless of sex , origin , race , religious or political beliefs or relationships . \u201d", "\u201c A soldier must recognise the free democratic order within the meaning of LAW and must act at all times in such a way as to uphold it . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
