{"ITEMID": "001-60157", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "CHE", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF ZIEGLER v. SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants are NORP citizens born in DATE and DATE , respectively . The first applicant lives in GPE , the second in GPE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants announced their intention to construct a subterranean garage in GPE . The neighbours complained , arguing that certain prescribed boundary distances between the real properties had not been observed . Their objection was dismissed by ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) on DATE . The court awarded the applicants , as defendants , MONEY ( CHF ) for procedural expenses ( GPE ) , as the plaintiffs , their neighbours , could themselves have verified that the distances in question had been respected . The court costs of CHF MONEY were imposed on the plaintiffs .", "CARDINAL . The neighbours filed an appeal ( GPE ) which ORG ( PERSON ) of ORG dismissed on DATE . In the operative part of its decision , the court took formal note of the applicants ' commitment that no changes would be made within QUANTITY from the border separating the real properties . The court also ordered the applicants to pay the plaintiffs CHF QUANTITY as procedural expenses for the first - instance proceedings and CARDINAL for the appeal court proceedings , and imposed on the applicants the first - instance court costs as well as appeal court costs amounting to CHF MONEY . The court found that the applicants ' plans had been incomplete and even incorrect and the terms employed had been vague , thus prompting the plaintiffs to uphold their objection . The uncertainty brought about by the applicants ' conduct contrary to good faith had actually provoked the procedures before the CARDINAL instances .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicants filed a public law appeal ( staatsrechtliche Beschwerde ) with ORG ( PERSON ) , complaining , first , about the imposition of costs , which in their view was disproportionate as ORG had dismissed the plaintiffs ' claims . There had been no obligation to submit plans , and neither the first nor the second instance had considered it necessary to ask for further plans . It was unclear to what extent the terms used had been imprecise , and indeed , the objections raised by the plaintiffs had a priori been completely unfounded . On the whole it appeared disproportionate that , for a matter of a value of CHF MONEY , the applicants were now asked to pay CHF MONEY for completely unnecessary proceedings . Second , the applicants complained that ORG had in its judgment incorrectly taken note of their commitment which in fact had not been requested by the parties in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG transmitted the applicants ' public law appeal for observations to both ORG and the plaintiffs .", "CARDINAL . ORG sent its reply , running to CARDINAL pages , together with the case - file , to ORG on DATE , requesting the latter to dismiss the applicants ' public law appeal . In its submissions it explained why the applicants ' plans had been vague and that precise early information would have been necessary . The court continued that it was \u201c quite typical for the ( applicants ' ) mentality \u201d ( geradezu QUANTITY f\u00fcr die PERSON ) that they had submitted sketches of plans only after objections had been filed , since they knew that there were tensions with their neighbours and that the latter would object . Other remarks of the applicants were misplaced ( deplaziert ) . ORG furthermore submitted that it had been competent to formulate conditions in its judgment , in particular as to changes in the border area between the properties .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiffs filed their observations of CARDINAL pages on DATE . Therein , they commented on the judgment of ORG , and they requested ORG to dismiss the applicants ' public law appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG transmitted the various observations to the applicants ' lawyer who , on DATE , replied :", "\u201c In the above - mentioned case I thank you for serving the observations . I should like to ask you to let me have the case - file for consultation ( which in the cantonal proceedings could not be fully undertaken , as the case - file presented by ORG was incomplete ) .", "In its written ' reply ' ( of CARDINAL pages ) , the lower court adds to its decision numerous new grounds as well as amendments to its reasoning . They are hardly objective and aim at twisting the facts in a manner not to be expected from a court . Pursuant to PERSON \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG and LAW , the applicants request the opportunity to comment on the ' reply ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG replied :", "\u201c You are objecting against inadmissible statements in the observations of ORG and you request transmittal of the case - file .", "At the present stage of the proceedings , the parties can no longer exercise any rights . Therefore , and as we need the case - file for our decision , we can not comply with your request for consultation . Inadmissible statements of ORG will be disregarded ex officio . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' public law appeal , the decision being served on DATE . The judgment noted at the outset that both ORG and the opposing party had requested dismissal of the applicants ' public law appeal . In its judgment ORG then declared inadmissible as being insufficiently substantiated the complaint that ORG had incorrectly taken formal note of the applicants ' commitment that they would not make changes within QUANTITY from the border line separating the CARDINAL properties . In respect of the complaints about the imposition of costs , ORG noted that the applicants , by expressing the wish to construct the garage , had in fact unintentionally obliged their neighbours to institute proceedings and to defend their property rights , compliance with which had at the outset not sufficiently transpired from the plans . ORG was entitled to combine the dismissal of the neighbours ' objection with a clause that no changes could be made in the border area between the properties . On the whole , a person wishing to construct became responsible for provoking litigation if he did not from the beginning establish clearly that other persons ' rights would not be affected .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( Organisationsgesetz ) envisages the following procedure after a public law appeal has been filed :", "\u201c Exchange of Statements", "CARDINAL . NORP If the court orders an exchange of statements , it transmits the appeal to both the authority from which the contested decision or act emanated and to the opposing party as well as any other persons involved . They are given an adequate time - limit to submit the case - file and to file their replies .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the reasons for the decision transpire only from the authority 's observations , the appellant may be granted a time - limit to complement his appeal statement .", "CARDINAL .
