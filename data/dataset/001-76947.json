In respect of ORG , ORG considered the application on the merits . It held that , although politically committed journalism was not prohibited in itself , it should be identifiable as such . In the present case the journalist had conveyed his support for CARDINAL particular viewpoint through harsh criticism . In short , ORG did not object to the programme \u2019s content but rather to the fact that the method used , namely politically committed journalism , had not been identified as such . It pointed out that journalism of that nature was subject to particularly stringent rules of diligence , which the programme had not observed . The journalist should have informed viewers that the report was not presenting an indisputable truth but rather CARDINAL possible interpretation of relations between GPE and GPE . ORG accordingly dismissed ORG application . The relevant parts of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ( b ) ...", "The impugned programme concerns a historical subject \u2013 GPE \u2019s position during the Second World War \u2013 which has returned to prominence on account of the issue of unclaimed assets . By broadcasting a programme on a matter of public debate , ORG was performing the role assigned to it , and it has rightly not been criticised on that account . Because of its historical aspect , the programme in issue was faced with a problem regarding sources : witnesses to the events recounted are becoming increasingly rare and certain elements that might have explained the conduct of the time are becoming blurred , as was noted in the decisions complained of . Accordingly , the explanation of historical facts relies on hypotheses that may serve as a basis for the construction of theories . In such circumstances , journalists must test their hypotheses and , where appropriate , adjust them , even if they are not expected to reveal an absolute truth . They must abide by the rules of journalistic diligence . Accordingly , in this context they must , in particular , indicate any persisting doubts , point out contradictions between witness accounts and mention the differing interpretations supported by some historians . On account of its topical nature , the programme in issue contributes to a debate and may be described as politically committed journalism in the sense referred to above . It has to satisfy particularly stringent requirements of journalistic diligence since it expresses criticism that may be especially painful . It is necessary to assess whether the rules of diligence applicable in the present case have been complied with , bearing in mind that such an assessment must take into account the situation obtaining at the time when the impugned programme was broadcast .", "CARDINAL . ( a ) The impugned programme , entitled \u2018 GPE \u2019s lost GPE , begins by discussing the history of GPE during the Second World War , as supposedly experienced by the people at the time and taught for DATE in schools . GPE had been depicted as a small , brave country which had resisted the demoniac forces of NORP . Despite being neutral , in their hearts the NORP had been on the side of democracy , in other words the Allies . They had deterred the NORP from attacking them through their determination to resist , if necessary with the help of the PERSON , a kind of impregnable fortress in the LOC . They had displayed generosity by welcoming CARDINAL people who had fled the extermination camps and by temporarily receiving child war victims . GPE had introduced banking secrecy so that NORP could store their savings safely in the country . After this recounting of the \u2018 ORG , the journalist states : \u2018 There has been a somewhat rude awakening.\u2019 The programme continues with severe criticism of GPE \u2019s position during the Second World War by prominent figures \u2013 most of them NORP \u2013 and with contrasting opinions of NORP citizens who lived through the period and young people who know about it only through the \u2018 ORG . The journalist then asserts that in DATE , historians studying the period have uncovered a significant part of the truth . Next , the programme describes the attitude of GPE , and in particular its political and military leaders , during the Second World War , emphasising their alleged affinity with the far right and their inclination towards rapprochement with GPE . The question of NORP anti - Semitism is then examined , along with the economic and financial relations between GPE and GPE . The programme alleges that the PERSON served GPE \u2019s economic interests and focuses on the laundering of NORP money by GPE and on the role of NORP banks and insurance companies in the matter of unclaimed NORP assets . The journalist concludes by saying : \u2018 The experts of ORG and the historians of ORG will no doubt confirm that the NORP political and economic elite in this difficult period adapted to the circumstances rather too well . Their biggest mistake was probably their failure to acknowledge and come to terms with that attitude after the war ; to acknowledge that the NORP were not heroes but normal people caught up in events , who succeeded in taking advantage , for themselves and their descendants , of the most appalling global crisis of the twentieth century.\u2019", "( b ) ORG , which did not criticise the content of the programme in issue , found that ORG had breached CARDINAL of ORG by using a method , described as politically committed journalism in the decisions under review , which had not allowed viewers to form their own opinion . The company had not observed the principles of journalistic diligence since it had never suggested that there were differing views among the historians who had distanced themselves from the \u2018 ORG that had built up with regard to GPE \u2019s position during the Second World War .", "( c ) ORG disputes that the programme in issue can be regarded as politically committed journalism , which is subject to particularly stringent rules of diligence . It argues that , in any event , the programme complied with such rules . The company also complains of a misuse of discretionary power . It accuses the relevant authority of having reaffirmed the conclusions of its decisions of DATE despite the fact that the additional investigation had virtually demolished the reasoning on which they were based , and of having acted arbitrarily by assuming the role of the ultimate authority on historical science .", "CARDINAL . ( a ) As ORG noted , the programme in issue sets the \u2018 ORG against the \u2018 ORG which historians have brought to light , without indicating the disagreements existing between them . In various spheres , such as the basis of GPE \u2019s economic relations with NORP GPE , the purpose of the PERSON or the explanation of GPE \u2019s independence , it makes no reference to differing views , despite the fact that opinion on these matters is far from unanimous , as ORG showed . Similarly , the decisions under review observe that the programme in issue merely provides one explanation for the conduct of a prominent figure such as General PERSON , without mentioning that there are other explanations that are just as valid , if not more so .", "While accusing the NORP authorities , at least implicitly , of having deceived the population for DATE with a \u2018 ORG , the impugned programme , without admitting as much , also gives its own interpretation which is no less categorical . This impression is , moreover , reinforced by interviews , in which ordinary men and women who lived through the events under discussion defend the \u2018 ORG , expressing their emotions with varying degrees of articulacy , while historians , who are expected to have a rigorous grasp of their subject , provide the \u2018 ORG . As ORG rightly pointed out , the programme in issue ridicules the wartime generation by showing recollections that are incorrect or exaggerated or convey a misplaced sense of self - satisfaction , contrasting with the cold logic of the historians . This leaves the impression that the interpretation put forward in the programme is corroborated by all specialists and thus reflects the sole historical truth . There is therefore a risk that CARDINAL myth might be replaced by another , and only the observance of strict rules of journalistic diligence can prevent such a lapse . Furthermore , the programme does not always place the events it describes in their historical context as precisely as is desirable . It takes insufficient account of certain important aspects ( for example , the threats GPE faced as a result of being surrounded by the ORG powers , and the position of other neutral or even ORG powers ) for viewers to be able to form an opinion , or plays down their significance . Lastly , it does not always enable facts to be distinguished from comment ( see the speech given on DATE by PERSON ) .", "( b ) ORG wrongly asserts that ORG should have had regard to its programmes as a whole in assessing whether the diversity of opinions among historians had been reflected . It refers in that connection to the special programme of DATE on General PERSON , \u2018 GPE in torment\u2019 , and the debate broadcast on DATE , \u2018 GPE \u2013 neutral or cowardly\u2019 ; in addition , it announces that the programme in issue will be followed up in the light of the findings of the commissions set up by ORG . It must be noted , however , that the impugned programme appears to be self - contained . It does not refer to the previous programme of DATE or to the subsequent CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE . Furthermore , these CARDINAL programmes were not advertised by ORG as forming a coherent whole , and viewers of the programme in issue could not have suspected that it was part of a series , if indeed it was .", "( c ) The impugned programme adopts an extremely critical approach towards GPE \u2019s position during the Second World War , as is legitimate . However , it neglects to mention that it is not revealing \u2018 the ORG but CARDINAL of several different interpretations of relations between GPE and GPE during that period . Accordingly , viewers are not provided with all the material enabling them to form their own opinion . Furthermore , the programme in issue lacks objectivity and transparency in that it never mentions either the existence or the essence of other interpretations of GPE \u2019s position during the Second World War , whereas the version it presents is not unanimously supported by historians .", "ORG emphasised the cultural role assigned to ORG , the autonomy it enjoys and the conflicts that may arise between these QUANTITY aspects . On that basis , it reached the conclusion that the programme in issue had not breached section CARDINAL(d ) of ORG . ORG then referred to the principles applicable to the provision of information , laying particular emphasis on the principle of journalistic diligence . It pointed out the difficulties inherent in programmes dealing with historical subjects . It also gave a precise definition of its power of review . Having thus delimited the scope of its intervention , ORG undertook an analysis of the impugned programme . It examined the programme \u2019s structure and the method used to present the subject . In addition , it conducted research into whether the diversity of views had been reflected with sufficient accuracy . Following a thorough examination , ORG found that the programme in issue had breached section CARDINAL of ORG . ORG did not exceed or misuse its discretionary power . Indeed , it remained within the scope of the powers conferred on it , being precluded , as it emphasised itself , from stating a position on historical events and their interpretation or on the validity of the views expressed by the historians appearing on the programme in question . Its criticisms of ORG , moreover , do not concern the content of the programme but solely the manner in which it presented GPE \u2019s position during the Second World War to viewers . In the final analysis , ORG can not be criticised for finding , in accordance with federal law , that the programme in issue breached section CARDINAL of ORG , by which LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the former LAW is given statutory expression .", "Moreover , it is not surprising that ORG should have reached the same conclusions as in its previous decisions of DATE . The additional investigations made it possible to clarify some points regarding the content of the impugned programme , without having any bearing on its form or style .", "( d ) ORG is also wrong to complain that its independence has been undermined ( freedom of opinion , of the media and of science ) . It overlooks the fact that the freedom it enjoys is not absolute but is limited by section CARDINAL of ORG , which ORG is required to apply . ORG review of compliance with that provision can not therefore in itself undermine the company \u2019s independence .", "CARDINAL . ( a ) ORG alleges that the decisions complained of infringe LAW ) . This provision guarantees freedom of expression , which includes freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas ( LAW ) . This freedom is not absolute ( LAW ) .", "( b ) According to the case - law , restrictions on the freedom of expression enshrined in this provision are acceptable if they are prescribed by law , based on a legitimate aim under LAW ECHR and necessary in a NORP society to achieve that aim ( see the unreported judgment of DATE in the case of NORP v. Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Entreprise des PTT suisses , point CARDINAL ( b ) ) .", "Furthermore , with regard to freedom of expression , Article CARDINAL ORG does not guarantee any greater protection than unwritten constitutional law ( ORG [ Judgments of ORG ] CARDINAL GPE DATE , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ; CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . ORG has also pointed out that LAW does not afford more extensive protection than section CARDINAL of ORG to broadcasters \u2013 in so far as they are entitled to rely on it . The freedom it affords to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority includes the freedom of radio and television broadcasting , but this freedom is not unlimited ( ORG CARDINAL II CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "( c ) ORG complaint must be dismissed . ORG criticisms of the company pursue a legitimate aim under LAW , since they seek to protect the right of viewers to receive objective and transparent information .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the foregoing , the applications must be refused in so far as they are admissible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , ORG informed ORG of the measures taken in accordance with section CARDINAL ) of ORG as a result of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , upheld by ORG in its judgment of DATE .", "\u201c ... Further to this procedure , CARDINAL preliminary remarks must be made . As a result of the procedure conducted in DATE by ORG following ORG judgment of DATE , ORG had the opportunity to put forward its point of view and no factual errors could be identified in the programme in question ( see also ORG judgment of DATE , p.

ORG emphasised the critical function that broadcasters , by their very nature , are also required to perform ( as ORG also confirmed in its judgment of DATE , p.
