Ever since her attention had been drawn to the inconsistency between her declarations of DATE and DATE and her open letter , she had refused to certify in writing - as she had been asked to do on DATE - that she did not support the ORG . When assessing her declaration in favour of this party , it was of little account that the party was running infant classes which might be desirable from the social point of view ; the only relevant consideration was that it was pursuing ends which were contrary to LAW .", "In view of Mrs. PERSON \u2019s support of the ORG , her declaration of DATE ( whose importance for her appointment she was not unaware of ) was false . She had at that time deliberately deceived the authority .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant challenged the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE before ORG . Referring to the grounds of her objection ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , she denied having deceived the relevant Land authority and declared that she stood by the statements she had made on DATE . In answer to the charge that she had failed to repudiate the ORG \u2019s policies , her reply was that she could not do so because she did not know what they were . She had merely praised its work in setting up a kindergarten in north GPE . Furthermore , her involvement in this matter dated from DATE ; she could not therefore be accused of wilfully misleading the authority on DATE .", "On DATE , she had been questioned about her accommodation in GPE when she had been studying there ; she had not felt under any obligation to give an account of her support for the kindergarten . If she had wished to deceive the authority , she would not have published her letter . As it was , she had thought that under the constitutional order she had a right to carry on and support legitimate and laudable activities , even if they were encouraged by a party which the Government in power deemed to be opposed to LAW .", "Mrs. PERSON supplemented her pleadings on DATE . She stressed that she did not unreservedly ( bedenkenlos ) support the ORG ; she had merely helped , together with members of that party , to set up a people \u2019s kindergarten in GPE . She pointed out that she believed she was entitled under the free democratic constitutional system not to make statements without cause . She was willing to answer questions concerning the ORG \u2019s practical objectives , but it was unreasonable to expect her to inform herself of the party \u2019s aims , then consider whether they were compatible with the LAW and dissociate herself from them .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed her claim on DATE , considering that she did not afford the guarantee required by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG that she would at all times uphold the free democratic constitutional system .", "It was undisputed and a matter of common knowledge that the former ORG , the ORG banned by ORG , together with the present party of the same name - still tolerated in GPE , apparently for reasons of foreign policy - , and the other communist groups ( whether they followed the GPE line or not ) sought to set up the \" dictatorship of the proletariat \" or the \" dictatorship of the working class \" . Admittedly , some NORP parties had recently abandoned the expression \" dictatorship \" and proclaimed their attachment to democracy , but experience in LOC showed that this was merely an electoral tactic . Under LAW and the system in GPE , freedom of each individual citizen and of the ORG was the highest value to be protected . But it did not exist where NORP were in control . A NORP form of government was incompatible with LAW . A candidate for a civil - service post was clearly not upholding the free democratic system within the meaning of LAW if he belonged to a NORP group . If he was not a member of such an organisation or if his membership could not be proved but he worked for it or for similar ends , he did not afford a guarantee that he would uphold the system .", "In Mrs. PERSON \u2019s case , the Land authority concerned had initially reached the conclusion on the basis of her statements on DATE and DATE that she afforded the necessary guarantee . Her refusal to dissociate herself from the aims of Communism , however , proved that she was not willing to subscribe to the principles of the free democratic system and to uphold them . It was not possible at one and the same time to support the aims of Communism and to support LAW : the one precluded the other . The authority was therefore right subsequently to regard the applicant \u2019s declaration as an admission of support for Communism and its aims . The applicant had admittedly said that she did not know what the policies of the ORG were , but in view of her level of education and the campaign by a section of the press against the decree on the employment of political extremists in the civil service ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , she could not be believed . Nor could the court accept her claim that she had supported and wished to support the ORG only in order to establish the kindergarten . Her letter in ORG on DATE gave the clear impression that she was trying to avoid not being thought of as a NORP . In the most characteristic passage - \" That is not the case \" - she denied that she was dissociating herself from Communism or its policies . There was nothing to suggest that she did not already approve of the aims of Communism at the time she applied for the appointment . By concealing her true opinions she had deliberately deceived the authority , which was therefore bound to dismiss her under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mrs. PERSON appealed against this judgment on DATE , filing her grounds of appeal on CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "She argued , inter alia , that there was no proof that she had given false information or concealed the real facts and thus deceived the relevant Land authority . As required by ORG in such cases ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it was for the appropriate authority to establish that there had been a specific breach of the duty at all times to uphold the free democratic system . In this connection , the expression of a given conviction could not be taken into account so long as it amounted merely to a criticism of the present state of society or sought to change existing legislation by constitutional means . Even if the impugned letter was regarded as evidence of a lack of loyalty to the LAW , regard should have been had to the fact that the applicant had not engaged in anti - constitutional activities and that her personal conduct left nothing to be desired . The seriousness of her professions of loyalty could therefore not be doubted ; nor could her refusal to dissociate herself from the policies of Communism ( which were in any case far from clear , even assuming that one could speak of the \" policies of Communism \" ) be doubted or be taken for an anti - constitutional activity , because she was not a member of the ORG and not familiar with its policies . She considered that she could and should support what she felt to be a laudable enterprise , irrespective of what a political party said about it , and that she could do so lawfully , even if her opinion on a particular matter was the same as a NORP \u2019s . In short , the authority had not established that there had been \" wilful deceit \" .", "Moreover , the judgment had contravened various principles in ORG in that it relied exclusively on the terms of the letter without taking into account the further explanation of their meaning given during the proceedings .", "Finally , neither the applicant \u2019s conduct in connection with the kindergarten project nor her reaction to the articles in the press could be complained of as anti - constitutional ; nor could her refusal to dissociate herself from the policy of the ORG warrant that conclusion if the principles adopted by ORG were applied .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . It held that the authority was right to consider that the applicant \u2019s appointment had been obtained by \" wilful deceit \" . The declarations of CARDINAL May and DATE were not true ; they were irreconcilable with the content of the letter . Admittedly , the letter referred to the matter of the kindergarten , but the applicant \u2019s support for the ORG had not stopped there ; on the contrary , she had stated that she supported the party \u2019s policies without expressing any reservations .", "Such support , however , was incompatible with a profession of loyalty to the free democratic system . That was clear from ORG manifestos and the policy statements of some of its leaders : the ORG rejected the parliamentary system enshrined in LAW ; its aim was social revolution and , as an avant - garde working - class organisation , it sought to bring about social revolution by force in order to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat . Its objective , as stated in its programme , was \" the march towards the revolutionary fusion of the working class and the people , towards destruction of the capitalist system and exploitation , towards the establishment of the absolute power of the working class , towards socialism and the classless society and towards Communism \" . As the governing class was not prepared to yield to the advancement of the proletariat , it was necessary \" to bring it down by using revolutionary force \" . The ends and means of the ORG accordingly ran counter to essential principles of the free democratic system : the ORG \u2019s first aim was the destruction of the ORG . It strove to achieve power not by the means afforded by LAW but by revolutionary force ; the dictatorship of the proletariat , which was its objective , was contrary to the principles of LAW , such as the sovereignty of the people , plurality of political parties , equal opportunity for all political parties and the right to oppose those in power within the limits imposed by LAW .", "Given the contrast between Mrs. PERSON \u2019s professions of loyalty and her letter published in ORG , it had to be supposed that objectively she had been lying in DATE and DATE . Her letter , which was written on her own initiative and not under any pressure , indicated her true position , whereas the need to confirm her allegiance to LAW in order to secure her appointment could have led her to make a declaration which was \" mere lip service \" ( NORP ) . Furthermore , the applicant was aware that her statements were untrue . Having regard to her level of education , it could be presumed that she had directed her mind to the effects of her letter , which was addressed to at least a section of the public . It was incomprehensible that after having stated publicly and in writing her agreement with the ORG on CARDINAL matters , she should have claimed to her employing authority ( PERSON ) that she did not know what the ORG \u2019s policies were . In this connection , her behaviour at the interview on CARDINAL DATE appeared particularly revealing . If , out of over - eagerness or without thinking , she had included statements in her letter which on mature reflection she no longer entirely approved of , she could easily have rectified the letter . The explanation she offered on this point ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) was too far removed from the actual wording of her letter . The employing authority was therefore entitled to ask her how she claimed to resolve the conflict ; civil ORG duty of political loyalty required them to dissociate themselves unequivocally from groups which attacked , opposed and defamed the ORG , its lawful institutions and the existing constitutional system .", "If Mrs. PERSON really was ignorant of the details of the ORG \u2019s policies when she wrote her letter , she could have said so . At the same time she could have admitted that she had gone too far in not wishing to dissociate herself from the party and its policies and in supporting the latter ; she could , for example , have said that she was in fact merely engaged in supporting the kindergarten venture . Instead of that , she had given the employing authority a reply not calculated to throw light on the position and she had made no further reply to the substance of the letter which the authority sent her on DATE . ORG drew the conclusion that at least the statements of DATE , which reiterated those of CARDINAL May , had been knowingly false . The applicant was well aware that her declarations of loyalty to the LAW were of decisive importance for her appointment as a probationary civil servant . Her appeal must therefore be dismissed .", "ORG refused the applicant leave to apply to ORG ) for review on points of law .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mrs. PERSON applied to the same ORG to have the latter decision set aside : she argued that her case raised a question of principle of vital importance for the uniform interpretation and application of the law ( Article CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . All the decisions in her case had been based on her refusal to dissociate herself from the policy of the ORG . The question was therefore whether it was allowable to draw adverse inferences from such conduct . There were conflicting authorities on the point . Unlike ORG , ORG and ORG ( PERSON ) - together with most legal writers - considered that it was not permissible to question candidates about their political opinions or their membership of political parties ; they inferred therefrom that the relevant authorities could not rely on replies to such questions or on the refusal to reply .", "CARDINAL . ORG When ORG found against her on DATE , Mrs. PERSON applied for legal aid to bring an appeal ( Beschwerde ) in ORG . That ORG refused her application on DATE on the grounds that the proposed appeal had insufficient prospects of success . It did not consider it necessary to decide whether the question raised by the applicant involved a matter of principle , because in the instant case it would have been necessary to determine whether a \" wilful deceit \" had been practised on the relevant authority . In the circumstances , however , the authority had been entitled to ask Mrs. PERSON to clarify her position in relation to the ORG ; and ORG could regard her negative reaction as evidence that in DATE she had knowingly made a false statement whose importance for her appointment could not have escaped her .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . She relied on LAW ( right of access to the civil service ) , LAW ) ( right to free choice of one \u2019s profession ) , Article PERSON ) ( non - discrimination ) and Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( right to free development of the personality ) of LAW .", "She argued that there was no evidence of \" wilful deceit \" . The decisions complained of were all expressly based on her refusal to distance herself from the policies of the ORG . She had , however , clearly dissociated herself from them by pointing out that by her letter she neither had wished nor could have wished to express support for the ORG generally but only for the opening of a people \u2019s kindergarten in north GPE . Admittedly , she had not agreed to repudiate the ORG \u2019s policies , but that did not justify drawing unfavourable inferences , in particular because the declaration in question had been made DATE before her letter . Such a far - reaching obligation to dissociate oneself from a party \u2019s policies could not exist . In any case , she had not joined the ORG and accordingly she could not judge its programme and aims .", "In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG had held that membership of a party opposed to LAW was merely CARDINAL relevant factor when it came to considering an application for a civil - service post ; the ORG required each case to be considered on its merits . However , it was not admissible to question a candidate about his political opinions or his connections with a party , or to use the answers given to such questions . It also appeared from this judgment and a series of decisions by other courts that even the members of a party whose aims were inimical to the LAW were not required to disapprove of its objectives in their entirety . This principle should apply a fortiori to non - members .", "The measure complained of had not taken these considerations into account ; in requiring the applicant to disavow the ORG \u2019s policies completely , the authority in question had made an absurd demand and had not complied with the principles laid down in the matter by the courts .", "CARDINAL .
