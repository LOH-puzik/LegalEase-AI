On CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicants leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision .", "After the refusal by the Secretary of ORG of the fourth and fifth applicants\u2019 application for asylum they too instituted proceedings for judicial review and were granted leave to apply .", "DATE . All CARDINAL applications were dismissed by ORG on DATE by Mr Justice PERSON . On appeal , however , ORG quashed the decisions refusing asylum on CARDINAL DATE . The Secretary of ORG then appealed to ORG which , on CARDINAL DATE , gave judgment in his favour ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON and conjoined appeals [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants\u2019 case before ORG concerned the proper interpretation of LAW ) of the DATE Refugee Convention as amended which defines a refugee as a person who has a \" well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ... \" .", "ORG found that the test was an objective one and that there has to be demonstrated a reasonable degree of likelihood , or a real and substantial risk , that the person will be persecuted if returned to his own country . The evidence before ORG confirmed that in reaching his decision not to grant asylum the Secretary of ORG had applied the test in the DATE Refugee Convention . In the course of the judgment the following opinions were delivered :", "Lord PERSON of GPE : \" The terms of [ the Secretary of ORG \u2019s ] decision letters make it clear that he has proceeded on the basis of the objective situation in GPE as understood by him . The affidavit of PERSON , an official of ORG , indicates that the Secretary of ORG took into account reports of the refugee unit of his department compiled from sources such as press articles , journals and ORG publications , and also information supplied to him by ORG and as a result of recent visits to GPE by ministers . It is well known that for a considerable time GPE , or at least certain parts of that country , have been in a serious state of civil disorder , amounting at times to civil war . The authorities have taken steps to suppress the disorders and to locate and detain those responsible for them . These steps , together with the activities of the subversives , have naturally resulted in painful and distressing experiences for many persons innocently caught up in the troubles . As the troubles occurred principally in areas inhabited by NORP , these are the people who have suffered most . The Secretary of ORG has in his decision letters expressed the view that army activities aimed at discovering and dealing with GPE extremists do not constitute evidence of persecution of NORP as such . This was not disputed by counsel for any of the applicants , nor was it seriously maintained that any sub - group of NORP , such as young males in the north of the country , were being subjected to persecution for any Convention reason . It appears that the Secretary of ORG , while taking the view that neither NORP generally nor any group of NORP were being subjected to such persecution , also considered whether any individual applicant had been so subjected and decided that none of them had been . Consideration of what had happened in the past was material for the purpose of assessing the prospects for the future .", "It was argued that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision letters did not clearly indicate that he had applied the \u2018 real and substantial ORG test , but left it open that he might have applied a \u2018 more likely than not\u2019 test . But there is clearly to be gathered from what the Secretary of ORG has said that in his judgment there existed no real risk of persecution for a ORG reason . \"", "Lord PERSON : \" In order for a \u2018 fear\u2019 of \u2018 persecution\u2019 to be \u2018 well - founded\u2019 there must exist a danger that if the claimant for refugee status is returned to his country of origin he will meet with persecution . The Convention does not enable the claimant to decide whether the danger of persecution exists . The Convention allows that decision to be taken by the country in which the claimant seeks asylum . Under the [ LAW of DATE applications for leave to enter GPE , including applications based on a claim to refugee status , are determined by the immigration authorities constituted by LAW . By the Rules made under LAW the appropriate authority to determine whether a claimant is a refugee is the Secretary of ORG . The task of the Secretary of ORG in the present proceedings was and is to determine in the case of each appellant whether the appellant will be in danger of persecution if he is sent back to GPE . Danger from persecution is obviously a matter of degree and judgment . The Secretary of ORG accepts that an appellant who fears persecution is entitled to asylum in this country unless the Secretary of ORG is satisfied that there is no real and substantial danger of persecution . The Secretary of ORG has concluded that there is no real and substantial danger of persecution ... In the present case an examination of the decision - making process does not disclose any error on the part of the Secretary of ORG or justify the court in contradicting his view that the applicants will not be in danger of persecution if they are returned to GPE . \"", "Lord PERSON of Chieveley : \" First , I respectfully agree with my noble and learned friend Lord PERSON , for the reasons given by him , that the requirement that the applicant \u2019s fear must be \u2018 well founded\u2019 means no more than that there has to be demonstrated a reasonable degree of likelihood of his persecution for a Convention reason ; indeed , I understand the submission of counsel for the Secretary of ORG , that there must be a real and substantial risk of persecution , to be consistent with that interpretation . Second , it is not to be forgotten that the Secretary of ORG has in any event an overriding discretion to depart from the immigration rules and admit an applicant for refugee status if he considers it just to do so . Third , I am with all respect unable to agree with the view expressed by Sir PERSON that different tests are applicable under Art . CARDINAL and Art . CARDINAL of the Convention ( see [ DATE ] Weekly Law Reports ( ORG at CARDINAL ) . Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides as follows :", "\u2018 No Contracting State shall expel or return ( \" refouler \" ) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\u2019", "Sir PERSON suggested that , even if the Secretary of ORG decides that an applicant is a refugee as defined in Art . CARDINAL , nevertheless he has then to decide whether Art . CARDINAL , which involves an objective test , prohibits a return of the applicant to the relevant country . I am unable to accept this approach . It is , I consider , plain , as indeed was reinforced in argument by counsel for the [ ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ] with reference to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires , that the non - refoulement provision in Art . CARDINAL was intended to apply to all persons determined to be refugees under Art . CARDINAL of the Convention . I can not help feeling , however , that the consistency between ORG . CARDINAL and DATE can be more easily accepted if the interpretation of well - founded fear in Art . CARDINAL ( A)(CARDINAL ) espoused by the Secretary of ORG is adopted rather than that contended for by the High Commissioner . \"", "CARDINAL . Following this decision the solicitors acting on behalf of all CARDINAL applicants wrote to ORG indicating that they would be making further representations and that they would be applying to ORG seeking an indication under Rule CARDINAL of its Rules of Procedure . They also sought ORG confirmation that no steps would be taken against their clients for DATE , which confirmation was given . The ORG refused the ORG request for an indication under Rule CARDINAL on DATE . Representations that they should not be removed were also made by ORG , ORG and a Member of ORG at the request of ORG GPE The Secretary of ORG considered that asylum candidates who failed to qualify for refugee status should be returned to GPE unless there were strong compassionate circumstances in any particular case . In the applicants\u2019 case he did not consider that such compassionate circumstances existed .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicants\u2019 removal to GPE their solicitors lodged an appeal against the asylum refusals to an Adjudicator in GPE , pursuant to LAW DATE . They filed voluminous documentary material concerning the past and present situation for NORP in GPE . None of this material was challenged by the Secretary of ORG \u2019s representatives and no other material upon which the latter based his decisions to refuse asylum was put before the Adjudicator . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the Adjudicator accepted the ORG claim that they had left GPE for fear that as young NORP they were at risk of , inter alia , \" interrogation , detention and even physical harm \" . He largely believed the accounts given by the applicants of their personal situations :", "- as regards the first applicant , the raid on the family business , the death of his cousin , his arrests and detention in DATE and later , on his return to GPE , his interrogation by the police ( but not his claim to membership of ORG ) ;", "- as regards the second applicant , his family situation , the alleged detention and assault , destruction of his home and , on his return to GPE , his arrest and ill - treatment in GPE ;", "- as regards the third applicant , his arrests , interrogations and death of his brother ( but not his claim to membership of the NORP ) ;", "- as regards the fourth applicant , the destruction of his family home by shelling , the incidents he witnessed and , on his return to GPE , his detention several times due to his lack of an identity card ;", "- as regards the fifth applicant , the arson of his home , the shooting dead of CARDINAL of his brothers and , after his return to GPE , the arrest of his family and relatives .", "The Adjudicator also accepted that in general the victims of ill - treatment at the hands of NORP forces had been young male NORP and that excessive force had been used against non - combatants in the LOC by both NORP armed forces and the ORG afterwards .", "Finally he concluded that the applicants had had a well - founded fear of persecution and he held , inter alia , as follows :", "( CARDINAL ) that they were all entitled to asylum at the time of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision ;", "( CARDINAL ) that the circumstances since that time had not materially changed ;", "( CARDINAL ) that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decisions in respect of all the applicants were not in accordance with the law ;", "( CARDINAL ) that the applicants\u2019 appeals were accordingly allowed ; and", "( CARDINAL ) that they should be returned to GPE with the minimum of delay .", "CARDINAL . The Secretary of ORG \u2019s appeal to ORG was rejected on DATE as being out of time , the DATE time - limit for lodging appeals having been missed due to an administrative error . On CARDINAL DATE the Secretary of ORG applied for judicial review of the Tribunal and Adjudicator \u2019s decisions . In particular he challenged the lawfulness or reasonableness of the directions that the applicants be returned to GPE .", "Leave for judicial review was granted by Mr Justice PERSON on CARDINAL DATE and the case was heard on DATE by Lord Justice Lloyd and Mr Justice Auld . ORG upheld the decision of ORG . On DATE the Secretary of ORG applied for a stay of execution against the return of the CARDINAL applicants pending a possible appeal against the refusal of judicial review .

The history of the ethnic conflict between NORP and NORP goes back for generations , with NORP , anti - Tamil chauvinism being a major factor in GPE politics since DATE . CARDINAL result of the anti - Tamil sentiment in GPE has been a series of pogroms against NORP communities , particularly since DATE , and which increased dramatically in DATE , triggered off by the killing of CARDINAL GPE soldiers by a NORP liberation group . A state of emergency was proclaimed which is still in force . This resulted in considerable governmental violence against the NORP community , including organised massacres tolerated , if not approved of , by the Government .", "CARDINAL . Following an Accord which was signed between GPE and GPE on CARDINAL DATE ORG entered NORP areas with a view to protecting the NORP community and the NORP forces were to be returned to barracks . However , the IPKF became involved in fighting GPE extremists who rejected the Accord . Incidents of arrest , arbitrary detention , torture and destruction were reported , especially in DATE and DATE , with indiscriminate shelling and shooting in villages and towns in the north . There was a siege of GPE town during which it was estimated that CARDINAL civilians were killed by the ORG with a high level of atrocities committed during the assault on the town and thereafter . Identity cards were indispensable for NORP at this time , not only a GPE identity card , but also a card issued by the IPKF for anyone in the north , in order to avoid the risk of summary detention .", "CARDINAL . When the applicants were returned to GPE in DATE reports of civil disturbance were still rife . The respondent Government analysed the situation as follows : they accepted that there was widespread disruption and violence , particularly in the north and east of GPE , although large parts of the country remained quiet . The disturbances seem to have eased off in DATE . Having regard to the DATE Accord they considered that LOC and ORG were firmly committed to the restoration of law and order , civil rights for all communities and the democratic election of regional representatives .
