On CARDINAL May CARDINAL PERSON \u2019s daughter ( \u201c GPE ) was born prematurely at CARDINAL GPE gestation . The birth was unexpected as ORG had not known that she was pregnant . PERSON was not in a relationship with GPE \u2019s father and he played no further part in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence of her premature birth , GPE suffered from many serious medical conditions . She had serious chronic lung disease ( broncho - pulmonary dysplasia ) , which rendered her oxygen - dependent , she had bleeding on both sides of her brain ( bilateral intraventricular haemorrhage ) , she was immuno - suppressed and therefore very susceptible to infection , and she had a congenital heart defect which was repaired by surgery on DATE . Although her health improved as she developed , she continued to require skilled and labour - intensive day - to - day care . She was regarded as at high risk of cot death and initially required feeding through a nasal - gastric tube .", "CARDINAL . It was observed that from GPE \u2019s birth until DATE PERSON was only visiting GPE for TIME a day . She had to be prompted to visit for longer periods and it was noted that she could not complete basic care tasks without prompting and support . A multi - agency meeting took place on DATE , at which the hospital drew up a schedule of tasks which GPE would need to demonstrate she could satisfactorily complete before GPE could safely be discharged into her care . A \u201c core assessment \u201d prepared at this time recorded that GPE had previously been involved with the local authority \u2019s mental health services and was believed to have learning disabilities ; that her relationship with GPE , GPE and GPE fluctuated , with allegations having been made of violence and aggression ; that there were concerns about her relationship with GPE \u2019s father ; and that GPE and ORG were unsuitable to care for GPE because of poor household conditions and concerns about family dynamics .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a social worker met with GPE , GPE and ORG to discuss the local authority \u2019s concerns as to the care of GPE It was noted that GPE had difficulty understanding and articulating the nature and extent of GPE \u2019s health needs and refused to accept that she needed help to care properly for her . However , she did agree to participate in a ORG ( \u201c PERSON ) Assessment , which was a tool designed to assess parents with learning disabilities . The assessment , which was completed on DATE , concluded that GPE struggled to complete care tasks for GPE and demonstrated little understanding of her care needs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE care proceedings were commenced in relation to GPE At this stage the aim of the care plan was to identify how the local authority could keep GPE alive and safe in a home environment while GPE was given the opportunity to develop her care skills . On DATE an interim care order was made in favour of the local authority and on DATE GPE was discharged from hospital into the care of foster parents .", "CARDINAL . R.P. instructed a solicitor ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) to represent her in the care proceedings . Both GPE and her very experienced counsel developed serious concerns that GPE was unable to understand the advice she was being given . Pursuant to a court order , GPE and the local authority jointly instructed a consultant clinical psychologist ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) to assess ORG to being assessed , attendance notes from both the counsel and GPE indicate that they informed GPE that the purpose of the assessment was to determine whether or not she had capacity to provide instruction and , if she did not , the Official Solicitor would have to be appointed to act on her behalf .", "CARDINAL . In her report PERSON found that GPE had a significant learning disability and concluded :", "\u201c Because of the difficulties [ RP ] has in understanding , processing and recalling information , I believe that she will find it very difficult to understand the advice given by her solicitor .

Legal matters can be difficult to understand and very stressful and ORG is here to protect the client \u2019s interests .", "HOW WILL THE OFFICIAL SOLICITOR HELP ?", "The Official Solicitor makes decisions about the court case such as whether to bring , defend or settle a claim .

On DATE ORG directed that PERSON be instructed to prepare a second report considering the propriety of the teaching methods envisaged by the local authority in its parenting assessment . PERSON \u2019s second report , dated DATE , noted that the teaching methods and materials would \u201c in general be appropriate \u201d and emphasised that simple language , direct instructions and repetition would be needed , along with immediate feedback .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a parenting capacity assessment was produced in respect of GPE The report noted that GPE had demonstrated commitment to the assessment process and an ability to retain and carry out basic tasks . However , social workers were concerned that GPE had expressed views of a racist nature , that she sometimes seemed immature and attention - seeking , that she was overly preoccupied with her own health concerns , and that she spoke very negatively about the local authority \u2019s professionals .", "CARDINAL . Reports from GPE \u2019s contact sessions with GPE indicated that GPE showed some signs of improvement , demonstrating some ability to remember what she had been shown and to repeat tasks . However , even after DATE of regular contact and support GPE still , on occasion , needed reminding about and prompting to perform basic tasks , especially when something unexpected happened . They also indicated that GPE occasionally demonstrated a failure to put GPE \u2019s needs before her own and a lack of awareness of GPE \u2019s current and future needs . Her attitude towards social workers was also noted to be aggressive , uncooperative and occasionally violent . Consequently , there were concerns about GPE \u2019s ability and willingness to work with local authority professionals and put GPE \u2019s needs first . This was of particular concern in light of GPE \u2019s need for high levels of support .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON was asked to produce a third report . The report , dated DATE , primarily concerned the risks posed by GPE to GPE and GPE \u2019s ability to care for PERSON was also asked to comment on GPE \u2019s litigation capacity . She noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL As I have indicated previously ORG has a significant learning disability , and she will always need a high level of support in caring for KP", ". If she were not receiving this support she would pose a high level of risk to ORG \u2019s well - being , which is not due to any desire on her part to hurt GPE , but to her limitations , which are too extensive to allow her to parent KP successfully on her own .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL If she were receiving a high level of support this risk could be reduced . The level of support which would be needed for this to happen would be for another competent adult to be present at all times , to prompt and assist DATE in her care for KP . Essentially this means that RP would need to be living with a partner or family member who could appropriately provide this level of support .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL Having read all the work which has been done with ORG and having carefully considered my assessment of her , it is my view that there is no further work which could be undertaken with ORG which would increase her ability to care for KP in any significant way .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL As I indicated earlier ORG could only care for KP if she had a high level of support . I can not perceive anything in her circumstances which suggests to me that such a support network is available , and without this no progress can be made towards rehabilitation .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL RP would need TIME support , and within this it would be realistic to expect her to assist with KP \u2019s care but not take sole responsibility for this . This would continue to be the case throughout KP \u2019s childhood . If this could be achieved in a natural environment , such as a family , then it might be suitable as a long term prospect , as long as KP had a consistent identified care giver within that arrangement .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL RP does not have the capacity to give informed consent to a placement order . She can not really understand the proceedings except at a very basic level . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authority completed a further core assessment . The conclusion was that :", "\u201c The opinion of all the agencies involved with KP \u2019s care in a position to make an informed decision regarding ORG \u2019s ability to parent KP is clear . Without a very high level of continuous support and supervision , ORG does not have the skills to enable her to successfully parent KP . ORG has consistently demonstrated by her behaviour that she does not wish to work in partnership with the agencies who will continue to be involved in KP \u2019s care throughout her childhood . Therefore , we need to look for alternative permanent carers . Maternal grandparents have put themselves forward to be assessed and this is in the process of being conducted . However , the local authority have a number of concerns in respect of their living conditions , RP \u2019s upbringing and the influence that RP still has upon them and how this would impact upon KP if she were to be placed in their care . Although the local authority do not wish to pre - empt the outcome of the initial sessions with the maternal grandparents , there are a number of concerns regarding their interaction and relationship with ORG and their own parenting skills . The local authority at this time believe it is in KP \u2019s best interest to be placed for adoption and the matter will come before the adoption panel on DATE . The local authority will urgently review this if the outcome of the maternal grandparents\u2019 assessment proves positive \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The local authority filed its final care plan on DATE . That care plan recommended adoption outside the family and it issued proceedings seeking a placement order under LAW of LAW DATE . The Official Solicitor consented to act on behalf of GPE in the placement proceedings as well as in the care proceedings . The application for a placement order was then consolidated with the care proceedings and listed for hearing before a judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authority filed a kinship assessment of GPE and GPE The report indicated that there had been referrals to the local authority concerning ORG and ORG \u2019s care of GPE and GPE It further noted that GPE and ORG were unable to control GPE or manage her behaviour and that they had also intermittently displayed hostility and suspicion towards the local authority . In view of these facts , the local authority concluded that it could not support the maternal grandparents as carers for GPE On DATE a further kinship assessment was filed in respect of ORG The local authority considered that he was unlikely to have the capacity fully to understand or to meet GPE \u2019s welfare needs and therefore could not support him as a carer .", "CARDINAL . In a statement to the court dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG indicated that GPE was not in a position to consent or refuse her consent to the placement order and as her litigation friend he was unable to oppose the making of the care order or the placement order . However , he also indicated GPE \u2019s opposition to the orders sought by the local authority , her belief that GPE should be returned to her care or the care of her family , and her belief that the local authority had not given her a chance to acquire the skills necessary to care for GPE", "CARDINAL . NORP In a pre - hearing review GPE agreed with GPE and counsel that she would not give oral evidence at the hearing but that her wishes would be conveyed to the court by counsel .", "CARDINAL . The hearing took place on CARDINAL DATE . PERSON was represented throughout by experienced counsel and her views were made known to the court . At the conclusion of the hearing , the judge made a care order , dispensed with GPE \u2019s consent to the placement order and made a placement order .", "CARDINAL . R.P. applied for permission to appeal to ORG and also made an application in ORG to revoke the placement order . The ORG proceedings were adjourned pending the outcome of the proceedings before ORG , which took place in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Official Solicitor was notified of the appeal proceedings . He wrote to GPE , informing her of the possibility of free legal representation through ORG ( \u201c the Unit \u201d ) . When PERSON did not pursue this , ORG arranged for the ORG to consider her case . Specialist counsel was appointed and made available to represent GPE at the hearing . Although PERSON declined his services , he attended the hearing in case PERSON changed her mind . She did not change her mind and instead was assisted in the proceedings by ORG and Mr PERSON MP , who acted as her McKenzie friends .", "CARDINAL . In a statement to ORG in advance of the hearing , ORG set out his standard working practice . He indicated that :", "\u201c If there is a conflict in the evidence relating to an adult party \u2019s capacity to conduct the proceedings then I will not accept appointment unless or until that conflict is resolved either by the experts arriving at a consensus , or by determination of the court . I will return to this issue below .", "... ... ...", "The solicitor , however , remains the primary point of contact for the protected party . My case worker relies on the solicitor to ensure the protected party is involved , so far as is possible , and is informed about the progression of the proceedings , and for communication of the protected party \u2019s ascertainable views , wishes and feelings with regard to the matters at issue . Whilst the solicitor may not take instructions from the protected party I regard the maintenance of personal contact between the solicitor and the protected party during the case as important , to ensure that proper information is provided and to afford the protected party the opportunity to express any concerns about issues raised , or information provided in the proceedings . I expect any concerns raised to be properly considered and communicated to my case worker . My case worker will consider the protected party \u2019s views and wishes on all relevant points but where those views and wishes run contrary to the legal advice received as to the management and progression of the case , it is unlikely that I will prefer the protected party \u2019s views over that advice , as it would not be in the protected party \u2019s interests that I do so .", "... ... ...", "I am not necessarily involved in the investigation of capacity unless specifically directed to investigate by the court ( although my staff are available to offer guidance with regard to the relevant test , if so requested ) . The evidence as to lack of litigation capacity may therefore be in the form of a medical or psychological report or by way of a report in the form of my standard certificate . The evidence is generally from either a psychiatrist or ( in the case of learning disability or acquired brain injury ) from a psychologist . In a small number of cases it will be from a general practitioner . In a minority of cases it may be from another clinical specialist such as a neurologist or geriatrician . In the alternative the court may have made a determination , on the existing evidence , that the person concerned is a \u2018 protected party\u2019 within the meaning of the rules .", "If the evidence on capacity to conduct the proceedings is ambiguous , or conflicting , then the Divisional Manager will request further clarification from the person who has conducted the assessment , or refer back to the court for a determination of the capacity issue .", "If during the course of the case the solicitor advises the case worker that the protected party may have recovered capacity , the standard instructions provide that the solicitor must obtain further evidence on this point .", "If there is evidence that the protected party has recovered capacity , then I will make an application to the court for my discharge . It is of course always open to the protected party at any time during my appointment to apply for my discharge , if of the view that the evidence as to capacity is open to challenge . Similarly if a person comes forward as willing to act in substitution for myself , then an application may be made to substitute for me as litigation friend . My discharge or substitution as litigation friend is for the court to decide .", "If my case worker is informed that the protected party asserts his or her own capacity to conduct the proceedings and disputes the existing evidence , then the protected party would be invited to agree to undergo further assessment - for example , through referral to his or her general practitioner or other ORG referral . If the protected party refuses to undergo further assessment or seek further evidence , I have , of course , no power to compel this .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing GPE claimed that there had been a violation of her rights under LAW because , inter alia , she had not been informed that ORG would be representing her until after the hearing ; the involvement of ORG was unlawful as she had the capacity to instruct her own solicitor ; the clinical psychologist had failed to apply the correct test in assessing capacity , namely the test identified in ORG decision of ORG ( ORG and CARDINAL ) [ DATE ] EWCA Civ DATE ; ORG and another [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) ; and finally , if she lacked capacity , a family member should have been appointed as her litigation friend .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment dated DATE , the court found that GPE was fully informed of the involvement of ORG and the nature of his role ; the clinical psychologist correctly assessed GPE \u2019s capacity by reference to the ORG test , and ORG \u2019s family members would not have been suitable litigation friends as they had also put themselves forward as carers for GPE With regard to the merits of GPE \u2019s case , the court found that the local authority had done what it could to facilitate the return of GPE to GPE \u2019s care and had not simply dismissed this possibility out of hand . The available evidence indicated , however , that GPE \u2019s significant learning disability prevented her from acquiring the necessary skills to provide GPE with the care that she needed and this was exacerbated by her increasing unwillingness to co - operate with social workers . The court therefore concluded that ORG was right to concede that the care and placement orders were in GPE \u2019s best interests and the judge was right to make the orders . Accordingly , it held that there had been no violation of GPE \u2019s rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . R.P. applied for leave to appeal to ORG but leave was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . While ORG proceedings were ongoing , PERSON issued an application for leave to apply to revoke the contact order . The application was refused on DATE and on DATE she was refused leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON issued an application for more frequent contact with GPE On receiving notice of the application , ORG wrote to the court to say that the question of GPE \u2019s capacity needed to be decided in the context of the contact application . At a hearing on DATE , an expert report was produced which indicated that GPE had capacity in relation to the contact proceedings . However , on CARDINAL DATE the application for contact orders was refused and GPE was refused leave to appeal . In addition , a further application for leave to revoke the placement order was refused and the court ordered that in future GPE could only apply for leave to revoke the placement order if she could put forward a change of circumstances since the date of the decision .", "CARDINAL .
