On DATE Mr Raza appealed to the Minister of ORG against the order for his expulsion ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He argued that it was unlawful , because he resided legally in GPE , lived with his wife and had never committed any offence . On DATE the Minister rejected the appeal , saying that there existed information that Mr Raza had been involved in human trafficking . He went on to specify that in cases of expulsion on national security or public order grounds it was not open to the administrative authorities to take into account extraneous considerations ; if the necessary prerequisites were in place , the authorities were bound to take the measure in question .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE PERSON sought judicial review of the expulsion order by ORG . He additionally asked the court to stay the order \u2019s enforcement . He asserted , inter alia , that he had been married to a NORP national for DATE and had never engaged in any unlawful activities .

He asked the court to request the immigration authorities to produce the materials which had led to the order .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the court found the application admissible , holding that the bar to judicial review set out in section PERSON ) of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was contrary to the Convention and was thus to be disregarded . It relied on this ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . It turned down the request for a stay of the order \u2019s enforcement , observing that its immediate enforcement was mandated by statute \u2013 section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In those circumstances , the courts were not competent to stay the enforcement , as this would amount to a judicial revision of a statute .

ORG heard the case on DATE . PERSON , who was legally represented , did not adduce evidence . He argued that the order was unlawful , as it did not specify the grounds for expelling him , and said that he would develop his arguments in pleadings that he would file later . Counsel for the authorities argued that the order was well - founded , as could be seen from the adduced evidence . The public prosecutor , who took part in the proceedings ex officio , argued that since the law specifically provided that no reasons were to be given for expulsion orders , the court was not competent to review the substantive lawfulness of the order , but only whether the procedure had been followed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed PERSON application . According to the applicants , apart from a short declaration that PERSON expulsion would not breach LAW , the court did not engage in any analysis of the proportionality of that measure . Nor did it scrutinise the facts underlying the decision to expel PERSON , or have before it the full text of the proposal for his expulsion , but merely a short excerpt from it , drawn up by the authorities specifically for the purposes of the judicial review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were not able to provide a copy of ORG judgment because the case is classified and neither they nor their counsel are allowed to make copies of any of the materials in the case file , including that judgment . Despite a specific request by ORG , the Government did not provide a copy of that judgment either , or specify what materials ORG had had before it when making it ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE PERSON sought judicial review of the order for his placement in a detention facility ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed his application and quashed the order . It found that the order was subject to review despite the express wording of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) because that provision was contrary to LAW . It also found that it had been made by a competent authority and in line with the applicable legal provisions . However , it went on to say that PERSON detention for such a long period had become unjustified , the authorities having been unable to deport him for DATE . There was no indication that the immigration authorities had taken any measures in that respect except asking for the cooperation of ORG .", "CARDINAL .

It held that the order for PERSON placement in a detention facility was subordinate to the order for his expulsion and had been made within the framework of the expulsion proceedings , for the sole reason that the expulsion could not be carried out forthwith . It was therefore not subject to judicial review by itself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sought judicial review of the decision of CARDINAL DATE turning down PERSON application for release ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE ORG declared PERSON application inadmissible , because she was not directly affected by the order , but found PERSON application admissible and wellfounded . It noted that the immigration authorities had sent CARDINAL letters to the consular department of ORG with requests for assistance in the process of securing a travel document for PERSON , but that no reply had been received . It went on to say that , in view of the difficulties in carrying out the expulsion , the authorities should have reconsidered whether or not Mr PERSON \u2019s detention continued to be justified . In situations where they had discretion , the authorities had to assess whether or not the impugned measures interfered disproportionately with the individual \u2019s rights and , whenever possible , opt for the option that was less onerous for the individual , in line with the principle of proportionality . The exercise of such discretion was subject to judicial review . Instead of keeping PERSON in custody , the authorities could have placed him under an obligation to report DATE to his local police station . In choosing between those alternatives , they had to take account of the length of the detention . If it exceeded DATE , it became an arbitrary deprivation of liberty , contrary to LAW ( f ) of the LAW . The inordinate amount of time spent by PERSON in custody , owing to the lack of effective measures for his expulsion , had negated the lawfulness of his deprivation of liberty . As the authorities had not taken those matters into account , they had made an unlawful decision . The court therefore quashed the refusal to release PERSON PERSON and instructed the authorities to reconsider the matter in line with its reasoning .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Director of ORG appealed . On DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible ( \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043c\u0430\u0439 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL CARDINAL \u0433. , PERSON , ORG ) .
