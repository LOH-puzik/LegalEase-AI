He is the proprietor and managing director of ORG , a publishing house which in DATE published a novel by PERSON entitled \u201c PERSON \u201d ( \u201c The forbidden phrases \u201d ) . The book conveyed the author 's views on philosophical and theological issues in a novelistic style . CARDINAL copies of it were printed in a single run .", "CARDINAL . In an indictment of DATE , the GPE public prosecutor ( \u201c the public prosecutor \u201d ) charged the applicant under the third and fourth paragraphs of LAW with blasphemy against \u201c God , the Religion , the Prophet and the Holy Book \u201d through the publication of the book in question .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor 's indictment was based on an expert report drawn up at the request of the press section of the GPE public prosecutor 's office by Professor PERSON , dean of the theology faculty of ORG at the material time . In his report of CARDINAL DATE the expert observed :", "\u201c ... the author arbitrarily uses theories about the physical substance of the universe , creation and the existence of natural laws to sway readers ' minds towards the conclusions he wishes to be drawn from the book . In particular , in the passages on theology he imprisons readers within the limits of his own views , which are devoid of all academic rigour . ... He criticises the beliefs , ideas , traditions and way of life of NORP society by adopting the independent and nonconformist viewpoint of the leaders , thinkers and scientists of the ORG in order to enlighten and advise our people as he sees fit . ... This way of thinking , based on materialism and positivism , leads to atheism in that it renounces faith and divine revelation ... Although these passages may be regarded as a polemic in support of the author 's philosophical views , it may be observed that they also contain statements that imply a certain element of humiliation , scorn and discredit vis - \u00e0 - vis religion , the PERSON and belief in God according to NORP ... In the author 's view , religious beliefs and opinions are mere obscurities , and ideas based on nature and reason are described as clear - sighted . The author describes religious faith as a ' desert mirage ' , a ' primitive idea ' and ' desert ecstasy ' , and religious practices as ' the primitivism of desert life ' . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In his report the expert quoted numerous passages from the book under review , in particular :", "\u201c ... just think about it , ... all beliefs and all religions are essentially no more than performances . The actors played their roles without knowing what it was all about . Everyone has been led blindly along that path . The imaginary god , to whom people have become symbolically attached , has never appeared on stage . He has always been made to speak through the curtain . The people have been taken over by pathological imaginary projections . They have been brainwashed by fanciful stories ...", "... this divests the imams of all thought and capacity to think and reduces them to the state of a pile of grass ... [ regarding the story of PERSON sacrifice ] it is clear that we are being duped here ... is God a sadist ? ... so PERSON is just as murderous as the God of PERSON ... \u201d", "The expert concluded his report as follows :", "\u201c The passages which I have quoted from the book form the actus reus of the offence provided for in LAW . As regards the mens rea , my analysis shows that it has been made out , especially since the author entitled his book ' The forbidden phrases ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE to ORG , the applicant contested the expert report . He requested a second opinion , arguing that the book was a novel and should have been analysed by literary specialists , and questioned the expert 's impartiality .", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG convicted the applicant and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and a fine . It commuted the prison sentence to a fine , so that the applicant was ultimately ordered to pay a total fine of MONEY ( equivalent at the time to MONEY ) . In its reasoning the court referred to the second expert report and cited the following passage from the book :", "\u201c Look at the triangle of fear , inequality and inconsistency in the Koran ; it reminds me of an earthworm . God says that all the words are those of his messenger . Some of these words , moreover , were inspired in a surge of exultation , in PERSON 's arms . ... God 's messenger broke his fast through sexual intercourse , after dinner and before prayer . PERSON did not forbid sexual relations with a dead person or a live animal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG .
