The arbitration tribunals were abolished , the task of assessing the final compensation becoming the sole responsibility of ORG , whose decision was based on a proposal by the relevant departments of the administrative authorities ( the regional directorates of ORG ) . The landowner had the right to comment on the proposal made by the authorities before a final decision was taken by ORG .", "Those CARDINAL statutory provisions , Legislative Decrees CARDINAL . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , were silent as to the remedies available to the landowner , although under administrative law it is possible to lodge an application with the administrative courts for judicial review of a ministerial act that gives cause for complaint .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the issue of the compatibility with LAW of the system of payment of compensation following a nationalisation or expropriation in its decisions LAW CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE . With regard to the authorities ' delay in the payment of compensation , it held in the first of these decisions :", "\u201c ... certainly all that [ namely , the payment of the compensation ] was done a considerable time after the nationalisations were carried out . It might be said that such delay constitutes a violation of the principle set out in LAW requiring the payment of compensation . However , that would be wrong . If , as a result of such a situation , there was a breach of the right to compensation on the ground that that right might become uncertain and therefore devoid of substance , the breach would not have been caused by any defect in the provisions under consideration but by the authorities ' inaction or lack of diligence ; and if it was the case that the authorities failed to act owing to the absence of statutory provisions capable of ensuring the effective application of the provisions in force and , consequently , the effective exercise of the right embodied in LAW , then any failure to abide by LAW would be by way of omission ... . ORG is not , however , called upon to examine that issue . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
