The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . He was employed by ORG as a parish priest in the parish of PERSON from DATE until DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the Cathedral Chapter ( tuomiokapituli , domkapitlet ) issued him with a warning , which was upheld by ORG on an unspecified date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Cathedral Chapter decided to transfer the applicant to the parish of GPE , which is situated QUANTITY from his home in PERSON . He did not consent to the transfer . In its decision , ORG reasoned as follows ( translation from NORP ) :", "\u201c The post of parish priest in the parish of PERSON is open ... and therefore it is for LAW to find a suitable person for the post . It has come to ORG knowledge that the parish priest of the parish of PERSON , PERSON , has stated that he considers himself unable to discharge all his duties . Therefore , the Cathedral Chapter has decided to discontinue PERSON assignment to his current post and give him a new assignment as parish priest in the parish of GPE .", "The Cathedral Chapter has heard ORG ( kirkkoneuvosto , kyrkor\u00e5det ) and PERSON . ORG has given a positive statement , whereas PERSON has announced that he will not accept a transfer and that he considers that there are no legal grounds for a transfer .", "However , considering the need to find a parish priest for the parish of GPE and the difficulties that PERSON has had in discharging all his functions in his current post , there is a justified reason as required by law for transferring him from the parish of PERSON to the parish of PERSON .", "Therefore , the Cathedral Chapter appoints PERSON to the post of parish priest in the parish of GPE from DATE until further notice and terminates his assigment as parish priest in the parish of ORG on DATE .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The decision indicated that ORG had applied LAW , section DATE ) , of LAW ( kirkkolaki , kyrkolagen ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , which provides that there has to be a justified reason for making a decision such as the above . It also indicated that , as provided by LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , as in force at the relevant time , no appeal lay against that decision .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the transfer had been orchestrated by the Vicar of the parish of ORG , who had not been satisfied with the applicant \u2019s contribution to his parish work .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been consulted in advance in writing about the proposed transfer . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel had informed ORG as follows ( translation from NORP ) :", "\u201c As the representative of the parish priest PERSON I would like to inform you that he does not intend to change his place of employment . He declares that he enjoys his present post in the service of the parish of ORG . There are no legal grounds for transferring him without his consent . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal ( kantelu , klagan ) with ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , alleging procedural errors in the decision . He claimed that ORG had not been impartial as the Vicar of the parish of PERSON , who was also the chairperson of ORG of ORG , had been present when the decision had been taken . However , he did not allege that the vicar had participated in the decision - making . He also argued that he had not been heard prior to the decision and that his opinion had not been taken into account . In particular , no weight had been given to the fact that his entire family lived in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG invited the Cathedral Chapter to make observations and communicated them to the applicant . According to ORG , it was an old tradition that a parish priest could be transferred to another parish with or without his consent if the transfer was considered to be in the interests of ORG . According to this tradition , which was comparable to a similar tradition in the armed forces , there was no appeal against a transfer decision . If an appeal were to be allowed , it would cause an unreasonable delay in the organisation of parish work . ORG also reiterated that it was known to all parties in question that the applicant had not been able to discharge all his functions in the parish of PERSON and that he had also faced disciplinary proceedings , resulting in a written warning . As the applicant had not denied this , ORG found it undisputed that he was incapable of fulfilling his duties in the parish of PERSON . The aim of the transfer was to avoid future disciplinary proceedings . Thus , it was also in the interests of the applicant that he be transferred . Moreover , there was a shortage of parish priests in the parish of PERSON . ORG disputed the applicant \u2019s contention that he had a right to be heard on the reasons discussed when his transfer was being considered . It also contested that the presence of the Vicar of the parish of PERSON had raised any disqualification issue . The vicar had not taken part in the decision - making .", "CARDINAL . In his observations in reply , the applicant maintained that ORG had not given him an opportunity to be heard about the grounds on which it had subsequently based its decision and according to which there was a shortage of priests in the parish of GPE and the applicant allegedly had difficulties in performing his duties in the parish of PERSON . He pointed out that he could be removed only on grounds provided for by law and that the decision certainly concerned his rights . As to his partiality allegation , he submitted that before the meeting there had been no report on the matter , which meant that the decision had thus been based solely on the discussion in which the Vicar of the parish of PERSON had taken part .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the Cathedral Chapter \u2019s decision without examining the merits of the case . It reasoned as follows ( translation from NORP ) :", "\u201c LAW , subsection CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of ORG ( hallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen ; Act no . ORG ) provides that a final decision may be set aside following a procedural complaint if a person concerned has not been provided with an opportunity to be heard and the decision violates his or her right . Paragraph CARDINAL provides that a decision may be set aside , if there has been another procedural error which may have likewise affected the decision .", "PERSON has requested that ORG decision be set aside on the grounds that he was not properly heard . However , PERSON had , as noted in the decision , been heard prior to the decision . Having regard to the fact that the case concerns appointment to a position under LAW , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , of ORG ( kirkkoj\u00e4rjestys , kyrkoordningen ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) PERSON has been adequately heard .", "PERSON has also requested that the decision be set aside on the grounds that the Vicar of the parish of PERSON was disqualified from taking part in the examination of the matter before ORG . As neither the vicar nor the parish of PERSON is a party to the proceedings in issue and as neither can be expected to derive particular benefit or suffer particular loss from the decision , there has not been any procedural error in respect of disqualification in the matter as provided by LAW , subsection CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW ( hallintomenettelylaki , lagen om f\u00f6rvaltningsf\u00f6rfarande ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , as in force at the relevant time . On these grounds and having regard to LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , ORG rejects the application .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant has been an assistant vicar of the parish of ORG since DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c Everyone has the freedom of religion and conscience . Freedom of religion and conscience entails the right to profess and practice a religion , the right to express one \u2019s convictions and the right to be a member of or decline to be a member of a religious community .

CARDINAL .", "The Government PERSON ( HE TIME ) for the enactment of LAW noted that the ORG is religiously uncommitted . CARDINAL of the purposes for the enactment of LAW was to relieve ORG from the duty to examine provisions concerning the religious doctrine and spiritual activities of the ORG and to strengthen the ORG \u2019s autonomous power of decision in its own sphere of authority .", "It follows from these provisions that the administration of the ORG is autonomous .", "CARDINAL .

LAW ) , paragraph CARDINAL , provides that a prior assignment is considered automatically terminated without notice where the priest in question is appointed , assigned or permanently transferred to another position within the ORG or a parish .", "CARDINAL . Chapter DATE , section CARDINAL of LAW provides that a parish priest belongs to the diocese in which he has been consecrated as a priest . According to the Government , this means that parish priests are considered to serve the entire diocese and ORG , without being bound to a particular parish or position . Further , a priest who is assigned to a parish by ORG is under an obligation to accept any new assignment . It is also an established principle that , having consecrated someone as a priest , ORG is under an obligation to ensure that the priest also has a valid assignment in the future .", "CARDINAL .

According to the ORG , the prohibition on appealing against a decision concerning assignment to a given position or withdrawal of an assignment was based on the need to ensure that the duties of parish priests were discharged as appropriate , in accordance with the respective needs of different parishes . The ORG noted , however , that this purpose was not indicated in the Government PERSON ( HE CARDINAL vp ) for the enactment of LAW .", "CARDINAL . LAW was amended with effect from DATE as regards the restrictions on the right of appeal concerning posts in ORG ( kirkkohallitus , kyrkostyrelsen ) and LAW .

In the opinion of ORG , the autonomy of the administration of ORG , based on LAW , must be taken into account in the assessment of the aforementioned proposed provision . ...", "Under existing provisions of law , the ORG and the Bishops\u2019 Conference do not decide on issues that would , in view of the foregoing , affect the rights or obligations of individuals . Therefore , the proposed prohibitions on an appeal ( paragraph CARDINAL ) have no relevance for the application of LAW [ according to which everyone has the right to have a decision pertaining to his or her rights or obligations reviewed by a court of law or other independent organ for the administration of justice ] . The proposed prohibitions may in this respect be considered to clarify the existing provisions of law . The bishop and LAW make their decisions on the assignment of a priest on the basis of religious criteria , and decisions made by the bishop alone mainly fall , according to the explanatory report of LAW , within the scope of religious guidance by the bishop . The prohibitions on appealing against such decisions ( paragraph CARDINAL ) do not constitute a problem with regard to LAW . The prohibitions on appealing referred to in subsection CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , relate to such issues concerning the religious workers of the ORG and falling within the scope of the autonomy of a religious community as do not directly affect anyone \u2019s subjective rights . Nor do the prohibitions on the right to request review and the right of appeal in any other respect cause problems with regard to the LAW . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
