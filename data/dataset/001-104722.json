The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was detained on charges of trafficking in children on account of his suspected involvement in illicit adoptions , and incitement to false testimony . The proceedings as regards the charge of trafficking in children were discontinued on DATE by ORG . The court found that the applicant \u2019s actions did not fulfil the description of such an offence . The decision was upheld on DATE by ORG . The remainder of the charges against the applicant were discontinued on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with using a forged power of attorney authorising him to represent Mr and PERSON On DATE ORG found him guilty on this charge and sentenced him to a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) , calculated as CARDINAL DATE rates , each equivalent to ORG CARDINAL . At the same time the court decided , under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , to credit the period of the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention from DATE to CARDINAL DATE towards the fine . Since , according to LAW , DATE of deprivation of liberty equalled CARDINAL DATE rates of a fine , the period of the applicant \u2019s detention of DATE was credited in its entirety towards the fine . An appeal by the applicant against that judgment was dismissed on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application for compensation for unjustified detention . He sought MONEY in respect of nonpecuniary damage and ORG CARDINAL for pecuniary damage ( at the material time these sums amounted to MONEY ( ORG ) in total ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment and remitted the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application . The court established that the applicant \u2019s detention DATE and DATE had undoubtedly been unjustified within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure . It relied on ORG interpretation to the effect that pretrial detention was undoubtedly unjustified if it had been imposed in violation of LAW as well as if it had caused the applicant suffering to which , taking into account all the circumstances and particularly the outcome of the case , he should not have been subjected . Accordingly , the final outcome of the case was to be considered decisive for finding that the pretrial detention in a case had been \u201c undoubtedly unjustified \u201d . In this connection the court established that the applicant had not been convicted of any of the offences which had been the basis of his pretrial detention . Moreover , it pointed to the findings of the courts , which had discontinued the proceedings against him on the ground that the applicant \u2019s actions did not fulfil the description of the offences he had been charged with . Taking into account all these arguments , the court concluded that the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention had undoubtedly been unjustified .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for compensation , reiterating that on DATE he had been convicted of forgery , for which he had been fined ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) . In accordance with Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , the total period of the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention had been credited towards the fine in such a way that DATE of pretrial detention had equalled CARDINAL DATE rates of ORG CARDINAL . The court thus considered that ORG had no longer been liable for undoubtedly unjustified detention , because the damage that had been sustained by the applicant had been correctly compensated for by crediting the period of his deprivation of liberty towards the fine ordered against him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the judgment , relying , inter alia , on LAW . He argued that the crediting of a period of deprivation of liberty towards a fine should not be automatic and that the courts should assess the actual damage sustained by a detainee .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) dismissed the appeal . The court agreed with the lower court \u2019s findings , and those expressed in ORG Resolution of DATE , which had stated that if the pretrial detention had been compensated for by being credited towards a fine , even one ordered in another set of proceedings , no compensation would be granted .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG applied to an extended bench of ORG for a resolution which would answer the following question :", "\u201c In the event that a period of pretrial detention ordered in another set of proceedings is credited towards a fine \u2013 under LAW of LAW and LAW of LAW \u2013 should the claim for compensation for undoubtedly unjustified detention be considered to have already been satisfied ; or , in application of LAW of LAW ( a contrario ) and the principles on calculating compensation as encompassing both [ pecuniary and nonpecuniary ] damage , would there still be a claim in so far as the just amount of compensation would exceed the amount of the fine that had been ordered ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , dismissed the application for a resolution in the applicant \u2019s case . The court considered that the law and practice were clear and that further interpretation of them in a resolution was not required . It considered that there existed CARDINAL ways of compensating for damage caused by unjustified pretrial detention . The first was of nonpecuniary nature , and applied when there was a possibility to credit a period of detention towards another penalty ordered against the same person in the same or another set of proceedings . The second was of a pecuniary nature , under Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , and was applicable only if the first way was not practicable . These CARDINAL methods were mutually exclusive in that making use of CARDINAL excluded the possibility of using the other . ORG concluded :", "\u201c ... crediting of a period of pretrial detention towards a penalty ordered in the same or in another set of proceedings precludes the possibility of subsequently bringing an effective claim for compensation [ under the relevant provisions of LAW ] for the same period [ of pretrial detention ] ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law following the interpretation provided by ORG in the abovementioned decision . The court considered that there were no provisions of NORP law that would allow for supplementary compensation in cases where the period of detention had been credited towards another penalty .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was notified of the ORG decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . An accused who , as a result of the reopening of proceedings or an appeal on points of law , has been acquitted or resentenced under a more lenient provision , shall be entitled to receive from the ORG compensation for the pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage which he has suffered as a result of having served all or part of the sentence unjustifiably imposed on him .", "CARDINAL . The provisions of paragraph CARDINAL shall also be applicable if , after the sentencing judgment has been reversed or declared null and void , the proceedings have been discontinued by reason of material circumstances not duly considered in prior proceedings .", "CARDINAL . A right to compensation for pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage shall also arise if a preventive measure has been applied under the conditions specified in paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .

Article DATE ( CARDINAL ) of LAW deals with the crediting of a period of actual deprivation of liberty towards other penalties ordered in the same set of proceedings . It provides :", "\u201c The period of actual deprivation of liberty in a given case , rounded to a full number of DATE , shall be credited towards the penalty ordered , with DATE of actual deprivation of liberty equalling CARDINAL day of the penalty of deprivation of liberty , or DATE of the penalty of restriction of liberty , or CARDINAL DATE rates of a fine . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly upheld the firstinstance court judgment and awarded compensation for unjustified detention to Mr U.M.K. in the amount of ORG CARDINAL as regards nonpecuniary damage and ORG CARDINAL for pecuniary damage ( in total approximately ORG CARDINAL ) . The claimant was detained for a total period of twentyfour days in DATE .
