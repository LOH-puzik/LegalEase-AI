THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 10", "JUDGES": "John Freeland", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a film director . He was born in DATE and resides in GPE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON wrote the shooting script for , and directed the making of , a video work entitled Visions of Ecstasy . Its running time is TIME , and it contains no dialogue , only music and moving images . According to the applicant , the idea for the film was derived from the life and writings of GPE of GPE , DATE ORG nun and founder of many convents , who experienced powerful ecstatic visions of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The action of the film centres upon a youthful actress dressed as a nun and intended to represent GPE . It begins with the nun , dressed loosely in a black habit , stabbing her own hand with a large nail and spreading her blood over her naked breasts and clothing . In her writhing , she spills a chalice of communion wine and proceeds to lick it up from the ground . She loses consciousness . This sequence takes up CARDINAL of the running time of the video . The second part shows PERSON dressed in a white habit standing with her arms held above her head by a white cord which is suspended from above and tied around her wrists . The near - naked form of TIME , said to represent GPE psyche , slowly crawls her way along the ground towards her . Upon reaching GPE feet , the psyche begins to caress her feet and legs , then her midriff , then her breasts , and finally exchanges passionate kisses with her . Throughout this sequence , GPE appears to be writhing in exquisite erotic sensation . This sequence is intercut at frequent intervals with a second sequence in which one sees the body of GPE , fastened to the cross which is lying upon the ground . GPE first kisses the stigmata of his feet before moving up his body and kissing or licking the gaping wound in his right side . Then she sits astride him , seemingly naked under her habit , all the while moving in a motion reflecting intense erotic arousal , and kisses his lips . For TIME , it appears that he responds to her kisses . This action is intercut with the passionate kisses of the psyche already described . Finally , GPE runs her hand down to the fixed hand of GPE and entwines his fingers in hers . As she does so , the fingers of NORP seem to curl upwards to hold with hers , whereupon the video ends .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the cast list which appears on the screen for TIME , the viewer has no means of knowing from the film itself that the person dressed as a nun in the video is intended to be GPE or that the other woman who appears is intended to be her psyche . No attempt is made in the video to explain its historical background .", "CARDINAL . Visions of Ecstasy was submitted to ORG ( \" the Board \" ) , being the authority designated by the ORG Secretary under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as", "\" the authority responsible for making arrangements ( a ) for determining , for the purposes of [ the ] Act whether or not video works are suitable for classification certificates to be issued in respect of them , having special regard to the likelihood of video works in respect of which such certificates have been issued being viewed in the home , ( b ) in the case of works which are determined in accordance with the arrangements to be so suitable ( i ) for making such other determinations as are required for the issue of classification certificates , and ( ii ) for issuing such certificates ... ... \"", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted the video to ORG in order that it might lawfully be sold , hired out or otherwise supplied to the general public or a section thereof .", "CARDINAL . The ORG rejected the application for a classification certificate on DATE in the following terms :", "\" Further to your application for a classification certificate ... , you are already aware that under LAW DATE the ORG must determine first of all whether or not a video work is suitable for such a certificate to be issued to it , having special regard to the likelihood of video works being viewed in the home . In making this judgment , ORG must have regard to ORG in which we are enjoined to ` continue to seek to avoid classifying works which are obscene within the meaning of ORG and DATE or which infringe other provisions of the criminal law\u2019 . Amongst these provisions is the criminal law of blasphemy , as tested recently in ORG in NORP v. Lemon ( DATE ) , commonly known as ORG case . The definition of blasphemy cited therein is \u2018 any contemptuous , reviling , scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God , PERSON or the Bible ... It is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the NORP religion\u2019 if the publication is \u2018 decent and temperate\u2019 . The question is not CARDINAL of the matter expressed , but of its manner , i.e. ` the tone , style and spirit\u2019 , in which it is presented . The video work submitted by you depicts the mingling of religious ecstasy and sexual passion , a matter which may be of legitimate concern to the artist . It becomes subject to the law of blasphemy , however , if the manner of its presentation is bound to give rise to outrage at the unacceptable treatment of a sacred subject . Because the wounded body of the crucified Christ is presented solely as the focus of , and at certain moments a participant in , the erotic desire of GPE , with no attempt to explore the meaning of the imagery beyond engaging the viewer in an erotic experience , it is the ORG \u2019s view , and that of its legal advisers , that a reasonable jury properly directed would find that the work infringes the criminal law of blasphemy . To summarise , it is not the case that the sexual imagery in Visions of Ecstasy lies beyond the parameters of the ` CARDINAL category ; it is simply that for a major proportion of the work \u2019s duration that sexual imagery is focused on the figure of the crucified Christ . If the male figure were not GPE , the problem would not arise . Cuts of a fairly radical nature in the overt expressions of sexuality between GPE and the NORP figure might be practicable , but I understand that you do not wish to attempt this course of action . In consequence , we have concluded that it would not be suitable for a classification certificate to be issued to this video work . \"", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s determination to ORG ( \" the ORG \" - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , established pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . His notice of appeal , prepared by his legal representatives at the time , contained the following grounds :", "\" ( i ) that the ORG was wrong to conclude that the video infringes the criminal law of blasphemy , and that a reasonable jury properly directed would so find ; ( ii ) in particular , the Appellant will contend that upon a proper understanding of the serious nature of the video as an artistic and imaginative interpretation of the ORG PERSON or ` rapture\u2019 of the DATE NORP nun , GPE of PERSON , it would not be taken by a reasonable person as contemptuous , reviling , scurrilous or ludicrous or otherwise disparaging in relation to God , PERSON or the Bible . The appeal will raise the question of mixed fact and law , namely whether publication of the video , even to a restricted degree , would contravene the existing criminal law of blasphemy . \"", "CARDINAL . The ORG submitted a formal reply to the ORG explaining its decision in relation to its functions under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act :", "\" The LAW does not expressly set out the principles to be applied by the authority in determining whether or not a video work is suitable for a classification certificate to be issued in respect of it . In these circumstances , the ORG has exercised its discretion to formulate principles for classifying video works in a manner which it believes to be both reasonable and suited to carrying out the broad objectives of the LAW . Amongst these principles , the ORG has concluded that an overriding test of suitability for classification is the determination that the video work in question does not infringe the criminal law . In formulating and applying this principle , the ORG has consistently had regard to ORG under LAW ... ORG has concluded on the advice of leading Counsel that the video work in question infringes the criminal law of blasphemy and that a reasonable jury properly directed on the law would convict accordingly . ORG submits and is advised that in GPE the offence of blasphemy is committed if a video work treats a religious subject ( in particular PERSON , PERSON or the Bible ) in such a manner as to be calculated ( that is , bound , not intended ) to outrage those who have an understanding of , sympathy towards and support for the NORP story and ethic , because of the contemptuous , reviling , insulting , scurrilous or ludicrous tone , style and spirit in which the subject is presented . The video work under appeal purports to depict the erotic fantasies of a character described in the credits as GPE of GPE . The CARDINAL-minute second section of the video work portrays \u2018 PERSON Teresa\u2019 having an erotic fantasy involving the crucified figure of GPE , and also a NORP erotic fantasy involving the \u2018 Psyche of St Teresa\u2019 . No attempt is made to place what is shown in any historical , religious or dramatic context : the figures of GPE and her psyche are both clearly modern in appearance and the erotic images are accompanied by a rock music backing . The work contains no dialogue or evidence of an interest in exploring the psychology or even the sexuality of the character purporting to be GPE of GPE . Instead , this character and her supposed fantasies about lesbianism and the body and blood of NORP are presented as the occasion for a series of erotic images of a kind familiar from \u2018 soft - core\u2019 pornography . In support of its contentions , the ORG refers to an interview given by the appellant and published in DATE magazine on DATE . In this interview , the appellant attempts to draw a distinction between pornography and \u2018 ORG , denying that the video work in question is pornographic but stating that ` all my own work is actually ORG . Further on , the interviewer comments : ` In many ways , though , Visions calls upon the standard lexicon of lust found in down market porn : nuns , lesbianism , women tied up ( NORP Nuns in Bondage could have been an alternative title in fact ) . PERSON flashes a wicked grin . ` That \u2019s right , and I \u2019m not denying it . I do n\u2019t know what it is about nuns , it \u2019s the same sort of thing as white stocking tops I suppose.\u2019 So why does he not consider Visions to be pornography , or at least soft porn ? ` I hope it is gentler , subtler than that . I suppose most people think pornography shows the sex act , and this PERSON It is clear from the appellant \u2019s own admissions that , whether or not the video work can rightly be described as pornographic , it is solely erotic in content , and it focuses this erotic imagery for much of its duration on the body and blood of GPE , who is even shown to respond to the sexual attentions of the principal character . Moreover , the manner in which such imagery is treated places the focus of the work less on the erotic feelings of the character than on those of the audience , which is the primary function of pornography whether or not it shows the sex act explicitly . Because there is no attempt , in the ORG \u2019s view , to explore the meaning of the imagery beyond engaging the viewer in a voyeuristic erotic experience , ORG considers that the public distribution of such a video work would outrage and insult the feelings of believing NORP ... ... ORG ... submits that the appeal should be dismissed and its determination upheld . \"", "CARDINAL . The applicant then made further representations to the ORG , stating , inter alia :", "\" The definition of the offence of blasphemy set out in ... the reply is too wide , being significantly wider than the test approved in the only modern authority - see ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , per Lord PERSON at CARDINAL . For example , there is no uniform law of blasphemy in GPE ; the last recorded prosecution for blasphemy under the law of GPE was in DATE PERSON [ DATE ] I Brown CARDINAL . Nor is any religious subject protected - the reviling matter must be in relation to God , PERSON or the Bible , or the formularies of ORG as by law established . In the Appellant \u2019s contention , these limitations are of the utmost significance in this case since the video is not concerned with anything which God or PERSON did , or thought or might have approved of . It is about the erotic visions and imaginings of a DATE NORP nun - namely GPE of GPE . It is quite plain that the NORP figure exists in her fantasy as the ORG expressly accepts ... The scurrilous and/or erotic treatment of religious subject matter has received the ORG \u2019s classification without attempted prosecution in DATE , e.g. PERSON Life of Brian and Mr PERSON \u2019s The Last Temptation of Christ . ... ORG argues that the video is purely erotic or \u2018 soft - core\u2019 pornographic , without historical , religious , dramatic or other artistic merit . The implication is that , had it possessed such merit the ORG \u2019s decision might very well have been otherwise . The Appellant will seek to argue and call evidence to the effect that the video work is a serious treatment of the subject of the ecstatic raptures of GPE ( well chronicled in her own works and those of commentators ) from a DATE point of view . The so - called \u2018 rock music backing\u2019 was in fact specially commissioned from the respected composer PERSON , after discussion of the Director \u2019s desired artistic and emotional impact . ORG has based its decision upon the narrowest , most disparaging , critical appreciation of the work . The Appellant will contend that a very much more favourable assessment of his aims and achievement in making PERSON is , at the very least , tenable and that the ORG ought not to refuse a certificate on a mere matter of interpretation . The Appellant takes objection to the ORG \u2019s quotation ... of comments attributed to him from an article by CARDINAL PERSON published in DATE magazine DATE . The remarks are pure hearsay so far as ORG is concerned . That aside , the piece quoted is in large part the comments of the author of the article . An entirely misleading impression of what the Appellant said to the author is conveyed by the interpolation of the words attributed to him , and by taking this passage out of context . Above all , the Appellant disputes the key assertion by ORG that the video work is solely erotic in content . \"", "CARDINAL . The appeal was heard by a CARDINAL - member panel of the ORG ( \" the Panel \" ) on CARDINAL and DATE ; oral and affidavit evidence was submitted . By a majority of CARDINAL , a written decision rejecting the appeal was given on DATE . The ORG also considered itself bound by the criteria set out in the designation notice ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It had difficulty , however , in ascertaining and applying the present law of blasphemy . It commented as follows :", "\" The authorities on this Common Law offence were reviewed by ORG in the case of ORG v. PERSON which concerned a magazine called ORG , the readership of which consisted mainly of homosexuals although it was on sale to the general public at some bookstalls . CARDINAL edition contained a poem entitled The Love that Dares to Speak its Name accompanied by a drawing illustrating its subject matter . In his judgment Lord PERSON said that it was unnecessary to speculate whether an outraged NORP would feel provoked by the words and illustration to commit a breach of the peace , the true test being whether the words are calculated to outrage and insult the NORP \u2019s religious feelings , the material in question being contemptuous , reviling , scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God , PERSON or the Bible , or the formularies of ORG . It should perhaps be added that the word ` PERSON should be read in the dictionary sense of ` PERSON or ` likely\u2019 as it was decided that intent ( other than an intent to publish ) is not an element in the offence . In the same case Lord PERSON said that the material must be ` likely to arouse a sense of outrage among those who believe in or respect ORG . In the present case the ORG \u2019s Director ... said in evidence that the ORG \u2019s view was that the video was ` contemptuous of the divinity of Christ\u2019 . He added that although the ORG \u2019s decision was based upon its view that the video is blasphemous ( blasphemy being an offence which relates only to the NORP religion ) , it would take just the same stance if it were asked to grant a ORG to a video which , for instance , was contemptuous of PERSON . \"", "CARDINAL . The Panel went on to review the content of the video and accepted that the applicant had in mind PERSON , a nun , \" who is known to have had ecstatic visions of NORP although , incidentally , these did not start until she was DATE of age - in marked contrast to the obvious youthfulness of the actress who plays the part \" .", "CARDINAL . The Panel reached the following conclusion :", "\" From the writings of GPE herself , and the subsequent writings of others , there seems no reason to doubt that some of her visions were of seeing the glorified body of GPE and being shown his wounds but , even so , it seems clear that PERSON has taken considerable artistic licence with his subject . Apart from the age discrepancy - a comparatively minor matter - we were made aware of nothing which would suggest that PERSON ever did anything to injure her hand or that any element of lesbianism ever entered into her visions . More importantly , there seems nothing to suggest that PERSON , in her visions , ever saw herself as being in any bodily contact with the glorified NORP . As CARDINAL author , Mr PERSON , puts it ` Teresa experienced ecstasy as a form of prayer in which she herself played almost no ORG . So , in view of the extent of the artistic licence , we think it would be reasonable to look upon the video as centring upon any nun of DATE who , like many others down the ages , had ecstatic visions . There is also another reason for taking this stance : unless the viewer happens to read the cast list which appears on the screen for TIME , he or she has no means of knowing that the nun is supposed to be GPE , nor that the figure of the second woman is supposed to be her psyche . And he or she in any event may well be unaware that PERSON was a real - life nun who had ecstatic visions . It is true that PERSON says that it is intended that the sleeve or jacket for the video will provide \u2018 basic historical information to assist the ORG , but we feel bound to regard this as irrelevant . Firstly because it by no means follows that every viewer will read any such description ; and secondly because ORG and ORG decision must be based solely upon the video itself , quite apart from the fact that at the time of making a decision the sleeve or jacket is usually - as in the present instance - not even in existence . However , although we have thought it proper to dwell at some length with the \u2018 LOC Teresa\u2019 aspect , we are of the opinion that in practice , when considering whether or not the video is blasphemous , it makes little or no difference whether CARDINAL looks upon the central character as being GPE or any other nun . The appellant , in his written statement , lays stress upon the undoubted fact that the whole of the second CARDINAL consists of ORG \u2019s vision or dream . Hence he says the video says nothing about GPE , his figure being used only as a projection of GPE mind , nor was it his intention to make that figure an active participant in any overt sexual act . He goes on to say ` Rather the very mild responses are those of GPE conjecture : the kiss , hand clasp and ultimately the tears of GPE . To show no response to a creation of her own mind would be nonsense ; no woman ( nor man ) whose deep love could cause such visions / ecstasies would imagine the object of that love coldly to ignore their caresses\u2019 . Although we quite appreciate the logic of this point of view , we have reservations about the extent to which a vision or dream sequence can affect the question of whether what is pictured or said is blasphemous . It would , for instance , be possible to produce a film or video which was most extremely contemptuous , reviling , scurrilous or ludicrous in relation to NORP , all dressed up in the context of someone \u2019s imaginings . In such circumstances we find it hard to envisage that , by such a simple device , it could reasonably be said that no offence had been committed . If in our opinion the viewer , after making proper allowance for the scene being in the form of a dream , nevertheless reasonably feels that it would cause a sense of outrage and insult to a NORP \u2019s feelings , the offence would be established . We should perhaps also deal , albeit briefly , with a further submission made on behalf of the appellant , namely that the crime of blasphemy may extend only to the written or spoken word and hence that a court might rule that no film or video , and perhaps nothing shown on television , could become the subject of such a charge . Suffice it to say that in our view this is too unlikely to cause it to be taken into account by ORG or a panel of ORG when reaching a decision . In the opinion of a majority of the ORG the video did not , as the appellant claims , explore GPE struggles against her visions but exploited a devotion to NORP in purely carnal terms . Furthermore they considered that it lacked the seriousness and depth of The Last Temptation of Christ with which Counsel for the appellant sought to compare it . Indeed the majority took the view that the video \u2019s message was that the nun was moved not by religious ecstasy but rather by sexual ecstasy , this ecstasy being of a perverse kind - full of images of blood , sado - masochism , lesbianism ( or perhaps auto - erotism ) and bondage . Although there was evidence of some element of repressed sexuality in GPE devotion to GPE , they did not consider that this gave any ground for portraying her as taking the initiative in indulged sexuality . They considered the over - all tone and spirit of the video to be indecent and had little doubt that all the above factors , coupled with the motions of the nun whilst astride the body of NORP and the response to her kisses and the intertwining of the fingers would outrage the feelings of NORP , who would reasonably look upon it as being contemptuous of the divinity of NORP . In these circumstances the majority were satisfied that the video is blasphemous , that a reasonable and properly directed jury would be likely to convict and therefore that the ORG was right to refuse to grant a ORG . Hence this appeal is accordingly dismissed . It should perhaps be added that the minority on the ORG , whilst being in no doubt that many people would find the video to be extremely distasteful , would have allowed the appeal because in their view it is unlikely that a reasonable and properly directed jury would convict . \"", "CARDINAL . As a result of the ORG \u2019s determination , as upheld by the ORG , the applicant would commit an offence under section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) if he were to supply the video in any manner , whether or not for reward .", "CARDINAL . The applicant received legal advice that his case was not suitable for judicial review ( see paragraphs DATE below ) on the grounds that the formulation of the law of blasphemy , as accepted by the Panel , was an \" accurate statement of the present law \" .", "CARDINAL . According to statistics submitted by the Government , in DATE there were CARDINAL video - recorders in GPE . Out of CARDINAL households in GPE , CARDINAL contained CARDINAL video - recorder . There were CARDINAL video outlets in GPE . Videos were available for hire in CARDINAL video rental shops . They were also available for sale in CARDINAL \" high street \" shops and in CARDINAL \" secondary \" outlets such as supermarkets , corner shops and petrol stations . In DATE there were CARDINAL video rentals and CARDINAL video purchases in GPE . It is estimated that a further CARDINAL illegal copies ( \" pirate videos \" ) were distributed during DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" ) regulates the distribution of video works . Subject to certain exemptions , it is an offence under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of that LAW for a person to supply or offer to supply a video work in respect of which no classification certificate has been issued . Under section CARDINAL there are CARDINAL categories of classification : works deemed suitable for general viewing ( and to which a parental guidance reference may be added ) ; works for which the viewing is restricted to people who have attained a specified age ; and works which may only be supplied by licensed sex shops . The Secretary of ORG for ORG may require that the content of certain works be labelled ( section CARDINAL) . It is an offence to ignore such conditions , for example by supplying someone DATE with an \" CARDINAL \" classified work ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act the Secretary of ORG may by notice designate any person or body as the authority for making arrangements for determining whether or not video works are suitable for classification certificates to be issued in respect of them ( having special regard to the likelihood of certified video works being viewed in the home ) . By a notice dated DATE ORG was so designated . In the case of works which are determined in accordance with the arrangements described above to be suitable for classification certificates , ORG is responsible under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) for making arrangements for the issue of certificates and making other determinations relating to their use .

ORG and Lemon [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL at CARDINAL , which concerned the law of blasphemy in GPE , Lord PERSON held that the modern law of blasphemy was correctly formulated in Article CARDINAL of ORG of the Criminal Law , CARDINALth edition ( DATE ) . This states as follows :", "\" Every publication is said to be blasphemous which contains any contemptuous , reviling , scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God , PERSON or the Bible , or the formularies of ORG as by law established . It is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the NORP religion , or to deny the existence of God , if the publication is couched in decent and temperate language . The test to be applied is as to the manner in which the doctrines are advocated and not to the substance of the doctrines themselves . \"", "ORG in that case also decided that the mental element in the offence ( mens rea ) did not depend upon the accused having an intent to blaspheme . It was sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the publication had been intentional and that the matter published was blasphemous . The Gay News case , which had been brought by a private prosecutor , had been the first prosecution for blasphemy since DATE .", "CARDINAL . As stated above , the law of blasphemy only protects the NORP religion and , more specifically , the established ORG . This was confirmed by ORG in DATE . Ruling on an application for judicial review of a magistrate \u2019s refusal to issue a summons for blasphemy against PERSON and the publishers of The Satanic Verses , PERSON stated :", "\" We have no doubt that as the law now stands it does not extend to religions other than NORP ... ... We think it right to say that , were it open to us to extend the law to cover religions other than NORP , we should refrain from doing so . Considerations of public policy are extremely difficult and complex . It would be virtually impossible by judicial decision to set sufficiently clear limits to the offence , and other problems involved are formidable . \" ( NORP v.

On DATE the then Minister of ORG at ORG , Mr PERSON , had sent a letter to a number of influential NORP , in which he stated inter alia that :", "\" Many NORP have argued that the law of blasphemy should be amended to take books such as [ The Satanic Verses ] outside the boundary of what is legally acceptable . We have considered their arguments carefully and reached the conclusion that it would be unwise for a variety of reasons to amend the law of blasphemy , not the least the clear lack of agreement over whether the law should be reformed or repealed . ... ... an alteration in the law could lead to a rush of litigation which would damage relations between faiths . I hope you can appreciate how divisive and how damaging such litigation might be , and how inappropriate our legal mechanisms are for dealing with matters of faith and individual belief . Indeed , the NORP faith no longer relies on it , preferring to recognise that the strength of their own belief is the best armour against mockers and blasphemers . \"", "CARDINAL . Decisions by public bodies which have consequences which affect some person or body of persons are susceptible to challenge in ORG on an application for judicial review . Amongst the grounds on which such a challenge may be brought is that the body in question misdirected itself on a point of law . ORG is such a public body because it is established pursuant to an ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .
