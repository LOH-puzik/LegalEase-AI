A total loss of control over one \u2019s actions is absolutely clear only in certain cases , such as delusional psychosis ( \u2018 dementia\u2019 ) . In other cases , it is more debatable and the personal conviction of the experts will be influenced by the presence of certain indicators .

These documents thus demonstrate beyond doubt that Ms PERSON no longer felt capable of controlling her actions ... it has always been clear that there was mental disturbance ... new evidence [ warrants ] the firm conviction that at the time of the events , PERSON was incapable of controlling her actions on account of a severe mental disturbance . ...
