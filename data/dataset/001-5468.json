NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE . He is an inventor , resident in ORG . In the proceedings before the Convention institutions he has been represented by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , PERSON , Attorney , Office of the Attorney General ( ORG ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "While seeking to earn his living from his own inventions , the applicant encountered financial problems . He ceased to pay taxes in DATE and by DATE his tax debt amounted to approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "In view of the applicant \u2019s financial problems , the local social security authorities issued a guarantee for a ORG CARDINAL loan contracted by the applicant . Later , as the applicant defaulted on the loan , the municipality paid the bank in full and took over the loan and mortgage .", "As of DATE , the applicant \u2019s real property in ORG was mortgaged for ORG CARDINAL . According to a valuation of CARDINAL DATE acquired by the applicant , the property \u2019s sales value was estimated at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and its technical value at ORG MONEY .", "On DATE the tax authorities lodged a petition with ORG ( skifterett ) for the opening of bankruptcy proceedings against the applicant . Under NORP law such a decision would be followed by the appointment of administrators entrusted mainly with the tasks of taking over the control of the debtor \u2019s property , verifying the claims made in the estate and ensuring its fair distribution among the creditors , in accordance with specific rules . The administrators\u2019 actions may be challenged separately by the debtor in ordinary judicial proceedings , if need be , at CARDINAL instances , the first CARDINAL with oral hearing .", "At an oral hearing on DATE , the applicant , unassisted by counsel , declared that his debts amounted to ORG CARDINAL and that his real assets amounted to ORG CARDINAL . By a decision ( kjennelse ) of the same date , ORG dismissed the request for the opening of bankruptcy proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s estate , finding that , \u201c because of uncertainty ( usikkerhet ) attached to the value of the applicant \u2019s real estate , the issue of insolvency was uncertain ( usikkert ) . \u201d", "The authorities appealed against ORG decision to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , arguing that the sales value of the applicant \u2019s real estate amounted to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL according to an evaluation of CARDINAL DATE carried out by a bank . Consequently , the applicant 's debts exceeded his possessions by more than ORG CARDINAL .", "In his rejoinder to ORG dated DATE the applicant , still unrepresented , requested that the appeal be dismissed \u201c already at this preparatory stage of the proceedings \u201d . He argued that at a meeting on DATE the municipal social security office had undertaken to draw up a proposal for clearing his debts , implying an understanding that the municipality would not lodge bankruptcy proceedings . In an alternative submission , the applicant asked ORG to hold a \u201c main hearing \u201d ( \u201c hovedforhandling \u201d ) in order to examine certain witnesses . PERSON could testify that the record of the meeting on DATE erroneously concluded that he should give priority to paying his debts as she had attended as his witness and representative at the said meeting . Should ORG wish to do so , it could also take evidence from CARDINAL of his clients , who could testify about the applicant \u2019s prospective future earnings , though the applicant considered it would not serve his commercial interest to call a client to testify . He moreover questioned the honesty and professionalism of the expert who had failed to visit the inside of his house before making the assessment of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant emphasised that since the earlier expertise made by another expert on CARDINAL DATE , he had invested work and money in the house , bringing the estimated \u201c technical \u201d value of ORG CARDINAL ( as of CARDINAL DATE ) up to ORG CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s submission , it was the technical value ( as opposed to the sales value ) that had to be taken into account in determining the issue of insolvency .", "In its decision ( kjennelse ) of DATE , ORG overturned ORG decision . ORG observed at the outset that there was no ground for dismissing the case . Nor did it find any basis in LAW ( tvistem\u00e5lsloven ) for holding a hearing . As to the merits it concluded that the conditions for declaring the applicant bankrupt were fulfilled . It considered inter alia , that his total debts amounted to at least NOK CARDINAL . His only asset of importance was his real estate in ORG . Having regard to the assessments of its value of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE and to the investments allegedly made by the applicant , ORG fixed the property \u2019s sales value , which was decisive for the assessment of insolvency , at a maximum of ORG CARDINAL . There was thus a deficit of approximately ORG CARDINAL . His capacity for future earnings were most uncertain and could in any event only accrue in the distant future .", "The applicant was notified of ORG decision on DATE . An annex to the decision informed him of the possibility to appeal to ORG of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) within DATE from the notification and subject to advance payment of the procedural costs . By letter of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , the applicant protested against the procedure and the date of notification , so close to the DATE and New Year holidays , making it impossible to consult a lawyer . He also stated his intention to lodge an appeal .", "By letter of DATE , ORG informed the applicant that his submissions of DATE did not fulfil the legal requirements for lodging an appeal and offered its assistance in drawing up an appeal , as provided for in the law on cases of unrepresented petitioners . The applicant did not take any further steps in this connection .", "Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , an appeal to ORG of the kind lodged in the present case - interlocutory appeal ( kj\u00e6rem\u00e5l ) - should as a rule be decided by ORG without an oral hearing . A hearing was only to be held in exceptional cases , in order to avoid an excessive burden on the judiciary . Such hearings were not limited to certain types of cases and were to be held essentially in the same manner as ordinary appeals . No appeal lay against the court \u2019s decision to hold a hearing . According to case - law and legal doctrine this applied also , in principle , to a decision not to hold a hearing . Where ORG had taken a decision on whether or not to hold a hearing , the procedure by which it was reached could be challenged but not the decision itself ( pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of Mr PERSON commentary to LAW ( GPE , GPE , GPE , DATE ) . Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) no . CARDINAL of the LAW , an appeal could be lodged with ORG of ORG on the ground that ORG had made a procedural error in relation to its decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
