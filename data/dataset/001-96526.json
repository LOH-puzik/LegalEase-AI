With the leave of the President of the Section ( Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of Court ) she was represented before the Court by her son Mr PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant \u2019s father , Mr PERSON , was the owner of a property located on the corner of ORG streets in GPE . The applicant and her son are the only heirs of Mr Meklemburg .", "By virtue of the Decree of DATE on the Ownership and Use of Land in GPE , ownership of all private land was transferred to GPE . The decree gave the former owners the opportunity to obtain a perpetual lease ( temporary ownership after DATE and currently perpetual use ) of the nationalised plot of land on request .", "On DATE GPE ( ORG ) signed before a public notary a contract with the PERSON limited liability company by virtue of which the ownership of a plot of land in the centre of GPE was transferred to the above company as the GPE \u2019s contribution to its seed capital ( aport do kapitalu zak\u0142adowego sp\u00f3\u0142ki ) . The land in question included the plot previously owned by the applicant \u2019s father . The Z\u0142ote Tarasy company constructed a shopping centre on it .", "The LOC acknowledged in the contract that there had been \u201c reprivatisation claims \u201d made in respect of the land in question and that proceedings to ascertain whether these claims were justified were pending . The GPE further stated that it had the financial means necessary to cover these claims .", "The LOC conducted negotiations with the applicant , her sister and CARDINAL other heirs of former owners of the land in question .", "On DATE the representatives of GPE signed before a public notary a friendly settlement agreement with CARDINAL heirs of the owners of the land . They accepted the compensation proposed by the LOC and agreed to waive any rights in respect of ownership or right to perpetual use of the land in question . The compensation proposed by the GPE had been based on the value of the property according to an assessment of DATE . The applicant and her sister decided not to sign the agreement because they contested the amount of compensation . The agreement in its relevant part reads as follows :", "\u201c GPE agrees to pay [ to CARDINAL heirs of the former owners of the land ] compensation for pecuniary damage ( odszkodowanie ) for not granting them the right of perpetual use of the plot of land described above , to which they were entitled under LAW , and the ownership of which was transferred by the LOC as a contribution to the Z\u0142ote Tarasy limited liability company ... \u201d", "On DATE the applicant lodged a civil claim with ORG ( PERSON ) for annulment of the contract of DATE by which the land in question had been transferred to the Z\u0142ote Tarasy limited liability company . They claimed that the contract had breached their right to be granted perpetual use of the land or their pre - emptive right thereto .", "On DATE the court dismissed their action , finding that the ownership of the property had been transferred in the form of the LOC \u2019s contribution to the seed capital of the limited liability company . According to the court such a contribution could not be considered as a sale of the property within the meaning of section CARDINAL of ORG , thus the contract in question remained valid .", "An appeal by the applicant was dismissed on DATE by ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) . The court agreed with the opinion that the form in which the GPE had transferred the ownership of the land had not been a sale within the meaning of the domestic law . However , even if it was a sale and the transfer of the ownership had been carried out in breach of section CARDINAL of the PERSON , in any event it had not rendered the contract of DATE null and void . The only consequence of a breach of these provisions was a compensatory liability on the part of the LOC .", "On DATE ORG refused to hear a cassation appeal lodged by the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a civil claim against GPE for compensation for damage caused by the decision of DATE dismissing her father \u2019s claim to be granted perpetual use of the land and the contract of DATE .", "On DATE ORG gave a preliminary judgment ( wyrok wst\u0119pny ) in which it allowed the claim . It considered that the issue of the applicant \u2019s claim to be granted perpetual use of the land should have been examined before the Municipality had transferred the ownership of the property to the company . GPE thus acted illegally , as it had known that the applicant \u2019s claims were pending .", "GPE lodged an appeal against the judgment .", "On DATE ORG allowed the appeal and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . The court considered that until the right to perpetual use of the land had finally been determined by the administrative authority the heirs of the former owners had no right to the property in question . Only a final administrative decision could decide whether or not they had any claim to the property . Thus the GPE could legally transfer the ownership of the land in question . Moreover , the proceedings concerning the request to be granted perpetual use of the land had been pending and as a result the applicant might still obtain perpetual use of another plot of land or compensation . The applicant was also ordered to reimburse the costs of the proceedings to GPE in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment but on DATE ORG refused to hear it .", "On DATE , in accordance with the time - limit provided in section CARDINAL of the DATE Decree , the applicant \u2019s father lodged an application in which he sought to be granted the right of temporary ownership of the land .", "On DATE the Mayor of GPE dismissed the application .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a request for the above decision to be declared null and void .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) decided to stay the proceedings . An appeal by the applicant was dismissed on DATE .", "On DATE ORG of Appeal decided to resume the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG of Appeal found the above decision null and void .", "Subsequently , the applicant intervened on many occasions with the President of GPE and complained to a local Member of ORG that the administrative authority was taking no action .", "On DATE the President of GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for perpetual use of the land . It established that the ownership of the property in question had been transferred to the Z\u0142ote Tarasy limited liability company , thus the applicant could not be granted the right of perpetual use of it .", "The applicant appealed .", "On DATE ORG upheld the impugned decision .", "On DATE ORG quashed the decision and remitted the case . It considered that the administrative authorities should have examined whether the applicant had fulfilled the legal requirements to be granted the right of perpetual use . The issue that the ownership of the land had been transferred was of a secondary nature .", "The parties appealed against the judgment and on DATE ORG upheld the decision .", "The proceedings are pending before the President of GPE .", "Under LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) of DATE an administrative authority should give a decision on the merits of a case within DATE . If those time - limits have not been complied with , the authority must , under LAW , inform the parties of that fact , explain the reasons for the delay and fix a new timelimit .", "Pursuant to LAW , if the case has not been handled within the time - limits referred to in ORG and DATE , a party to administrative proceedings can lodge an appeal to the higher authority , alleging inactivity . In cases where the allegations of inactivity are well - founded , the higher authority fixes a new term for handling the case and orders an inquiry in order to determine the reasons for the inactivity and to identify the persons responsible for the delay . If need be , the authority may order that measures be applied to prevent future such delays .", "On DATE , the Law of CARDINAL DATE on ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) entered into force . Under section CARDINAL of the DATE ORG was competent to examine complaints against inactivity on the part of an authority .", "Section CARDINAL of the Act provided :", "\u201c When a complaint alleging inactivity on the part of an administrative authority is well - founded , ORG shall oblige that authority to issue a decision , or to perform a specific act , or to confirm , declare , or recognise a right or obligation provided for by law . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act set out the requirement of the exhaustion of available remedies before lodging a complaint with ORG . Accordingly , a complaint concerning alleged inactivity should be preceded by the lodging of a complaint with an administrative organ of a higher level , pursuant to the abovementioned LAW .", "Pursuant to LAW , the decision of ORG ordering an authority to put an end to its inactivity was legally binding on the authority concerned . If the authority did not comply with the decision , the court could , under section CARDINAL , impose a fine on it and might itself give a ruling on the right or obligation in question .", "LAW was repealed and replaced by LAW DATE on ORG ( \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) which entered into force on DATE . LAW of LAW contains provisions analogous to section CARDINAL of LAW . It provides that administrative courts examine complaints of inactivity on the part of authorities obliged to issue an administrative decision or to carry out enforcement proceedings . Under section CARDINAL , if a complaint is wellfounded , an administrative court shall oblige the authority concerned to issue a decision , to perform a specific act , or to confirm , declare , or recognise a right or obligation provided for by law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
