CARDINAL of the fingers of her left hand were amputated .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE in GPE PERSON gave birth to her third child , PERSON , a daughter . As she still suffered from epilepsy , she could not take care of the baby , who was placed in a home in GPE , where she has remained ever since . In a written declaration dated DATE , a GPE specialist in internal medicine stated that a return to GPE would be impossible for PERSON and might even prove fatal to her , given her serious medical condition .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the Minister for Refugees rejected PERSON application for political asylum , on the ground that he had not been able to establish that he personally had been a victim of persecution , as the general situation of the NORP population in GPE was not in itself sufficient to justify granting political asylum . He went on to say that , according to reliable sources , no measures were being taken by the ORG authorities against former members of the ORG , and ordered the applicant to leave GPE by DATE , failing which he would be deported .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the above decision to ORG and ORG . He asserted that the collective repression of NORP in GPE , of which he himself had been a victim , in itself justified granting political asylum . In addition , at the time when he had fled to GPE all political parties had been proscribed and their members - especially the members of left - wing parties like the FAC - were being prosecuted . He could not therefore be required to return to GPE , and this would be in breach of LAW ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ) informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that they supported Mr G\u00fcl \u2019s request for a residence permit ( GPE ) on humanitarian grounds in respect of himself , his wife and his daughter PERSON .", "In view of the length of time PERSON had been living in GPE and his wife \u2019s precarious state of health , the police considered that the conditions for the issue of such a permit laid down in LAW ( f ) of ORG ( \" the ORG \" - see paragraph DATE below ) had been satisfied . The final decision to grant a residence permit was given by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG As ORG and ORG had informed PERSON that his application for political asylum had only very limited prospects of success on appeal , he withdrew it . The authorities took formal note of this on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE Mr G\u00fcl asked ORG for permission to bring to GPE his CARDINAL sons , GPE and Ersin , who had remained in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected Mr G\u00fcl \u2019s request , on the ground that the conditions for family reunion had not been satisfied ( LAW paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Firstly , the PERSON family \u2019s flat did not conform to the standards laid down and , secondly , the applicant did not have sufficient means to provide for his family . In any event , GPE was already DATE and was therefore ineligible for a residence permit under the rules governing family reunion .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision to the ORG cantonal government ( NORP ) . He argued that the residence permit issued to him and his wife under LAW ( f ) of the ORG should have been extended to include his CARDINAL sons , as his personal circumstances made it an extremely serious case . Since it was impossible to return to GPE because of his wife \u2019s precarious state of health and the length of time he had lived abroad , the family could be brought back together only in GPE . Both Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL) of LAW , guaranteeing the right to respect for family life , and LAW on the Rights of the PERSON gave the QUANTITY boys the right to join their parents in GPE . If the cantonal government were nevertheless to rely on the provisions of Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the ORG ( see paragraph DATE below ) on family reunion , the younger son , Ersin , could and should be permitted to exercise that right . There was enough room for him in the family \u2019s flat and PERSON financial resources were sufficient to provide for his family .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the ORG cantonal government dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It pointed out that under section CARDINAL of ORG ( \" the RSAA \" - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) the question whether to grant a residence permit ( GPE ) or settlement permit ( Niederlassungsbewilligung ) was determined by the competent cantonal authorities with unfettered discretion ( nach freiem GPE ) , having regard to the relevant statutory provisions and international agreements . In that connection , the authorities had to take account of the country \u2019s moral and economic interests , and of the degree of immigrant penetration ( PERSON ) .", "The cantonal government then considered whether PERSON CARDINAL sons could rely on a right to obtain permission to reside in GPE ( PERSON ) on the basis of the statutory provisions , as the agreement on settlement concluded by GPE and GPE on DATE did not confer such a right .", "Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) a minor did not have such a right unless his parent was in possession of a settlement permit . As PERSON and PERSON only had a residence permit , they could not rely on that provision in order to assert a right to family reunion . As for the guarantees set forth in LAW article CARDINAL) of the LAW , only NORP nationals or persons in possession of a settlement permit could rely on these ; PERSON and PERSON fell into neither of those categories .", "Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the ORG ( see paragraph DATE below ) did not confer a right but merely set out the minimum conditions to be satisfied before family reunion could be authorised . The cantonal authorities had the final say on the matter , and in reaching their decision they had unfettered discretion . It being established that the provisions concerned could only apply , if at all , to the minor son , Ersin , the cantonal government listed the minimum conditions which Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the OLNA ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) required to be satisfied by a foreigner living in GPE before family reunion could be authorised , namely :", "( a ) his residence and , where relevant , his gainful employment should appear to be sufficiently stable ;", "( b ) he should live with his family and occupy accommodation suitable for that purpose ;", "( c ) he should have sufficient means to support his family ;", "and", "( d ) firm arrangements should have been made for the care of any children who still needed their GPE presence .", "The cantonal government did not determine points ( a ) and ( b ) , but carefully considered points ( c ) and ( d ) , on which it gave the following decision :", "\" ( c ) The calculations made by ORG and the cantonal government \u2019s legal service , which investigated the case , show that PERSON has not satisfied the condition laid down in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) of the ORG . He does not have sufficient means to support his family during their residence in GPE . According to the reference calculation , PERSON should have a DATE net income of MONEY ( CHF ) if he is not to fall below the minimum standard of living . That figure is derived from the base rates used by the cantonal social security office for assessing the likelihood of reliance on social security , which are on the whole identical with the base rates adopted by ORG for the calculation of financial support . These base rates are used to establish the DATE living expenses of the foreigner concerned and the members of his family seeking to join him , which have to be covered by his income . This must be sufficient to provide not only the basic necessities of life but also a minimum standard of living . In this way the legitimate interest of the public authorities in preventing the family from becoming a burden on the social security services is also taken into account .", "PERSON net DATE income is CHF MONEY , which falls CHF CARDINAL short of the amount required for the minimum standard of living as calculated by the social security services . The cost of keeping the youngest child , PERSON , in a children \u2019s home has not been taken into account , as it is not known who pays for this . The calculation of income is based on pay - slips from DATE , the latest available . On DATE ORG sent ORG a medical certificate stating that PERSON was PERCENT unfit for work and would remain so for a period that it was not possible to determine . On enquiry being made , it was confirmed in a medical certificate dated DATE that PERSON had suffered from PERCENT incapacity since DATE and would remain unfit for work for the foreseeable future . The GPE municipal social security services stated in a letter of CARDINAL DATE that PERSON would have to have several operations and that for the time being he was waiting to be awarded an invalidity pension . For DATE alone the social security services have paid the G\u00fcl family CHF CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , and the family will remain dependent on social security payments . In DATE PERSON stated during a personal interview with the subordinate authority ( PERSON ) that his family was at that time entirely dependent on social security payments . He therefore has no other source of income . At present the social security services are paying the PERSON family the amount needed by a CARDINAL - person family , but no more . The social security services can not be expected to provide for children arriving from abroad when it is known in advance that they will have to support them . Nor can PERSON support his other children from his own resources . For that reason alone the application for family reunion must be refused .", "( d ) Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( d ) also requires firm arrangements to be made for the care of children . But PERSON , for reasons connected with her illness , is not mentally or physically capable of keeping her daughter PERSON with her and looking after her . That is why PERSON has been brought up in the \" PERSON \" children \u2019s home in ORG , where she is to remain . It follows that if PERSON and PERSON DATE son Ersin joined the family , it is not at all certain that firm arrangements could be made for his care . He too would presumably have to be brought up in a children \u2019s home , which is not the aim of family reunion . A medical certificate dated DATE states that PERSON is suffering from a serious illness which makes it necessary for her to have constant medical supervision and treatment . She might even need to go into hospital again . That prospect makes it impossible to consider that firm arrangements have been made for the child \u2019s care as the Order requires . \"", "The cantonal government went on to say that residence permits issued on humanitarian grounds under LAW ( f ) of the ORG could not in addition confer on the recipients a right to family reunion . In order to ensure equal treatment for all aliens not having the right to reside in GPE , such reunion could take place only under LAW seq . of the OLNA .", "Lastly , the cantonal government considered the situation of the younger boy from the standpoint of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , announcing its decision in the following terms :", "\" Ersin G\u00fcl is CARDINAL . It must be determined whether his entry into GPE would be in accordance with LAW , which requires an ` important reason\u2019 that is lacking in this case . There is no special reason for treating LOC differently from other children wishing to rejoin their families in respect of whom the conditions laid down in Articles QUANTITY et seq . of the ORG have not been satisfied . Another reason for refusing to admit him to GPE is the fact that Ersin and PERSON would be separated . Ersin has lived with GPE since birth . On the other hand , he has been separated from his father and mother for DATE and DATE respectively . Having regard to the child \u2019s welfare , which plays an important role in family reunion cases , the question arises , at the very least , whether it is reasonable to separate him from his brother and the environment he is used to in order to bring him to live with his mother , who is seriously ill and unable to keep him with her or look after him , and his father , who went away to GPE DATE after ORG birth , which means that he hardly knows him . In view of all the circumstances , and having regard to the child \u2019s welfare , the cantonal government considers that PERSON should not be authorised to join his parents in GPE . In any case , there is no important reason within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of the ORG which requires him to be admitted to GPE . \"", "The cantonal government concluded that PERSON had not satisfied the conditions laid down for family reunion and that his children could not rely on LAW ( f ) or LAW ORG either in order to come to GPE to join him .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant lodged an administrative - law appeal with ORG . He repeated his previous arguments ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and added that , because of the \" special circumstances \" , LAW article CARDINAL) of the ORG gave his sons the right to obtain permission to reside in GPE . The earlier issue of a residence permit on humanitarian grounds to himself , his wife and his daughter had been based on the finding that a return to GPE was impossible , as it would put the health of his wife and daughter seriously at risk . PERSON argued that the same considerations which had prevailed in the decision to grant that residence permit should prevent any withdrawal thereof , which would be tantamount to subjecting PERSON , whose state of health was still causing concern , to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to LAW . The residence permit issued to PERSON and PERSON on humanitarian grounds was therefore the equivalent of a settlement permit , and it followed that they had the right to family reunion , which could only take place in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment of DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal inadmissible . It pointed out that , pursuant to section CARDINAL ( b ) ( CARDINAL ) of ORG , an administrative - law appeal in an immigration - control case was inadmissible if it concerned the issue or refusal of permits to which federal legislation conferred no entitlement . Like the cantonal government , ORG found that neither section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the RSAA nor LAW article CARDINAL) of the LAW conferred such a right on an alien resident outside GPE whose parent living in GPE had only a residence permit , as PERSON did . In particular , Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL) of the ORG could be relied on only by a person who had the right of abode in GPE either by virtue of his NORP nationality or by virtue of a settlement permit . The court gave this ruling in the following terms :", "\" DATE ( article CARDINAL) of ORG guarantees the right to respect for family life . In certain circumstances the right to be issued with a residence permit can be deduced from this ( see ORG [ Judgments of ORG ] CARDINAL Ib CARDINAL at CARDINAL , CARDINAL at c ; CARDINAL Ib CARDINAL at CARDINAL ; CARDINAL Ib CARDINAL at CARDINAL ) , so that LAW article CARDINAL) may be breached where an alien whose family lives in GPE is refused leave to enter the country . According to ORG established case - law , however , a breach can occur only where the family members living in GPE themselves possess a well - established right of abode ( Anwesenheitsrecht ) . For that purpose , it is in principle necessary to have NORP nationality or possess a settlement permit ( see ORG CARDINAL Ib CARDINAL at CARDINAL ; CARDINAL Ib CARDINAL at CARDINAL ) . A mere residence permit is at any rate not sufficient unless it is based on a firmly established right ( see ATF CARDINAL Ib CARDINAL at CARDINAL ) , as ORG has held in many unpublished judgments ( most recently in the judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON , at CARDINAL ) ... That is , moreover , consistent with the new provisions on the legal status of aliens having family members in GPE ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG , as amended on DATE , which came into force on DATE ) . Under the Act the right to family reunion presupposes a firmly established right of abode , as pointed out above ( at CARDINAL ) . Given that the legislature \u2019s intention in adopting the amendment in question was precisely to take account of LAW article CARDINAL) of ORG GPE [ ORG ] DATE III , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , particularly pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , there is no reason , when that provision ( article CARDINAL) of the ORG is invoked with regard to recognition of legal rights in the matter of residence permits , to go beyond what the LAW itself expressly provides ( see ORG unpublished judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON , at CARDINAL ) . \"", "ORG also emphasised the differences between settlement permits and residence permits , stating :", "\" Unlike settlement permits , which are issued for an indefinite period ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG hereinafter the ORG ) , residence permits are always subject to a time - limit ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG ) . Whatever the reason for granting the first residence permit , an alien must therefore allow for the possibility that his permit will not be renewed . There could be many reasons for this , including , for example , police , economic or demographic considerations . Although the alien \u2019s personal circumstances have to be taken into account in the inquiry into the proportionality of the decision not to renew , that does not mean that the alien is on that account entitled to have his residence permit renewed .", "The above statement of the law also applies to residence permits issued on humanitarian grounds . The only effect of a finding that a case is an extremely serious one within the meaning of LAW ( f ) of ORG of DATE ( hereinafter ORG ) is to exclude the alien concerned from the quotas laid down in that Order ; it does not imply the existence of a right to a residence permit . The Aliens Police prefer to remain free to decide when such a permit should be issued ( see ORG CARDINAL Ib CARDINAL at CARDINAL ) . In addition , the possibility can not be ruled out that the particular circumstances which justified the issue of a residence permit on humanitarian grounds will subsequently cease to exist , or lose their significance to such an extent that not only will there no longer be any reason to exclude the person concerned from the quotas , but even renewal of the residence permit will no longer be justified . Moreover , it is apparent from the rule established in LAW para . CARDINAL of the ORG that the conditions required for a finding that the case is an extremely serious one may subsequently cease to exist ( see the unpublished judgment of DATE in the case of P. , at CARDINAL ) . The question whether the case is of this type is therefore entirely separate from the question whether the person concerned has the right to obtain permission to reside in GPE by virtue of DATE ( article CARDINAL) of ORG ( see ORG CARDINAL Ib CARDINAL) .", "Furthermore , in the instant case the possibility can not be entirely ruled out that in the future the medical or other reasons which led the authorities to grant the residence permit will lose their significance , or that new grounds justifying a refusal to renew the permit will become apparent . The appellant can therefore not deduce from the fact that he is authorised to reside in GPE any right to the issue of a residence permit for his sons . \"", "ORG went on to say that the question how the ORG should be applied to the issue of permits was not one it had to examine in connection with the administrative - law appeal , as the cantonal government had already looked into the question whether the G\u00fcls\u2019 younger son could be issued with a residence permit under LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG Ersin has lived in GPE since his birth , at first in GPE until DATE ( with his mother until DATE ) , and then in GPE .", "According to the Government , he is at present living , as is his grandfather , with the family of his elder brother PERSON , and has been visited several times by his father .", "The applicant maintained that Ersin frequently moved from CARDINAL home to another and spent DATE staying with various NORP families who used to live in the village where he was born , including the family of his elder brother . Owing to his grandfather \u2019s limited financial resources and the distance between the homes of some of these families and the school it was not possible for the boy to attend school on a regular basis .", "As is evidenced by an article which appeared in the NORP newspaper GPE on DATE , PERSON and PERSON visited their son in GPE in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL .
