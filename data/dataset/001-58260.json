In the agreement the neighbour , who had only a life interest in the building he occupied , undertook to block the view from his patio over the applicant \u2019s property within DATE .", "CARDINAL . When , on DATE , that period expired without the neighbour having carried out his undertaking , the applicant applied to ORG for enforcement of the agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court gave judgment for the applicant and allowed the defendant an additional period of DATE to perform the undertakings made in the agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defendant informed ORG that as he was not the owner of the building he occupied , he could not carry out the works needed to fulfil the terms of the agreement . On DATE the applicant renewed her application , stating that the defendant had not brought any action to have the agreement in question set aside under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision ( auto ) of CARDINAL DATE the deputy judge of ORG ( not the same judge as before ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s application and held that the agreement was void on the ground that the neighbour , who was merely a life tenant , could not carry out the works needed to block the view without the consent of the reversioner , since they would change the appearance and structure of the building . The judge added that there was nothing to prevent an agreement being concluded with the person who had the necessary capacity .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s allegation that the defendant had not raised the nullity of the agreement within the prescribed time ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the judge held that LAW covered only cases in which the actual conclusion of the agreement had not complied with the conditions or formalities laid down by law , and not defects such as to negate a consensus ad idem . The agreement was defective because CARDINAL of the parties had no capacity to conclude such an agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the registrar of ORG ordered that the decision should be served at the applicant \u2019s home in the village of GPE , QUANTITY from Aoiz .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the magistrate at ORG ( under whose jurisdiction the village of GPE came ) recorded that the applicant was not at her home at GPE and informed the registry at ORG that her husband , who was at the same time her lawyer , had requested by telephone that the decision should be served at the applicant \u2019s home in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision in question was served on the defendant .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( QUANTITY from GPE ) ordered that the decision should be served at the applicant \u2019s home in GPE ; on DATE the decision was at last served on the applicant in the person of her domestic help , since she herself was out at the time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a reposici\u00f3n application and , in the alternative , an ordinary appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE with the registry of the duty court in GPE , which initially stamped the document . Noticing , however , that the application should have been lodged at ORG , the head of the registry crossed out the stamp , thereby invalidating it .", "On DATE , the applicant sent , by registered letter with advice of delivery , the same reposici\u00f3n application and , in the alternative , an ordinary appeal to ORG .

On DATE the applicant sent to ORG , by registered letter with advice of delivery , a reposici\u00f3n application against the aforementioned decision and this was received at the registry on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Instance dismissed the application and upheld the impugned decision , on the ground that the application against the decision of DATE should have been registered at the court registry within the prescribed period of DATE , that is to say on DATE at the latest . The court also noted that the legislation on administrative matters cited by the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was not applicable in the case as proceedings in the ordinary courts were governed by LAW and LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . Lastly , the Court held that allowing an application to be lodged by post would undermine \u201c judicial authenticity \u201d , thereby breaching the principle of legal certainty , inasmuch as a post office ( an administrative entity ) could not be equated with a judicial body .", "As to the ordinary appeal , the court added that it could not be lodged until the reposici\u00f3n application had been determined and not at the same time as that application , and that it was accordingly pointless to consider whether it had been lodged timeously .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG , which dismissed it in a decision ( auto ) of DATE , emphasising that applications had to be made to the appropriate court or to the duty judge of the same town , particularly where the person making it was assisted by counsel .", "CARDINAL .
