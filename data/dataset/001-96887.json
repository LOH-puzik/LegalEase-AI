The order laid down the conditions which the candidates for the post had to fulfil , and the test and the interview which they had to pass . The competition announcement was published on DATE .", "On DATE the Minister appointed a commission to make a preselection of the candidates . On DATE , having earlier laid down the manner in which the test and the interview were to be conducted , he appointed another commission to conduct those .", "The applicant applied for the post . She and CARDINAL other candidates were pre - selected . The CARDINAL of them took part in the test and the interview . On DATE the applicant was informed that she had been ranked second . The candidate ranked fist was PERSON The Minister then issued a decision validating the results of the competition . The applicant objected to this decision but did not receive a reply .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an application for judicial review of the Minister \u2019s decision with ORG . She argued that Dr PERSON did not meet all the criteria laid down in the order of DATE , because he had not had TIME of training in medical management .", "In a decision of DATE ( \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , PERSON , V \u043e. ) a threemember panel of ORG declared the application inadmissible . After analysing the matter in some detail , it found that the competition had not been governed by the special rules applicable to some other medical posts , but by the general provisions of the Labour Code relating to competitions . In competitions governed by LAW the Minister acted in a capacity of an employer , not as an administrative authority . Therefore , his decisions relating to the competition were not administrative decisions amenable to judicial scrutiny . This applied a fortiori to the commission which had organised the competition . The applicant could challenge the manner in which the competition had been conducted by means of a civil claim : she could seek a declaration that the contractual relationship between the Minister and PERSON had not come into existence because the competition had been tainted by irregularities .", "CARDINAL judge dissented . He disputed the conclusion that the competition had been governed by the general provisions of LAW and not by special rules . However , even assuming that this had been so , in his view , by taking part in the competition the applicant had sought to exercise her right to work , recognised by LAW . Therefore , the refusal to appoint her to the desired post had to have a lawful basis . Such basis could be found in the fact that she had not been ranked first . However , this basis was valid only if the competition had been conducted lawfully . If it was tainted by irregularities , each candidate after the first was injured in the exercise of his labour rights , whereas those rights deserved protection from the courts . Since , in view of the former ORG and ORG caselaw ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) , the applicant would be unlikely to obtain such protection from the civil courts , as suggested by the majority , she was entitled to obtain it from the administrative courts , in order not to be faced with a denial of justice .", "The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal on points of law was rejected by a fivemember panel of ORG on DATE ( \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u044e\u043d\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , PERSON , \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0432 ) . The court fully agreed with the threemember panel \u2019s reasoning , and went on to say that the dissenting judge \u2019s view that the competition had not been governed by LAW was erroneous , as was his view that the Minister \u2019s decisions in connection with employment competitions were subject to review by the administrative courts . Those decisions did not amount to an exercise of public powers affecting the rights of others , and were therefore not administrative decisions amenable to judicial scrutiny .", "On DATE the applicant brought a civil claim against ORG , seeking a declaration that the competition had been tainted by irregularities and that the resulting employment agreement between ORG and Dr PERSON was unlawful . However , on DATE the ORG discontinued the proceedings . On appeal , its decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal on points of law was rejected by ORG on DATE ( \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0447. \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u0433. , ORG , ORG \u0433. \u043e. ) . The court found that her claim did not concern an employment dispute , because such disputes were only those between the person who had come first in the competition and the employer . The remaining candidates did not have an employment relationship with the employer . The actions carried out by the employer during a competition were simply preliminary steps for the creation of an employment relationship ; they could not be challenged before the courts but merely before the employer whose decision was final . The court went on to say that the applicant did not have the requisite legal interest to seek a declaration that the employment of the person who had won the competition was unlawful . Such a declaration would have no impact on her legal sphere , because she could not expect to be employed unless the person ranked first failed to take up his or her duties .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Regulations on the organisation and the operations of ORG \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449 ) issued by ORG , provides that the ORG \u2019s director is employed on the basis of a competition conducted in line with the provisions of LOC .", "The manner in which employment competitions are to be conducted is governed by LAW to CARDINAL of the DATE LAW .", "LAW provides that the posts to be filled by means of a competition must be set forth in a statute or a statutory instrument , or a decision of the employer . LAW stipulates that those posts can be filled only by means of a competition .", "Article CARDINAL specifies the contents of the competition notice and the manner in which it should be published , as well as the rights of the candidates to get acquainted with the job description of the advertised post .", "Candidates are admitted to the competition by a commission appointed by the employer ( LAW ) . Those who are not allowed to take part in the competition must be informed in writing about the reasons for that ; they may object before the employer , who rules on the matter by means of a final decision ( LAW ) . Another commission then conducts the competition ( LAW ) , by assessing the qualities of the candidates and ranking only those who have successfully passed the tests ( LAW ) .
