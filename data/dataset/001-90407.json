At the material time , in DATE and DATE , he was registered as being domiciled at ORG , in the neighbourhood of ORG , a village in the north - western corner of GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG were represented by their Agent , Mr ORG , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The present application has its background in criminal proceeding brought against the applicant on account of his having fished lumpfish on certain dates in DATE and DATE in the net zone of the NORP farm in GPE in the western part of GPE . At the time he was CARDINAL of CARDINAL co - owners of the farm . His sister , CARDINAL brothers \u2013 including PERSON ( GHG ) - and the applicant each owned PERCENT of the property ; CARDINAL was owned by CARDINAL other individuals . The applicant and his siblings had acquired their shares in the property as a result of a gift from their father , PERSON , according to a Deed of Transfer to this effect dated DATE .", "ORG at CARDINAL time owned the vessel ORG , a boat which had been allocated a catch permit for lumpfish on the basis of LAW and the Regulation applying to such permits . ORG had used the boat ORG for catching lumpfish since DATE , and on DATE a catch permit for lumpfish was issued in respect of the vessel under the new system when LAW came into force . On DATE this catch permit for lumpfish was transferred from ORG DATE to another boat , ORG DATE ) , also owned by ORG . On DATE , he sold the D\u00edva to the company ORG , together with all its fishing permits ; in addition , it was stated specifically that all the boat \u2019s catch experience was to be the property of the purchaser . The purchase price was ORG CARDINAL . The Deed of Transfer identified LAW as the owner of all the share capital in ORG .", "The lumpfish catch permit in question was assigned yet again on DATE , and is currently attached to the boat PERSON DATE ( DATE ) , which is also owned by ORG \u2019s company ORG .", "In DATE the applicant was working in PERSON . As the volume of his work there declined and his income dropped , he acquired a new QUANTITY long boat and started fishing for lumpfish from the LOC farm in DATE .", "On DATE a check by fisheries inspectors of the fish - processing plant PERSON ehf . in PERSON revealed entries in the company \u2019s weight records showing that the boat ORG had landed QUANTITY of lumpfish roes in DATE and DATE , which the processing plant had purchased from it . On DATE , the fisheries inspectors visited the applicant at ORG . It was then found that the boat , ORG , which belonged to the applicant \u2019s father , lay upside down on dry land , and had been replaced by the plastic boat that the applicant had bought in DATE .", "On DATE , the LOC Commissioner issued an indictment against the applicant for violations of the fisheries legislation by having , on specified dates in DATE and DATE , caught lumpfish from his unregistered boat without a general commercial fishing permit and without a permit to catch lumpfish ; these catches of lumpfish produced QUANTITY of lumpfish roes , which he had sold to PERSON ehf . in PERSON , in violation of section CARDINAL of LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of the Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on Fishing in GPE \u2019s GPE ( hereinafter \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) and section CARDINAL of Regulation No . CARDINAL on LOC . ORG requested that the applicant be sentenced for these violations and be made to suffer confiscation of the proceeds obtained through them .", "The applicant , for his part , maintained that the owners of land adjacent to the sea had an exclusive right to fish lumpfish within the net zone as it was an inseparable part of the farm and the owners had not been deprived of their property rights in the net zone . In his view , the provision concerning fisheries jurisdiction ( section CARDINAL of GPE in GPE \u2019s Fisheries Jurisdiction , No . CARDINAL , hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) extending from the water \u2019s edge to the outer limits of the economic zone ought to be interpreted with reference to the rights that already existed and which had not been overruled despite a definition in ordinary legislation . LAW ought to be interpreted with consideration being given to the more extensive rights of other parties which were valid before the LAW took effect ; otherwise , it would have been necessary to state that the LAW was intended to prevail over rights of ownership that were protected under LAW .", "It was undisputed that on the dates indicated in the indictment the applicant had been fishing lumpfish without a permit within the net zone of the LOC farm . Nor was it disputed that he was co - owner of the farm and that he had obtained the permission of other co - owners to fish lumpfish within the net zone of the farm .", "On DATE the LOC ORG convicted the applicant of the offences and sentenced him to pay a fine of ORG CARDINAL to the ORG , failing which he was to serve CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment . It further ordered the confiscation of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL corresponding to the value of the QUANTITY lumpfish that the applicant had caught . In addition , he was ordered to pay the entirety of the court costs .", "ORG judgment contained the following reasons :", "\u201c In the absence of any proof to the contrary , the accused \u2019s assertion that he caught all the lumpfish within the net zone of the property in question will be used as a basis for this judgment .", "Ever since ancient times , there have been legal provisions on the rights of landowners to make catches within net zones in GPE . PERSON [ the ancient law code of GPE ] states that all men have the right to catch without incurring a penalty outside the net zone , the outermost boundary of the net zone being where a seal - net , from mainland or skerry , touches the bottom at a depth of CARDINAL meshes with the floats on the surface at low tide , with the footline touching bottom . LAW in the PERSON law code [ from DATE ] stated that all men had the right to catch without incurring a penalty outside the net zone , the outermost boundary of the net zone being where a seal - net touched bottom at a depth of CARDINAL meshes with the floats on the surface .", "The most recent provisions in NORP law regarding net zones are to be found in Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL , the outermost boundary of the net zone means , for the purposes of the LAW , QUANTITY out from the shore of a lake to which a property is adjacent , and the sea - floor QUANTITY out from the high - water mark of a property during DATE tides . Net zones are defined in the same way in LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Its section CARDINAL states that only landowners have the right to hunt animals on their land . Under the same article , persons other than the landowners do not have the right to hunt animals in GPE \u2019s economic zone except outside the net zones .", "A judgment by ORG , reported in ORG DATE p. CARDINAL , describes how section CARDINAL of the Decree on Hunting issued in DATE stated that from that time forth , only landowners in GPE had the right to hunt animals and birds unless otherwise stated in the Decree . Furthermore , section CARDINAL stated that all statutory articles on fishing and whaling that were not amended by the Decree were to remain unchanged for the time being . The ORG took the view that it could not be considered that the provisions of section CARDINAL of the Decree , on the landowners\u2019 right to make catches QUANTITY out to sea from the high - water mark at DATE tides , involved a different and more ample right for the landowners regarding catches than the right provided for in section CARDINAL of the Decree .", "The same judgment went on to say that it could not be seen , from the ancient laws , that net zones in the sea had been regarded as being subject to the same authority of ownership by land owners as the land above them . Nor had the land owners , under the legislation of recent times , been granted all the same ownership rights over net zones in the sea that they enjoyed regarding the properties that were adjacent to them . Under legislation postdating the aforementioned Decree , property owners had not been unequivocally granted an exclusive right to catch marine fish in net zones based on a distance out from the high - water mark during DATE tides . Nor had the provisions of the LAW concerning the definition of net zones based on the depth of the sea been repealed by any act of the legislature , though they were not incorporated in the DATE edition , or subsequent editions , of the statute book .", "Although it is therefore not clear in law whether land owners possess all the same rights in the net zones as they do on the land above them , and whether their right to catch marine fish should be based on a distance out from the land or on the depth of the sea , it must be considered that it is not evident that the accused caught lumpfish at a greater depth than is specified in LAW in the PERSON . In this judgment , the provision of that LAW stating that the landowner owns all fishing rights in the net zone and catch rights on the beach will be taken as a basis .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , the marine area from the water \u2019s edge to the outer limits of NORP s economic zone is considered as constituting its fisheries jurisdiction . Thus , the net zone is included in the fisheries jurisdiction . The same definition can be found in LAW No . CARDINAL .", "Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW states that its aim is to promote the prosperity and efficient utilisation of the economically exploited stocks within GPE \u2019s fisheries jurisdiction and so to ensure firm employment and human settlement in the country . The same aim on the part of the legislature can be found in LAW No . GPE , which also states that the commercially exploited stocks in NORP waters are the common property of the NORP people .", "Notwithstanding the aforementioned rights of landowners in the net zone , and taking into account ORG judgment in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( Court Reports CARDINAL p. CARDINAL ) , the ORG is not able to concur with the view that the legislature may not protect the commercially exploited stocks in the fisheries jurisdiction and promote their efficient utilisation by prohibiting landowners from making catches from these stocks , both within the net zone and outside it , except with special permits . The accused , who had the permission of the landowner to catch lumpfish within the net zone , was therefore nevertheless obliged to respect the prohibition contained in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW on the catching of lumpfish without a special permit from ORG . LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on LOC states that the condition for obtaining a special permit is the possession of a commercial fishing permit .", "Accordingly , the accused violated the provisions of LAW . MONEY , which prohibits fishing for commercial purposes off GPE \u2019s coasts by persons other than those who have received a general fishing permit , and has incurred punishment under LAW of the same LAW ( see section CARDINAL of Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , his actions constitute a violation of LAW CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL ( see section CARDINAL ) of the Regulation No . CARDINAL ( see section CARDINAL of LAW ) . \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG , which on DATE upheld ORG judgment in extenso and ordered the applicant to pay the entirety of the legal costs in the appeal .", "NORP law concerning the rights of landowners in respect of the catching or hunting of fish , birds , whales and seals and ownership of driftwood in their net zones may be found in the provisions set out below ( the different legislative definitions of the net zone boundaries are not in issue in the present case ) .", "The ancient NORP law code , PERSON , dating from CARDINAL , stated in LAW of LAW :", "\u201c The landowner shall also own [ a whale in which a missile or a marked harpoon is fixed ... ] and all drift materials , and all those whales which swim ashore fleeing from men and all catches in the net zone and on the beach . \u201d", "The Decree on Hunting in GPE of DATE provided :", "Article CARDINAL", "Landowners in GPE shall henceforth own exclusive rights to catch animals [ and birds ] unless other provisions are made in this Decree . Furthermore , the catch rights they have acquired by law outside their properties shall remain completely intact .", "Article CARDINAL", "... the owner shall own the right to make catches in an area extending QUANTITY out into the sea from the low spring tide mark ; this is his net zone", "Under LAW , hunting animals on the land properties of other persons without their permission , or making catches in their net zones , is a criminal offence that is punishable by a fine .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of Act No . CARDINAL on ORG and Wild Mammals read :", "\u201c All NORP citizens , and also foreign nationals who are domiciled in GPE , may hunt animals on common land , on pastureland lying outside the property boundaries of legally - defined farms , providing that no one is able to demonstrate his right of ownership over them , and also in GPE \u2019s economic zone outside the net zones of land properties . They shall have obtained licences for this purpose under LAW and regulations issued hereunder .", "Landowners shall have an exclusive right to hunt animals on their properties and dispose of such rights unless other provisions are made in law . \u201d", "According to the Government , the above - mentioned provisions , in particular that of PERSON , had been interpreted to the effect that ownership of the net zone in the sea conferred on the landowner an exclusive right to make catches of all types , including fish . However , in so far as relevant for the present case , such rights were restricted by the statutory provisions referred to below .", "LAW , No .

Regulation No . CARDINAL of DATE , on catches of lumpfish , contains provisions on lumpfish fishing in GPE , specifying what vessels will qualify for lumpfish catch permits . The issue of permits has been limited for DATE , and is restricted to those parties who made catches during DATE . It should be pointed out here that marine biologists have not proposed that lumpfish catches be limited ; on the other hand , it has been felt that there is reason to impose limits on these catches , first and foremost because the number of small fishing boats is now so great that without limits , catches could get completely out of control in a short time . In this context , attention must also be given to conditions on the market and the right of those persons who have engaged in catches of this species and as a result of doing so have smaller quotas in other fish species . The Regulation on catches of lumpfish was issued under the second paragraph of LAW ; here it is proposed that it be stated clearly that these catches are to be subject to permits , and also that provisions be laid down authorising the Minister to control these matters in the way that this has been done up to now . \u201d", "The Regulation on lumpfish catches , No .
