NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in ORG . He was represented before the ORG by Mr A. Campagna , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant ( a journalist who manages a website , S ) was heard under oath as a witness , without the assistance of a lawyer , by an investigating judge . The questioning was in connection with a series of allegedly defamatory articles published on the website about a journalist and a politician , who had complained to the police on DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date a certain PERSON was questioned by the investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge put the applicant \u2019s name on the list as a suspect and issued a \u201c judicial notice \u201d , informing him of the charges against him being investigated ( a step required by GPE law ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was again questioned by the investigating judge , this time as a person subject to investigation , and he therefore had the assistance of a lawyer . The investigation was concluded on DATE and a bill of indictment was filed against the applicant on charges of insult , defamation and libel in connection with the abovementioned articles .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on an unspecified date before he became aware of the indictment , he had asked that he and his lawyer be allowed to reexamine C. The request was ignored since the bill of indictment had already been issued .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was found guilty of the charges . He was fined MONEY ( ORG ) and ordered to pay damages that had still to be quantified .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on the merits and further argued that the investigating judge had purposely delayed putting his name on the list of suspects , which leads to the issuing of a judicial notice , in order to deny him his defence rights , contrary to LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . He noted that the judge had only filed the notice after C. \u2019s testimony ( which had then been repeated at the trial ) .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , by a judgment of DATE , the applicant was acquitted of the charges relating to the politician but found guilty of insulting and libelling the journalist . His fine was reduced to LAW .", "CARDINAL . In respect of his procedural complaints , the court of appeal considered that all the evidence had been adduced at trial and had thus been legitimate . It further noted that being put late on the list of suspects ( which is the basis for a judicial notice being issued within DATE ) and the collection of evidence in relation to an \u201c indagato sostanziale \u201d , against whom such a notice has not yet been filed , could not nullify the actions in question . Indeed , the decision as to when to issue such a notice was a matter of judicial discretion and at worst could only entail disciplinary proceedings against the judge concerned in cases of dolo or culpa grave . The court noted that in the case in question the applicant had repeated his statements in the presence of a lawyer and they had thus been totally legitimate .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , there had been no infringement of the rights of the defence and the earlier questioning of the applicant had allowed him to become aware of the proceedings against the website he was managing . In any event , the court of appeal considered that the applicant had failed to specify which rights had been breached by the late filing of the judicial notice .", "CARDINAL . Law no .
