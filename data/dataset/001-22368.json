By instituting a national levy to provide compensation in the form of an advance on the sums owed to NORP nationals by ORG for the dispossession of their property , by making the share of the compensation fund apportioned to each dispossessed person proportional to the value of the property which he or she had lost and by imposing a general limit on the amount of that share in the light of the resources which the nation could reasonably devote to it , the aforementioned statutes do not contain any provision that is incompatible with GPE \u2019s international obligations under , on the one hand , LAW No .
