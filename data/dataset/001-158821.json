LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Administrative proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Egidijus K\u016bris;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant owned a QUANTITY plot of land in the village of PERSON ( PERSON region ) . In DATE he submitted a request to the local authorities to change the classification of the land from agricultural to residential use . In accordance with the domestic law , such a request had first to be granted by the municipal council and then approved by the county administration .", "CARDINAL . ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request and prepared a detailed area plan ( detalusis planas ) ( hereinafter \u201c the plan \u201d ) . The plan was subsequently submitted for approval to ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . However , on DATE the ORG refused to approve the plan on the ground that it had not been prepared in accordance with the domestic laws governing the planning process .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a complaint to ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , which was the competent institution for out - of - court settlement of disputes arising from the planning process . On DATE the ORG held that the ORG \u2019s refusal to approve the plan had been unfounded .", "CARDINAL . After the ORG \u2019s decision , ORG re - submitted the plan to the ORG . However , on DATE the ORG informed the council and the applicant that it would not review its previous decision to refuse approval .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG notified the ORG that its refusal to approve the plan had been unfounded and urged it to review that decision . It appears that the ORG did not take any action in that respect .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged a claim with ORG . He asked the court to order the ORG to approve the plan . Following the court \u2019s suggestion , in DATE the applicant added a request to annul the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims . The court held that county administration \u2019s decisions on approval of detailed area plans were valid for DATE after their adoption . If the plan had not been adopted within that time , the decision became invalid and the plan had to be re - submitted for approval . Therefore , the court found that the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE was no longer valid and could not have any effect on the applicant \u2019s situation . The court stated that it had no competence to examine the lawfulness of an invalid act and dismissed the claim . It also held that , as a result , there was no need to examine the applicant \u2019s remaining claims .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment . He complained , inter alia , that the first instance court had not examined his original request \u2013 to order the ORG to approve the plan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s appeal and returned the case for re - examination by the firstinstance court . ORG noted that when a county administration refused to approve a detailed area plan , that plan could be re - submitted only after the errors indicated in the refusal had been corrected . However , if the author of the plan disagreed with the indicated errors , he or she would effectively be denied access to court if the proceedings lasted DATE . The court also noted that the applicant \u2019s original request had been to order the ORG to approve the plan and that the first - instance court had not made any findings in that respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after re - examining the case , again decided to dismiss the applicant \u2019s claims . The court held that decisions of the ORG , taken during the out - of - court settlement procedure , were mandatory for county administrations ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , the ORG \u2019s decisions of DATE and DATE had repealed the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE . As a result , the ORG \u2019s refusal to approve the plan was no longer valid and the court had no competence to examine its lawfulness . The court also held that , as a result , there was no need to examine the applicant \u2019s remaining claims .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment , again complaining that the first - instance court had not examined his request to order the ORG to approve the plan , and that it had not followed ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It upheld the lower court \u2019s findings that the ORG \u2019s decision had been repealed by the ORG and that courts had no competence to examine invalid acts . ORG then held that the applicant \u2019s request to order the ORG to approve the plan was \u201c derived \u201d ( i\u0161vestinis ) from the request to annul the ORG \u2019s decision ; having dismissed the latter , there was therefore no need to examine the former request either . Lastly the court noted that the applicant had not requested that the court order the ORG to comply with the ORG \u2019s decisions , so it would make no findings in that respect .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following a national administrative reform , all county administrations were abolished and their planning powers were transferred to the ORG . The applicant then submitted a new request to change the classification of his land and it was approved by all the relevant authorities . The classification of the land was changed to residential use in DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
