The first applicant submitted that he had become a member of ORG of GPE ( \u201c PDPA \u201d ) in DATE and that , as a conscript , he had served in a battalion in GPE from DATE to DATE .

Holding the rank of captain , the applicant had been assigned to ORG , which was responsible for controlling the border between GPE and GPE . From DATE the first applicant had worked in that area in the political affairs division of the border security unit . He had been responsible for cultural matters , including propaganda , combating illiteracy amongst soldiers , and the creation of patriotic awareness amongst them . He had further been given the task of persuading deserters who had been caught to do their military service in the NORP army .

PERSON had come to the army museum to take exhibits which they thought were valuable as weaponry or otherwise . When they recognised the first applicant as an army officer who had worked for the former regime , the mujahideen had incarcerated him \u2013 together with CARDINAL other officers and a soldier \u2013 in the basement of the museum . He had been released after DATE . The mujahideen had wanted him to cooperate with them by helping them to take arms and ammunition out of the museum . He had refused all such requests , which had led to aggressive behaviour towards him on the part of the mujahideen . The first applicant had repeatedly reported this attitude to these mujahideen \u2019s superiors in ORG , namely CARDINAL generals with whom the first applicant had collaborated during the former communist regime . These CARDINAL generals had both remained in their position at ORG and were working with the PERSON of PERSON .

Shortly after the first applicant had resigned from his post in the museum , the applicants received a written death threat in the courtyard of their house : the house was destroyed DATE . After a brief stay with the second applicant \u2019s father in another neighbourhood of GPE , the applicants moved in DATE to PERSON , which was under the control of followers of PERSON , who DATE like the applicants DATE was of NORP origin .

They were separated shortly after their arrest .", "CARDINAL . During his detention by the ORG , for DATE in a basement on a military base in PERSON and subsequently in the PERSON prison , the first applicant had been interrogated , ill - treated and forced to perform hard labour . As it happened sometimes that in TIME CARDINAL or CARDINAL detainees were taken away from the cell they shared with the applicant and others and were never seen again , the first applicant feared for his life during his detention .", "CARDINAL .

The first applicant was interviewed by NORP immigration officials about his flight and the motives for it on CARDINAL occasions ; the second applicant on CARDINAL occasions . On DATE they were informed of the intention ( voornemen ) of the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) to refuse them asylum . Having noted the first applicant \u2019s asylum account , an official general report ( ambtsbericht ) , drawn up on DATE by ORG on \u201c ORG in NORP GPE ( DATE ) .

On DATE , a lawyer acting on behalf of the applicants submitted written comments ( zienswijze ) on this intention .", "CARDINAL . After interviewing both applicants once more , the Minister rejected their asylum applications , in separate decisions taken on DATE . The elaborately argued notices of intention of DATE were added to the decisions and formed part of them .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister found , inter alia , that the first applicant constituted a danger to public order ( openbare orde ) , as serious reasons had been found for believing that he had committed crimes referred to in LAW , thus excluding him from international protection under LAW . Although the Minister attached credence to the first applicant \u2019s statements in terms of his positions and career within the NORP army , the applicant \u2019s description of his tasks was deemed to be inaccurate . His statements relating to certain of the tasks he said he had performed ( namely his stated activities relating to what was called the ORG \u2019s national reconciliation policy , amnesty , reconstruction and demilitarisation ) were found to be highly implausible .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the CARDINAL person - specific official reports of DATE , the Minister found that , at the relevant time , the political affairs divisions of the NORP army consisted solely of highly loyal and skilled professional soldiers , that people working for these divisions regularly provided the security service ORG with person - specific and general information ( \u201c ORG - e Dowlati / PERSON GPE ; the ORG was set up in DATE and transformed in DATE into a ministry called \u201c FAC , which remained in existence until the communist regime fell in DATE . Although the ORG was the successor of the LAW , the security service continued to be commonly referred to as ORG ) ; those working for the political affairs divisions had relatively easy access to the ORG leadership , and one of their tasks had been to remove anti - government soldiers from the army , if need be with the help of the ORG . They were thus inextricably connected to the frequent arrests , torture , disappearances and/or executions of disloyal members of the army by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister emphasised the widely known cruel character of the LAW , its lawless methods , the grave crimes it had committed such as torture and other human rights violations , and the \u201c climate of terror \u201d which it had spread throughout the whole of NORP society , including the army . The Minister underlined the vague definition of \u201c enemy of the communist regime \u201d used by the ORG , how it found those enemies through an extensive network of spies , and how all of this led to widespread and often random arrests of suspects . The Minister relied in this regard on the general official report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having established , on the basis of elaborate argumentation based on various international documents , that those involved in ORG and the political affairs divisions of the NORP army were likely to fall within the scope of LAW , the Minister proceeded to an analysis of the first applicant \u2019s individual responsibility under that Convention on the basis of the prescribed test known as the \u201c personal and knowing participation test \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On this point , the Minister found that , in view of the contents of the aforementioned official reports of ORG , the first applicant had known or should have known about the criminal character of the LAW , given his position in one of the political affairs divisions of the army and the contacts he had maintained professionally . The Minister further found that the first applicant had directly facilitated the crimes committed by ORG by performing his tasks in the NORP army , inter alia the attributed task of arresting and persuading deserters trying to flee across the border to continue military service , failure of which led to the handing over of these deserters to the office of ORG .", "CARDINAL . As regards LAW , the Minister noted that , during an additional interview on his asylum motives held on DATE , the first applicant had been explicitly invited to submit specific evidence that he would be exposed to a risk of treatment contrary to LAW in GPE . The Minister found that the first applicant had not furnished sufficient specific grounds to establish that he would run a real risk of treatment contrary to this provision if returned to GPE . Thus , he had failed to indicate which specific persons or groups would be looking for him , and had only stated in generally phrased terms that he feared persecution by the mujahideen . In respect of the first applicant \u2019s alleged fear of returning to GPE as a ( former ) member of the ORG , the Minister held that the first applicant was in a position not dissimilar to that of many other NORP nationals . Furthermore , the Minister , with reference to the most recent general official report on GPE issued by ORG on DATE , held that the sole fact that an asylum seeker had been a member of the ORG did not in itself suffice to render LAW applicable in the eventuality of an expulsion .", "CARDINAL . Separate appeals by the applicants were rejected in CARDINAL distinct judgments handed down on DATE by ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE , sitting in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first applicant , ORG accepted the Minister \u2019s decision to hold LAW against the first applicant . It also rejected the first applicant \u2019s arguments based on LAW . It agreed with the Minister that the first applicant \u2019s fear that he would be subjected to treatment in breach of this provision was based on assumptions , and that he had not submitted any specific evidence of the identity of the person(s ) or group(s ) , or for what reasons , he expected to encounter problems if he were returned to GPE , whereas \u2013 according to an official country assessment report on GPE issued by ORG on DATE mere membership of the ORG and active participation in its regime was in itself not enough to raise an issue under LAW in the event of expulsion of the alien in question . It further rejected , for lack of substantiation , the first applicant \u2019s claim that ORG ( ORG ) in GPE would be unable to provide him with sustained protection .", "CARDINAL . Further separate appeals by the applicants were rejected on summary reasoning on DATE , in CARDINAL distinct rulings given by ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) . It found that the further appeals did not provide grounds for quashing the impugned rulings ( kan niet tot vernietiging PERSON aangevallen uitspraak leiden ) . Having regard to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) , no further reasoning was called for , as the arguments submitted did not raise any questions requiring a determination in the interest of legal unity , legal development or legal protection in the general sense . No further appeal lay against these rulings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants\u2019 fourth child , a daughter named PERSON , was born in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants applied for a regular , non - asylum - related , residence permit . This request was rejected on DATE . The applicant \u2019s objection ( bezwaar ) was dismissed on DATE by the Deputy Minister of ORG ( ORG ) . The applicants initially lodged an appeal with ORG of The Hague , but withdrew this appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the second applicant had submitted a fresh asylum claim for herself and on behalf of the CARDINAL youngest children . The ORG eldest daughter had made her own asylum claim . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( Algemene wet bestuursrecht ) , a repeat claim \u2013 like the one submitted by the second applicant \u2013 must be based on newly emerged facts and/or altered circumstances ( \u201c nova \u201d ) warranting a reconsideration of the initial refusal . The asylum claim submitted by the second applicant and her eldest daughter was based on the claim that they had become westernised . The oldest daughter further claimed that she feared being forced into marriage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after an initial negative decision had been quashed on appeal , the Minister of Justice allowed the asylum claim submitted by the second applicant and the CARDINAL youngest children . The eldest daughter was also granted asylum .", "CARDINAL . DATE , namely on DATE and at the ORG request , the President of ORG had decided to indicate to the Government of the GPE that it was desirable in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG not to remove the applicants to GPE for the duration of the proceedings before ORG CARDINAL of ORG ) . At the same time , the President had decided under LAW ( b ) that the ORG should be invited to submit written observations on the admissibility and merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . Also , on DATE the first applicant had submitted a fresh asylum claim , based on the alleged deterioration in the general security situation in GPE and an increased individual risk of treatment prohibited by LAW , namely the fact that he was an ex - communist , that he was an atheist and thus belonged to a religious minority , and the fact that he had lived abroad for a long period . He also claimed that , due to his work , he was well known in GPE and was prominent in NORP circles in the GPE . On DATE , the first applicant was informed of the intention of the Deputy Minister of ORG to reject this request . The first applicant submitted written comments ( zienswijze ) on this intention on DATE .", "CARDINAL . This request was rejected on DATE by the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON , ORG ) . An appeal by the first applicant against this decision was rejected on DATE by ORG of The GPE sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch . It found that the first applicant had not shown evidence that the general security situation in GPE had deteriorated since the determination of his first asylum request , or that the further elements relied on by him did not constitute \u201c nova \u201d warranting a reconsideration of the decision taken on his initial asylum request . In so far as the first applicant relied on LAW , ORG held that asylum proceedings offered no scope for such arguments , which should be raised in proceedings on a request for a non - asylum - based residence permit , and that it was open for the first applicant to apply for a residence permit based on his family life within the meaning of LAW . A further appeal by the applicant was dismissed by ORG on DATE . No further appeal lay against this ruling ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
