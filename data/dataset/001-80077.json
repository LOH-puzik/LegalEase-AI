On TIME CARDINAL DATE the applicant , at that time aged DATE , went out with several friends in the centre of GPE to play electronic games . On the way back he left the main group to see a classmate of his and her sister to their door . After he had walked the girls home at TIME , he ran back to rejoin his friends . The applicant was wearing shorts , a yellow teeshirt and a green sleeveless jacket .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , some time after TIME , the PERSON police received a report that an icecream booth in the centre of the town had been vandalised by QUANTITY individuals . A police patrol was dispatched to the scene and arrested the first of them , but the second managed to get away . All patrols in the area were put on alert and ordered to track him down . The description given over the police radio was of a man wearing short pants and a lightcoloured teeshirt .", "CARDINAL . At that time Mr PERSON and PERSON , both trainee police officers , were in the area of the incident , patrolling in PERSON private car . Although they were supposed to be accompanied by a supervising police officer , chief sergeant A. , they were patrolling by themselves , as sergeant PERSON had been dispatched elsewhere . Their car was in a street which was not well lit . Seeing the applicant running past the car , they assumed that he was the offender at large . They got out of the car and gave chase . The applicant heard their steps , but , seeing that they had come out of an unmarked rather than a police car , kept on running . It was disputed whether or not Mr PERSON and PERSON had shouted \u201c Stop ! Police ! \u201d after the applicant . They submitted that they had done so , whereas the applicant and several witnesses stated that they had not heard the officers shouting . The chase continued for TIME . The applicant ran by ORG Shortly afterwards , Mr PERSON caught up with the applicant in front of a beauty parlour and apparently tripped him over . The applicant fell on the ground , face down . Mr PERSON then started hitting the applicant 's back and legs with a truncheon and kicking his torso . Soon after that Mr GPE caught up with them and also started hitting the applicant 's back and legs with a truncheon and kicking his torso . The applicant averred that Mr V.E. had sat on his back and had delivered several truncheon blows to his head . The applicant was crying and begging the officers to stop , insisting that he had done nothing wrong . Mr GPE was an eyewitness to the incident , and so were a Mr P.S. and a Mr V.K.", "CARDINAL . Shortly afterwards , chief sergeants PERSON and PERSON arrived at the scene . By that time the physical assault on the applicant had stopped . The applicant was lying on the ground and Mr PERSON and Mr GPE were standing beside him . The applicant 's teeshirt was soaked with blood coming from the neck area .", "CARDINAL . Chief sergeants PERSON and GPE helped the applicant get into their patrol car . On the way to the hospital they stopped at a fountain and told him to wash the blood off his neck . The applicant told the officers that he felt pain in his legs and in his right lumbar area .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was admitted to the emergency ward of ORG at TIME Upon his admission he stated that he could not see . His blood pressure was measured to be CARDINAL/CARDINAL . It was found that he had a traumaticlacerated injury on the back of his head . He was also complaining of severe pain in the area of the right kidney . He was taken to the surgical ward and the injury on his head was treated .", "CARDINAL . From the hospital the applicant was taken to the police station , where he was questioned at TIME It was established that he had nothing to do with the breaking of the icecream booth . After the questioning an officer took the applicant home . When the applicant 's mother saw the state the applicant was in , she asked a friend to drive the applicant and herself back to the emergency ward of ORG . There she was informed that the applicant had already been treated and that there was nothing more the staff could do , as there were no doctors on the ward at that time , only paramedics .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his mother then went to the police station to find out why he had been beaten and apprise the police of the names of the eyewitnesses to the incident . They were given the names of the officers who had assaulted the applicant and TIME left the station and went home .", "CARDINAL . When the severe pain in the applicant 's right lumbar area continued through TIME and blood showed up in his urine , a doctor was called in and examined the applicant at TIME on DATE . He found that the applicant had a reddening of the skin in the groins , parallel traces of blood suffusions and grazes on the calves , CARDINAL on the left leg and CARDINAL on the right leg , and a head injury .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on CARDINAL DATE the applicant went once more to the emergency ward of ORG . At TIME he was admitted to the surgical ward . He was diagnosed as suffering from contusion in the right lumbar area , commotion of the right kidney and haematuria ( blood in the urine ) , and was treated with styptics and antibiotics . He remained in hospital until DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , the applicant was urgently admitted to the urology centre of ORG in GPE because of macroscopic haematuria ( high levels of blood in his urine ) and sustained dull pain in his right lumbar area . His right kidney was found to be surrounded by a haematoma and retaining liquid . It was established that his blood pressure was ORG because of , among other reasons , the pressure from the haematoma on the kidney . The applicant was treated with spasmolytics , analgesics and antibiotics . The applicant had to be released on DATE due to an inhospital infection outbreak .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout DATE the applicant underwent numerous examinations of his right kidney .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was admitted to the urology ward of ORG \u201c Pirogov \u201d , after complaining from dull pain in his right lumbar area . He was diagnosed as suffering from hydronephrosis of the right kidney ( pathological chronic enlargement of the collecting channels of a kidney , leading to the compression and the eventual destruction of kidney tissue and the deterioration of the kidney function ) . On DATE he underwent surgery and his right kidney was removed . On CARDINAL DATE he was released from hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's mother complained about his beating to ORG . On DATE the applicant 's father also lodged a complaint with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , which was competent to deal with offences allegedly committed by police officers , opened criminal proceedings against Mr PERSON and Mr GPE", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigator to whom the case was assigned conducted a series of interviews on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . He questioned the applicant , PERSON I.P. , PERSON and several other witnesses . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the investigator questioned chief sergeant PERSON and CARDINAL other police officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON and PERSON were charged and questioned . During questioning PERSON stated that he had tripped the applicant but had not subjected him to any other violence . PERSON stated that he had only hit the applicant once with a truncheon on the legs , but had not subjected him to any other violence .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the investigator ordered a medical expert report to determine the extent of the applicant 's injuries . The report was drawn up by PERSON , head of the forensic medicine ward of ORG . She found that the applicant had had a wound on his head , haematomas and grazing on his legs , contusion of the right lumbar area and haematuria . She concluded that the beating had caused the applicant a shortterm lifethreatening health disorder , due to a traumatic - haemorrhagic shock resulting from the contusion of the right kidney and a massive haematoma around the kidney .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's mother , acting for the applicant , who was still underage , submitted a civil claim against Mr PERSON and Mr V.E. She sought CARDINAL old NORP levs ( ORG ) on the applicant 's behalf .", "CARDINAL . Another series of interviews was conducted on DATE by another investigator at ORG . Mr PERSON and Mr DATE were questioned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted to ORG an indictment against Mr PERSON and PERSON GPE , charging them with causing intermediate bodily harm to the applicant . On DATE the case was set down for hearing .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing took place on DATE . Mr PERSON and PERSON GPE were represented by PERSON , a former military prosecutorgeneral . The applicant , who was also represented by counsel , amended his civil claim , seeking interest as from DATE of the beating and naming ORG as a third defendant . The court heard Mr PERSON , PERSON , the applicant , the applicant 's mother , chief sergeant PERSON , several other police officers , Mr GPE , Mr PERSON and Mr DATE Noting that the statements of the accused differed from those of the eyewitnesses , the court carried out a confrontation . Finally , the court heard Dr PERSON , the medical expert who had given an opinion about the extent of the applicant 's injuries . The accused disputed Dr PERSON 's conclusions and requested a new medical report to be drawn up by CARDINAL experts , excluding Dr PERSON The court acceded to the request and ordered a new expert report , to be drawn up by CARDINAL medical experts .", "CARDINAL . In their report the CARDINAL medical experts ( PERSON , head of the forensic medicine and ethics department of ORG in GPE , PERSON , head of department at ORG of the Institute , and PERSON , senior assistant at the anaesthesiology and intensive care departments of ORG concluded that as a result of the DATE incident the applicant had suffered a contusion of the right kidney , haematomas and grazing of the CARDINAL legs , a wound on the head and a reddening in the right part of the groins . Unlike PERSON , they concluded that the traumaticneurogenic shock suffered by the applicant had not become truly lifethreatening . They also found that before the incident the applicant had been suffering from a congenital kidney anomaly , which had been the reason for the applicant 's haematuria after the incident . In the experts ' view , the applicant 's kidney injury had not been lifethreatening and had had no longlasting effects on his health . The beating had caused the applicant only a temporary ( CARDINAL or threeweek ) health problem .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing took place on DATE . The court heard the CARDINAL medical experts , who stated that they adhered to the conclusions given in their report . The prosecutor noted that the first report , drawn up by Dr PERSON , and the second report , drawn up by the CARDINAL medical experts , substantially differed on the issue of the extent of the injuries suffered by the applicant . He therefore requested an additional expert report , to be drawn up by CARDINAL experts , including Dr PERSON The court acceded to the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the report of the CARDINAL medical experts was ready . They concluded that the applicant had suffered a traumaticneurogenic shock , which , however , had not deteriorated and had not become lifethreatening . They also concluded that before the incident the applicant had been suffering from a congenital kidney anomaly , which had been the reason for his haematuria after the incident . In the experts ' view , the applicant 's kidney injury had not become lifethreatening . As regards the later surgical removal of the kidney and its potential causal link with the beating , the experts were of the opinion that , in view of the long time - span between the beating ( DATE ) and the surgery ( DATE ) and the nature of the injury , it could not be concluded that the removal of the kidney had been a direct and proximate consequence of the beating . Additionally , the applicant 's congenital kidney anomaly had been prone to natural deterioration and could have led on its own to a decline in the kidney function , which was what had made the removal necessary . It could not be categorically established that the beating had not contributed to the need for the removal of the kidney , but the main factor had been the congenital anomaly .", "CARDINAL . After several adjournments due to difficulties with the attendance of all CARDINAL medical experts , ORG listed a hearing for DATE . At that hearing the court heard all CARDINAL medical experts . CARDINAL of them stated that they adhered to the conclusions made in their report . By contrast , Dr PERSON stated that she did not agree with the conclusions of the report and that she still maintained the opinion expressed in her initial report . The applicant presented Xrays of his kidneys and , after examining them , the CARDINAL experts stated that they still adhered to the conclusions reached in their report . The applicant increased his civil claim to BGL CARDINAL . In his concluding argument the public prosecutor stated that , in view of the experts ' opinion , he did not pursue the charge of intermediate bodily harm , and urged the court to characterise the officers ' act as inflicting minor bodily harm .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found Mr PERSON and PERSON guilty of inflicting the applicant minor bodily harm and not guilty of inflicting him intermediate bodily harm . It sentenced them to DATE imprisonment , suspended for DATE . The court also partially allowed the applicant 's claim for damages , awarding him ORG CARDINAL , to be paid jointly and severally by the CARDINAL officers and the vicariously liable ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The court found that Mr PERSON had tripped the applicant and that the applicant had fallen on the ground face down . After that Mr PERSON had delivered a number of blows on the applicant 's back and legs with a truncheon and had kicked several times his torso . When PERSON GPE had arrived he had also hit the applicant 's back and legs with a truncheon and had kicked his torso . During the beating the applicant had told the CARDINAL accused that he had done nothing wrong . The court stated that it did not find the accused 's averment that they had not beaten the applicant persuasive , because it was disproved by the testimony of QUANTITY eyewitnesses NORP and Mr DATE and of the applicant himself . The court considered that the eyewitnesses ' and the applicant 's testimony was consistent and reliable .", "CARDINAL . The court also examined the officers ' assertion that they had acted lawfully , in a situation calling for the arrest of a suspect , and that they had inflicted bodily harm in their efforts to subdue the applicant . In that connection , it noted that the accused were substantially stronger physically than the applicant , that Mr GPE , Mr GPE and chief sergeant PERSON had testified that the applicant had not tried to resist , and that at the time of the incident the applicant had been DATE . The court accordingly rejected the assertion .", "CARDINAL . As regards the extent of the applicant 's injuries , the court held that the opinion of the CARDINAL medical experts , which appeared objective , impartial , consistent , wellreasoned and in conformity with the medical documents in the case file , should be given more credit than that of Dr FAC In the court 's view , the CARDINAL experts ' arguments confuted her opinion . The court therefore held that as a result of the beating the applicant had suffered a temporary ( CARDINAL or threeweek ) nonlifethreatening health disorder , which amounted to minor bodily harm within the meaning of ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court rejected Mr PERSON and Mr GPE 's defence under LAW that they had only used the force necessary to arrest a presumed offender , injuring the applicant in the process of subduing his resistance . The court acknowledged the great disparity in terms of physical strength between the CARDINAL policemen and the applicant . Moreover , the other witnesses had clearly indicated that the applicant had not put up any resistance requiring the use of force . Finally , at the time of the incident the applicant had been DATE and his age was visible from his physical features .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON and Mr GPE appealed , arguing that their actions had not constituted an offence , as they had acted within the bounds allowed by LAW of DATE . In the alternative , they submitted that the sentences imposed on them were too harsh . The applicant also appealed , arguing that the amount of damages awarded to him was too low .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE . The officers were represented by their counsel , PERSON The applicant was represented by CARDINAL lawyers .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . It held that the manner in which the applicant 's injuries had been caused had been correctly established by the lower court . There existed direct evidence that the applicant had been subjected to violence even after he had been brought to the ground and had not had the possibility to resist or run away . Even if the officers had misidentified the applicant , this had not legally justified the physical assault that they had inflicted on him . Moreover , the use of force had continued after the applicant had been subdued . There existed a direct causal link between the violence and the injuries sustained , as confirmed by all of the medical expert reports . The court went on to state that it did not agree with the lower court 's conclusion as regards the extent of the applicant 's injury . To exclude the causal link between the surgical removal of the applicant 's right kidney and the incident of CARDINAL DATE , ORG had relied on the conclusion of CARDINAL medical experts and had rejected as illogical the conclusion of Dr PERSON However , that court had disregarded that conclusion on purely formal grounds , without discussing its main points . It was unclear whether the opinion of the CARDINAL experts was in fact based on the raw medical data , which in turn cast doubt on its correctness . The court concluded that if the lower court had taken into account these considerations , it could have made a different finding as to the reason for the surgical removal of the applicant 's right kidney . However , since no appeal had been lodged by the prosecution , the court only noted this factual mistake and did not correct it in its judgment by holding that the applicant had suffered intermediate bodily harm , as that would worsen the accused 's position .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON and PERSON appealed on points of law to ORG . The applicant also appealed , requesting an increase in the amount of damages awarded .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE . It heard the applicant 's and the officers ' oral argument and accepted their written pleadings for consideration . The prosecutor present at the hearing submitted that both appeals were groundless and should be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG reversed Mr PERSON 's and PERSON convictions and acquitted them . It also dismissed the applicant 's civil claim . Its opinion read as follows :", "\u201c ... The courts below arrived at the erroneous conclusion that the CARDINAL [ officers ] ' act had been wrongful and contrary to LAW ...", "This is so for the following reasons :", "The [ officers ' ] act does not amount to an offence , as they acted under the prerequisites of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , points CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW [ of DATE ] and within the bounds set by this LAW on the use of physical force , namely information about the perpetration of a publicly prosecutable offence in the centre of GPE , which was broadcast over the [ police ] radio station and was received by [ Mr PERSON ] and [ Mr GPE ] . Moreover , the description of the perpetrator who had fled from the crime scene coincided with the appearance of the [ applicant ] , and for this reason the ... officers mistook him for the wanted offender . What is more , the [ applicant ] did not obey and through his actions refused to comply with the lawful order of the [ officers ] , who tried to stop him by shouting ' Stop ! Police ! ' Instead , he tried to escape , in order to avoid arrest by the [ police ] , who , in line with their duties , gave chase with a view to arresting the suspect . As it were , not only did the [ applicant ] not obey , but he also resisted the [ police officers ] . Finally , the injuries he sustained upon his arrest are within what is permissible under sections DATE and CARDINAL of the [ LAW of DATE ] .", "The overall situation , including the [ applicant ] 's inadequate behaviour , led the [ officers ] to conclude that he was the offender who was being sought after and who had to be caught , overawed and apprehended . This conclusion and the lawful actions of the officers , including the use of force with its consequences for the [ applicant ] , rule out the criminality of their act .

The persons effecting the arrest are criminally liable only if they cause the harm wilfully .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG make it an offence to inflict grievous , intermediate or minor bodily harm on another person . The ORG defines intermediate bodily harm as , inter alia , CARDINAL which involves a temporary lifethreatening health disorder or a permanent nonlifethreatening health disorder ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ) .
