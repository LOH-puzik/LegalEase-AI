Insofar as the applicant complained that he was unable to consult the case - file , the President noted that the applicant had seen certain annexes to the criminal report of DATE ; TIME of the applicant \u2019s interrogations on DATE ; a letter of the GPE firm of DATE ; and part of TIME of the interrogation of a certain PERSON .

He submitted that the President of ORG had had the entire case - file at his disposal , whereas he had been refused access thereto . It did not suffice if , as the President stated , he , the applicant , had seen all relevant documents , since the President \u2019s decision could also have been influenced by other documents . For instance , his decision of DATE mentioned the date of the criminal report originally filed against him , a document which the applicant had never seen .

To the extent that the applicant complained about insufficient consultation of the case - file , the court considered that the applicant had been able to consult all documents upon which the decision of the President of ORG of DATE had been based .", "ORG furthermore considered that the applicant could no longer claim a practical interest in his complaint about the conditions of detention , as the latter had meanwhile been ameliorated .

The lawyer requested compliance with this decision .", "Following further requests for release from detention , the applicant was released on DATE .", "The Code of Criminal Procedure of ORG lists in Section CARDINAL the grounds for detention on remand and in LAW provides , inter alia , that the investigating judge shall be competent to impose such detention . LAW envisages the possibility of a complaint in proceedings before ORG to ORG and subsequently to ORG , though this remedy does not apply if other remedies are available . In this respect , LAW provides for an appeal to the President of ORG against the warrant of arrest ; the conditions of detention ; and the refusal of release from detention .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) of ORG provides that ORG of ORG shall elect the investigating judges , and LAW states that ORG shall supervise ORG . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL states that ORG shall be competent for conducting the investigations . According to LAW , ORG will raise the charges at the trial before the court .", "According to ORG case - law , a complaint about unlawfulness of detention may no longer be filed after release from detention . However , subsequent complaints may be raised in an action for compensation before ORG ( see ORG f\u00e9d\u00e9ral [ ORG ] CARDINAL ORG ; CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL ; CARDINAL I a CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
