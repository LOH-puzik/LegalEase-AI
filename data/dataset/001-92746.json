FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Lech Garlicki;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant went to a bar for a few drinks . He met his female acquaintance who was in the company of CARDINAL DATE girls whom he had not met before . Afterwards , they all decided to leave the bar in a taxi . They dropped off the applicant \u2019s acquaintance at her home and continued to the applicant \u2019s apartment . The applicant , and apparently also the girls , continued drinking and talking . According to the statement given by the applicant in ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) , after a while he called a taxi for the girls and gave them money for the fare . He claims that the next time he heard of the girls was DATE when the police contacted him and suspected him of a sexual offence .", "CARDINAL . The ORG version of the early evening \u2019s events was roughly the same as the applicant \u2019s but differed considerably as concerned the events at his apartment . The girls claimed that while they were in the applicant \u2019s apartment , he had sexual intercourse with one of the girls after she had fallen asleep , and that he attempted to rape the other one . Immediately after this had happened , the girls decided to leave . One of the girls called a taxi and the applicant gave them money for the fare . When they got home , the mother of CARDINAL of the girls called the police . A police patrol came and the police interviewed the girls . The girl who alleged that she had been raped refused to see a doctor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was questioned for the first time on DATE . The public prosecutor brought charges against him on DATE . ORG held an oral hearing on DATE at which only the applicant and the girls were heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave its judgment . It acknowledged that the parties\u2019 accounts of the facts diverged greatly . The majority of the ORG judges found that the ORG account was more reliable than the applicant \u2019s . Their stories were coherent and consistent . It was not credible that the girls could have invented the allegations . The fact that the girl who had been raped did not see a doctor immediately after the incident was of no relevance . The applicant was convicted of sexual abuse and attempted coercion into sexual intercourse ( sukupuoliyhteyteen pakottamisen yritys , f\u00f6rs\u00f6k till tvingande till samlag ) , sentenced to a conditional prison sentence of DATE and DATE and fined . CARDINAL judge found the applicant \u2019s account of the facts to be more reliable and gave a dissenting opinion .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , requesting that an oral hearing be held as he had been convicted on the basis of conflicting evidence . The ORG testimonies before ORG had differed from their accounts given during the pre - trial investigation and were inconsistent . The girl who claimed to have been raped had not seen a doctor after the alleged offence . Moreover , the police had started to investigate the crime as rape . However , since rape was such a serious offence the police should have arrested the applicant immediately and conducted a crime - scene investigation in his apartment . Instead , the applicant had been questioned for the first time DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to apply the filtering procedure ( seulontamenettely , s\u00e5llningsf\u00f6rfarandet ) and rejected the request for an oral hearing . It upheld ORG judgment without examining the case any further .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , complaining about the use of the filtering procedure and reiterating the grounds of appeal relied on before ORG . He referred , inter alia , to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The filtering procedure used by ORG is based on LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) , which has been in force since DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG may filter a case , that is , uphold the District Court\u2019", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Code of Judicial Procedure ( Act no . PERSON ) provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The Appeal Court shall hold a main hearing regardless of whether CARDINAL has been requested , if a decision on the matter turns on the credibility of the testimony admitted in ORG or the findings of ORG in an inspection , or on new testimony to be admitted in ORG . In this event , the evidence admitted in the ORG shall be readmitted and the inspection carried out again in the main hearing , unless there is an impediment to this .", "( CARDINAL ) If the evidence referred to in paragraph ( CARDINAL ) can not be readmitted at the main hearing , the decision of the ORG shall not be changed for that part , unless the evidence for any special reason is to be assessed differently . However , a decision on a charge may be altered in favour of the defendant in a criminal case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the filtering procedure the material to be taken into account comprises the appeal documents , the finding of ORG as well as any possible reply .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Law Committee ( perustuslakivaliokunta , grundlagsutskottet ) stated in its opinion CARDINAL concerning the filtering procedure ( see government bill HE CARDINAL ) the following :", "\u201c A fair trial requires in some situations the holding of an oral hearing at the appellate level . The consideration of a matter can not , according to subsection CARDINAL of the proposed section , be discontinued in the filtering procedure if a full - scale procedure is necessary for the purposes of the legal security of the parties . The appeal courts are therefore required to apply the provisions on the filtering procedure in a way that meets the requirements of basic and human rights , for example so that the decisions made when using the filtering procedure do not , in an individual case , violate the right to an oral hearing . \"", "CARDINAL . Since the introduction of the filtering procedure ORG has given numerous judgments on the applicability of the procedure . According to its case - law , a full examination and an oral hearing are necessary when ORG finding depended on the credibility of oral evidence . The credibility of oral statements and the evaluation of testimonies both require an oral hearing to be held ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
