UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN was a political party founded on CARDINAL DATE and based in southwest GPE ( in an area known as the GPE region or the geographic region of LOC ) . It was declared unconstitutional by ORG on DATE and as a result dissolved .", "CARDINAL . DATE CARDINAL organisations of persons declaring to have NORP ethnic consciousness were formed and were active on the territory of GPE . Apparently most of these never sought to be registered .", "CARDINAL . One of them , ORG ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) , was founded on DATE . Its aims , according to its articles of association and programme , were to \u201c unite all NORP in GPE on a regional and cultural basis \u201d and to achieve \u201c the recognition of the NORP minority in GPE \u201d . DATE it applied for , but was refused , registration . In their judgments of DATE and DATE and DATE the competent courts found that the association \u2019s aims were directed against the unity of the nation , that it advocated national and ethnic hatred , and that it was dangerous for the territorial integrity of GPE . The aims of the association included the \u201c political development of GPE \u201d and the \u201c united , independent NORP State \u201d ( see PERSON and ORG v. GPE , ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIX ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG made an additional attempt to register in DATE ( see ORG and Others v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . Registration was again refused .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant party was founded in the town of PERSON on DATE by fiftyone persons . Some of its founders had previously been members of ORG . It applied for registration at ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings the public prosecutor , who participated ex officio , maintained that the party \u2019s aims were contrary to LAW and that registration should therefore be refused . In connection with these remarks the founders decided to amend CARDINAL point of the party \u2019s constitution . They did so at a meeting on DATE and presented the amended copy to the court .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , a notice of which was published in ORG on DATE , the ORG registered the applicant party , holding that its aims , as set out in its constitution and programme , were not contrary to the proscriptions of LAW and of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL members of the NORP parliament requested ORG to declare the applicant party unconstitutional , more specifically , contrary to LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW of DATE . They argued that the party had in fact been formed in DATE and was a successor of the \u201c illegal \u201d FAC . They further argued that the party \u2019s ultimate aim was the formation of an independent NORP state through the secession of GPE from GPE . The party \u2019s members and leaders had on numerous occasions declared such goals . The party \u2019s original constitution , amended in the course of the proceedings before ORG , contained language to the effect that it would \u201c protect the interests of the population of LOC [ and ] of the refugees from LOC and LOC . This indicated its separatist character . Also , the applicant party \u2019s chairman , Mr PERSON ( the second applicant ) , had sent letters to the state institutions and media of a neighbouring country , urging them to look for a \u201c NORP minority \u201d in GPE . It was true that the party \u2019s public influence was negligible , but its registration had created a dangerous precedent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the request admissible and invited the applicant party , ORG , ORG , the Ministers of Internal Affairs and of ORG , the ORG , ORG and ORG to submit written observations within DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant , PERSON , acting in his capacity of chairman of the applicant party , filed written observations in which he argued that ORG was a democratic party and its activities were fully compliant with the LAW and the laws of the country .", "CARDINAL . In a joint memorial ORG and ORG argued against the applicant party \u2019s dissolution . They pointed out that it had existed for only a short time and that it was therefore too early to judge whether its activities rendered it unconstitutional . The few public statements of its leaders and members could not lead to a firm conclusion in that respect . On the contrary , the applicant party had never questioned the country \u2019s territorial integrity . A measure as radical as dissolution would be justified only if there was an immediate and direct threat to national security or public order , which was clearly not the case .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held on DATE at which ORG heard oral argument . At the hearing ORG presented as evidence a letter written by Mr PERSON , former chairman of the applicant party , and sent by him on the party \u2019s behalf to ORG in GPE . In the letter PERSON PERSON had stated that \u201c LOC ha[d ] to gain cultural , political and economic autonomy \u201d and that \u201c the human rights of NORP in GPE [ stood ] higher than GPE \u2019s national sovereignty \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP That letter was discussed at a meeting of ORG of the applicant party held on DATE . The ORG distanced itself from the letter and expressed the opinion that Mr PERSON \u2019s actions had been contrary to the party \u2019s constitution and aims . The ORG recommended that Mr PERSON be expelled from the party . The applicant party informed ORG of this resolution .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court gave judgment on DATE , declaring the applicant party unconstitutional ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e \u2116 DATE \u0433. , \u043e\u0431\u043d. , NORP \u0431\u0440\u043e\u0439 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 QUANTITY \u0433. ) .", "CARDINAL . The court started by observing that the constitutionality of a party should mainly be assessed on the basis of its activity . It was not sufficient to make the assessment solely on the basis of the statements contained in its constitution and programme . The constitution of a party could be just a fa\u00e7ade for facilitating its registration ; this is why it was necessary to have regard to the party \u2019s real activities . It could not be ruled out that the documents could conceal objectives , intentions and activities that were different from those which were publicly proclaimed . It was therefore necessary to compare their content with the party \u2019s practical actions . ORG had ruled on this issue in its judgment in the case of ORG of GPE and Others v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The court went on to hold that although the applicant party had been registered in DATE on the basis of a constitution which had been adopted at a founding meeting on DATE , it was not a novel organisation . It had a predecessor and was continuing its activities . The court described the founding of ORG in DATE and its unsuccessful attempt to register in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It further found that ORG had split in DATE , the radicals remaining on one side and the more moderate members forming CARDINAL separate organisations : ORG \u2013 Democratic Action and PERSON . Most of the applicant party \u2019s current leaders , including Mr PERSON ( the second applicant ) and Mr PERSON , had been members of these CARDINAL organisations , which had merged and , after an unsuccessful attempt to register as an association at ORG , had managed to register as a political party at ORG . It could thus be concluded that the applicant party was not a novel organisation , but was closely connected with the former unregistered association ORG . The CARDINAL had almost the same name and the same persons were their leaders and members . Moreover , the second applicant and another leader of the applicant party had intimated in newspaper interviews that they considered the applicant party and FAC as one and the same organisation . The court therefore concluded that the activities of the applicant party \u2019s predecessor organisations should be taken into account for purpose of assessing its constitutionality .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court then turned to the specific grounds invoked by the sixtyone members of parliament for declaring the applicant party unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . With regard to its alleged incompatibility with LAW , the court found that there was no NORP ethnos in GPE . Therefore , it could not be said that the applicant party was based on ethnic origin . Moreover , it was clear from its constitution that every NORP citizen could become its member . This part of the request was therefore unfounded .", "CARDINAL . As to the other ground for declaring the applicant party unconstitutional , incompatibility with LAW , the court pointed to a number of specific instances in which members of the applicant party and its predecessor organisations had engaged in conduct prohibited under LAW :", "\u2013 A meeting on DATE at FAC . At this meeting a declaration had been adopted , demanding full cultural , economic and political autonomy of the GPE region ; withdrawal of the NORP troops , referred to as \u201c occupational \u201d ; dissolution of all NORP political parties and organisations ; the establishment of a NORP orthodox church independent of the NORP orthodox church , etc .", "\u2013 A commemorative rally held on DATE in the area PERSON krepost . A brochure announcing the event had featured a map of GPE , which had included territories that are part of GPE ( the GPE region ) and GPE , and in the middle of the map there had been depicted the sixteenray NORP star symbol .", "\u2013 In DATE the newspaper PERSON , published by ORG , had printed a map of GPE featuring territories belonging to GPE and GPE .", "\u2013 On DATE the faction of ORG lead by Mr PERSON had issued a memorandum according to which in GPE there existed \u201c modern - day genocide , discrimination and assimilation \u201d and the NORP there were deprived of the right to honour the memory of the CARDINAL of fighters who had fallen in the struggle for \u201c free and independent GPE \u201d . That memorandum had been circulated abroad .", "\u2013 Immediately after the applicant party \u2019s founding , the newspaper LOC in its issue of CARDINAL DATE had reprinted an interview of Mr PERSON , the party \u2019s secretary , in which he had allegedly insulted the NORP nation and had attacked representatives of the NORP authorities . He had portrayed the GPE region as part of GPE and had indicated that the unique folklore , culture , traditions and individuality of the NORP people had been destroyed , that its history and customs had been stolen , and that its national identity had been denied .", "\u2013 In DATE Mr PERSON had attended a press conference of ORG held in GPE , as a representative of ORG . When asked why he spoke NORP , he had replied : \u201c This is not NORP , but NORP , and this is the language spoken in GPE , whereas the NORP there speak PERSON language \u201d .", "\u2013 In an interview for the NORP PERSON newspaper of CARDINAL DATE the applicant party \u2019s deputychairman , PERSON , had accused GPE of genocide and lack of democracy , and had spoken of a \u201c LOC part of GPE \u201d , as if of a NORP territory . He had obviously agreed with its secession from GPE but had thought that it was not the opportune time and had concluded : \u201c I believe time works for us \u201d .", "\u2013 A declaration of ORG , signed by its chairman , Mr PERSON ( the second applicant ) , and its secretary , Mr PERSON , had been published in the issue of NORP PERSON of DATE . In this declaration the LOC region had been referred to as \u201c part of GPE \u201d . The organisation had proclaimed that it was a defender of \u201c the NORP in GPE and GPE \u201d , that is , a distinction had been drawn between LOC and GPE .", "\u2013 The issues of the newspaper ORG of CARDINAL and DATE had contained publications relating to a letter issued by the applicant party and to a press conference given by its chairman , Mr PERSON , in GPE . It had been indicated in them that \u201c GPE even [ then ] continue[d ] to misappropriate GPE \u2019s cultural heritage \u201d and that \u201c GPE [ had ] incited GPE \u2019s partition \u201d .", "\u2013 the applicant party had , together with several foreign organisations , participated in the issuing of a Declaration for the protection of the NORP people \u2019s national distinctiveness , addressed to the former GPE Government . CARDINAL of the declaration had requested an affirmation to the effect that part of the NORP people lived on NORP territory given in temporary trusteeship to GPE , GPE and GPE by the DATE treaty of GPE . It had been once again proclaimed that this part of GPE \u2019s territory was only temporarily under NORP administration .", "\u2013 On DATE Mr PERSON , running for mayor of PERSON on the applicant party \u2019s ticket , had declared at a press conference : \u201c In several statements made by members of ORG it was said that if the [ ORG ] do not win the elections in PERSON , no funding will be forthcoming to the region . Thus , if we win , the government gives us the right to freely choose and declare that this is a free territory , which may decide subsequently where to turn to . \u201d", "\u2013 In an interview of DATE the applicant party \u2019s chairman , Mr PERSON ( the second applicant ) , had been even more radical . He had noted that the party should be firm and assert the interests of LOC . He had gone on to say that the prime minister should be presented with the following statement : \u201c We have certain demands , or else we will secede GPE \u201d .", "\u2013 The letter sent by Mr PERSON on DATE on behalf of the applicant party to ORG in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) was also significant . In it he had expressed the wish that \u201c LOC gain cultural , political and economic autonomy \u201d . He had also stated that \u201c the human rights of the NORP in GPE [ stood ] higher than GPE \u2019s national sovereignty \u201d . In the court \u2019s view , the fact that the applicant party \u2019s leadership had distanced itself from Mr PERSON was not relevant , as this had happened only after the letter had reached the addressee and had become known to the public .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court continued :", "\u201c The facts set out above indicate that the [ applicant party \u2019s ] activity is focused around the GPE region . It treats this part of the country \u2019s territory as nonBulgarian land . In its view , it is foreign territory , given to GPE for temporary administration pursuant to an international treaty . [ The applicant party \u2019s ] activity is in that direction , going as far as secession of the territory in question from GPE .", "This is indicated by the calls for autonomy , which is expressly proscribed by LAW . It is also indicated by the maps of GPE issued and circulated [ by the applicant party ] , by the definition of the GPE region as part of GPE and by the interpretations of the Balkan War and the GPE treaty of DATE . Its culmination is the threat to secede the GPE region if the party \u2019s demands are not met . Such a threat , when made by the chairperson of a party , could not only be in words . It is real and shows the positions of the party itself ; moreover , it has been supported by its other leaders .", "The actions in question constitute an activity aimed against the territorial integrity of the country within the meaning of LAW . Each and every one of them [ goes against this Article \u2019s proscription ] .", "The constitutional rule protects a value of the highest calibre , namely the territorial integrity of GPE , which LAW proclaims as inviolable . That is why [ the proscription has been breached ] even in the absence of effective damage to the protected value \u2013 the country \u2019s territory . An activity aimed against the territorial integrity , such as the one present here , is quite sufficient .", "A political party which declares part of GPE \u2019s territory as foreign and engages in actions for its secession is an unconstitutional party . It has no right to exist .", "ORG deems it necessary to underscore that its notion of unconstitutionality is in line with LAW of LAW sand LAW of LAW . These provisions allow restrictions of the freedom of association when necessary in the interests of national security , as here . There is no doubt that an activity aimed against the territorial integrity of GPE imperils its national security . \u201d", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL judges voted against the majority . In their dissenting opinions they , inter alia , expressed the view that the activities of ORG should not be taken into account for the purpose of evaluating the applicant party \u2019s constitutionality . They went on to say that ORG had erred in taking into account only certain statements of members and leaders of the applicant party . Its most fundamental activity since its registration was rather its normal and fully democratic participation in the local government elections in DATE . However , the court had chosen to ignore that fact . Lastly , the dissenting judges expressed the opinion that the applicant party was being penalised for expressing its views , which it was entitled to convey , although they were shocking and probably offensive for the majority of NORP .", "CARDINAL .
