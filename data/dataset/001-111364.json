The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG convicted the applicant , inter alia , of repeated rape and of CARDINAL counts of attempted rape , together with dangerous assault respectively , committed against CARDINAL young women he did not previously know and whom he had seriously beaten or injured with weapons , and sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . The court found that owing to a sadistic sexual deviation , the applicant had acted with diminished criminal responsibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG convicted the applicant of dangerous assault and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It found that the applicant had caused a knife injury to a prostitute who had resisted sexual intercourse with him . It considered that the sadistic sexual deviation the applicant suffered from had not diminished his criminal responsibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG convicted the applicant , in particular , of CARDINAL counts of rape , sexual assault and assault and of CARDINAL count of attempted rape , attempted sexual assault and assault , committed against CARDINAL drug - addicted prostitutes in DATE . It found that the applicant had raped or attempted to rape the CARDINAL women , had beaten and mistreated them in a torture - like manner and had partly urinated on them or forced them to have obscene photographs taken of them . It sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his placement in a psychiatric hospital ( LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It considered that the applicant suffered from a serious personality disorder and from a sadistic sexual deviation and had committed his offences with diminished criminal responsibility .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the applicant was liable to reoffend and was therefore dangerous to the public as long as he was not undergoing therapy . The therapy in question was only possible in a psychiatric hospital . The court considered that the conditions for the applicant \u2019s preventive detention under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) were also met . However , owing to the fact that preventive detention only entailed a person \u2019s safe custody , without offering any specific medical and psychological treatment , this measure was clearly less suitable in the applicant \u2019s case than his placement in a psychiatric hospital . Therefore , the court did not order the applicant \u2019s preventive detention in addition to his placement in a psychiatric hospital .", "CARDINAL . The judgment became final in DATE and from DATE the applicant was initially detained in a psychiatric hospital in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant serve his prison sentence prior to his continued placement in a psychiatric hospital . It argued that the applicant denied the offences he had been found guilty of and refused to undergo therapy . Furthermore , doubts had arisen as to whether he had actually acted with diminished criminal responsibility .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was retransferred to prison on DATE and then served his full sentence mainly in FAC .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an expert , C. , confirmed that the applicant , who suffered from a borderline personality disorder , had originally been wrongly placed in a psychiatric hospital from a present - day perspective .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicant , having served his full sentence , was again detained in a psychiatric hospital , initially in GPE and subsequently in GPE , on an order of the GPE am ORG , based on ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . In these proceedings , expert PERSON , who had already examined the applicant prior to ORG judgment in DATE , confirmed that the applicant , an autistic psychopath , had acted with diminished criminal responsibility and that his placement in a psychiatric hospital had therefore been justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the applicant \u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital ( Article QUANTITY of LAW , see paragraph DATE below ) . Having heard evidence from another expert , PERSON , it found that the applicant did not suffer from a serious personality disorder or from a sadistic sexual deviation which diminished his criminal responsibility . It further ordered the applicant \u2019s provisional detention pending the competent court \u2019s decision whether or not he was to be placed in preventive detention retrospectively as the applicant still had a propensity to commit serious offences . The applicant was accordingly detained in FAC since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG quashed ORG order for the applicant \u2019s detention . The applicant was released on DATE . Shortly afterwards , he harassed a young woman and threatened her presumed partner .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s failure to appear at the hearing before the GPE am ORG on DATE in the proceedings at issue , that court ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest in order to secure the conduct of the proceedings . The applicant has been in detention since that date , first in FAC and subsequently , since DATE , in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG , relying on Article CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ordered the applicant \u2019s preventive detention retrospectively ( nachtr\u00e4gliche GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The GPE am ORG found that , in accordance with LAW of LAW , ORG had terminated the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital on DATE pursuant to Article CARDINAL of LAW as the requirements for placing him in such a hospital had not been met at the time of that court \u2019s decision . The court further noted that the requirements of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW were met . The order for the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital had been made in the judgment of the GPE am ORG of CARDINAL DATE convicting him , inter alia , of CARDINAL counts of rape and CARDINAL count of attempted rape and sentencing him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . Moreover , the applicant had already been convicted of rape and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment by a judgment of the GPE am ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that a comprehensive assessment of the applicant , his offences and his development during his placement in a psychiatric hospital revealed that it was very likely that , if released , he would again commit serious sexual offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims ( Article CARDINALb \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . It based its findings on the reports submitted by a psychological expert , GPE , and a psychiatric external expert , S. Both experts had considered that the applicant was a psychopath suffering from a serious dissocial personality disorder and from a sexual deviation , sadism . There was a high risk that the applicant would commit further violent sexual offences if released . The experts and all the witnesses confirmed that the applicant had not changed throughout his detention and placement in a psychiatric hospital and had not made any serious effort to reflect on his offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded . It found that Article CARDINAL of LAW was compatible with LAW and applied also to cases in which a person \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital was terminated because the person concerned had not been suffering from a disorder warranting his or her placement from the outset .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He complained , in particular , that the retrospective order for his preventive detention had violated the prohibition of retrospective punishment under LAW ( LAW ) . He argued that LAW had been applied with retrospective effect to him as , at the time of his conviction , ordering preventive detention retrospectively had not been authorised . In view of the manner in which preventive detention orders were executed in practice , there was no material difference compared to the execution of a prison sentence . Preventive detention therefore had to be treated as a penalty to which the prohibition of retrospective punishment applied .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted that the retrospective order for his preventive detention amounted to the correction of a final judgment of a criminal court without any new facts having emerged . Even though the GPE am ORG had considered , in its judgment of DATE , that the requirements of LAW had been met , it had not ordered his preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a chamber of CARDINAL judges of ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint \u2013 as well as that of another applicant , PERSON , who lodged application no . CARDINAL before this Court \u2013 on the grounds that it was ill - founded ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and Article CARDINALb \u00a7 CARDINAL had been inserted into LAW because , under ORG well - established case - law , a person could no longer be detained in a psychiatric hospital under LAW and had to be released if that person no longer suffered from a condition excluding or diminishing his criminal responsibility . This was considered problematic in cases in which the person concerned , without suffering from the said condition , was still dangerous to the public .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court found that Article CARDINAL of LAW and the ORG decision to order the applicant \u2019s placement in preventive detention retrospectively were compatible with LAW . Article CARDINAL of LAW did not breach the ban on the retrospective application of criminal laws imposed by LAW . That Article applied only to ORG measures which expressed sovereign censure of illegal and culpable conduct and involved the imposition of a sanction to compensate for guilt . Unlike such a penalty , preventive detention was not aimed at punishing criminal guilt , but was a purely preventive measure aimed at protecting the public from a dangerous offender . For the same reason , Article CARDINAL of LAW did not breach the right not to be punished twice for the same offence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further took the view that LAW was in conformity with the protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law , even if applied to a case such as that of the applicant , who had committed his offences and had been convicted and sentenced prior to the entry into force of the said provision . It considered as compatible with LAW the legislator \u2019s decision whereby the effective protection of the public from very dangerous offenders who were liable to commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims \u2013 which was a paramount public interest \u2013 outweighed the offender \u2019s interest in protection of his legitimate expectations .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the impugned provisions allowed the courts in a case like that of the applicant to amend retrospectively a sanction fixed in a previous final judgment in the light of new evidence ( in particular new expert reports ) , without new facts having come up . It emphasised that the sentencing criminal courts\u2019 decision not to order preventive detention became final even if it later emerged that the courts had erred in considering the offender not to be dangerous . Nevertheless , the retrospective preventive detention order under LAW of LAW , read in conjunction with Article CARDINAL of LAW , entailed only very limited disadvantages of constitutional relevance . In substance , the ordering of a measure of indefinite duration depriving the person concerned of his or her liberty DATE namely , placement in a psychiatric hospital DATE was merely replaced , under certain qualified conditions , by the ordering of a different such measure of indefinite duration , namely preventive detention . Any remaining disadvantages for the offender in the protection of his legitimate expectations were outweighed by the paramount interest of the public pursued by the provisions in question .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further found that Article CARDINAL of LAW was compatible with the applicant \u2019s right to liberty under LAW ( LAW ) . In order to protect the right to life , physical integrity and liberty of citizens the legislator was authorised , within the limits set by the principle of proportionality , to deprive of his liberty a person who could be expected to violate the ORG said rights .", "CARDINAL . In FAC , persons in preventive detention are placed in a separate building from prisoners serving their sentence . They have certain minor privileges compared with convicted offenders serving their sentence ( see , for instance , PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG DATE ) . As regards therapeutic measures , persons held in preventive detention in PERSON are offered a DATE discussion group proposing ideas for recreational activities and for structuring DATE life . They are further offered discussions with an external psychiatrist once per DATE as well as psychological or psychotherapeutic measures and social training considered suitable for them .", "CARDINAL . When placed in preventive detention , the applicant was not motivated to undergo therapy . He denied the offences he had been convicted of and considered himself to be detained unlawfully . Therefore , he had not been transferred to a social therapeutic department of another prison . He worked in prison in DATE and has been out of work since then . In DATE he participated in a social training course .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to suspend the execution of his preventive detention and to grant probation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against that decision . It found that there was a risk that the applicant would commit further violent sexual offences if released ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Having regard to this ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ) , ORG took the view that the question of whether the applicant \u2019s preventive detention breached the prohibition of retrospective punishment could not be examined in the present proceedings concerning the execution of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention . That issue could only be dealt with following a reopening of the proceedings in which that detention had been ordered .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the applicant again requested ORG to order his release . On DATE ORG refused to suspend the applicant \u2019s preventive detention , ordered retrospectively on DATE , and to grant probation . Having regard to the expert reports obtained in those proceedings , it found that it could not be expected that the applicant would not commit any further unlawful acts on his release ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . There was , on the contrary , a risk that the applicant , owing to specific circumstances relating to his person and his conduct in prison , would commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences soon after his release from prison . The stricter standards for a prolongation of his preventive detention set up by ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE were therefore met .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered , in particular , that according to the pertinent findings of ORG in the said judgment , a retrospective order of preventive detention following the termination of a person \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital did not breach the protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law or the prohibition of retrospective punishment . As the judgments of ORG only had the force of Federal legislation in GPE , the fact that that ORG had considered , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , that retrospective preventive detention was in breach of human rights , did not alter that conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request of DATE for a reopening of the proceedings in which his preventive detention had been ordered as inadmissible as there was currently no ground for reopening . In particular , a reopening on the ground that ORG had found a domestic court \u2019s judgment to be in breach of the LAW applied only to applicants who had themselves obtained a judgment of that ORG in their favour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ) . A summary of the provisions of LAW the right to liberty ( LAW ) and the ban on retrospective application of criminal laws ( LAW ) can also be found in that judgment ( ibid . , LAW and DATE ) . The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows :", "CARDINAL . Measures of correction and prevention ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) cover , in particular , placement in a psychiatric hospital ( LAW ) or in preventive detention ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code governs orders for a person \u2019s preventive detention made by the sentencing court when finding the person guilty of an offence . That court may , at the time of the offender \u2019s conviction , order his preventive detention ( a so - called measure of correction and prevention ) under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence ( a penalty ) , if the offender has been shown to be a danger to the public .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , under LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time , the sentencing court had to order preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone was sentenced for an intentional offence to PERCENT two years\u2019 imprisonment and if the following further conditions were satisfied . Firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , first sentence , of LAW , preventive detention may further be ordered in addition to a prison sentence if the perpetrator is sentenced for certain serious offences , including murder , rape and dangerous assault , to DATE imprisonment , if he has previously been convicted ( only ) once of CARDINAL or more such offences to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment and if the remaining requirements laid down in LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) are met .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code governs the combination of different measures of correction and prevention . If the conditions for several such measures are met , yet the desired objective may be attained by one or a part of these measures , then only those latter measures shall be ordered ( see Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Otherwise , such measures shall be ordered cumulatively unless the law provides otherwise ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Retrospective Preventive Detention Act ( Gesetz zur Einf\u00fchrung der nachtr\u00e4glichen GPE ) of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , inserted Articles CARDINALb and QUANTITY into LAW ; the latter provision was amended by LAW of DATE . The provisions in question were aimed at preventing the release of persons who could no longer be detained in a psychiatric hospital because the conditions for placement under LAW were no longer met , but who were still dangerous to the public ( see ORG documents ( ORG ) , no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In fact , under the case - law previously established by the courts dealing with the execution of sentences , a person \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital had to be terminated and the person concerned had to be released if he no longer suffered from a condition excluding or diminishing his criminal responsibility , even if that person was still dangerous to the public ( see ORG , no .

NORP the placement of the person concerned under LAW was ordered on the basis of several of the offences listed in LAW , first sentence , or if the person concerned had either already been sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment or had been placed in a psychiatric hospital because of CARDINAL or more such offences , committed prior to the offence having led to that person \u2019s placement under LAW , and", "CARDINAL . a comprehensive assessment of the person concerned , his offences and , in addition , his development during the execution of the measure revealed that it was very likely that he would again commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The said CARDINAL provisions remained valid also under LAW ( Gesetz zur Neuordnung des Rechts der Sicherungsverwahrung ) of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , for offences committed after the entry into force of that LAW . As a result of the abolition of paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Article CARDINALb of LAW , the former paragraph CARDINAL , slightly amended , became the only provision of that Article .", "CARDINAL . Article GPE of the Criminal Code governs the duration of preventive detention . Paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence , of that LAW provides that if there is no provision for a maximum duration or if the time - limit has not yet expired , the court shall suspend on probation the further execution of the detention order as soon as it is to be expected that the person concerned will not commit any further unlawful acts on his release .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code governs the detention of mentally ill persons as a measure of correction and prevention if the detention is ordered in relation to an unlawful act committed by the person concerned . It provides that if someone commits an unlawful act without criminal responsibility or with diminished criminal responsibility , the court shall order his placement \u2013 without any maximum duration \u2013 in a psychiatric hospital if a comprehensive assessment of the defendant and his acts reveals that , as a result of his condition , he can be expected to commit serious unlawful acts and that he is therefore a danger to the general public .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the ORG preventive detention beyond the former DATE maximum period and also concerning the retrospective order for a complainant \u2019s preventive detention under LAW of LAW ( file FAC . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Reversing its previous position , ORG held that all provisions concerned , both on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective ordering of such detention , were incompatible with LAW as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law , read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all the relevant provisions of LAW on the imposition and duration of preventive detention were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of persons in preventive detention . It found that those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment ( PERSON ) . These provisions included , in particular , LAW in its version in force since DATE and LAW in its version of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with LAW remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until DATE at the latest . In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged or ordered retrospectively under LAW of LAW ( but not preventive detention ordered LAW ) , the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned , owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct , were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if , additionally , they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the newly enacted Therapy Detention Act . As regards the notion of mental disorder , ORG explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of \u201c persons of unsound mind \u201d in LAW sub - paragraph ( e ) of the LAW made in this ORG \u2019s case - law ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) . If the above pre - conditions were not met , those detainees had to be released DATE . The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be further applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality ; as a general rule , proportionality was only respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , ORG relied on the interpretation of LAW made by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ; see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ss . of ORG judgment ) . It stressed , in particular , that the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment and the principles laid down in LAW required an individualised and intensified offer of therapy and care to the persons concerned . In line with the ORG \u2019s findings in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , it was necessary to provide a high level of care by a team of multi - disciplinary staff and to offer the detainees an individualised therapy if the standard therapies available in the institution did not have prospects of success ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["7"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["7-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
