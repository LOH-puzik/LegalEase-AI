On DATE the ORG partly upheld ORG and ORG claims . It held that the applicant had acted in bad faith by renouncing the inheritance while being insolvent and owing money to the claimants .

However , the court held that there was insufficient evidence to find that the applicant had de facto accepted the inheritance and dismissed that part of the claim .", "CARDINAL .

On that basis , ORG held that the applicant \u2019s sister had not inherited any property which could have been used to cover the applicant \u2019s debt to ORG , and thus there were no legal grounds to satisfy ORG claim . That judgment was not appealed against and became final .", "CARDINAL .
