In DATE the applicant discovered that there were CARDINAL vacant rooms in an old administrative building that belonged to ORG ( the army recruitment office ) , which , however , no longer occupied the building . Part of the building was occupied by an association of war veterans , but the rooms that the applicant was interested in were abandoned and in a state of neglect . The rooms were located in auxiliary LOC which had a separate entrance from the rear side of the building . The applicant occupied these rooms and conducted substantial repair work there for DATE . According to him , the other occupants of the building were aware of his activities but did not object to them . Likewise , according to the applicant , there were no objections by any public authorities to the repair works carried out by him .", "CARDINAL . After completing the repair works , at DATE the applicant left his hostel room and moved into the new dwelling together with his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL officials ( E.G. and CARDINAL ) of ORG ( \u201c the SCEA \u201d ) , an employee of the local housing maintenance and utilities board ( K.A. ) and a number of police officers arrived in the applicant 's new dwelling . They had no court order for his eviction .", "CARDINAL . At an unspecified time after the arrival of the above - mentioned officials , the applicant 's wife , PERSON , poured some kerosene on herself and ignited it , apparently in protest at what she perceived as the authorities ' intention to evict her family . It appears that CARDINAL of the police officers helped put out the fire on her body , using a blanket he found inside the applicant 's home .

According to the Government , at TIME on DATE CARDINAL ORG officials , accompanied by CARDINAL police officers , visited the LOC occupied by the applicant 's family . The aim of the visit was merely to explain to the applicant that his family was occupying these LOC illegally . The applicant immediately left , together with a child of his , and went to a post office to send a complaint against the ORG officials and the police .

By a decision of CARDINAL DATE an investigator of ORG decided not to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the death of the applicant 's wife .", "CARDINAL . Based on the witness testimonies , the investigator concluded that there was no proof supporting the applicant 's allegations that ORG had entered the applicant 's dwelling , that ORG had offered matches to PERSON , that ORG had ever asked the applicant for a bribe , or that any police officers had used force against PERSON . As there were no indications that any third persons had been in any way responsible for the fact that the applicant 's wife had attempted suicide , there were no grounds to institute criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Following this decision , the applicant sent a number of letters to ORG asking for a new investigation into the circumstances of his wife 's death with a view to determining the responsibility of the ORG officials and police officers involved in the incident . ORG Office replied , with similarly worded letters , on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . It was noted in these letters that PERSON death had been suicide and that the preliminary inquiry could not establish any responsibility on the part of the ORG officials in her death . It was also noted , however , that :", "\u201c ... during the investigation into the circumstances of the death of PERSON [ ORG ] , it was revealed that officials of ORG and certain officers of ORG had committed a number of errors [ in performing their official duties .

In the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , the investigator of ORG questioned a number of witnesses ( mostly the same ones as those who had been questioned before ) and obtained written testimonies from them ( see section F. below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator requested an expert opinion on PERSON mental condition prior to her death and how it might have affected her actions leading to the suicide . In an expert opinion of CARDINAL DATE an expert psychiatrist , having studied PERSON medical records and comments by people who had known her , concluded as follows :", "\u201c No symptoms of a psychogenic - depressive reaction potentially causing her suicide can be observed in PERSON personality and mental traits . However , in the period preceding PERSON death , she had experienced a state of emotional stress of a degree capable of influencing her behaviour . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator issued a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings . The decision stated , inter alia :", "\u201c [ According to the expert opinion of DATE , ] the act of self - immolation by PERSON was carried out in an attempt to prevent [ her family 's eviction ] . During the incident , she found herself in the extreme circumstances of facing eviction from the rooms that [ her family ] had occupied , and reacted inadequately by selfimmolating in an ostentatious manner , having decided that it would attract the attention of those who were around her , evoke in them feelings of compassion towards herself , and help her resolve the conflict situation she encountered . In the period preceding her death , PERSON had experienced emotional stress of a degree that could have influenced her subsequent actions .", "... the additional inquiry revealed that no other person had incited PERSON to commit suicide by means of either ill - treating her , debasing her dignity or intimidating her .", "The claims of [ the applicant ] have not been confirmed during the additional inquiry ... It was established that the [ ORG and police ] officials had carried out their official duties in a lawful manner , had given lawful instructions and had not committed any breaches of law when implementing those instructions , and that there had been no corpus delicti in [ their ] actions .", "Therefore ... the institution of criminal proceedings should be refused . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears that , following this decision , the applicant sent a number of letters to ORG , complaining that the investigation into the circumstances of his wife 's death had been inadequate . In letters of DATE and DATE ORG responded that the inquiry by ORG did not reveal any criminal elements in the actions of the ORG officials and that the applicant could challenge the decision of ORG Office of CARDINAL DATE in the courts .
