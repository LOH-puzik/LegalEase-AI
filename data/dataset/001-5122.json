{"ITEMID": "001-5122", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "CRAIG v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national living in GPE . She is represented before the Court by ORG , a solicitors\u2019 firm in GPE", "The applicant is a social worker working with children DATE . She also works on a voluntary basis as a classroom assistant in a local school . She is homosexual and her sexual orientation is known to her employer and to the school where she assists . The applicant has CARDINAL children DATE .", "The applicant has been involved in a homosexual relationship with L since DATE . L obtained a divorce in DATE but the custody and care of ORG CARDINAL children ( born in DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , respectively ) were the subject of ORG proceedings . In or around DATE L and her former husband agreed interim shared care arrangements according to which the children would spend alternative DATE with each parent .", "On DATE L and her former husband settled the ORG proceedings . L \u2019s former husband would have custody of the children and her access to them would continue on the basis of the shared care arrangement . L also agreed that she would not permit the children to come into contact with or remain in the company of the applicant or of any other person known to L to be lesbian . ORG made an order on DATE in the terms of this agreement . As a result of difficulties surrounding the applicant \u2019s contact with L , the matter was brought before ORG on DATE when PERSON again undertook to the ORG that she would comply with the order of CARDINAL DATE . Following another summons issued by ORG former husband , on DATE L undertook to ORG that she would instruct the applicant not to call at her home at any time when she had access to the children , and she undertook not to answer or open the door if the applicant called at her house during a scheduled access visit . ORG recorded L \u2019s undertakings in its order of DATE and dismissed the summons . Since then L lives DATE at her own address with her children and DATE with the applicant .", "During the course of the custody proceedings , social work and psychologist reports were submitted to ORG dealing , inter alia , with the applicant \u2019s position in relation to L and her children .", "The detailed report of a child and adolescent psychiatrist , PERSON , of DATE concluded that research showed there was no evidence that children living with lesbian mothers were adversely affected in terms of their sexual identity , personal development , peer relationships or social adjustment . He considered that there was no evidence that ORG sexual orientation posed a threat to the children or that GPE \u2019s relationship with the applicant would adversely affect the children . The evidence was that cohabitation between L and the applicant , provided that relationship was good , would have a positive effect on the children . Given the acrimonious relationship between L and her former husband , the children \u2019s need for stability and security , the difficulties ORG husband experienced with the shared care arrangements and since GPE was the main care giver , it was that expert \u2019s opinion that L should be granted custody with frequent access being given to GPE \u2019s former husband .", "A social work report of DATE indicated that there was nothing to suggest that L could not provide adequate care and protection for the children . Given the GPE acrimonious relationship and the children \u2019s need for stability , custody was recommended in favour of L with regular access in favour of ORG husband . A further social work report of DATE highlighted the husband \u2019s concern about L \u2019s relationship with the applicant . Having considered all of the care and custody options , the social worker indicated that he was unable to assess the children \u2019s views on their mother \u2019s homosexuality and that there was a lack of definitive research on the possible effects on the children \u2019s developments of being in the custody of L who was homosexual . He found it extremely difficult to make a definite recommendation , but considered that custody should be given to L , her husband \u2019s condition as regards the children having no contact with the applicant being considered \u201c untenable \u201d .", "Dr Harbinson , a consultant psychiatrist , did not agree with PERSON report of DATE . In his report of DATE , he considered that it was difficult to dismiss the vital importance of parents as role models for their children and the stigmatisation attached in our society to homosexuality . He considered that it would not be wise to raise the issue of ORG homosexuality with the children at that stage .", "PERSON produced an addendum to his report in DATE pointing out that PERSON had done limited research on lesbian couples and children and had misinterpreted the research quoted . He repeated that it was not the sexual orientation of parents that was the issue but rather the quality of the GPE relationship . He added that psychological studies had shown that where the mother ( the main care giver ) was living with her lesbian partner , the mother was psychologically more secure and stable and this was , in turn , beneficial for the children . He confirmed his recommendation that L have custody of the children , with her husband having regular access ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
