He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was appointed a junior inspector in the police . He was responsible for the investigation of economic crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal investigation was started against the applicant . He was suspected of forging documents and appropriating value added tax . The applicant was arrested on the same day and placed under arrest for DATE by the decision of the GPE DATE ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was suspended from performing his official duties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of fraud and abuse of office . The court stated that the applicant and several other people had established a fictitious company , forged documents and acquired property of high value . The court also noted that the applicant had been employed at the police division which investigated economic crimes , however , he had abused his position and had wilfully appropriated value added tax . The applicant was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining that the court of first instance had made mistakes in applying the provisions of the domestic law , and that there had been no information that he had in fact received CARDINAL of the value added tax appropriated by the perpetrators as alleged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding contradictions in his statements . The applicant had denied his guilt but at the same time he had acknowledged that he had known that other people had been engaged in illegal activities and had still acted as an intermediary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was dismissed from the police after the judgment of ORG became enforceable ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and on DATE ORG returned the case to ORG for fresh examination . ORG held that the reasoning of ORG had been insufficient in relation to the application of the provisions of LAW and the assessment of evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that only one witness could confirm that the applicant had received CARDINAL of the value added tax appropriated by the perpetrators , but that that witness had only presented his evidence as his own view and not as a fact ( ne kaip fakt\u0105 ) . The witness had also testified that there had been no discussion with the applicant about seizing the value added tax . ORG therefore held that it had not been proved that the applicant had gained any personal benefit . On the other hand , the court stated that the applicant , as a police officer , had undoubtedly understood the illegality of his actions , despite arguing otherwise . He had also acted as an intermediary for CARDINAL other people in an illegal exchange of money and documents . However , ORG held that the applicant \u2019s alleged crime fell under a different provision of LAW than the one he had originally been accused under , and that the court could not assess the applicant \u2019s crime under that specific provision without overstepping the limits of the appeal . As for abuse of office , the court held that the applicant \u2019s participation in the crime had not been proved and that he had communicated with the other people in a personal capacity rather than an official one . The applicant was therefore acquitted of that crime .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant asked the police to annul their dismissal decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and to reinstate him to his former position . The police refused and stated that ORG had not expressed itself in any way regarding his reinstatement to his former position or about his dismissal being illegal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started court proceedings before ORG to be reinstated to his former position and have his salary paid from DATE , when he had been suspended ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , until the execution of the court \u2019s judgment , i. e. until his reinstatement to his former position . The applicant also asked for a renewal of the time - limit for submitting his complaint because the timelimit to complain about being dismissed from work was DATE under domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant had been dismissed on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , however , the grounds to annul that decision had only arisen after the court proceedings had ended on DATE and he had been acquitted ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that the applicant had become aware of the grounds to contest the dismissal order on DATE at the latest . He had submitted the complaint to ORG on DATE and had therefore not missed the prescribed time - limit . The court also annulled his dismissal from the police ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and ordered that he be reinstated to his former position and paid his average salary for the period from DATE to the date of the judgment on DATE . The total of the average salary for the period was CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police and the applicant both appealed , the latter asking to be awarded approximately LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) for the period of his suspension and dismissal , up to ORG decision of DATE . He also asked to be awarded the payment of an average salary from DATE until his reinstatement to his former position , as well as late - payment fees and payment for unused holidays .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court noted that the applicant had complained about the dismissal order of DATE but found that although he had submitted his first complaint on DATE , he had also submitted CARDINAL clarifying complaints on DATE and DATE . ORG thus held that the date of submission was DATE , as that was when the applicant had finally formulated his complaints . ORG held that the dismissal order had been an extremely important social issue for the applicant ( parei\u0161k\u0117jui ypating\u0105 socialin\u0119 reik\u0161m\u0119 turintis klausimas ) , that he should have started court proceedings within DATE of that order , and that therefore he had missed the time - limit to lodge a complaint . The court also observed that ORG had put too much weight ( neteisingai sureik\u0161mino ) on the applicant \u2019s acquittal . The court also considered that despite the fact that the applicant had missed the time - limit for submitting his complaint , it had to express itself on the merits of the applicant \u2019s complaint about his dismissal and found that it had never been contested by the parties that at the time of the order to dismiss him there had been factual and legal grounds for such a decision because of ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Lastly , the court held that monetary claims under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had to be submitted to civil courts rather than administrative courts and it therefore rejected that claim too .", "CARDINAL . Shortly before the applicant applied to ORG DATE he started civil proceedings for damages for his unlawful conviction before ORG . The applicant asked to be awarded LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in respect of pecuniary damage and LTL MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in respect of non - pecuniary damage . The applicant stated that he had never been reinstated to his former position after his acquittal , had lost his main source of income , and had experienced emotional problems , not only because of his unlawful conviction but also because of the lengthy criminal proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG satisfied the applicant \u2019s claim in part . The court held that in order for the ORG \u2019s civil liability to arise , CARDINAL conditions had to be met : an unlawful act , damage and a causal link between the CARDINAL . The court held that the acquittal decision had not automatically meant that all acts related to the criminal prosecution had been unlawful . The court referred to the material of the criminal case and stated that the criminal proceedings had been started against the applicant because there had been enough evidence to suspect that he had committed a criminal offence . That circumstance was confirmed by the acquittal decision , which had stated that the applicant had undoubtedly understood the illegality of his acts ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , the court held that while the dismissal order had been lawful at the time it had been issued , the grounds for it had disappeared after the applicant \u2019s acquittal . The court dismissed his claim in respect of pecuniary damage , observing that although his unlawful conviction had directly influenced his dismissal , the conviction itself had been influenced by the applicant \u2019s illegal acts . The court further held that the applicant \u2019s unlawful conviction had caused him mental suffering and emotional distress and decided to award him LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) for non - pecuniary damage . The court also noted that the applicant had been arrested on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and acquitted on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and that therefore the criminal proceedings against him had lasted for DATE . They had been unjustifiably long and so the court awarded him a further LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) for nonpecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining that he had not been awarded anything in respect of pecuniary damage and asking the court to increase the amount in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s appeal in part . It held that the acquittal had not necessarily meant that the acts of the law enforcement institutions ( teis\u0117saugos institucij\u0173 veiksmai ) had been unlawful . The court further observed that the applicant had carried out certain acts that were unlawful under \u201c civil law \u201d , which meant that he could not have expected the same protection when deciding on damages as a person who had not carried out such illegal acts . The court considered that the amount of compensation could be reduced in such cases and awarded him LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in respect of pecuniary damage , counting it as unpaid salary from the date of the decision by which he had been convicted until the date of the decision he had been acquitted . The court also held that the criminal proceedings had been lengthy , but that around QUANTITY hearings had been postponed for reasons related to the applicant and some of the other accused . It therefore decided to award the applicant LTL QUANTITY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in respect of nonpecuniary damage in that part . Lastly , the court found that the applicant \u2019s conviction had lasted for DATE but that he had not started serving a sentence and so it decided to reduce the amount awarded for nonpecuniary damage to LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was paid his compensation award DATE totalling LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) DATE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , LAW ( CARDINAL) of the Statute on Interior Ministry Service ( ORG tarnybos statutas ) provided that an officer could be dismissed if he had been convicted of an intentional crime or criminal act by a final court judgment .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ( PERSON byl\u0173 teisenos \u012fstatymas ) provided at the time that a complaint had to be brought before an administrative court within DATE of the disputed act being carried out or served on an interested party .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG provided that if there was a good reason for not complying with the time - limit to lodge a complaint then an applicant could seek an order from an administrative court to renew the time - limit .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code provided at the time of the events that the acts of a victim could be grounds to reduce or remove civil liability . Such acts were those that were the fault of the victim and which led to that person suffering greater damage . They could be a victim \u2019s consent to damage or risk . Such consent could only be grounds for exemption from civil liability if it was not contrary to mandatory legal rules , public order , good morals , and the criteria of good faith , reasonableness and justice .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW allowed a civil claim to be brought in respect of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage caused by the unlawful acts of the investigating authorities or the courts . LAW in question made provision for compensation for unlawful conviction , unlawful arrest or detention or for the application of unlawful procedural measures in enforcement proceedings . The relevant part of the provision read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Damage resulting either from unlawful conviction , unlawful arrest on remand , unlawful detention , the application of unlawful procedural measures in enforcement proceedings , or the unlawful imposition of an administrative penalty ( arrest ) shall give rise to full compensation by the ORG , irrespective of any fault by preliminary investigation officials , prosecution officials or courts ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code provided at the time that if a victim \u2019s gross negligence had contributed to causing or increasing any damage , depending on the degree of the person \u2019s fault , the amount of compensation could be reduced or the compensation dismissed unless the law provided otherwise .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided that an appellate court judgment became enforceable from the date of issue .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provided that ORG had the power to examine appeals on points of law against judgments delivered by courts of first instance and appellate courts that had become final .", "CARDINAL . ORG has held that interpreting LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as precluding the reinstatement of an officer to his or her former position or an equivalent position after his or her acquittal would contradict the principles of justice , reasonableness and ex iniuria ius non oritur ( decision of CARDINAL DATE , no .
