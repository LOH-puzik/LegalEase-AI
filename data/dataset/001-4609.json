THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are NORP citizens , born in DATE . They are twin brothers , resident in GPE . They own an island , GPE , in LOC . They also own \" The NORP \" newspaper . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , solicitor , of PERSON White Durrant , with Mr PERSON . The facts of the application , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "A.", "The applicants bought PERSON in order to build a private residence there for themselves and their family .", "In DATE , a producer of the television programme \" The Spin \" wrote to the applicants ' lawyers requesting an interview with the applicants on the issue of The NORP and their home on GPE . The request was referred to the Editor in Chief of The NORP , who offered to answer questions concerning the newspaper , and stated that the applicants did not wish do be interviewed and that they refused permission for anyone to enter GPE without their express permission .", "The producer nevertheless arranged for a reporter on The Spin to be taken to the island in a small boat , and for his unauthorised landing to be filmed by a film crew . When challenged about his landing , the reporter told an employee of the building contractors that he had come for a meeting with the applicants . The reporter then walked about the island until challenged by a Mr Field . The reporter initially told PERSON that he did not have any recording equipment on him , but later produced a radio , a voice microphone and a battery pack . Mr Field then sought to escort the reporter off the island . In order to secure the reporter 's departure , Mr Field used the reporter 's radio to speak to a person , identified by the reporter as his producer , to ask for the reporter to be picked up again . The producer informed Mr. PERSON that he no longer had the boat , with the result that the applicants had to arrange for a boat to be chartered , at their expense , to ensure the reporter 's return to ORG .", "The applicants complained about the invasion of privacy to ORG ( ORG ) , which denied jurisdiction unless and until the relevant issue of The ORG was broadcast . The applicants ' challenge by way of judicial review to that decision of the ORG failed on DATE , leave to apply for judicial review having been granted on DATE . In his judgment on the application for judicial review , Mr Justice PERSON agreed that on a proper construction of LAW DATE , the ORG had no role to play until a broadcast had occurred . He observed :", "\" The law of GPE and GPE at present places no general constraints upon invasions of privacy as such . LAW DATE unambiguously limits the power of the [ ORG ] to adjudication upon complaints of infringement of privacy against the ORG arising out of programmes which have been broadcast . If an unwarranted infringement of privacy has been committed by the ORG otherwise that in connection with the obtaining of material included in a broadcast programme - whether because the nexus is insufficient or because no programme has been broadcast - the Commission is without adjudicative power . It can not therefore entertain an anticipatory complaint even where , once the programme is broadcast , the complaint is bound to succeed . It follows that in this field and to this extent , as elsewhere in LANGUAGE law , the individual is without an effective remedy before a national authority if the right to respect for his or her private and family life is violated . \"", "Leave to appeal was refused .", "On DATE , the ORG delivered its adjudication on the applicants ' complaint following the broadcast of The Spin , which had taken place on DATE . The ORG found , inter alia , that \" in landing on the ORG ' private island and in broadcasting footage obtained , the ORG unwarrantably infringed the ORG ' privacy \" .", "In separate proceedings relating to a different broadcast , ORG on DATE awarded the applicants FFCARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL against the reporter .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "ORG ( ORG ) was created in its present form by LAW DATE ( LAW ) . By LAW , its function is to consider and adjudicate upon complaints of :", "( a ) unjust or unfair treatment in programmes to which this Part applies , or", "( b ) unwarranted infringement of privacy in , or in connection with the obtaining of material included in , such programmes .", "The relevant Part of the DATE Act applies to \" any television or sound programme broadcast by the ORG or after [ DATE ] ... \" .", "Under Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , where the ORG has considered and adjudicated upon a complaint , it may give the following directions , namely :", "\" directions requiring [ the ORG ] to publish the matters mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL ) in such manner , and within such period , as may be specified in the directions \" .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides that :", "\" Those matters are -", "( a ) a summary of the complaint ; and", "( b ) the ORG 's findings on the complaint or a summary of them . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
