ORG On DATE the PERSON of Emmen ordered PERSON emergency confinement in a psychiatric hospital pursuant to section DATE ( b ) of LAW ( PERSON , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . His decision was based on a medical report drawn up DATE by a psychiatrist , PERSON , according to which there were serious grounds for believing that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder representing an immediate danger to himself , to others and to public order . PERSON had already threatened members of his family and attacked a neighbour in her house .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the Crown Prosecutor ( PERSON ) requested the President of ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of PERSON to extend the applicant \u2019s confinement . In addition to the file attached to this application , the President received a police report dated DATE containing the statements of various witnesses and of PERSON wife , and a memorandum , of the same date , setting out the opinion of the applicant \u2019s doctor , PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , in the presence of Mr Jongeneelen , PERSON \" confidential counsellor \" ( patientenvertrouwenspersoon ) , the ORG President interviewed the applicant together with a psychiatrist , PERSON then consulted CARDINAL other persons by telephone - PERSON , PERSON wife and another doctor , PERSON made a brief note of their statements . Again by telephone , he gave a summary of the resulting information to PERSON .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , Mr Jongeneelen told the applicant \u2019s lawyer that this conversation , which had lasted TIME , had taken place at his request and had given him ( Mr Jongeneelen ) an opportunity to put forward his views ; DATE after the conversation , the President had communicated the whole file to him .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the President ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s confinement pursuant to sections CARDINAL ( i ) and DATE ( j ) of LAW . Referring to the medical report by PERSON ( see paragraph PERSON above ) and the statements of PERSON , Dr. PERSON and the CARDINAL persons whom he had questioned by telephone ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) , he considered that , because of his mental illness , the applicant was an immediate danger to himself , to others and to public order . The President added that it was clear from the statements which he himself had obtained and those contained in the police report of CARDINAL DATE that PERSON had already caused considerable disturbance to his neighbours . It was therefore to be feared that , as he was unaware of the effect of his actions on others , he would continue his unacceptable behaviour if he were to return home .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON left the hospital on DATE . On DATE the President of ORG sent to the applicant \u2019s lawyer , at the latter \u2019s request , various documents from the file , including the note that he had made after interviewing PERSON and hearing the views of the persons whom he had questioned by telephone . He explained that circumstances relating to the organisation of the court made it impossible to arrange for a registrar to be present in every case of emergency confinement . There were CARDINAL large psychiatric hospitals within the court \u2019s jurisdiction and it was a small court .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant filed an appeal on points of law with ORG ( PERSON ) against the order of CARDINAL DATE . He complained that the President of ORG had not specified sufficiently the nature of the danger which his mental illness represented for himself and for public order , that the President had held a hearing without a registrar \u2019s being present to draw up a record and , finally , that , before making the order , the President had failed to communicate to him the text of the statements of the persons whom he had telephoned , thereby depriving the applicant of any opportunity to react thereto .", "CARDINAL . ORG In his submissions of CARDINAL DATE , the Attorney General at ORG ( ORG ) expressed the view that the second of these grounds ( and only the second ) was well - founded . However , on DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible , finding that Mr PERSON no longer had any interest in having the contested order quashed since the maximum period for an emergency confinement had already expired .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the GPE the confinement of mentally ill persons is governed by LAW of DATE on ORG , commonly known as LAW ( PERSON , \" LAW \" ) .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL ( b ) to CARDINAL ( j ) make provision for the emergency committal procedure which was followed in the present case .", "Where there are serious grounds for believing that a person represents an immediate danger to himself , to others or to public order on account of mental illness , the burgomaster of the municipality in which he resides is empowered to order his compulsory committal ( inbewaringstelling ) to a psychiatric hospital ( section CARDINAL ( b ) ) .", "In so doing , the PERSON is required first to seek the opinion of a psychiatrist or , if that proves impossible , of another medical practitioner ( section CARDINAL ( c ) ) . As soon as he has ordered a confinement , he must inform the Crown Prosecutor and transmit to him the medical certificate on which he based his decision ( section CARDINAL ( e ) ) . ORG has then , in his turn , to forward the certificate to the President of ORG , not later than DATE , requesting , where appropriate , the continuation of the confinement ( section CARDINAL ( i ) ) . The President must give his decision within DATE . An order to continue the confinement is valid for DATE , but the President may renew it for a second period of the same length if , before the expiry of the first period , an application for judicial authorisation for confinement ( rechterlijke machtiging , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) is made ( section CARDINAL ( j ) ) .", "CARDINAL .

ORG has held that , in view of the importance of having up - to - date information as a basis for a confinement decision , the judge may be justified in using information obtained by telephone . He must , however , communicate any such information to the person concerned or his counsel in order to enable them to comment on it .

ORG On the question of the presence and the role of the registrar during hearings held pursuant to LAW , ORG has stated as follows :", "\" Having regard to the serious nature of decisions taken under LAW , to the requirements which have accordingly to be complied with in respect of the statement of the reasons on which they are based and to the importance of its being possible to review , in cassation proceedings , their conformity with those requirements , a record , signed by the registrar , must be made of any interviews effected and any questioning at the hearing .
