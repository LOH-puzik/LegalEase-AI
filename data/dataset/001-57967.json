PORTUGAL", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 8;No violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG Mr PERSON Barreto , a NORP national born in DATE , is an office worker . He married in DATE and he and his wife have CARDINAL child , born on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG When the applicant was still single he lived with his parents . Since his marriage he has lived in a house rented by his parents - in - law . CARDINAL of his wife 's brothers and CARDINAL of her aunts have also lived there at various times in that period . The house , in GPE ( Madeira ) , has QUANTITY bedrooms , a kitchen , a living - cum - dining room and a basement .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE Mr PERSON inherited from his parents a house also situated in GPE . This house , which has been let for residential use to GPE since DATE , has CARDINAL bedrooms , a kitchen and a bathroom . The rent , which had initially been fixed at QUANTITY ( PTE ) , was PTE CARDINAL at the time when the proceedings began .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant and his wife brought proceedings against GPE and his wife in ORG . Relying on Articles DATE and DATE of LAW , they asked the court to terminate the lease on the ground that they needed to occupy the property as their own home .", "CARDINAL . ORG found against the applicant and his wife on CARDINAL DATE . It held that CARDINAL of the statutory requirements for termination had not been satisfied , since the applicant had not established facts which proved a real need to occupy the house himself .", "The reasons given by the judge included the following considerations :", "\" A landlord 's need to terminate a lease must be assessed mainly in the light of his family circumstances , his living conditions and/or his occupational status at the time when the action is brought or foreseeable in the immediate future .", "In that connection , the following facts have already been established : that ' since his marriage , in DATE , Mr PERSON has lived with his parents - in - law in the Travessa do PERSON , [ Funchal ] ' ; that ' PERSON 's parents , PERSON and PERSON and their son , one of PERSON brothers and CARDINAL of her aunts ... lived in the house ' ; that ' the plaintiffs ' house has CARDINAL bedrooms , a kitchen and a bathroom ' ; that ' the house where the plaintiffs live has CARDINAL bedrooms on the first floor , a kitchen and a living - cum - dining room on the ground floor and a basement ' ; that ' Mr PERSON parents - in - law , who are at present the sole occupants , with PERSON and PERSON and their son , of the house in the Travessa do PERSON , are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son , since they have nowhere else to live ' ; and that ' the plaintiffs both work in GPE ' .", "It should be noted that PERSON CARDINAL aunts and her brother no longer live in the house where the plaintiffs are now living and that this has increased the available living space and privacy that all human beings need . The plaintiffs ' living conditions are better now than they were when the action was brought , since they even have a bedroom for their son .", "Moreover , the plaintiffs did not succeed in proving , as the onus was on them to do , that the relations between themselves and PERSON parents were permanently strained and conflictual . What is certain , however , is that no link whatsoever has been established between their son 's illness and their living conditions in that house .", "It might be said - and after all it has been proved that the plaintiffs live with PERSON PERSON parents , ' who are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son , since they have nowhere else to live ' - that in view of the adage ' When a man marries he needs a house ' , cited by Mr PERSON in his first application , the existence of a marriage should be sufficient to establish a need to recover possession of the rented property in order to live there .", "...", "However , each case is unique . Regard being had to the facts found to have been established and those asserted by the plaintiffs in support of their claims , but not established , and given that the concept of the need to occupy must be interpreted as a state of necessity , to be objectively assessed on the basis of a reasonable criterion , in the light of everyday experience , it can not be denied that the facts as a whole do not support the conclusion that the plaintiffs need the property in question in order to live there .", "Their living conditions would certainly be better and more comfortable in the house let to the defendants , but the real need required by case - law does not exist , nor is this a case where it is absolutely necessary or essential for the plaintiffs to recover possession of the accommodation .", "It follows that , although the other conditions in Article DATE of LAW have been satisfied , the plaintiffs ' application must be considered inadmissible , since they have not established that they are entitled to terminate the lease under Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( a ) .", "In conclusion , without finding it necessary to add any further considerations , I declare unfounded , for lack of evidence , the present action for termination of the lease and eviction of the tenant ( processo especial de despejo ) , and find against the plaintiffs ... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE Mr PERSON appealed against this judgment to ORG . Referring to the underlying intention of the legislation concerning the right to terminate a lease , he argued that he and his family had the right to live in a home they did not have to share with anyone .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG upheld the impugned judgment . It held that the house of the applicant 's parents - in - law was large enough for all the people who lived in it , including the applicant , his wife and his son . There was therefore no real need for Mr PERSON to live in the house he owned .", "ORG gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\" In order to establish need , plaintiffs must cite specific facts which , once proved , establish the existence of a real , serious and present need , adducing weighty rather than purely hypothetical arguments . It is not sufficient to desire , to wish or to claim .", "...", "In order to be able to exercise their right [ to terminate the lease ] , the applicants must adduce evidence of those facts ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "...", "... it is established that :", "( a ) the house where the plaintiffs live has CARDINAL bedrooms on the first floor , a kitchen and a living - cum - dining room on the ground floor and a basement ;", "( b ) at present that house is occupied by Mr PERSON parents - in - law , the plaintiffs and their son , that is CARDINAL people altogether ; and", "( c ) Mr PERSON parents - in - law are resigned to the presence in the house of the plaintiffs and their son .", "As the house has CARDINAL bedrooms , the plaintiffs can occupy CARDINAL room and their son another .", "The house has enough bedrooms for all the members of the family to be able to live there .", "Each couple has a bedroom and the plaintiffs ' son has his . And there is still CARDINAL bedroom left over .", "The judgment must reflect the situation at the conclusion of the evidence and argument ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) .", "Since it has not been proved that the plaintiffs are in a precarious situation , the fact that they live with PERSON parents , albeit by their favour , is manifestly insufficient to prove the need required by LAW ... Moreover , the plaintiffs have not proved that there was tension which made it intolerable for them all to live in the same house .", "Derogation from the general principle and eviction of the tenant for the benefit of the landlord are possible only where it appears to be absolutely necessary , for weighty reasons , for the landlord to live in the property ( LAW ) .", "In the light of the foregoing considerations , and because the plaintiffs have not proved need as set out above and as this court interprets it , the appeal is inadmissible and the judgment is upheld . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG No appeal lay against the above judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG The following is a translation of the main provisions of LAW applicable at the material time to the termination of tenancy contracts on residential property :", "... A landlord shall not have the right to terminate a [ tenancy ] contract , which shall be tacitly renewed unless terminated by the tenant in accordance with LAW . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG A landlord may seek termination of a [ tenancy ] contract on its expiry in the following cases :", "( a ) when he needs ( necessite ) the property in order to live there or to build his home there .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The right of a landlord to seek the termination of a [ tenancy ] contract in order to occupy the property as his home shall be subject to the following conditions :", "( a ) he must have owned ... the property for DATE or have acquired it by inheritance , in which case this qualifying period shall not apply ;", "( b ) he must not have been in occupation of another residence in the area where the property covered by the [ tenancy ] contract is situated , either as owner or tenant , for DATE ; and", "( c ) he must not previously have sought to terminate the contract .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG According to established case - law ( ORG judgments of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) , a landlord 's right to terminate a lease in order to occupy the property as his home may be exercised only when , in addition to the conditions laid down in DATE LAW , the condition laid down in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( a ) , namely the landlord 's real need to live in the property , has been satisfied .", "CARDINAL . ORG These rules were amended by the legislative decree of DATE , but this did not introduce any fundamental change regarding the possibility of termination ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
