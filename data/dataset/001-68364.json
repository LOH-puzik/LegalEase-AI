The applicable provisions originated in the exceptionally rigid distribution of housing resources which characterised DATE of the communist regime in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The circumstances did not change significantly after the end of the communist rule in DATE ; indeed , at DATE the situation of housing in GPE was particularly difficult , as was demonstrated , on the one hand , by a shortage of dwellings and , on the other hand , by the high cost of acquiring a flat . The ORG - controlled rent , which also applied to privately owned buildings , covered merely PERCENT of the actual cost of maintenance of buildings .", "In DATE those social and economic factors prompted the legislature not only to maintain elements of the so - called \u201c special lease scheme \u201d ( szczeg\u00f3lny tryb najmu ) ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) in respect of ORG - owned dwellings but also to continue to apply that scheme DATE temporarily , for a period of DATE expiring on DATE to privately owned buildings and dwellings .

According to that report , in DATE , after DATE of the operation of the DATE rent control scheme , the average rent as fixed under that scheme covered PERCENT of the costs of maintenance of residential buildings . The shortfall was to be covered by landlords .

The relevant provisions of LAW , namely section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) , stipulated that a tenant had to vacate a dwelling only if the owner had offered him another flat owned by him or the municipality had agreed to provide the tenant with an alternative accommodation owned or administered by it .

Nor was it liable for the implementation of the special lease scheme introduced by LAW and the operation of LAW , which incorporated certain similar rules for the protection of tenants whose right to lease flats in privately owned houses had been conferred on them by administrative decisions ( see also paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . Lastly , the court noted that the defendant could not be liable for any damage caused by the applicant \u2019s tenants .", "CARDINAL .

It also listed the types of maintenance work to be carried out by landlords under lease agreements . That section provided , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

In practice , if such a tenant had not fallen into CARDINAL CARDINAL months\u2019 arrears of controlled rent , the lease could not be terminated unless he or she had used the flat \u201c in a manner inconsistent with its function \u201d , damaged the flat or the building , repeatedly and flagrantly disturbed the peace and upset order or had sublet the flat without obtaining the prior consent of the landlord ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "However , even if a tenant had fallen into rent arrears exceeding DATE , a landlord was obliged to notify him in writing of his intention to terminate the lease agreement and to allow him a DATE time - limit to pay off both the arrears and DATE rent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , ruling on a legal question referred to it by ORG , declared unconstitutional section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) read in conjunction with , inter alia , section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . It found that those provisions were in breach of LAW ( protection of property rights ) read in conjunction with LAW rule of law and social justice ) and LAW ( principle of proportionality ) of the LAW ( see also paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) and LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention because they had placed a disproportionately heavy and , from the point of view of the permitted restrictions on the right of property , unnecessary financial burden on the exercise of property rights by landlords owning flats subject to rent control .", "The court ruled that the unconstitutional provisions should be repealed on DATE . That in practice meant that by that date ORG had to enact new , constitutional legislation dealing with the matter .", "CARDINAL . Before giving its judgment , ORG asked the President of ORG ( Prezes PERSON i PERSON ) for information concerning the implementation of the CARDINAL Act and , more particularly , the manner of determining the \u201c conversion index of QUANTITY of the usable surface area of the residential building \u201d as referred to in section CARDINAL of the Act . According to the information received , levels of controlled rent had never reached the statutory PERCENT of the reconstruction value referred to in section GPE ) but were determined by the municipalities at PERCENT of that figure . As a result , the levels of controlled rent covered merely PERCENT of the maintenance costs of residential dwellings . The rest had to be covered by landlords from their own resources . That did not allow them to put aside any sums for repairs .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment ORG attached much importance to the fact that the relevant regulations concerning controlled rent had brought about a situation whereby the expenses incurred by owners of dwellings were much higher than the rent paid by tenants and that the former \u201c had no influence on how the rates of controlled rent were determined \u201d . In its view , that shortfall of the rent actually received had resulted in the progressive reduction of the value of tenement houses and this , with the passage of time , entailed consequences similar to expropriation .", "The judgment contains extensive reasoning , the gist of which can be summarised as follows .", "\u201c CARDINAL of the essential elements of the right of property is the possibility of deriving profit from the object of ownership , which is of particular importance in a market economy . The legislature may regulate and limit this right in view of , among other things , the social context of enjoyment of property and duties towards the community that are inherent in ownership . In exceptional cases , ... it is even [ acceptable ] to exclude temporarily the possibility of ... deriving an income from goods that are the subject of ownership . However , if the limitations on a property right go even further and the legislature places an owner in a situation in which his property necessarily inflicts losses on him , while , at the same time imposing on him a duty to maintain property in a specific condition , it can be said that there is a limitation which impairs the very essence of that right . ...", "ORG observes that the applicable provisions very seriously limit the possibility for a landlord to use and dispose of his dwellings , as referred to in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act . In particular , under this section all earlier tenancy relationships , in so far as they originated in administrative decisions on the allocation of a dwelling ... were transformed into contractual leases for an indefinite period . ...", "ORG will not assess the compatibility of those regulations with LAW , as this is not the object of its ruling . It merely observes that , against that background , the owner of a building is practically deprived of any influence on the choice of tenants in his building and on whether the lease relationships with those persons should continue . ...", "Thus , the possibility [ for a landlord ] to enjoy and dispose of property is very considerably limited . While it is not totally extinguished , as he may still sell his building ( dwelling ) or take out a mortgage on it and there are no restrictions on succession rights , the exclusion of the owner \u2019s right to dispose of dwellings subject to the provisions of the DATE Act results in the depreciation of the market value of the building . By the same token , other attributes which have so far not been taken away from the owner , such as the possibility of enjoying and disposing [ of his property ] , are substantially reduced and his property right becomes illusory .", "At the same time , the legal provisions impose on the owner of the building a number of onerous duties ... Not only do most of the applicable laws impose specific duties on the owner but they also provide for specific penalties for failure to comply with those duties or to discharge them properly . ...", "ORG considers that LAW and , especially , its practical application have not secured a sufficient mechanism for balancing the costs of maintaining a building , its equipment and surroundings and the income from controlled rent . ...", "ORG considers it necessary to draw attention to CARDINAL further points which are relevant for the situation of the landlord .", "First , the inadequacy of controlled rent vis \u00e0 vis real expenses for maintenance of a building does not allow ... [ landlords ] to put aside savings for repairs and for keeping the building in a good condition . As a result , the tenement houses are gradually losing value . In terms of property rights , this should be perceived as a process of gradual deprivation of this right , leading , with the passage of time , to results similar to expropriation . Also , it has a general impact on the community because many tenement houses are approaching the time of their \u2018 technical ORG and , in consequence , not only will the owner lose his property but tenants will also lose the possibility of housing , which will hardly be compatible with LAW .", "Secondly , the inadequacy of controlled rent vis \u00e0 vis real expenses for maintenance of a building has not been duly recognised by the tax laws ... [ Under those laws ] , landlords are treated in the same way as businessmen or a person letting dwellings for a profit and must bear the financial consequences of all losses caused by the lease of their dwellings . ...", "[ As regards the principle of proportionality laid down in LAW ]", "... it may be justified to fix rent in such a way that it will not be disproportionate to the financial standing of tenants , so that it will be possible for them to maintain a decent standard of living ( or at least a minimum standard ) after paying the rent . Thus , it is in conformity with the contemporary perception of a \u201c social state \u201d to demand some sacrifice from all members of society for the benefit of those who can not provide subsistence for themselves and their families . By the nature of things , the extent of that sacrifice depends on the level of income and imposes a heavier burden on those who are better off . By the nature of things , the owners of property may be required to make sacrifices , according to the general principle that \u2018 ownership entails ORG . However , the distribution of burdens among specific members of society can not be arbitrary and must maintain rational proportions .", "In the circumstances obtaining in GPE , pursuant to LAW , it may be justified to maintain the provisions limiting landlords\u2019 property rights and , more particularly , excluding unrestricted freedom in fixing rates of rent and other charges collected from tenants . ... It may still \u2013 in any event in the transitional DATE be justified to impose further - reaching restrictions on property rights , precluding the freedom to derive profit by fixing levels of rent in such a way as to cover only the costs of maintenance and upkeep of the building .", "However , an assessment of the DATE Act leads to the conclusion that the applicable restrictions do not stop there . The present regulations deliberately set the levels of controlled rents below the costs and expenses actually incurred by owners . That , in itself , would not necessarily have had to be considered unconstitutional had there been any parallel legal mechanism compensating for incurred losses . No such mechanisms have been set up . In consequence , the applicable provisions are based on the premise that property must \u2013 until DATE entail losses for the owner and that , at the same time , the owner has a duty to incur expenses to maintain his property in a particular condition .", "That means that LAW placed the main burden of the sacrifices that society had to make for tenants , or at least for tenants in a difficult financial position , on the owners of property . Besides , other remedies \u2013 such as , for instance , subsidising from the public funds the costs of maintaining and repairing buildings referred to in section CARDINAL ) , ensuring full recognition in the tax regulations for losses and expenses incurred by landlords and making the level of rent dependent on the tenant \u2019s income \u2013 have not been employed . Instead , the simplest means ( being apparently the cheapest in social terms ) have been applied , namely setting a low maximum level of rent and allowing the municipalities to make exceptions to that level . Consequently , it has been assumed that owners will cover the remaining costs of maintaining their property out of their own pockets . No proportionality whatsoever has been maintained in respect of the distribution of burdens ( sacrifices ) among the owners and the other members of society .", "ORG would stress once again that in the present context there is a constitutionally acknowledged necessity to protect the rights of tenants ... and this may be reflected in , among other things , provisions fixing a maximum level of rent . However , there is no constitutional necessity to afford them such protection mostly at the expense of private individuals \u2013 the owners of dwellings DATE because the duty to help the underprivileged and [ the duties inherent in ] social solidarity are incumbent not only upon those persons . It is possible to adopt other legal solutions so as to secure at the same time the necessary protection to tenants and the minimum financial means needed to cover the requisite costs to the landlords . ... It is not for ORG to indicate concrete solutions and to determine the ratio of costs to be incurred by tenants , landlords and the community as a whole . However , this court considers that there are no constitutional considerations to justify imposing the greater part of those costs on the landlords . ...", "Consequently , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) is incompatible with the LAW . A limitation on the right of property ... which is not \u2018 ORG does not satisfy the constitutional requirements of proportionality .", "[ Other considerations ]", "The finding that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) infringes the principle of proportionality makes it unnecessary for ORG to determine whether that provision also infringes the very essence of the right of property since [ a further finding to that effect ] will not affect the merits of the ruling . It should merely be noted in passing that the question whether the \u201c essence \u201d of the right of property has been preserved must also be assessed ... against the background of the combination of existing limitations on this right . ... The manner in which [ rent control ] has been effected by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , taken together with other provisions regarding privately owned buildings has [ resulted ] in the owners being deprived even of the slightest substance of their property rights .", "It is ORG opinion that , in consequence , the right to derive profit from property , which is an important element of the right of property , has been destroyed and , at the same time , the second element , the right to dispose of CARDINAL \u2019s property , has been stripped of its substance . In consequence , the right of property has become illusory and unable to fulfil its purpose in the legal order based on the principles listed in LAW [ principles of social market economy , economic activity , private ownership , solidarity , dialogue and cooperation ] .", "[ As regards the constitutional aspects of the situation of tenants ]", "A kind of obligation has been placed on the legislature to ensure that up to DATE tenancy relationships concerning municipal dwellings and [ privately owned ] dwellings should retain their present form , including the level of rent [ PERCENT of the reconstruction value of the dwelling ] ... ORG considers that , having regard to the principle of maintaining ORG confidence in the ORG and the law made by it and the principle of legal security , which ensue from the rule of law laid down in LAW and are binding on the legislature , renouncing that obligation will be admissible only in case of exceptional public necessity . At present , there is no such necessity ... It should be noted in passing that setting a time - limit for the operation of the rent - control scheme in buildings owned by natural persons also places an obligation on the legislature \u2013 for the benefit of landlords \u2013 to repeal the scheme in its present form by DATE . This obligation should also be seen from the perspective of the principle of maintaining ORG confidence in the ORG .", "[ Final considerations ]", "The constitutional inadmissibility of setting the income received by landlords below a certain minimum does not automatically mean that the rent chargeable to tenants has to be increased , because that problem can be resolved by allocating public financial resources . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ORG held that section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , laying down landlords\u2019 obligations , was incompatible with the constitutional principles of the protection of property rights and social justice because , in particular , it placed a heavy financial burden on them , a burden which was in no way proportionate to the income from controlled rent . ORG ruled that that provision should be repealed by DATE .", "CARDINAL .

In the reasoning for its judgment , ORG extensively cited its judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "In conclusion , it held that the fact that LAW had abolished the scheme of rent control had not improved the situation of landlords because , instead , it had introduced a defective mechanism for controlling increases in rent . In its opinion , section GPE ) had not only \u201c frozen \u201d the disadvantageous position of landlords , a situation which had already been found to be incompatible with the LAW , but had also , owing to the changing economic circumstances , significantly reduced any possibility of increasing rent to cover expenses incurred by them in connection with the maintenance of property .", "The court repeated what it had already stated in its judgment of DATE , namely that the relevant provisions placed the main burden of the sacrifices that society had to make for the benefit of tenants in a difficult financial position on the owners of property . It went on to find that section GPE ) perpetuated the state of a violation of property rights that had subsisted under LAW , especially as landlords had not been relieved of any of their previous duties in respect of maintenance of property .", "CARDINAL . The main thrust of ORG reasoning was as follows :", "\u201c During the transition from controlled rent to contractual rent it is necessary to control the increase in rent . ... In most NORP countries legislative bodies exercise control over rent increases . The introduction of such a mechanism into NORP law seems to be particularly justified and the need for it follows quite evidently from the shortage of flats and the absence of a lease market which would influence rates of rent . This very low supply of flats for rent has caused a situation in which tenants are exposed to undue demands from landlords . Hence there is a need to regulate rent increases .", "While recognising this necessity , ORG is convinced that the mechanism introduced by the impugned provision is defective and is objectively inappropriate for accomplishing the aims pursued by the legislature . ...", "To begin with , ORG will examine the impact of the operation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act on landlords who were subject to controlled rent under LAW . In this court \u2019s view , the contested provision has not only \u201c frozen \u201d the disadvantageous position of landlords subsisting QUANTITY , a situation which was already found to have been incompatible with the LAW , but has also actually aggravated that situation on account of changing economic circumstances . ...", "At the time when the present legislation entered into force , tenants paid rent determined by the municipalities . [ The rent paid ] , according to the information supplied by ORG , covered merely PERCENT of the costs of maintenance of residential buildings . LAW did not increase rent to the level that could have been established according to the principles set out by ORG in [ the judgment of DATE ] . Nor did the legislature give landlords an opportunity to increase rent to a level ensuring recovery of their expenses . LAW has frozen rates of rent and fixed them as a reference level for the calculation of future increases . ...", "In ORG opinion , in order to arrive at reasonable level of rent it is necessary to take CARDINAL of the following CARDINAL measures : either a CARDINAL - off increase in deflated rates of controlled rent , accompanied by a restrictive protection of tenants against further increases or , while freezing the applicable rates , permitting considerable increases in relatively rapid succession until an acceptable level has been reached . However , the legislature fixed an unreasonably low basic rent and allowed only strictly regulated increases , correlated with the inflation rate . The legislature did not take into account the fact that the rate of inflation was constantly declining , which means that permissible increases have been insignificant , amounting merely to a few percentage points of the basic rent and giving no opportunity , for purely mathematical reasons , to reach levels that would ensure profitability , or at least recovery of maintenance costs . The decrease in the inflation rate , although a generally positive sign of economic stability , has resulted in the stagnation of rent at low levels .", "The deterioration of the situation of the landlords receiving controlled rent is also shown by a comparison of rent increases under LAW with increases permissible under LAW . As transpires from information supplied by ORG [ in respect of the operation of the DATE Act ] , at the relevant time municipalities raised controlled rent DATE to a significant extent : in DATE , when the inflation rate was PERCENT , by PERCENT on average , but in DATE , when the inflation rate was PERCENT , by PERCENT . The pace of transition to a reasonable level of rent was faster than at present , if only because municipalities , themselves owning residential buildings , had a strong interest in securing genuine increases in rent . Finally , the previous regulations gave landlords the hope of relaxing rent policy . Irrespective of the rates of controlled rent imposed on them by municipalities , they knew that from DATE they would be able to negotiate rent freely . However , that encouraging prospect was wiped out by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act . Even though the ceiling of PERCENT will no longer apply after [ DATE , given the provision of section GPE ) , this ceiling will not be reached in reality .", "In ORG view , the above circumstances give sufficient grounds to find that the situation of landlords who formerly received controlled rent is now unquestionably less favourable than it used to be under LAW . ... [ O]n the contrary , section GPE ) has perpetuated the violation of the right of property . At this point , it is necessary to determine how the landlords\u2019 situation looks in other respects , apart from the restrictions on rent increases . If , following the ... judgment of CARDINAL January CARDINAL , the legislature had significantly changed any aspect of the legal position of landlords , thereby compensating for losses resulting from reduced rent , the evaluation of levels of rent in the present case would have had to be based on other criteria than those referred to by this court in DATE .", "Since DATE there have been no changes to legislation , apart from the enactment of the CARDINAL Act , which seriously aggravated the situation of landlords . They still bear the burden of obligations imposed by LAW , whose non - fulfilment , as stressed by the ORG , is subject to penalties . There have been no changes to regulations on income tax , at least in respect of deductions from tax ( or from taxable income ) of amounts spent on maintenance of buildings in which flats are let to tenants . Nor has the legislature introduced preferential loans for repairs . ... ORG also points out that LAW has not materially improved the situation of landlords in respect of termination of leases . ...", "Accordingly , it is fully justified to rely on this court \u2019s findings in respect of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . Even though the provisions under consideration have changed , and the ORG is now considering completely different legal instruments ( control of rent increase as opposed to the scheme of rent control under LAW ) , the core of the dispute and the issues under consideration remain essentially the same , namely the situation of landlords on whom the legislature has imposed reduced levels of rent . In addition , section GPE ) leads to a difference in the treatment of landlords , depending on whether they are parties to lease relationships formerly governed by the rent control scheme , or to lease contracts based on freely determined rent . As shown above , in practice the rent increase mechanism adversely affects the first group of landlords and , and the same time , unjustifiably and at the tenant \u2019s expense , favours the second group .", "In view of the foregoing , the Constitutional Court finds that the [ operation of ] the contested provision is tantamount to the continued violation of the right of property vested in a specific group of landlords , namely those who entered into a lease relationship by virtue of administrative decisions on the allocation to a dwelling , or on another basis , prior to the introduction of ORG management of housing matters in a given municipality . Not only did the legislature fail to adjust rates of controlled rent , despite their having been found to be unconstitutional , but in fact , through the introduction of restrictive provisions on rent increases , practically froze such rents at levels that can not be regarded as consistent with constitutional guarantees of the right of property . ...", "It is worth reiterating , having regard to the [ judgment of DATE ] , that the restrictions in question are undoubtedly guided by the need to protect public order and the rights of other persons , namely tenants . However , according to ORG case - law , LAW implies that restrictions on the rights guaranteed therein are necessary . In respect of the rent [ control scheme ] , ORG qualified as \u201c necessary \u201d \u2013 at least during DATE the restriction on the right of property \u201c precluding the freedom to derive profit , by fixing levels of rent in such a way as to cover only the costs of maintenance and upkeep of the building \u201d . A reduction below that minimum was seen by this court as unconstitutional . Placing the financial burden of subsidising rent on a single social group , namely landlords , was also considered to have been unconstitutional since \u201c the duty to help the underprivileged and [ the duties inherent in ] social solidarity are incumbent not only upon those persons \u201d . ORG envisaged and still envisages the possibility of applying other legal solutions ... which would result in a more uniform social distribution of the burden linked to the necessity to satisfy housing needs . It is therefore unnecessary to place the entire burden on the single group of landlords . Consequently , ORG considers that the restriction resulting from section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ... does not meet the criteria established by the principle of proportionality and goes beyond the tolerable extent of limitations on the right of property set out in LAW .", "ORG is not competent to fix minimum levels of rent ... [ However , ] from the point of view of the protection of landlords\u2019 rights , [ it ] stresses again the crucial importance of the correct determination of the costs of maintenance and upkeep of residential buildings . This constitutes the absolute minimum rate . ...", "As regards the implementation of the constitutional rights of tenants , ORG stresses that , although in the present judgment section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL LAW has been found unconstitutional , the LAW still imposes significant restrictions on the freedom to increase rent .
