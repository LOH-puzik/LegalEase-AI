The applicant unsuccessfully appealed to ORG ( Ratskammer ) of ORG and to ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , whose rulings were given on DATE and DATE respectively . The pre - trial detention ( Untersuchungshaft ) was confirmed by the presiding judge of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the opinions of several experts , the presiding judge on DATE ordered Mr ORG \u2019s provisional placement ( vorl\u00e4ufige Unterbringung ) in an institution for mentally ill offenders ( LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The order was confirmed by ORG on DATE and ORG on DATE , and the applicant was transferred to the special prison at GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the psychiatrists who examined him , he was suffering from paranoia querulans , which was equivalent to a mental illness and meant that he was not responsible for his acts ; he was extremely aggressive and incapable of understanding that his behaviour was unlawful , and there was a risk that attendance at the trial could harm his health .", "Following these reports , the public prosecutor \u2019s office amended the indictment on DATE and now sought PERSON detention rather than conviction . From that date the detention in issue was based on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the amended indictment was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The hearing before ORG took place on CARDINAL and DATE . It had previously been necessary to adjourn a hearing arranged for DATE because the case - file had been lost , to adjourn a hearing of CARDINAL DATE because of the applicant \u2019s request for further witnesses to be called , a hearing of DATE because the presiding judge was absent , CARDINAL of DATE because fresh evidence had been produced , CARDINAL of DATE because of mistakes in sending out summonses , and CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE because the applicant had spat in the presiding judge \u2019s face , which had led to the indictment being amended ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "On DATE the court found that the charges against Mr Herczegfalvy had been proved and ordered him to be detained under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on the grounds that he was dangerous and not criminally responsible for his acts . The court relied on the opinions of CARDINAL psychiatrists who had each diagnosed paranoia querulans which from DATE at least had been equivalent to a mental illness .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought an application for a declaration of nullity ( PERSON ) to ORG . ORG decided , however , that pending the decision he should remain provisionally detained under LAW , but in prison , on the psychiatrist \u2019s recommendation .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG upheld the detention in issue . Applying Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , it ordered PERSON to be sent to the GPE psychiatric hospital so that he could receive urgent medical and socio- and psycho - therapeutic treatment there , which was essential inter alia because of the hunger strike he had carried on since DATE . On DATE he was admitted to ward CARDINAL of that hospital , and stayed there until his release on DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime ORG had on DATE varied the judgment of DATE in part ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , quashed the detention order and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr ORG requested his release . On DATE the investigating judge informed him that he continued to be detained in accordance with LAW .", "At that judge \u2019s request , the psychiatric hospital submitted a report dated DATE expressing the opinion that it was not possible to place the applicant in ordinary pre - trial detention , as his aggressive behaviour was still causing danger to those around him .", "Pursuant to LAW and ORG extended the detention in question in DATE .", "CARDINAL .

It based its decision on the judgment of DATE , the CARDINAL psychiatric reports on which it had been based ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and the opinions of the authors of the reports , who had appeared at the hearing and stated that despite certain improvements there had been no fundamental change in the situation .", "As the applicant had withdrawn his appeal and application for a declaration of nullity in writing on DATE and at a hearing on DATE , the judgment was on the latter date declared binding by a final order ( Endverf\u00fcgung ) , which set the date of DATE for the next judicial review of the detention ( LAW ) of LAW ; see paragraph DATE below ) .", "The applicant subsequently challenged the validity of his declarations . He said that he had made them only with a view to his repatriation to GPE , which was discussed on DATE but did not come about .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG , acting under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , extended PERSON detention , as a psychiatric report produced at the request of that court stated that he was a dangerous person .

On DATE , DATE and a date in DATE the applicant requested his release , pointing out that the period for carrying out the DATE review had expired on CARDINAL DATE . On receiving the first of these applications , the court consulted a psychiatrist , who submitted a report on DATE recommending the applicant \u2019s release subject to supervision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "An application to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction ( Dienstaufsichtsbeschwerde ) was made to ORG , which ordered ORG to reach a decision speedily ; on DATE the latter court ordered a further extension of the detention in issue . Taking into account the opinions of the psychiatric expert and the director of the hospital , filed on DATE , it considered that there had been no fundamental change in Mr ORG \u2019s mental state . He was still suffering from paranoia querulans , and if released would undoubtedly refuse to follow the necessary course of treatment ; he would consequently be likely to bring numerous complaints or even carry out the threats he had made , in particular those against the prison staff ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and confirmed that the requirements for his release under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW were not satisfied .", "CARDINAL . PERSON made further applications for release on DATE and DATE . He was conditionally released on DATE in accordance with the court \u2019s decision of DATE , itself based on a psychiatric report dated DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court found that the applicant \u2019s paranoia had admittedly worsened , but that it was primarily due to his detention ( Haftquerulanz ) ; the vexatious complaints and petitions ( Rechtsquerulanz ) did not constitute a danger within the meaning of LAW ; since being detained the applicant had behaved with genuine aggressiveness on a few occasions only ; although the possibility could not be excluded of his becoming aggressive in the event of frustration , his psychiatric history did not permit the conclusion that his abnormal personality would induce him to commit criminal offences ; moreover , continued psychiatric treatment or treatment by drugs was not considered necessary by the expert , although it was recommended .", "CARDINAL . On being returned to prison after his stay in the GPE psychiatric hospital from DATE to DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , PERSON had begun a hunger strike on DATE as a protest against his detention and the refusal to give him his files . He collapsed on CARDINAL DATE and was transferred to a clinic where he received intensive medical care . On DATE he was transferred back to the GPE psychiatric hospital , where he remained until his release on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant was in an extremely weak state when returned there , the director of the hospital ordered him to be force fed , pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant refused all contact and refused to have any medical examination or treatment , and was also given sedatives against his will ( CARDINAL doses of QUANTITY each of NORP ) ; on DATE and DATE he was attached to a security bed , the net and straps of which he succeeded in cutting through . On DATE he was given a different neuroleptic ( Sordinol IM ) , as infiltrations had appeared . He stopped refusing food on DATE , after being allocated a single room and being given some of his files .", "CARDINAL . Mr Herczegfalvy again went on hunger strike from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , on which date he allegedly eventually agreed to be fed through a tube ( GPE ) once daily . However , he later denied that his consent had been validly given .", "CARDINAL . In view of the deterioration of his physical and mental state , he was injected by force with QUANTITY of GPE on DATE , in order to bring about a state of somnolence ( D\u00e4mmerschlaf ) in which it would be possible to treat him by means of perfusions . Since he had resisted this with violence , the emergency team had had to overpower him . On DATE he was transferred to the intensive care unit , as he showed symptoms of pneumonia and nephritis ; he stayed there until DATE .", "CARDINAL . He had not made a complete recovery when he left , and he still needed treatment with antibiotics and neuroleptics . On his return to the closed unit he was handcuffed and a belt placed around his ankles because of the danger of aggression and the death threats he was making ; the restraints were not removed until DATE . According to the Government , their position was changed regularly , in order to avoid nervous paralysis , and on DATE he had agreed to be fed by a woman doctor . The applicant stated , however , that other belts had been put around his thighs and stomach and had been untied for the first time only on DATE ; in order to obtain his files and writing materials with which to write his complaints , he had continued his hunger strike without interruption , and had been artificially fed throughout this period .", "CARDINAL . From CARDINAL DATE the applicant calmed down and behaved in a more co - operative manner . Although he continued to insult the staff from time to time , he agreed to communicate with those around him and consented to being fed through a tube by a female doctor twice DATE . On DATE he was given paper and a ballpoint pen .", "CARDINAL . Following a dispute about his correspondence , PERSON was forbidden on DATE to watch television . As his physical resistance to the forced administration of neuroleptics had frequently been in vain and had even led to injuries ( loss of teeth , broken ribs and bruises ) , he brought a complaint of assault on each occasion that he was given medicaments . These letters , which he claimed had not been communicated to the relevant authorities , filled CARDINAL binders ; they were given to him on his discharge .", "CARDINAL . During this period he continued to refuse , at least in part , to take nourishment other than through a tube , but on CARDINAL DATE he stated that he no longer needed to be fed artificially , as a doctor had persuaded him to end his hunger strike by explaining to him that it was endangering his life . Hospital reports had , however , stated that he appeared to be adequately nourished .", "CARDINAL . In an opinion of CARDINAL DATE an expert considered that conditional release of the applicant would be possible if certain accompanying psychiatric and social measures were taken . In his view , PERSON behaviour was much improved , so that there was now virtually no danger .", "CARDINAL . After a further series of complaints which were regarded as vexatious , ORG consulted the hospital on DATE as to the applicant \u2019s possible release .", "On DATE an expert noted the progress which the applicant had made and expressed the opinion that troublesome behaviour did not constitute a risk within the meaning of LAW .", "However , in a letter of DATE , the director of the hospital advised the court not to terminate Mr ORG \u2019s detention ; as the treatment carried out , based on medication , had only a sedative effect , the possibility could not be excluded that if he were released , he would again become aggressive and dangerous .", "ORG thereupon on DATE refused to release the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . He eventually recovered his liberty on DATE , after a further expert report dated DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . While in detention PERSON addressed an extremely large number of petitions and complaints to various authorities , relating inter alia to his medical treatment and the proceedings brought by him . As he considered that he did not have the necessary money , he refused on several occasions to put stamps on his letters , or sent them to ORG for that purpose . In order to stem this flow of correspondence , he was deprived from time to time of writing materials , and his unstamped letters were frequently returned to him , with the exception of those addressed to the public authorities , in particular the courts .", "CARDINAL . With respect to the letters written at the psychiatric hospital , the hospital management had agreed with the applicant \u2019s curator that they would be transmitted to him regularly and it would be for him to decide whether it was necessary to send them on ; this system would apply to all letters other than those to his lawyer , his adviser and the guardianship court . PERSON has complained that even those letters were not all sent on .", "CARDINAL . When he left the hospital the applicant was given CARDINAL binders containing the originals of these letters and also CARDINAL sealed letters ; the postal register showed that the latter had never been sent to their addressees , namely the police , the public prosecutor \u2019s office and the courts .", "CARDINAL . PERSON also claimed that he had been deprived of reading matter , radio and television for long periods during his detention , in particular from DATE to DATE and from DATE ; from DATE there had been no television set in his cell or in the ward . He alleged that these measures had been taken for disciplinary purposes only .", "DATE . According to the Government , these measures were based on section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , had been justified for therapeutic reasons , and had lasted for a short time only on each occasion .", "CARDINAL . LAW , in the version in force at the time , permits the pre - trial detention of a person ( where there are serious reasons for suspecting him of having committed a criminal offence ) if there is a danger of absconding , collusion or repetition of offences .", "CARDINAL .
