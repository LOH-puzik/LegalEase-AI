He has dual nationality : NORP and NORP . His current place of residence is unknown . He is represented before the ORG by Mr J. Arsov , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( \u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0418\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0430 ) ( hereinafter referred to as the ORG ) to be listed as an independent candidate in the presidential elections in the former GPE . For that purpose he had collected CARDINAL signatures of citizens in support of his candidacy .", "On DATE the ORG rejected his application on the ground that the applicant did not satisfy the requirement in LAW governing the eligibility of candidates for presidential election . In particular , the applicant had not continuously resided in the former GPE for CARDINAL out of DATE of the election . The ORG found that on DATE the applicant had informed the authorities that he was no longer resident in GPE and had registered himself as resident in GPE in GPE ; he had continued residing in GPE until DATE ( when he re - registered himself as resident in GPE ) . Whereas the applicant 's residence in GPE between DATE and CARDINAL DATE was accepted as qualifying as domestic residence by the ORG pursuant to LAW ( the latter date being the date the former GPE enacted its LAW ) , his residence in GPE DATE and DATE was deemed foreign and not taken into account . The ORG calculated that in DATE the applicant had resided in the former GPE for DATE , DATE and DATE .", "On DATE the applicant challenged the rejection of his candidacy in ORG ( \u0412\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0421\u0443\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u041c ) , alleging that the ORG had incorrectly calculated the overall length of his residence in the former GPE by an erroneous ( restrictive ) construction of LAW . According to him , his residence in GPE after CARDINAL DATE should have been deemed domestic residence by the ORG . First , the applicant maintained that neither the LAW nor the LAW ( \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430 PERSON ) , nor any other statute imposed a time - limit on the application of LAW , which is a transitional provision . Second , he maintained that LAW , as well as the other provisions of the LAW and the relevant statutes , did not specify that the qualifying period of residence in the other GPE of ORG would be restricted to the period before the LAW was enacted or any other period . Since neither the LAW nor the statutes regulated the manner or duration of the application of LAW , the applicant argued that the said provision should have been construed by the ORG in accordance with the human rights conventions and DATE LAW on ORG , that is to say , broadly , not restrictively . He claimed that he could not be blamed for leaving the former GPE for GPE in DATE and staying there for a certain period of time following the disintegration of GPE , and had done so for economic reasons . Finally , the applicant alleged that he had been discriminated against in comparison to other candidates in DATE presidential elections , namely , Mr. PERSON in DATE and Mr. V. Tupurkovski in DATE , whose candidacies had been upheld by a differently composed ORG . He alleged that the ORG had not applied the aforementioned provision in the same manner in their cases as in his . The applicant requested ORG to order the ORG to serve and disclose its decisions on the candidacies of Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's challenge , finding that the overall length of his domestic residence had been correctly assessed by the ORG . It held that the former GPE had declared its independence with the adoption of the LAW on DATE , so that LAW could only be applied for the period prior to that date . It did not directly respond to the applicant 's assertions or arguments .", "On DATE the applicant petitioned ORG ( \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0421\u0443\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u041c ) for an order quashing the decisions of ORG and the ORG on the basis of LAW and LAW . He called the petition a request for the protection of an electoral right ( \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e ) . Before ORG , the applicant repeated the assertions he had made and arguments he had advanced before ORG , adding that his right to stand for election under LAW and LAW No . CARDINAL of the Convention had been violated . He also complained that he had not received a reasoned answer from ORG to his arguments .", "On the same date the applicant made an almost identical application to ORG , requesting it to adopt a common position on its decision of DATE ( and to set it aside ) in a joint session of its CARDINAL chambers .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's petition as being incompatible ratione materiae . It held that the right to stand for election was not among the individual rights and freedoms referred to in LAW whose violation could be challenged in ORG by way of individual petition . According to ORG , the ORG and ORG had exclusive jurisdiction to protect the right at issue pursuant to LAW . In addition , ORG held that it had no jurisdiction to review the complaint under LAW No . CARDINAL to LAW . ORG reached its decision without a hearing .", "It is not clear whether ORG acted upon the applicant 's request for the adoption of a common position and an order setting aside its decision of DATE . The applicant was deprived of the possibility to stand as a candidate in the elections . The elections took place on CARDINAL and DATE .", "Article CARDINAL of the LAW ( \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430 ) stipulates that the President of the Republic is a Commander - in - Chief of ORG former GPE .", "LAW ( \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430 ) lists the discretionary powers of the Head of the ORG .
