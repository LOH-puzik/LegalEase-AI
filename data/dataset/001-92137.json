On the same page appeared an article headed \u201c Searching for a locally known murderer \u201d , which quoted Chief Constable PERSON as stating inter alia that the main emphasis of their investigation had been based on the belief that the murderer(s ) had been locally known but that a wider NORP focus had also been discussed .

At the material time , PERSON was published in TIME , whereas ORG , ORG were published in TIME .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , after the arrest of the actual perpetrators in the GPE case , the applicant , represented by a lawyer , demanded that PERSON apologise for its coverage and compensate him for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage he had sustained . As the newspaper refused , in DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer brought on his behalf defamation proceedings before ORG ( tingrett ) against PERSON , its editor - in - chief , Mr PERSON and journalist PERSON applicant claimed compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s action .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then appealed to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) . He waived his claim for pecuniary damage , which matter was formally discontinued ( hevet ) , but maintained his claim for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG , sitting with CARDINAL judges , found that an ordinary reader could perceive the impugned press reports published by the PERSON on DATE and DATE as pointing to the applicant as a possible perpetrator of the murders of the QUANTITY girls in GPE . ORG observed that , although the paper had not mentioned the applicant by name , it ought to have been possible for those who knew him in advance to recognise him , in particular from the photograph taken of him from behind and from the information about his residence- and work places contained in the CARDINAL DATE issue . It was hard to derive anything specific about the strength of the suspicion . Although it was true that formally speaking the applicant had only been given witness status , seen as a whole the report was capable of giving the ordinary reader the impression that the paper regarded the applicant as a person who already at an early stage of the investigation had stood out as the most probable perpetrator among those who had been in the police \u2019s search light . ORG moreover noted a number of other aspects of the publications confirming this impression . It concluded that the impugned publications were defamatory in the sense of LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the question whether the publications were unlawful ( rettstridig ) , ORG was of the view that it generally should fall within the ORG \u2019s margin of appreciation to strike a fair balance between the interests in protection of freedom of speech under LAW and the interests in protection of reputation under LAW , bearing in mind also the presumption of innocence under LAW . On the particular facts of this case , ORG considered that there was undoubtedly a great public interest in the investigation of the murders and in the pursuit of the culpable persons . However , with CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , ORG found that , on balance , the interests in allowing the publications weighed more heavily than those against and that the impugned news coverage had therefore not been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The dissenting member found that the \u201c identification \u201d of the applicant and its extensive press coverage by PERSON had been unlawful and that he should be awarded compensation under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , namely ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL by the newspaper and ORG CARDINAL each from the editor - in - chief and from the journalist .", "The applicant appealed against ORG application of the law to ORG , alleging that it entailed a violation of Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . He maintained that in its coverage on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the PERSON had portrayed him as the perpetrator of the most aggravated offences seen in modern times in GPE . He had not consented to the media coverage which had been a great burden to him . He had lost his job and home and suffered from serious psychological problems .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , found in favour of the respondents and rejected the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON , whose reasoning was endorsed in the main by the other judges in the majority , inter alia concurred with ORG finding that , the PERSON \u2019s focus on the applicant as a previously convicted knife killer , his presence in GPE on DATE when the criminal acts had been committed and the investigation of the applicant , for an ordinary reader must have been perceived as if he could be suspected of having committed the murders . It had already been publicly known that the perpetrators of the murders had used pointed penetrating weapons against the girls . This information together with the rendering of parts of the judgment by which the applicant had been convicted in DATE and the security measures case , were likely to harm his good name and reputation and to expose him to hatred and contempt , thus fulfilling the objective constitutive elements in LAW . On these points Mr Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Taking as a starting point the wording , typography , the internal context and the use of photographs it must be ascertained how the report and articles were likely to be understood by the ordinary reader .... The statements must be considered in the context of the whole report they are part of .", "( CARDINAL ) The High Court unanimously found that the factual information had to be considered in the context of the other content of the reports and the articles published on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , and concluded :", "\u2018 In ORG opinion the conclusion of the interpretation is that PERSON pointed to [ the applicant ] as a possible perpetrator of the murders of the QUANTITY girls in GPE . His name is not stated , but it was possible for those who previously knew [ the applicant ] to recognize him in particular because of the photograph taken of him from behind and because of the information about where he lives and the work place in the report dated DATE It is difficult to evaluate how strong the suspicion created was . Even though it is correctly underlined that the police had given [ the applicant ] only a witness status without formally charging or suspecting him , in the High Court \u2019s view the report as a whole was capable of giving the ordinary viewer the impression that the newspaper considered [ the applicant ] to be a man who already at this early stage in the investigation stood out as the most likely perpetrator among the persons who were in the police \u2019s search light.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) ORG , amongst other aspects , emphasised that in the front page story of CARDINAL May it was stated that [ the applicant ] was \u2018 probably the most interesting of several convicted persons whose movements are now being checked by the police\u2019 , that he had been questioned for TIME after having been collected by the police at his work place , and that the report was illustrated with ORG \u2019s photograph of [ the applicant ] with his head blanked , being escorted by CARDINAL police officers . ORG found that the photograph created associations of arrest . This was presented together with the information that , after having been brought home , another police car with a dog patrol had arrived at the house , had passed by in low speed , had turned and had vanished in the dark . In addition to this the newspaper rendered statements by a police inspector to PERSON that the police had received much information with substance , and that the answer to who had killed the CARDINAL little girls was to be found in the police records . Also the rendering on DATE that the police were looking for a locally known murderer with a greatly deviant personal character , in the High Court \u2019s opinion supports the view that the applicant may be a person with the special character that are a requisite for committing such a heinous crime . ORG did not find that the rendering of [ the applicant ] \u2019s denial and of the ORG warning against prejudging were sufficient to weaken the suspicion created by the newspaper coverage as a whole .", "( CARDINAL ) I concur with ORG in that the focus by PERSON on [ the applicant ] as a previously convicted knife killer , his presence in GPE that afternoon the misdeed was carried out , and the investigation of him , for an ordinary reader must have been perceived as if he could be suspected of having committed these killings . It was already publicly known that the perpetrator(s ) had used knives when the girls were killed . This information , together with the description of parts of his criminal conviction from DATE and the security measures [ sikring ] , was likely to harm [ the applicant ] \u2019s good name and reputation and to expose him to hatred and contempt . The objective description of the offence in LAW is therefore fulfilled .", "( CARDINAL ) The adversary party has stated that the reports in PERSON of DATE and DATE did not contribute to identify [ the applicant ] beyond that occurred in TVCARDINAL in TIME CARDINAL May , where he was interviewed and filmed from behind and from the side while walking towards GPE . My comment to this is that PERSON in connection with the reports of CARDINAL DATE about [ the applicant ] informed about \u2018 the DATE old\u2019s\u2019 work place and place of residence . The photograph from DATE depicting [ the applicant ] entering a bus , a new photograph of DATE showing [ the applicant ] with the same jacket and with a plastic bag on his way home \u2018 to the house in .... [ the applicant ] \u2019s road at Z\u2019 , and the article from the newly constructed housing area in \u00c6 at Z , may have led to more people in the near environment becaming aware of [ the applicant ] \u2019s identity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the further question whether the allegations were unlawful ( rettstridige ) , Mr Justice PERSON observed inter alia", "\u201c ( DATE ) It is self - evident that the rapes and killings in GPE on DATE , DATE were of great public interest . The news media had a duty to report , and the public had a right to receive , information about the misdeed , the investigation and the progress in the case . It is clearly a matter of public interest that previously convicted felons are in the police \u2019s searchlight , and that interrogations and other police work is taking place to check witnesses out of the case or to charge them . In the near environment it may be of public interest to be informed about the fact that a previously convicted killer in the area in respect of whom a case concerning prolongation of security measures was pending , has been brought in by the police for questioning .", "( CARDINAL ) This must however be weighed against the interest of privacy and the protection of reputation , when the media circles in and identifies CARDINAL or a few previously convicted persons being under investigation . At this stage the public normally has no legitimate interest to receive detailed information about previously convicted persons and their identity , hereunder descriptions of the criminal offences for which they have been convicted . However , in this very special case people living in the vicinity had a particular interest in knowing that a person who had previously been found guilty of murder and of violent assault and who had been sentenced to security detention , was living in the area , so that they could protect their own and their children \u2019s interests .", "( CARDINAL ) The character of the allegation and , in particular , its seriousness is an important factor in the balancing exercise to be carried out when determining whether the interests of protection of personal life justify an interference with the freedom of expression , see NORP case - law reports ( PERSON ( FAC . ) ) DATE p. CARDINAL on pp CARDINAL - CARDINAL . In accordance with the case - law of ORG and ORG a distinction ought to be made between statements of fact and value judgments , because only statements of fact may be susceptible to proof . Normally statements which may be understood to mean that a person is or may be suspected of a criminal offence must be considered to be statements of facts which need to be proven .", "( CARDINAL ) The respondents have argued that the impugned statement only concerns whether the unnamed CARDINAL DATE \u2018 is probably the most interesting among several previously convicted felons whose movements are now being checked by the police\u2019 . The leader of the investigation has later confirmed that the applicant was the most interesting person on whom efforts were deployed at the beginning of the investigation . The statement is alleged to have been correct , and its publication is claimed not to be unlawful .", "( CARDINAL ) When CARDINAL , as I do , has reached the conclusion that the newspaper \u2019s reports and articles considered as a whole left the impression that [ the applicant ] could be a suspect in the case , the evidence must concern whether he has committed the crime he has been accused of . It is not sufficient that the newspaper gave an accurate description of the factual circumstances adduced to show that there was a basis for suspicion . As an exception to this general rule case law has accepted the publication of charges . Here the evidence is acceptable when it is proven that the reporting of the charge in itself is correct , see ORG . DATE p. CARDINAL ( PERSON ) . There is no corresponding exception for reporting on suspicion .", "( CARDINAL ) In this case PERSON has not rendered a suspicion stated by others . The newspaper coverage and the articles mainly consist of reporting on the judgment from DATE , the relevant preventive supervision case [ sikringssak ] and the statements made by leaders of the investigation . It appears clearly that the applicant has been interrogated as a witness and that neither he nor anyone else is under investigation as a suspect . The most direct statement indicating suspicion is attenuated in its form in that [ the applicant ] according to the newspaper is \u2018 probably the most interesting of several criminally convicted persons whose movements are now being checked by the police\u2019 . His statements in an interview published on DATE about his being completely innocent , has been published in the head line on top of the front page .", "( CARDINAL ) In balancing the competing interests in the concrete case I have with some doubt found that it was not unlawful for PERSON on DATE and CARDINAL DATE to publish that [ the applicant ] was the most interesting of several convicted persons investigated by the police , even though this in the context may be perceived to mean that he was or could be a suspect . The monstrous sexual offences and consequent killings in GPE were of particularly great public interest throughout the country , especially in GPE and in the LOC counties . The people in the vicinity around GPE and in the vicinity where [ the applicant ] lived , had a particular interest in receiving continuous and concrete information about the investigation .", "( DATE ) In my opinion the journalist and the editor have not been negligent . The intense and extensive interest shown by the national news media directed against [ the applicant ] before PERSON \u2019s own publishing , his own statements to the media and the public interest justified the publication of the information about [ his ] workplace and place of residence and the use of anonymous photos of his person . When considering the question of negligence , I also emphasize that the coverage and articles were balanced , that their main content consisted of reporting true factual information , and that the police underlined that no one was under suspicion and that the [ applicant ] \u2019s view was presented clearly . I add that since this case presented itself at the early stage of the investigation , the newspaper had no cause to investigate further if [ the applicant ] could be the perpetrator .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mrs Justice Coward , whose opinion was endorsed in the main by the other judge of the minority , stated , amongst other :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) There was obviously public interest attached to the investigation in the GPE case . The nation was shocked , and it was a task for the media to inform of the crimes and the work of the police . In ORG it was agreed that it must be allowed to impart an information that a previously convicted felon was in the police \u2019s search light and had been subjected to a long interrogation - even though the reporting would make it possible to understand who this was for those who had special knowledge or for those who carried out investigations on their own . I too agree with that . The disagreement in the ORG concerned whether the further identification provided by PERSON - in particular by revealing the workplace and residence was justified .", "( CARDINAL ) In assessing the character of the allegation it is a point that this constituted an affirmation of suspicion , which when considering the seriousness is different from an accusation of being the perpetrator . But , on the other hand , the suspicion was related to particularly heinous crimes . The crimes aroused strong feelings of abhorrence and hatred in the population , and it is difficult not to think that it must have been awful to have been exposed to suspicion for having committed them . I agree with the High Court minority when it states that \u2018 strong reasons for protecting the privacy militate for protecting the identity of an individual who for different reasons has come in the search light of the police in the investigation of criminal cases . This consideration is , not the least , important in serious criminal cases where great public interests are attached to clearing up the ORG . And precisely a person like [ the applicant ] , who with his background more easily than others would be suspected , had a special need for the protection offered by the presumption of innocence .", "( CARDINAL ) I can not see that it betters things , as stated by PERSON , that [ the applicant ] was given the opportunity to declare his innocence on the front page of the newspaper \u2019s issue of CARDINAL DATE : \u2018 Convicted murderer : I am completely innocent\u2019 . It emerges from this report that none of \u2018 a not insignificant number of people\u2019 being checked in the case were under suspicion . However , neither this was likely to weaken the suspicion towards [ the applicant ] as the likely perpetrator . I agree with ORG - all CARDINAL justices - when it states :", "\u2018 Not in the least the High Court finds that the total search light directed against [ the applicant ] is important . He represents both the starting point and most of the reporting done by PERSON covering the PERSON - case DATE . Given the reluctance the press in accordance with the ethics of journalism usually show by not identifying individuals being in the police \u2019s search light , this to a large extent must strengthen the ordinary reader \u2019s impression of [ the applicant ] as being the most possible perpetrator.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) I can not see that the total reporting by PERSON should be considered balanced , even though the factual information taken apart had not been incorrect , [ the applicant ] had been given the opportunity to claiming his innocence and the police \u2019s statement that no one was to be suspected had been referred to . When it comes to heinous crimes of such gravity as here , in my opinion the press should not be allowed to publish untrue suspicions against identifiable individuals , even though the coverage should otherwise be characterized as being balanced .", "( CARDINAL ) I add that [ the applicant ] was persecuted by assertive media people against whom he found it difficult to protect himself . That he at no point accepted to be identified , must be obvious .", "( CARDINAL ) The difference of opinion between the majority and the minority of ORG was related to the significance of other media identifying [ the applicant ] . In TIME of CARDINAL DATE TVCARDINAL showed a report where he was filmed from behind and somewhat from the side . On DATE Dagbladet informed that he worked in a protected workplace in GPE and lived in his brother \u2019s cabin in Y at Z. The newspaper also showed a photo of him taken from behind . PERSON went the furthest in publishing identifying information about [ the applicant ] - in particular by revealing his workplace and residence , but besides this the articles in this most important district newspaper must have made it possible for more people to identify him than those who watch TVCARDINAL or read PERSON .", "( CARDINAL ) The High Court minority point to an important consideration in emphasising at the end stating the need for the individual to be protected from collective media pressure :", "\u2018 The minority also attaches considerable weight to the fact that the coverage in ORG appeared as an extensive and independent contribution from the newspaper and that the damaging effect for [ the applicant ] and the problems caused for him must have been caused by the total pressure from the media coverage during a short and concentrated period of time where PERSON \u2019s contribution was of particular significance . The minority is inclined to accept that [ the applicant ] had become \u2018 free game\u2019 as a result of the fact that some media had identified him . Such a solution is not adequate for protecting each individual against libellous reporting in mass media and does not coincide with the independent responsibility each newspaper has in circumstances where judicial and ethical press norms may be under challenge due to a situation of competitiveness .\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) I concur with this , and conclude - in accordance with the vocabulary used by ORG - that a pressing need existed for interfering with the freedom of expression in the way of a reaction to the coverage by PERSON .", "( CARDINAL ) The conditions for compensation in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW have been fulfilled . Since I am aware that I represent a minority , I see no reason to go into detail with regard to the amount of compensation . However , in view of PERSON \u2019s pleadings I point to the fact the harm caused by the offence to a large extent must be objectified : Also people who are socially marginalised must enjoy effective protection against libellous allegations . Like the minority in ORG , I vote for compensating [ the applicant ] with ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL from the newspaper and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL from the editor . The contribution from the journalist was more peripheral , and she should not be ordered to pay compensation . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought defamation proceedings against ORG ) before ORG claiming compensation with regard to TVCARDINAL \u2019s news coverage on DATE of the PERSON case . ORG found for TVCARDINAL and rejected the applicant \u2019s claims . On an appeal by the applicant , on DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s claim that the news coverage constituted unlawful defamation and ordered the defendants to pay him ORG CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage and discontinued the case with regard to his claim for pecuniary damage . As regards the contents of the disputed broadcasts and their defamatory effect , ORG made similar findings in the TVCARDINAL case as made by the appellate courts in the present case . In finding the defamation unlawful it had regard to several factors , notably ORG \u2019s national as opposed to local media role , unlike that of PERSON , the potency of the televised medium , the rule of caution applicable to the press with regard to identification of person regarding coverage of early stages of criminal investigations and the fact that , although aware of an autopsy report made available on DATE revealing that the murders had involved rape , TVCARDINAL had in the TIME news of that date continued to focus on the applicant notwithstanding the fact that his DATE criminal conviction had not concerned sexual offences . TVCARDINAL had also been the first medium to insinuate suspicion against the applicant and to identify him in its broadcasts and had taken the lead in this regard . On DATE ORG refused TVCARDINAL leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL .
