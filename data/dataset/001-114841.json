SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Administrative proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Ineta Ziemele;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( canton of GPE ) . He practises as a lawyer in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the owner of a house built in CARDINAL in the centre of GPE which is subject to a number of measures aimed at the protection of the historical heritage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the company I.G.W. requested GPE to issue a building permit for the construction of a \u201c wellness centre \u201d on the plot of land adjacent to the applicant \u2019s house . The building plan envisaged , inter alia , the construction of a swimming pool on top of the building . The applicant objected to the issuing of the building permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Samedan rejected the objection . The applicant lodged a motion with the administrative court of the canton of GPE which was rejected by judgment of DATE . The administrative court considered , inter alia , that the municipality did not have an obligation to hear expert submissions by ORG for the protection of historic buildings or by ORG on nature and homeland protection , because the instant case did not fall within ORG competencies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal under public law as well as an administrative appeal with ORG . He complained that the swimming pool would create emissions of steam and noise which exceeded the limits allowed under the regulations for the protection of the environment and that the presence of such an installation in DATE was contrary to the rules for the protection of historic buildings , to which the applicant \u2019s house belonged . He further alleged that the remainder of the planned building would not respect the pertinent legal regulations . Finally , he complained that the proceedings before ORG had been unfair .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG invited ORG to submit comments on the applicant \u2019s appeal . On DATE , the General Secretary of ORG submitted CARDINAL pages of comments to the tribunal . He considered , in particular , that the building permit did not violate the provisions of LAW and Homeland protection , because the building project did not fall within ORG competence . In DATE , ORG had subsidised archaeological searches and restoration work on the GPE church . However , these subsidies did not constitute Federal tasks and did not establish ORG competency . It followed that the Federal provisions necessitating further expert examination were not applicable in this case . Furthermore , ORG considered that the building project did not have a relevant impact on the centre of GPE . On DATE ORG forwarded a copy of the comments to the applicant for information . The applicant received it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeals as being admissible , but unfounded . With regard to the admissibility of the appeal under public law , it noted that the applicant contested the lawfulness of a building permit and that he complained , in particular , about the arbitrary application of the town planning law . Under the pertinent case - law , an appeal under public law was only admissible if the legal provisions relied upon also protected the applicant \u2019s own interests . In view of the fact that the applicant \u2019s building marked the historical centre of GPE , the ORG concluded that the provisions serving the protection of the overall appearance of the locality also served the protection of the applicant \u2019s building . With regard to the admissibility of the administrative appeal , the ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s building was situated at a distance of QUANTITY from the place where the impugned wellness centre was to be constructed , leading to the conclusion that the applicant had an \u201c interest warranting protection \u201d . ORG considered , however , that the appeals were unfounded because the pertinent legal provisions had not been breached in the instant case . With regard to the applicability of LAW and Homeland protection , ORG considered that the fact that the church had been restored with the help of federal subsidies did not mean that all building projects in the church \u2019s vicinity fell within the competency of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant provisions of LAW ( Organisationsgesetz ) as applicable at the time of the instant proceedings read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If the tribunal orders an exchange of written submissions , it serves the appeal on the authority which had issued the impugned decision or act , on the adverse party and on other possible parties . It sets an adequate time - limit for submitting the case - file and comments .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the reasons for the judgment or decision are contained for the first time in the authority \u2019s submissions , the applicant may be granted a time - limit allowing him or her to submit supplementary observations .", "CARDINAL . A further exchange of submissions takes place only exceptionally . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . If the tribunal orders an exchange of written submissions , it serves the appeal on the previous court instance and possible other parties ...", "CARDINAL . At the same time , it sets a time - limit for submissions and orders the previous instance to submit the case - files within that same time - limit .", "CARDINAL . NORP ...", "CARDINAL . A second exchange of submissions takes place only exceptionally . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( published in the official collection ( LAW ) CARDINAL I DATE , summarised in PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) , ORG considered that , in proceedings which provided , as a rule , for a simple exchange of submissions , it was sufficient to send the respective submissions to the adverse party for information , without expressly inviting him or her to submit comments . That way , the party had the possibility to examine the need to comment on the new submissions . If , in such a case , the party did not react after having taken notice of the new submissions , the tribunal could assume that he or she had waived their right to comment . ORG considered that this approach was \u201c a pragmatic way of implementing LAW \u201d . Referring to a previous judgment , the tribunal further considered that an applicant , who deemed it necessary to submit comments on submissions which had been served on him for information , was obliged , without undue delay , to submit his comments or to request leave to submit such comments ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
