A guard intervened and took the applicant out of the wing , leaving him in the prison barbershop . According to statements made by the applicant later , Mr PERSON followed him , grabbed him by the collar through the bars separating the barbershop from the corridor , and hit him on the head and nose .

As a result , on DATE the social worker recommended that the prison governor move the applicant to another group .
