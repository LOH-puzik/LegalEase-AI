On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presnenskiy District Court of GPE allowed the action in part . The court found that ORG had wrongly requested the original documents , copies of which had been available on file . It held that ORG reference to ongoing proceedings before ORG was inadmissible because it had first invoked this argument before the court and had never referred to it as a ground for its earlier refusals . The court declared ORG refusals unlawful but did not order re - registration of the applicant community on the ground that new application forms for religious organisations had been introduced and that the applicant community had to submit a fresh application for registration .", "DATE .

On DATE a new round of proceedings began in ORG under a new presiding judge . On DATE the hearing was adjourned .", "CARDINAL . Following the adjournment , the community of GPE 's Witnesses in GPE collected CARDINAL signatures on a petition to protest against the prosecutor 's claim that she was protecting the rights of the community members . Copies of the petition were sent to ORG , the President , and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE ORG ordered a new composite psycho - linguistic expert study of the applicant community 's literature and teachings .

Following several oral hearings , on DATE the ORG of GPE decided to uphold the prosecution 's claim , to dissolve the applicant community and to impose a permanent ban on its activities .", "CARDINAL . ORG found the applicant community responsible for luring minors into religious associations against their will and without the consent of their parents ( section QUANTITY of LAW ) and for coercing persons into destroying the family , infringing the personality , rights and freedoms of citizens ; inflicting harm on the health of citizens ; encouraging suicide or refusing on religious grounds medical assistance to persons in life- or health - threatening conditions ; and inciting citizens to refuse to fulfil their civil duties ( section LAW ) . However , the court found the applicant community not liable for extremist activity in the form of inciting religious discord with calls for violent acts ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Likewise , it found unproven the allegation that the applicant community had collected contributions from its members for its benefit .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the allegation of \u201c coercion into destroying the family , \u201d ORG relied on the statements by CARDINAL family members of GPE 's Witnesses DATE of which were members of ORG \u2013 who had been unhappy about their relatives ' abidance by the religious norms , their active involvement in the applicant community and their estrangement from non - religious family members . Thus , one husband had blamed the applicant community for the collapse of his family life , claiming that since \u201c his wife [ had ] joined ORG , she fulfil[led ] all their orders , [ he ] c[ould ] not discuss anything with her , or even watch TV with her because of her comments on everybody , including the leadership of the country and the ORG \u201d . Other witnesses complained that their adult children or , in CARDINAL case , the daughter - in - law had spent less time caring for elderly relatives because they had been constantly busy within the community . ORG further relied on the majority opinion of the expert study of DATE which determined that \u201c the texts of NORP 's Witnesses do not contain direct coercion into destroying the family but apply and propose for application direct psychological pressure which risks causing the destruction of families \u201d . Assessing the opinion by the dissenting expert and the findings of the new study of DATE , which found no coercion into destroying the family , ORG considered that these experts had limited the scope of their inquiry to publicly available literature of GPE 's Witnesses and had not analysed the \u201c actual activity of the GPE community \u201d or implementation of the religious commandments and recommendations \u201c in real life \u201d and their influence on family relations . ORG rejected statements by the witnesses for the defence who had GPE 's Witnesses in their families and the conclusions of a sociological study of CARDINAL community members , randomly selected , conducted by ORG at ORG on the ground that it had been based on the lists of respondents supplied by the community itself and failed to \u201c report a single instance of an internal family confrontation which objectively existed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As to the charge of infringement of the personality , rights and freedoms of citizens , ORG firstly found a violation of the right to privacy in that the applicant community determined the place and nature of work of its members , recommended that they engage in part - time employment so as to have time for preaching , prohibited them from celebrating holidays or birthdays , and required them to preach door to door , thus also invading other people 's privacy . As evidence of attempts to interfere with other people 's private life , ORG referred to the criminal conviction of a PERSON for beating a female community member who had offered religious literature to his wife at their home . Moreover , in ORG view , the applicant community violated its members ' right to a free choice of occupation as it recommended that they engage in part - time employment and provided applications for voluntary service at GPE , the community centre near GPE , where they only received a DATE living allowance and no salary .", "CARDINAL . ORG found a violation of the constitutional guarantee of equality between parents in relation to the upbringing and education of children ( LAW ) because some parents involved their children in the religious activity of the applicant community without the permission of the other parent , a non - member of the community . It relied on the fact that there were pending custody disputes between parents in GPE courts where religious education had been in issue . It noted that where a Witness parent had been represented in the custody dispute by a community - retained lawyer , this amounted to \u201c a manifestation of interest in the outcome of the cases of the community itself and an interference with the family and private affairs of its members \u201d . ORG also relied on the opinions of CARDINAL psychiatrist witnesses for the prosecution who stated that \u201c the literal following of the Bible principles , as practised by GPE 's Witnesses , restricted the person 's independent thinking ... and arrested psychological development \u201d . In their view , a child who did not celebrate holidays would become \u201c a social outcast \u201d and the community 's teachings \u201c hindered the development of patriotic feelings and love for LOC .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant community violated the right to freedom to choose one 's religion by resorting to active proselytising and \u201c mind control \u201d . According to the prosecution experts , GPE 's Witnesses were set apart from traditional religions because of the \u201c theocratic hierarchy of the community \u201d , \u201c their striving to integrate families into the life of a totalitarian non - secular collective \u201d and \u201c military - like discipline in domestic life \u201d . ORG accepted the opinions of the prosecution experts and rejected the contrary conclusion in the expert study that the defence expert psychiatrist had conducted of CARDINAL community members on the grounds that \u201c participants had been selected from lists supplied by the organisations \u201d and that the study \u201c only concerned the community members whereas their relatives had not been examined \u201d . ORG also considered that the petitions signed by the community members in its support had been \u201c evidence of the pressure that the community exercised on its members \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Ruling on the charge of \u201c encouragement of suicide or the refusal of medical assistance on religious grounds \u201d , ORG found that under the influence of the applicant community its members had refused transfusions of blood and/or blood components even in difficult or lifethreatening circumstances . That finding was based on the following evidence : the prohibition on blood transfusion contained in the literature of the applicant community , the \u201c No Blood \u201d card distributed within the community for the benefit of its members , testimonies by community members who confirmed carrying such cards , the existence of ORG with the applicant community , and stories of patients who had refused a blood transfusion on religious grounds and whose refusal had been noted in their medical records . ORG also had regard to a letter from ORG that listed a number of instances in which patients had refused blood transfusions for themselves and , in CARDINAL case , in respect of a newborn child . Even though the medical outcome of those cases was not specified , ORG held that the proven fact of damage to the health of CARDINAL individual was a sufficient ground for terminating the activities of the GPE community . It further noted the opinions of medical experts who clarified that bloodless surgery was a prospective trend in medicine but that in case of certain diseases the transfusion of blood or its components was still indispensable . Finally , in ORG view , the \u201c No Blood \u201d card contravened the patient 's right to take medical decisions for himself by delegating that right \u2013 in the eventuality of his being unconscious \u2013 to his fellow believers .", "CARDINAL . As to harming the health of citizens , ORG found that , in addition to the prohibition on blood transfusion , the activities of the applicant community had had a \u201c negative influence on the mental state and mental health of the followers \u201d . This assessment rested on opinions of PERSON family members who testified that they had seen \u201c sudden and negatives changes of personality \u201d in their relatives who had joined the applicant community and that many participants at religious meetings of GPE 's Witnesses had \u201c cried \u201d and had complained thereafter \u201c about colossal emotional exhaustion \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As to luring minors into the religious association , ORG found , on the basis of statements by CARDINAL non - Witness parents , that where a Witness parent involved the child in the activities of the applicant community , there was an encroachment on the child 's freedom of conscience and the joint right of parents to participate in the child 's upbringing .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG found that the applicant community 's literature incited citizens to \u201c refuse to fulfil their civil duties . \u201d This included refusal to serve in the army and to perform alternative service and promotion of \u201c a disrespectful attitude towards ORG emblems DATE the flag and the national anthem \u201d , as well as a prohibition on celebrating State holidays .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the interference with the applicant community 's rights was justified , prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim because the applicant community had \u201c violated rights and freedoms of citizens , and its activity led to the destruction of families , encroachments on the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens and calls to refuse to perform duties to society ... Taking into account that the [ applicant ] community violated constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens , the contemplated restriction on its rights and termination of its activity is justified and proportionate to the constitutionally significant aims \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant community was ordered to bear the costs of the expert studies of DATE and CARDINAL DATE and to pay costs of MONEY to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant community appealed , claiming , in particular , that the interference with its right to freedom of religion was not justified from the standpoint of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . It also invoked Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' appeal in a summary fashion and upheld the judgment of ORG , endorsing its reasons .", "DATE .

The principles of self - determination and individual autonomy compel the conclusion that the patient may reject blood transfusions even if harmful consequences may result and even if the decision is generally regarded as foolhardy ... To transfuse a GPE 's Witness , in the face of her explicit instructions to the contrary , would , in my opinion , violate her right to control her own body and show disrespect for the religious values by which she has chosen to live her life ...", "CARDINAL NORP The state undoubtedly has a strong interest in protecting and preserving the lives and health of its citizens . There clearly are circumstances where this interest may override the individual 's right to self - determination . For example , the state may , in certain cases , require that citizens submit to medical procedures in order to eliminate a health threat to the community ...", "CARDINAL NORP The state 's interest in preserving the life or health of a competent patient must generally give way to the patient 's stronger interest in directing the course of her own life . As indicated earlier , there is no law prohibiting a patient from declining necessary treatment ... Recognition of the right to reject medical treatment can not , in my opinion , be said to depreciate the interest of the state in life or in the sanctity of life . Individual free choice and self - determination are themselves fundamental constituents of life . To deny individuals freedom of choice , with respect to their health care , can only lessen and not enhance the value of life ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . A DATE landmark case from GPE involved an adult daughter of a NORP 's Witness who had been prevailed upon by her mother to refuse blood transfusions for religious reasons ( In re GPE ) CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) . Lord PERSON gave the following summary of his opinion :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Prima facie every adult has the right and capacity to decide whether or not he will accept medical treatment , even if a refusal may risk permanent injury to his health or even lead to premature death . Furthermore , it matters not whether the reasons for the refusal were rational or irrational , unknown or even non - existent . This is so notwithstanding the very strong public interest in preserving the life and health of all citizens . However , the presumption of capacity to decide , which stems from the fact that the patient is an adult , is rebuttable ...", "CARDINAL . In some cases doctors will not only have to consider the capacity of the patient to refuse treatment , but also whether the refusal has been vitiated because it resulted not from the patient 's will , but from the will of others . It matters not that those others sought , however strongly , to persuade the patient to refuse , so long as in the end the refusal represented the patient 's independent decision . If , however , his will was overborne , the refusal will not have represented a true decision . In this context the relationship of the persuader to the patient \u2013 for example , spouse , parents or religious adviser DATE will be important , because some relationships more readily lend themselves to overbearing the patient 's independent will than do others ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In GPE law , the doctrine of informed consent required for any kind of medical treatment has been firmly entrenched DATE when PERSON , on ORG , described this doctrine as follows : \u201c Every human being of adult DATE and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body , and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient 's consent commits an assault \u201d ( ORG , CARDINAL N.Y. CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . The logical corollary of the doctrine of informed consent is that the patient generally possesses the right not to consent , that is , to refuse treatment ( NORP v.

PERSON , CARDINAL So.CARDINALd CARDINAL , DATE [ Fla.CARDINAL , PERSON , PERSON . J. , concurring ] ) . When the individual 's conduct threatens injury to others , the ORG 's interest is manifest and the ORG can generally be expected to intervene . But the ORG rarely acts to protect individuals from themselves , indicating that the ORG 's interest is less substantial when there is little or no risk of direct injury to the public . This is consistent with the primary function of the ORG to preserve and promote liberty and the personal autonomy of the individual ( LOC v. PERSON , supra ) . ... The ORG will intervene to prevent suicide ... but merely declining medical care , even essential treatment , is not considered a suicidal act or indication of incompetence ( Matter of PERSON , supra , CARDINAL N.Y.CARDINALd at CARDINAL - CARDINAL , n.
