NORP The applicants\u2019 names and dates of birth are listed in annex CARDINAL . They are members of ORG najemnikov ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In the former GPE , socially - owned dwellings represented a significant part of the housing stock ( CARDINAL housing units ) . CARDINAL of the NORP population lived in such housing units at the time . According to the doctrine of \u201c social ownership \u201d ( dru\u017ebena lastnina ) introduced into the NORP system in DATE , such dwellings were owned by the community , the role of public bodies being confined to management .", "CARDINAL . After the Second World War , private dwellings and other LOC passed into ORG ownership through legislation on nationalisation . At the same time , dwellings were built or purchased by socially - owned enterprises or other public bodies . In both cases the latter allocated them to their employees and other entitled persons , who became holders of a \u201c specially protected tenancy \u201d or \u201c occupancy right \u201d ( stanovanjska pravica \u2013 hereinafter translated either as \u201c specially protected tenancy \u201d , as suggested by the applicants , or as \u201c occupancy right \u201d , as indicated by the Government ) under LAW and the existing legislation . The right to a socially - owned dwelling guaranteed the citizen \u201c the permanent use of the dwelling for his personal housing needs as well as for the needs of his family \u201d . LAW ( hereinafter referred to also as the \u201c ZSR \u201d ) provided that once allocated by an administrative decision followed by a contract , a specially protected tenancy entitled the holder to permanent , lifelong and uninterrupted use of the flat against the payment of a fee covering maintenance costs and depreciation . The fee ( or rent ) was determined on the basis of the construction price of dwellings and the requirements of simple replacement of dwellings , and in accordance with the standards and norms for the maintenance and management of socially - owned dwellings .", "CARDINAL . The Government pointed out that the occupancy right conferred the right to use the socially - owned dwelling only for the purpose of satisfying one \u2019s personal and family housing needs . Its rationale was the economical and efficient use of housing space , meaning that each family should have at its disposal as much space as it needed , and no more . The occupancy relationship could be terminated and another , more appropriate dwelling allocated in the event of a reduction of the number of users of the dwelling ( LAW of the ZSR ) . In the ORG \u2019s view , this proved that the occupancy right was associated with personal and family needs , and not with a particular dwelling . The concept of family needs was variable and depended on the number of family members . CARDINAL dwelling could be used at the same time and no one could move into the dwelling without the prior approval of the holder of the occupancy right . The latter was given management entitlements , such as the right and duty to participate in the management of the socially - owned housing . Holders of occupancy rights could exchange dwellings and make alterations to the dwelling , its furnishings and appliances only with the prior written approval of the housing administration ( Section CARDINAL of the ZSR ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged the ORG \u2019s allegation that the specially protected tenancy permitted use of the dwellings for housing purposes only . They observed that the holder of the occupancy right could use the dwelling without restrictions for himself and for the members of his family , did not need any consent to enlarge the number of family members , could use part of the dwelling for business activities and could sublease part of it for an agreed rent . He could modernise the dwelling with the agreement of the housing organisation managing the building ; if such agreement was denied DATE which in practice almost never occurred \u2013 he could demand substitution of consent in legal proceedings . The dwellings in question could be sold only to holders of occupancy rights , who could \u2013 with few very specific exceptions \u2013 exchange their dwellings . Any sales to third persons were null and void .", "CARDINAL . NORP In legal theory and judicial practice the specially protected tenancy was described as a right sui generis . On DATE the ORG delivered a decision ( Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in which it considered that under the legislation of the former GPE , the specially protected tenancy enjoyed stronger protection than a purely contractual tenancy right . The legal relationship was not limited in time and was linked not only to the holder of the right , but also to persons living with him . It concluded that , because of the very limited volume of transactions involving socially - owned dwellings , the specially protected tenancy had been more akin to a property right than to a tenancy right .", "CARDINAL . When a holder of a specially protected tenancy died , his or her rights were transferred to the surviving spouse or long term partner ( who held the specially protected tenancy jointly ) or to a registered member of the family household who was also using the flat . According to the applicants , this also applied if they moved out or divorced . Thus , specially protected tenancies could be passed on from generation to generation .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , however , this was not a succession of the occupancy right but rather a specifically regulated transfer of it to CARDINAL of the users of the dwelling . In this respect , the spouse and long term partner enjoyed a privileged status . Special provisions applied in the event of divorce ( LAW ) , and if it considered that none of the users of the dwelling met the conditions for obtaining the occupancy right after the death of the previous holder , the housing administration could request the said users to vacate the LOC ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The occupancy right could be cancelled only on limited grounds ( Sections CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the ZSR ) , the most important of which was failure by the holder to use the flat for his or her own housing needs for a continuous period of DATE without good reason ( such as military service , medical treatment , or temporary work elsewhere in the former ORG ( the \u201c SFRY \u201d ) or abroad ; see LAW of the ZSR ) . In this case , the users of the dwelling who had been living together with the holder of the occupancy right for a minimum of DATE had the same rights as they would have had if the holder had died . Other grounds were inappropriate and detrimental behaviour , failure to pay the fee , full sublease , use of the dwelling by a person other than the holder of the occupancy right and possession of an unoccupied flat suitable for residence . Although inspections were to be carried out to ensure compliance with these requirements , the specially protected tenancy was rarely , if ever , cancelled on these grounds ( see PERSON GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) . In this connection , the applicants pointed out that it was true that in theory holders of a specially protected tenancy could be moved to a substitute dwelling if the dwelling they were occupying was too large for them and the other users with regard to social standards ( see the Government \u2019s submissions in paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , according to the applicants , this possibility was in practice never used and there was no case - law on the matter .", "CARDINAL . All employed citizens were required to pay a special DATE housing contribution ( CARDINAL to MONEY of their DATE income ) to ORG . The funds thus obtained were used to build and maintain socially - owned flats . ORG granted benefits ( allocation of a flat under specially protected tenancy , or loan to purchase , construct or renovate a dwelling ) on the basis of the principles of mutuality and solidarity with those in need . All socially - owned dwellings were part of ORG and administered by ORG institutions , municipalities , social enterprises and other legal entities governed by public law .", "CARDINAL . Before GPE became independent , the applicants or their legal predecessors acquired specially protected tenancies in socially - owned dwellings which had been expropriated under the legislation on nationalisation . Under the legislation in force prior to DATE , no difference in specially protected tenancy conditions was made between tenants of ORG - constructed dwellings and tenants of nationalised dwellings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE declared its independence . Among the first reforms enacted were LAW DATE ( PERSON ) and LAW DATE ( Zakon o denacionalizaciji ) , aimed at redressing the wrongs committed after the Second World War . LAW Section CARDINAL ) guaranteed the right of private ownership .", "CARDINAL . The Housing Act DATE ( hereinafter referred to also as the \u201c SZ \u201d ) provided for the transformation and privatisation of socially - owned dwellings . ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was dissolved and , with few exceptions , the socially - owned dwellings were transferred ex lege into ORG ownership or into that of local communities or ORG . Those dwellings which had become socially - owned property after having been expropriated from private owners were transferred into the ownership of the municipalities ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The specially protected tenancy was replaced ex lege with a normal lease contract ( LAW ) . The previous holders of specially protected tenancies or , in the event of their death , their family members living in the flats , were given the possibility of renting the flats for an indefinite period and for a non - profit rent ( which covered maintenance , management of the flat and capital costs \u2013 LAW ) or of purchasing them on favourable terms , paying an administratively defined price which was calculated on the basis of a discount of PERCENT ( in the event of payment in instalments ) or PERCENT ( in the event of CARDINAL - off payment ) off the estimated value ( Sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , in practice this meant a price of PERCENT of the real market value of the dwelling payable in instalments over DATE or PERCENT of that value payable within DATE . The right to purchase on favourable terms could be transferred inter vivos or mortis causa to close family members . However , previous holders of specially protected tenancy in flats which had been expropriated could only purchase them on favourable terms if the owners agreed to sell them within DATE from the restitution of the dwelling ( Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . In that case DATE MONEY discount ( Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) was offered by the owner , who would then be reimbursed by the municipality .", "CARDINAL . It follows from the above that all previous holders of specially protected tenancies were given the possibility of taking out new leases ( to be signed within DATE from the entry into force of LAW DATE ) . However , the applicants contended that these new leases were less advantageous than the specially protected tenancy . In particular , tenants no longer had secured tenancy of their homes since the owners could move them to other adequate flats without any particular justification ( Section CARDINAL ) . There were now CARDINAL grounds on which tenants could be evicted for misconduct , compared with CARDINAL previously . The fault - based grounds for termination of the lease were ( LAW of the ORG ) :", "\u201c - if the tenant and any person living with him uses the dwelling counter to the law or the terms of the lease ;", "- if , by the way they use the dwelling , the tenant or any person living with him causes major damage to the dwelling or to common areas , parts , facilities and installations of a multi - dwelling building ;", "- if the tenant fails twice in succession or for CARDINAL out of DATE to pay rent or costs payable in addition to rent within the time - limit specified in the lease ;", "- if the tenant or any person living with him , by their manner of using the dwelling , frequently or seriously disturbs other residents in their peaceful use of the dwelling ;", "- if the tenant makes changes to the dwelling and fixtures without the prior consent of the owner ;", "- if , in addition to the tenant , a person who is not named in the lease contract uses the dwelling for DATE without the owner \u2019s knowledge ;", "- if the tenant leases out the dwelling without the agreement of the owner or charges a subtenant a higher rent ;", "- if the tenant does not allow access to the dwelling in cases [ specified by law ] ;", "- if the tenant or any other person who uses the dwelling engages in a prohibited activity there , or a permitted activity in an unlawful manner . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , before terminating the lease the owner had to give prior written notice to the tenant who was allegedly violating its provisions ; no termination was allowed if the inability to pay the rent in full and to entirely fulfil other obligations was due to the social distress of the tenant and the other persons using the dwelling .", "CARDINAL . Without the owner \u2019s permission , tenants could not sublet a flat , renovate it or decorate it . Nor could they bring new people into the flat ( Section CARDINAL ) . The owner could renovate the flat at any time and enter it twice a year ( Section CARDINAL ) . The tenant could not freely transfer the lease to another family member or exchange the flat . After the death of the original tenant , only the spouse or a person having lived with the tenant in a permanent relationship , or an immediate family member living in the flat , had the right to take over the lease ( Section CARDINAL ) . The tenant had to pay the legally regulated non - profit rent ( Section CARDINAL ) , which , unlike the fee ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , not only covered maintenance costs and depreciation , but also included a sum to offset capital costs and management of the dwelling .", "CARDINAL . The Denationalisation Act DATE ( hereinafter referred to also as the \u201c NORP \u201d ) regulated the denationalisation of property which had previously passed into ORG ownership through legislation on agrarian reform , nationalisation , confiscation or other forms of expropriation of privately owned properties . Previous owners or their heirs ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c previous owners \u201d ) were entitled ( until DATE ) to claim restitution of the expropriated property . Wherever possible , the property itself was to be returned in natura , including dwellings which had been let under the specially protected tenancy scheme . Where such restitution was not possible , claimants were entitled to substitute property and/or compensation ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The restitution of dwellings occupied by a tenant did not affect the leases concluded in the meantime , which remained in force ( see LAW of the ORG and LAW of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants pointed out that after the enactment of the housing reform , a number of former holders of specially protected tenancies in previously expropriated flats filed requests to purchase the flats . The deadline for filing such requests expired before that for \u201c previous owners \u201d to file restitution claims . Only when it became clear in individual cases ( especially in DATE ) that denationalisation proceedings had been initiated , were the former holders of specially protected tenancies informed that their requests to purchase had been rejected .", "CARDINAL . Holders of occupancy rights had no part in the denationalisation proceedings to determine the ownership of the property , which meant that they were not notified when a request was filed for the restitution of the dwelling they were occupying . According to the data submitted by the applicants , CARDINAL restitution requests had been filed and in the period until DATE a yearly average of CARDINAL decisions had been rendered , which meant a total of CARDINAL decisions , out of which CARDINAL became final . Until DATE PERCENT of decisions were for restitution in the form of compensation , PERCENT for restitution of ownership of free dwellings , PERCENT for restitution of ownership of occupied dwellings and PERCENT were refusals or rejections of the requests . This meant that by DATE a substantial portion of denationalisation procedures had not been completed . Initially in such procedures the property was returned to the pre - war owners ; however , in the vast majority of cases those owners had passed away , which meant that in order to identify the \u201c previous owners \u201d a complex and time - consuming inheritance procedure was necessary .", "CARDINAL . The Government pointed out that tenants were not party to the denationalisation proceedings because restitution did not affect the tenancy relationship and did not prejudice the tenants\u2019 rights or benefits which had a direct basis in law . Moreover , the existence of a tenancy relationship did not affect the decision on denationalisation and restitution ( see ORG decision no . Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , point CARDINAL ) . However , tenants could participate if they demonstrated a legal interest , notably an interest in recovering their investments . In this regard , the status of party to the denationalisation proceedings was recognised in respect of : ( a ) any person who , before DATE ( date of entry into force of the PERSON ) , had invested in nationalised real estate , whenever and insofar as the proceedings might lead to a ruling on that person \u2019s rights deriving from the investments concerned , and ( b ) the entities liable for restitution , which in the case of former socially - owned dwellings usually meant municipalities ( Section CARDINAL of the PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The principle of restitution in natura applied also in cases in which the value of the property had increased . Former holders of the occupancy right who had invested in the dwelling could only claim compensation under the law , but not acquire ownership of the dwelling by virtue of such investments . In particular , the occupant could claim total recovery of costs on the condition that the investments had been made prior to DATE and that they constituted major maintenance investments and not simple routine maintenance . Upon a judicial action introduced by the tenant , the competent court would appoint a construction expert to assess the value of the property at the time of nationalisation and its value at the time of its restitution ; a tenant who could provide evidence of the investments made ( they were not required to provide evidence that the community of residents had consented to the investments ) could then obtain the difference between the CARDINAL values of the property ( LAW of the ORG ) . In cases in which a final decision on restitution had already been adopted , a claim for recovery of investments could be filed within DATE from the entry into force of the CARDINAL Act amending the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants observed that in the event of an increase in the value of the property due to the investments made by the tenant , LAW of the PERSON gave CARDINAL options to the \u201c previous owners \u201d : ( a ) to request compensation instead of restitution in natura ; ( b ) to request part ownership of the dwelling ; ( c ) to recover the full property and reimburse the tenant . As a rule , the tenants\u2019 requests for reimbursement were examined in sets of proceedings initiated after the denationalisation proceedings , often after DATE . However , according to the applicants , the evaluation of the dwellings according to the relevant domestic rules was totally unrealistic , which made the evaluation of the increased value due to new investments unrealistic also . Moreover , only those investments which had increased the value of the dwelling DATE and not those which had kept the value of the property at the same level since its expropriation \u2013 were taken into account . The time - limit for reimbursement of investments was DATE and the parties could reach a friendly settlement on these matters . \u201c Previous owners \u201d frequently made the reimbursement conditional upon the tenants vacating the LOC . In the applicants\u2019 opinion , these rules did not guarantee former holders of occupancy rights a fair possibility of recovering the real value of their investments .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the ORG and the PERSON , as well as the legal acts implementing them , underwent numerous amendments , which on some occasions were more favourable to the tenants , and on others to the \u201c previous owners \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The DATE amendments to LAW , enacted on DATE , were more in favour of the tenants . Former holders of a specially protected tenancy who occupied previously expropriated flats which had not been returned to \u201c previous owners \u201d ( because no request for restitution had been filed , or the request had been rejected ) were allowed to purchase the flats they were occupying ( amended Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The amended LAW further provided that where the dwelling had been returned to the \u201c previous owner \u201d , if he agreed to sell he was eligible for an additional financial reward from public funds ( this was the so - called \u201c first model \u201d of substitute privatisation ) .", "CARDINAL . If the \u201c previous owner \u201d declined to sell the dwelling and the tenant decided , within DATE from the restitution , to move out and purchase a flat or construct a house , and if the \u201c previous owner \u201d so agreed , he would pay the tenant compensation amounting to CARDINAL per cent of the value of the dwelling . If , however , the \u201c previous owner \u201d refused this solution , the tenant was entitled to claim the same amount from the entity liable for restitution , which was usually a municipality ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The tenant was entitled to further compensation amounting to MONEY of the value , in CARDINAL , from the municipality , ORG and ORG . In addition , the tenant also had the right to a ORG loan under certain conditions . This was the so - called \u201c second model \u201d for settling the housing issue .", "CARDINAL . The DATE amendments also introduced a so - called \u201c third model \u201d , where a tenant to whom the \u201c previous owner \u201d was not prepared to sell the dwelling could purchase a comparable substitute flat on favourable terms from the municipality if he decided not to purchase another flat or construct a house ( amended LAW ) . Under this model , the applicants were in the same position as previous holders of specially protected tenancies in ORG - constructed dwellings who could not purchase the dwelling they had occupied because of practical and legal obstacles .", "CARDINAL . The applicants noted that the right to purchase established by the amended LAW of the ORG was legally directly applicable and was not subjected either to preclusive time - limits or to a statute of limitations . It was a permanent legal option , to be realised on the basis of a unilateral request by the former holder of the specially protected tenancy ( ORG decision of DATE , no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . However , the \u201c third model \u201d was repealed on DATE by ORG ( decision ORG ) , which considered that the additional financial burden had unduly restricted the FAC newly acquired ownership rights over dwellings which had previously been socially owned . In ORG opinion , this restriction could not be justified by the tendency of the legislature to ensure that the previous protected tenants of denationalised dwellings enjoyed a position resembling as closely as possible that of other tenants , in particular with regard to the possibility of purchasing a flat .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered a decision ( U - I-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerning the pre - emption right of tenants having contracts of unlimited duration ( Section CARDINAL ) , such as the previous holders of specially protected tenancies . It held that that pre - emption right , already provided for by the previous legislation , did not interfere with the property rights in respect of dwellings subject to original privatisation under the ORG and the PERSON , since the property right had not yet been established at the time of the entry into force of those acts . However , where property rights had been acquired by other means , the pre - emption right interfered with the right of property and was unconstitutional . The dissenting opinion of Judge PERSON was appended to the ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent amendments to LAW , and LAW enacted in DATE ( hereinafter referred to also as the \u201c SZ-CARDINAL \u201d ) , were more favourable to the \u201c previous owners \u201d , who were authorised to raise the non - profit rent by PERCENT in order to cover maintenance costs and other expenses . That increase in the non - profit rent was to be applied only to leases taken out after the amendments entered into force ( DATE ) . However , on DATE ORG ( decision no . U - I-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) declared this limitation unconstitutional as being discriminatory . It underlined that protecting the status of former occupancy right holders did not mean that the non - profit rent could not change , and that eliminating the discrepancy in the previous system ( under which rents did not cover the real cost of the use of a dwelling ) could not be deemed to be an inadmissible interference with the terms of the lease contracts . The protection of acquired rights and the principle of non - retroactivity did not protect tenants from increases in rent . The increase in the non - profit rent was thus extended to all the leases that predated the enactment of the DATE amendments .", "CARDINAL . The Housing Act DATE increased from CARDINAL to CARDINAL the number of fault - based grounds on which tenants could be evicted from their homes ( unauthorised persons living in the flat , violation of the house rules , tenant \u2019s absence in excess of DATE , ownership of another suitable dwelling , either by the tenant or by his or her partner \u2013 Section CARDINAL ) . However , tenants could avoid termination of the lease by proving that the problem was not their fault or that it had not been possible for them to rectify the problem within the given time - limit ( Section CARDINAL ) ) . The \u201c previous owner \u201d could also move the tenant to another adequate flat ( defined in LAW as a flat satisfying the housing needs of the tenant and his immediate family members living with him or her ) at any time and without any reason ; however , this could be done to the same tenant only once and the removal costs were borne by the \u201c previous owner \u201d ( LAW ) . In respect of the transferability of the lease after the tenant \u2019s death , a request to take the lease over had to be filed within DATE ( Section CARDINAL ) . For this purpose , a relative up to the second generation who had lived in economic community with the former holder of the occupancy right for DATE on DATE of entry into force of LAW was considered to be an \u201c immediate family member \u201d ( LAW ) . The tenant had a pre - emption right if the flat was for sale .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , rent subsidies ( PERCENT of the non - profit rent ) were available to tenants in the event of financial difficulties ; socially disadvantaged people could also apply to the municipalities to obtain another non - profit rental dwelling or a temporary solution for their housing needs ( Sections ORG and CARDINAL ) . The DATE LAW introduced Sections CARDINALa and CARDINALb , which provided for the possibility , for people who were paying market rents and had unsuccessfully applied for the allocation of a non - profit rental dwelling , to obtain subsidies ( amounting to the difference between the market and non - profit rents ) . These provisions were aimed at compensating the shortage of non - profit dwellings .", "CARDINAL . The DATE LAW also introduced a \u201c new model \u201d of so - called \u201c substitute privatisation \u201d for former occupancy right holders . Within DATE after the enactment of the LAW or after the decision on denationalisation had become final , they could exercise their right to purchase another dwelling or to build a house , thus becoming entitled to special compensation ( PERCENT of the price of the dwelling \u2013 Section CARDINAL ) and to a subsidised loan for the remaining amount . Entitlement to and level of compensation were determined by the Ministry responsible for housing matters . Tenants who decided to buy another dwelling or build a house were obliged to vacate their rented accommodation DATE after receiving the compensation .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , tenants who did not wish or could not afford to buy a flat could apply to rent a non - profit dwelling ( Section CARDINAL ) . The latter was defined as a dwelling rented out by the municipality , the ORG or a public housing fund or non - profit organisation , allocated on the basis of a public call for applications ( LAW ) . Under this procedure \u201c tenants of a dwelling expropriated under nationalisation regulations and returned to the previous owner \u201d were awarded a rather high number of points ( CARDINAL ) , which , according to the ORG , offered them good prospects of being given priority and actually being declared eligible . Lease agreements for non - profit dwellings would be concluded for an unlimited period ( Section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to information available on the Internet , in DATE there were CARDINAL housing units eligible for return to \u201c previous owners \u201d . CARDINAL housing units were returned to ownership in full title , while CARDINAL were returned to \u201c previous owners \u201d while still occupied by tenants who previously had specially protected tenancies . According to the Government , in DATE some CARDINAL such tenants had managed to solve their housing situation by substitute privatisation , that is , by purchasing or building a substitute dwelling with the help of a financial incentive from the ORG . A further FAC tenants had lodged requests and proceedings were still pending at the time of submission of the Government \u2019s observations . CARDINAL tenants would eventually continue to live in the flats they had previously occupied as holders of specially protected tenancies .", "CARDINAL . The applicants emphasised that at the beginning of the housing reform , out of CARDINAL housing units in GPE CARDINAL were socially - owned dwellings housing CARDINAL of the NORP population under specially protected tenancies ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . At the time the legislation did not distinguish between expropriated dwellings and other socially - owned dwellings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and , in general , individuals acquiring occupancy rights did not even know which source the dwelling came from . This was especially true for those who had acquired occupancy rights DATE after the expropriation . The great majority of holders of occupancy rights who had been given the opportunity to purchase the dwellings on favourable terms had availed themselves of this possibility ; only a few of them had stayed in the flats on a contractual basis . However , as explained in paragraph CARDINAL above , the possibility to purchase without the \u201c previous ORG \u201d consent was not given to those who were living in previously expropriated dwellings subject to denationalisation ( CARDINAL properties , covering PERCENT of all specially protected tenants ) . According to the available estimates , in DATE approximately CARDINAL families ( most likely those who could not afford to buy a dwelling ) had continued to lease their denationalised dwellings , while CARDINAL families had vacated the LOC and found a solution to their housing needs elsewhere . According to the applicants , for the former category of families relations with the \u201c previous owners \u201d had often been burdened with judicial and personal conflicts . \u201c Previous owners \u201d applied constant pressure through , inter alia , illegal evictions , rent increases or simply poor building maintenance .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , in his regular annual reports the NORP Ombudsman has illustrated the difficulties facing tenants in denationalised flats . In his ORG of DATE on FAC in FAC he also made a number of proposals designed to remedy the situation : feasible models for substitute privatisation ( greater financial incentives to solve the housing issue , for both tenants and \u201c previous owners \u201d ) , protection of the duration of leases and definition of the non - profit rent , legal mechanisms for the protection of tenants\u2019 rights , such as free legal aid , improved implementation of the right to pre - empt , realistic evaluation of tenants\u2019 investments for the refurbishment of the dwellings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hereinafter , \u201c the Association \u201d ) , lodged a \u201c petition \u201d with several ORG authorities , including ORG , the President of the Republic and the Government . It challenged LAW DATE and LAW DATE , on the ground that they deprived the ORG \u2019s members of their specially protected tenancy rights in a manner incompatible with LAW , which was still in force at the time when the CARDINAL acts were passed in DATE . Instead of the privileged specially protected tenancy , which in the ORG \u2019s view was in many respects equal to a property right , tenants were granted leases with a temporary non - profit rent . Moreover , once the dwelling had been taken over by a \u201c previous owner \u201d , that contract became an ordinary lease contract . This effectively deprived the tenants of their property and home . In DATE CARDINAL individuals ( previous holders of specially protected tenancies and their families ) , living in CARDINAL flats , were concerned by these measures . They considered themselves victims of the transition , in the same manner as \u201c previous owners \u201d whose property had been taken away under the previous regime .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also complained that its members were not given all the rights and benefits that other former specially protected tenancy holders enjoyed , such as the right to purchase the dwelling and to have a permanent lease with a non - profit rent . It argued that tenants who \u2013 like all its members \u2013 were living in dwellings once expropriated , could not purchase their homes , which were subject to restitution to the \u201c previous owners \u201d , whereas all other previous beneficiaries of specially protected tenancies had that possibility . In addition , \u201c previous owners \u201d of flats returned in denationalisation proceedings were selling them to third parties but not to the tenants , who were facing eviction proceedings . In the ORG \u2019s view , the restitution of the dwellings to the \u201c previous owners \u201d deprived the tenants of the right to purchase them and resulted in differential treatment between the CARDINAL groups of tenants on no reasonable ground .", "CARDINAL . The offending legislation allegedly also failed to provide for proper compensation for the money the tenants had invested in the maintenance and improvement of the dwellings . Moreover , the ORG complained that its members did not have locus standi in the denationalisation proceedings which were to rule on the ownership of \u201c their \u201d dwellings . It also criticised the constant increases in the non - profit rent , which in its view was approaching levels comparable to the rents charged on the free market . The ORG concluded that privatisation and restitution of previously expropriated dwellings should be achieved by paying compensation to the \u201c previous owners \u201d of the dwellings rather than returning their property , as recommended by LAW of ORG of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . It requested that an independent expert commission be set up , that the ORG and the PERSON be amended , that the restitution of property as such be stayed and that ORG be supplemented .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government adopted a decision concerning the petition , with an accompanying opinion . The Government did not agree that tenants were the victims of transition . Regarding the right of previous holders of specially protected tenancies to purchase the dwellings , different factual circumstances had to be taken into account . While in some cases the dwellings had been built with ORG funds , in other cases they had been expropriated from private owners . These \u201c previous owners \u201d might also claim restitution of , and therefore property rights over the dwellings . This meant that they had priority over the former holders of specially protected tenancy rights . In conclusion , as far as the purchase of dwellings was concerned , the CARDINAL categories of previous holders of specially protected tenancies were not in a comparable position .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , with respect to other rights and benefits the tenants had been put on an equal footing with all those previous holders of specially protected tenancies who decided not to purchase their dwellings but to rent them on favourable terms . They were all granted the right to rent the dwellings for an indefinite period for a non - profit rent , even after the \u201c previous owner \u201d took over the flat . This had been upheld by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government also disputed the objection that the impugned legislation did not take into account the investments the tenants had put into the dwellings . They referred to the relevant provisions of the ORG , which granted former specially protected tenancy holders the right to compensation . The Government pointed out that the needs and expectations of the tenants had to be reconciled with those of the \u201c previous owners \u201d of the dwellings , as well as with the limited financial capacities of the ORG to provide them with housing on favourable terms . They further acknowledged that the tenants , especially elderly people , encountered certain difficulties in their new situation ( pressure to move out or to pay a higher rent ) , but such circumstances had no foundation in the existing legislation . The Government supported the establishment of an expert commission with representatives of both tenants and \u201c previous owners \u201d . It appears that no other authority took a position with respect to the petition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG instituted proceedings against the Government with ORG , for not initiating the necessary amendments to the ORG and the PERSON . In their view , the legislation in question breached the tenants\u2019 rights under LAW and LAW , and disregarded LAW of ORG of ORG . In particular , the ORG repeated the complaints from its petition that the dwellings should not be returned as such , that the tenants had only a limited right to purchase the dwellings , that they did not have locus standi in the denationalisation proceedings and that their investments in the dwellings had not been taken into account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the complaints , holding that the ORG \u2019s decision and the accompanying opinion did not qualify under LAW , as then in force , as an individual act or an action infringing the individual \u2019s constitutional rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG , challenging ORG decision . It repeated the arguments from the petition and the subsequent court proceedings , and argued in particular that the legislation in issue deprived the tenants of their property and homes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the complaint . It upheld the decisions of ORG and ORG that the relevant governmental decision and the accompanying opinion could not be challenged in administrative proceedings . In ORG view , they merely reflected the ORG \u2019s policy position with respect to the petition lodged , and were therefore not subject to court review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the same time as the constitutional complaint ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG , representing a group of previous specially protected tenancy holders , also lodged a constitutional initiative for review of the constitutionality of the ORG , the ORG , LAW DATE and the relevant judicial practice , and their compatibility with international law binding on GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the constitutional initiative ( decision ORG ) . It acknowledged that the ORG , relying on a number of court proceedings initiated by its members , had a legal interest in challenging the existing legislation since it directly interfered with their rights , interests and legal position , but it ruled that ORG did not have jurisdiction to examine the compatibility of the disputed legislation with the provisions of LAW , which was no longer in force .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the case - law of ORG , ORG went on to say that in any event the specially protected tenancy could not be interpreted as an absolute right to property under LAW No . CARDINAL , guaranteeing the acquisition of a particular dwelling . Nor could it be said that the claimants\u2019 right to a home had been breached under LAW , since they could remain in the dwellings , with a contract of unlimited duration and for a non - profit rent . In addition , after the tenant \u2019s death , the right of a spouse or a person having lived with the tenant in a permanent relationship , or an immediate family member living in the flat , to take over the tenancy was also guaranteed ( LAW of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG had held in its previous decisions that the specially protected tenancy from the former system was a right to be protected by the rule of law . However , in the new system , this right encountered other rights . In transposing the system of specially protected tenancy relations into lease relations , the legislator could not fulfil all the expectations arising from the former socio - economic and political system , which was founded on social property , and not on private property . The rights from the former system could not have remained unchanged and untouched .", "CARDINAL . The ORG had undergone political and social changes , including the transformation of social property into private property . The challenged legislation and the transformation of specially protected tenancy into simple tenancy rights should therefore be understood as part of these changes . Tenants\u2019 rights were now limited by the rights of the \u201c previous owners \u201d of the dwellings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the tenants\u2019 right to purchase now competed with the property rights of the \u201c previous owners \u201d of the dwellings . In this conflict of rights , priority was given to the property rights of the \u201c previous owners \u201d . With this argument ORG also dismissed the objection that tenants who could not purchase their dwellings because they were subject to restitution to the \u201c previous owners \u201d were discriminated against in comparison with all other tenants , who had the right to buy their dwellings . It held that the factual circumstances of the CARDINAL groups of tenants were profoundly different . While the rights of CARDINAL group of tenants had to be reconciled with the rights of the \u201c previous owners \u201d of the dwellings , no such limitation on the rights of the other group of tenants was necessary . The tenants also had a pre - emption right in the event that the \u201c previous owner \u201d decided to sell the dwelling , which could be entered in the land register and was weaker only than the pre - emption right of a co - owner ( Section CARDINAL of the SZ-CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As for other rights and benefits , including the right to a non - profit rent , ORG considered that all the previous holders of occupancy rights had been placed on an equal footing , regardless of the origin of their dwellings . These rights , in turn , were comparable to the level of protection granted to tenants in other GPE . General allegations that the legislative definition of the non - profit rent was inappropriate were not sufficient to warrant constitutional review .", "CARDINAL . ORG also dismissed the complaint that the tenants did not have locus standi in the denationalisation proceedings . Inasmuch as the proceedings were decisive for tenants\u2019 rights , tenants did have locus standi . In particular , this concerned the tenants\u2019 right to compensation for any money invested in the dwelling , which could be claimed from the \u201c previous owner \u201d . On the other hand , on the basis of such financial investments , the tenants did not acquire a property right or a claim to the property itself in the denationalisation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . As to the restitution to the \u201c previous owners \u201d of expropriated dwellings in which tenants were living , ORG had already ruled that the relevant provisions of the PERSON were not contrary to LAW . Furthermore , the \u201c previous owners \u201d were not free to enter into any lease agreements with the tenants ; they merely took over the existing leases the tenants had signed with the municipalities . Finally , ORG dismissed the ORG \u2019s allegations that Section CARDINAL of the Administrative Disputes Act as then in force was unclear and contrary to the LAW .", "DATE . On DATE ORG deliberated in a case , brought by applicant no . CARDINAL ( Mr PERSON ) , concerning the right of a family member to demand a new non - profit lease after the tenant of the denationalised flat in question had died . ORG reversed the case - law and decided that users of denationalised flats could not demand the continuation of a non - profit lease following the demise of the tenant ; in the ORG \u2019s view , they were entitled only to a lease , and the \u201c previous owner \u201d should be free to determine the amount of the rent without any limitations .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , a close family member of a deceased former holder of occupancy rights filed a petition for a review of the constitutionality of this new case - law , and a constitutional complaint . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( no . U - I-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the LAW court held that it was unconstitutional to interpret LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) in such a manner that , after the death of the holder of a protected tenancy , the \u201c previous owner \u201d was obliged to lease it to the family members of the deceased for a non - profit rent . It thus confirmed the DATE decision of ORG . However , ORG did clarify that the spouse or the long term partner of a deceased tenant at the time of the enactment of the ORG was entitled to continue the lease at a non - profit rent .", "CARDINAL . The applicants observed that this case - law allowed \u201c previous owners \u201d to fix an unreasonably high rent , thereby preventing the family members of the deceased tenant ( other than the spouse or the long term partner ) from continuing the lease . They alleged that from DATE onwards a mortis causa transferability of the right to lease had de facto been eliminated .", "CARDINAL . As the file contained no specific examples of individual situations , in DATE the ORG requested the applicants to submit factual information in respect of the amount of the original rent in DATE and that of the present non - profit rent , the surface area of the flat , its state of repair and its current market value , as well as a chronological overview of the increases in rent and in the statutory minimum wage .", "CARDINAL . In their reply of DATE , the applicants gave evidence that they were all original former holders of specially protected tenancies or their legal successors .", "CARDINAL . They stated that the first significant increase ( of PERCENT ) in the non - profit rent took place in DATE . At that time , its ceiling DATE amount was still PERCENT of the value of the dwelling . Further gradual changes were introduced by the DATE amendments to the ORG ( rent increase of PERCENT ) , by ORG decision and by the SZ-CARDINAL ( rent increase of PERCENT ) . The ceiling amount for the DATE non - profit rent was currently PERCENT of the value of the dwelling . They stated that a further rent increase of PERCENT was foreseen in different municipalities . The non - profit rent paid at the time by the tenants equalled PERCENT of the non - profit rent fixed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the applicants stated that factual information provided by them showed that the non - profit rent in GPE and GPE was still relatively affordable , as it was below the market rent ( see annex DATE \u201c Table summarising the situation of the individual applicants \u201d ) . The situation was allegedly different in the countryside , but no concrete information was provided . In certain cases there was no historical data as the documentation no longer existed because of the lapse of time and because the tenants had moved .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the average market price of property per square metre in GPE city centre ranged QUANTITY it was between EUR CARDINAL per square metre . As to the statutory minimum wage , in DATE it amounted to CARDINAL NORP tolars ( SIT , nominally ORG CARDINAL ) . In DATE it was SIT CARDINAL ( nominally ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) and in DATE EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "DATE . The applicants also stated that they had made significant financial investments in the renovation and refurbishment of the dwellings .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL applicants ( Mr Kuret , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON PERSON and PERSON ) had been forced to move out . Mr PERSON was the only applicant who pursued the legal avenues up to ORG . His constitutional complaint was dismissed on DATE for lack of legal interest , as he had reached a settlement with the \u201c previous owner \u201d on DATE ( see annex DATE \u201c Table summarising the situation of the individual applicants \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The other applicants , who still occupied the dwellings , were allegedly under pressure , either through court proceedings or through correspondence with the lawyers representing the \u201c previous owners \u201d . They complained about various forms of chicanery and intimidation . All the applicants had had to seek legal advice .", "CARDINAL . The parties also gave details as to the method of calculating the non - profit rent which was introduced by the ORG . Its level might be agreed upon by the parties to the lease contract , but they had to apply the method provided for by the law and not exceed the maximum permitted level of non - profit rent . This was always a percentage ( PERCENT for dwellings DATE ) of the administrative value of the flat , which was determined by the housing authorities according to the following formula :", "Value of the dwelling = number of points x value of the point x usable area x effect of size of the dwelling ( corrective factor )", "CARDINAL . NORP The rent for dwellings for which tenancy agreements were concluded with the former holders of occupancy rights could not exceed the rent level charged for dwellings DATE . The values of the point and the correction factor for surface measurements had always been determined by primary or secondary legislation and as such amended several times . As a general rule , the non - profit rent for newly constructed or renovated flats , of better quality and better equipped , was higher than for older , less well - maintained flats . The non - profit rent was also determined in the light of the state of repair at the time the dwelling was allocated to the tenant , that is , before any investment was made .", "CARDINAL . The Government pointed out that the non - profit rent was a cost - based rent covering the economic costs of a dwelling . It did not include taxes to be paid by the \u201c previous owner \u201d and was meant to cover :", "- the depreciation of the dwelling ( to enable the owner to replace a run - down dwelling after a certain number of DATE initially CARDINAL , then CARDINAL ) ;", "- the cost of the capital invested ;", "- the management of the dwelling ;", "- investment and routine maintenance .", "CARDINAL . Under the DATE rules , for previous holders of occupancy rights the DATE non - profit rent could not exceed PERCENT of the value of the dwelling . The rules were revised in DATE for ordinary tenants , bringing the percentage to PERCENT for dwellings constructed after DATE . From DATE until DATE , the percentage was PERCENT for dwellings DATE and PERCENT for dwellings DATE . For former holders of occupancy rights or persons with whom the \u201c previous owner \u201d was obliged to conclude a lease contract under LAW of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the percentage could not exceed PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . The Government observed that the new calculation method had been applied progressively over DATE ; thus , according to them , for tenants of denationalised dwellings the rent , in real terms , had decreased from PERCENT in DATE to PERCENT in DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE brought the value of the maximum permitted annual non - profit rent up to PERCENT of that of the dwelling , and this notwithstanding the fact that a study ordered by ORG responsible for ORG had shown that a rent covering all costs of the use of the dwelling should amount to PERCENT . A progressive increase in rents was scheduled DATE ( see LAW DATE and LAW on the method for calculating rents in non - profit dwellings ) . As a result , for dwellings DATE , the non - profit rent was immediately decreased by PERCENT , from PERCENT to PERCENT ; for dwellings DATE ( which were the majority ) , it increased by PERCENT , from PERCENT to PERCENT ; lastly , in the CARDINAL denationalised dwellings it increased by PERCENT , from PERCENT to PERCENT . On DATE , the annual non - profit rent in all buildings amounted to PERCENT of the value of the dwelling . It did not increase any more after that date .", "CARDINAL . The Government also emphasised that the value of the \u201c housing point \u201d , which was based on the DATE average price per square metre of constructed non - profit dwellings divided by CARDINAL ( average number of points for newly constructed non - profit dwellings ) , increased from CARDINAL NORP PERSON ( ORG ) in DATE to DEM CARDINAL.CARDINAL in DATE . Non - profit rents increased no further in real terms , but they did increase in relation to the ORG . For dwellings rented after the implementation of the new calculation method introduced in DATE the value of the point was fixed at DEM MONEY ( and later at EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . Each dwelling was given a certain number of points which would take into account the time and quality of construction , the type and quality of joinery elements , floorings , walls , fitted installations , the type and availability of common areas , thermal and acoustic insulation and any negative impacts on the use of the dwelling .", "CARDINAL . According to the DATE ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) the location of the dwelling could also affect its value . The effect of the location on the level of the non - profit rent could be determined by each municipality and might amount to a maximum of PERCENT of the rent ; however , at the time of the Government \u2019s observations , CARDINAL municipalities ( Nova Gorica and Menge\u0161 ) had adopted provisions in this respect ; this meant that in all other municipalities , the location of the building did not affect the rent ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "6", "8", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "8-1", "P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
