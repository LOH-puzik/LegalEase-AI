Among these tests were the \u201c LOC \u201d and \u201c Grapple Z \u201d series of CARDINAL detonations at LOC in LOC ( DATE ) , of weapons many times more powerful than those discharged at GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . During the DATE Island tests , service personnel were ordered to line up in the open and to face away from the explosions with their eyes closed and covered until TIME after the blast .", "The applicants alleged that the purpose of this procedure was deliberately to expose servicemen to radiation for experimental purposes . The Government denied this and stated that it was believed at the time of the tests , and was the case , that personnel were sufficiently far from the centre of the detonations to avoid being exposed to radiation at any harmful level and that the purpose of the line - up procedure was to ensure that they avoided eye damage and other physical injury caused by material blown about by the blast .", "CARDINAL . No record exists of the degree of exposure to radiation , if any , of servicemen such as the applicants , since film badges ( which turn black if exposed to radiation ) were issued only to the CARDINAL predominantly non - service personnel on DATE Island who were working in identified , controlled and active areas . According to the applicants ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , this decision was taken to avoid future liability for radiation - caused harm . According to the Government , however , experience of earlier nuclear test explosions in GPE , GPE , where film badges had been issued to all personnel , had shown that personnel with duties such as the applicants\u2019 were not exposed to measurable levels of radiation .", "CARDINAL . Documents containing the original contemporaneous recordings of environmental radiation levels in the vicinity of DATE Island following the tests were stored at ORG ( \u201c AWRE \u201d ) at GPE , GPE . Although these documents were not available for inspection by members of the public , the Government claimed that since the information contained in them would not have given rise to security concerns , they could have been produced if required for the purposes of proceedings before ORG ( \u201c PAT \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

The Government annexed to their memorial to the ORG in the present case a number of documents , not hitherto in the public domain , including a report by the AWRE of the measurements made of radioactive fall - out on various LOC , including DATE Island , during ORG DATE ( Grapple Y ) and of the concurrent programme of fish sampling ; a report by Major PERSON describing measurements of fallout on various LOC DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( ORG ) ; a report of residual radiation measurements following the Grapple Y explosion on LOC ; a summary statement of environment radiation measurements following the Grapple Y explosion , by AWRE , dated DATE ; and interim reports on radiological measurements following the Grapple Y and ORG detonations .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE he was admitted to ORG in GPE suffering from a duodenal ulcer , which led to a recommendation that he be discharged from the army as unfit for further military service . This was effected on DATE and he was awarded a PERCENT pension in relation to the ulcer since it was considered to be attributable to military service .", "CARDINAL . In his statement on discharge , in response to the question \u201c If you are suffering from any diseases , wound , or injuries , state what they are , and also when and where they first started \u2026 \u201d , he referred to out - patient treatment which he had received in GPE in DATE for a torn cartilage and on DATE Island in DATE for a broken ankle ; this latter treatment had not been recorded elsewhere in the service medical records contained in the Statement of Case .", "In response to the question \u201c Give details \u2026 of any incidents during your service which you think caused or made worse your disability \u201d , he referred to his service in DATE as a plant operator in GPE , GPE , and the fact that \u201c the food consisted of compound rations CARDINAL meals per day \u201d .

Following a series of articles in the press in DATE about the potential effects of the LOC explosions on those exposed to them , Mr PERSON came to attribute his health problems to his service on the island and became chairman of ORG ( \u201c GPE ) , an organisation which campaigned for compensation for the servicemen present during the tests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he made a claim for an increase in his pension , complaining of depression , sterility and severe arthritis . In his application he described the line - up procedure followed during the tests and the rash he had allegedly developed subsequently ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , and continued :", "\u201c I consider that my problems are directly linked with radiation exposure . Since leaving the service I have experienced bouts of moodiness and at time [ sic ] unexplained attacks of very quick tempered actions . Then later regret them .

The ORG responded to the ORG \u2019s enquiries by stating that the areas on DATE Island in which the applicant had served were not subject to fall - out , and therefore :", "\u201c His radiation exposure from the GPE nuclear tests was PERSON and the radiation effective dose equivalent which it represents was PERSON .

The psychiatrist who saw PERSON did not consider that he was suffering from any psychiatric condition . The consultant rheumatologist concluded that the pain and stiffness in his hands , arms , shoulders and neck of which the applicant complained related to normal wear and tear and could \u201c find nothing to connect it with radiation exposure \u201d . The dermatologist reported that the appearance of the applicant \u2019s skin was consistent with the long - term effects of untreated constitutional acne vulgaris , concluding however that since he had no competence to give an opinion as to whether this condition might have been linked to exposure to radiation , the opinion of an expert familiar with the effects of ionising radiation should be sought . The ORG declined to follow this advice since they were satisfied by the ORG \u2019s statement that PERSON had not been exposed to radiation . The consultant urologist found that PERSON was not suffering from any kidney disease . In relation to his infertility he stated :", "\u201c \u2026 it is impossible to be certain of its cause as there is no indication of the patient having had a normal seminal analysis prior to his alleged exposure to ionising radiation in DATE . His seminal analysis was performed in DATE at which time he was DATE and to which age many men are beginning to show a reduction in sperm count . The incidence of oligospermia in the normal male population at this age is probably not PERCENT .", "In all , it is impossible to incriminate exposure to ionising radiation as a primary cause of the patient \u2019s subfertility problem \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . Also included in the Statement of Case to the ORG was the opinion of a ORG medical officer , who explained that , in the light of the medical evidence and the ORG \u2019s statement that PERSON had not been exposed to ionising radiation , it was not considered that the disablement from acne vulgaris , generalised osteoarthritis or reduced fertility with associated nervous symptoms were attributable to or had been aggravated by service in the armed forces . In view of the consultant urologist \u2019s report , the applicant was found not to be suffering from right renal colic .", "CARDINAL .

I think that the respiratory symptoms of cough and occasionally blood - stained sputum were associated with intercurrent respiratory infection . CARDINAL possible alternative diagnosis is considered below \u2026", "I think it is true to say that there is no reference in the international literature to any case of sarcoidosis specifically related to the effects of atomic explosion .", "The only possible aetiological factor which could be incriminated is exposure to beryllium copper alloy . I do not know whether this alloy was in use in DATE . The features of chronic berylliosis \u2026 are very similar to those which occur in chronic sarcoidosis \u2026", "In summary , it is , in my opinion , virtually certain that the correct diagnosis in this case is sarcoidosis and that the disease had no relationship to proximity to an atomic explosion in DATE . \u201d", "The Government subsequently confirmed , in response to a parliamentary question , that beryllium is commonly used in nuclear test devices , although for security reasons it was not possible to disclose the materials used in specific devices .", "CARDINAL .
