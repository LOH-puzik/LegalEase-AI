Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was arrested on suspicion of having attempted to steal a car and on DATE was remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . The trial took place on DATE , DATE and DATE before ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) . ORG heard as witnesses the owner of the car and his neighbour as well as the police expert , who confirmed that the door lock had been tampered with in an attempt to open it . The court also considered as evidence a bag containing instruments , which could have been used to open the car lock . The bag had been found in the close vicinity of the applicant at the time of his arrest . The applicant was present during the trial . According to the Government the applicant had chosen not to be represented by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of attempted theft and sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . It found the evidence of the witnesses to be exhaustive and logical and their statements consistent .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal against this judgment with ORG ( S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki ) . He maintained in particular that the first - instance court had disregarded his explanations and had only attached weight to the prosecution evidence . He also requested that his accomplice and the CARDINAL policemen who had arrested him be heard as witnesses and that he be brought from prison to the hearing before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request to be brought before it , considering that his presence was unnecessary , since he had already given a detailed account of the events at his trial before ORG . Moreover , in his written statement of appeal he had set out at length his complaints in respect of the contested conviction . Furthermore , in its view he had sufficient time to submit further observations in writing , if he wished to do so .", "CARDINAL .

ORG found that the evidence given by the applicant was inconsistent and motivated by his wish to avoid conviction . Moreover , the applicant had failed to request ORG to hear further evidence . It noted that the applicant had only submitted a request to have the policemen who had arrested him heard when lodging his appeal . However , ORG considered it unnecessary to hear the witnesses as the other evidence presented to ORG was sufficient to prove the applicant \u2019s guilt .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW in force at the material time read as follows :", "\u201c An accused , who does not have a lawyer of his own choice , may request the assistance of an officially appointed lawyer if he proves that he is not able to incur the costs of defence without detriment to himself and his family . \u201d", "\u201c A court of appeal shall conduct a hearing when examining a case \u2026 \u201d", "\u201c A hearing shall be held irrespective of whether the parties are present .

The Code of Criminal Procedure provided at the material time for CARDINAL - instance proceedings . Regional courts considered , inter alia , appeals against judgments of district courts .
