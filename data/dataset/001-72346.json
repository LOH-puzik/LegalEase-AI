The applicant party , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , is a parliamentary political party in GPE which was in opposition at the time of the events .", "CARDINAL . Towards DATE , the NORP government made public its intention to make the study of the NORP language compulsory in schools for children aged seven and over .", "CARDINAL . This initiative prompted vehement criticism from the opposition and generated a heated public debate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parliamentary group of the ORG informed ORG of its intention to hold a meeting with its supporters on DATE , in FAC , in front of the government buildings . It stated that the meeting would relate to the introduction of the compulsory study of NORP in schools . It relied on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) which , according to the ORG , did not require members of parliament to obtain prior authorisation for meetings with their supporters .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG classified the gathering to be held on DATE as a \u201c demonstration \u201d within the meaning of sections CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and authorised the parliamentary group of the ORG to hold it in FAC . It did not give any reasons for the change of location .", "CARDINAL . Later , on DATE , ORG addressed a letter to ORG , informing it that there was a discrepancy between the provisions of the Status of Members of Parliament Act and those of LAW and that it did not know which to apply . It stated , inter alia , that a number of reputable lawyers supported the idea that the ORG members of parliament had the right to hold meetings with their supporters in ORG without obtaining prior authorisation , in accordance with the provisions of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Status of Members of Parliament Act . It cited in that respect the opinion of an ombudsman who considered that , since section CARDINAL of the Status of Members of LAW proclaimed the right of MPs to raise demands on the spot for action to remedy a breach of the law , the ORG members of parliament were entitled to raise their demands for the cessation of the alleged breaches concerning the introduction of compulsory NORP lessons in front of the government building , as it also housed ORG . Accordingly , ORG requested ORG to ask ORG for an official interpretation of the legislation in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision which stated , inter alia :", "\u201c Having regard to the fact that the provisions of the domestic legislation are contradictory in respect of the demonstrations organised by the ORG and that the opinions of legal experts are contradictory , and bearing in mind the considerable social impact of a possible decision regarding the matter and the consequences it might entail , ORG has formally requested ORG to ask ORG for an official and urgent interpretation of the relevant legislation . ... ORG decision of DATE is hereby suspended until ORG has given its official interpretation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the parliamentary group of the ORG held a gathering in FAC , in front of government headquarters . It also held gatherings on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . The ORG informed ORG in advance of each gathering ; however , it did not seek authorisation in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an official warning to the ORG in accordance with LAW ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It stated , inter alia , that the ORG had breached the provisions of LAW by organising demonstrations in FAC on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , notwithstanding the authorisation issued by ORG , which only gave permission for a demonstration on DATE in FAC . It called for an immediate halt to the gatherings , which it considered to be illegal and unconstitutional and which it claimed were not meetings with voters within the meaning of the Status of Members of LAW , but demonstrations falling under LAW . It asked the ORG for a written explanation within DATE and warned that , if it failed to comply with the warning , the ORG would impose a temporary ban ( suspendarea activit\u0103\u0163ii ) on the party 's activities in accordance with LAW ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the ORG wrote a letter to ORG in which he stated that the gatherings had not been organised by the ORG but by members of its parliamentary group , and that it was therefore the members concerned who were liable , and not the party . He also relied on LAW , arguing that it was a very specific LAW , applicable to meetings between members of parliament and voters , while LAW was general in nature . He finally submitted that the threatened ban on the party 's activities would amount to a political measure taken by ORG in order to repress the opposition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision imposing a DATE ban on the ORG 's activities , in accordance with LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . The measure was imposed on the basis of the organisation by the ORG of unauthorised demonstrations on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry of Justice dismissed the ORG leader 's argument that the party could not be held liable . It stated , inter alia , that the gatherings organised by the ORG on the above dates had in fact been demonstrations and marches and therefore fell within the scope of LAW rather than the Status of Members of LAW as the ORG had claimed .", "CARDINAL . According to the decision , the ORG had breached the provisions of sections CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW by not obtaining prior authorisation from ORG to stage demonstrations and by blocking the public highway .", "CARDINAL . The participation of minors in the ORG demonstrations had been in breach of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and section CARDINAL(g ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG 's actions also disclosed a violation of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Parties and other ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the Status of Members of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The use of such slogans as \u201c I 'd rather be dead than a NORP \u201d ( PERSON dec\u00e2t NORP ) could be interpreted as a call to public violence and an act undermining the legal and constitutional order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG challenged the decision of ORG arguing , inter alia , that the gatherings had been meetings with voters within the meaning of the Status of Members of Parliament Act , and not assemblies falling within the scope of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision lifting the temporary ban imposed on the ORG 's activities . It stressed that the ORG had breached all the laws mentioned in the decision of DATE and that the temporary ban had been necessary and justified . However , following an inquiry by the Secretary General of ORG under LAW , and having regard to the forthcoming local elections , the ORG was authorised to resume its activities . The decision of DATE did not , however , set aside the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found in favour of ORG and ruled that the decision of DATE had been lawful . It dismissed the ORG 's argument that the party could not be held liable for the actions of its members , namely its parliamentary group . It found that the gatherings organised by the ORG had in fact been demonstrations , meetings and marches which fell under the provisions of LAW , and not meetings with voters . Even assuming that the gatherings had been intended as meetings with voters , they had gradually taken on the nature of demonstrations and , accordingly , the ORG needed authorisation in order to organise them . It also stated that , as a result of the demonstrations , the public transport company had suffered losses of CARDINAL NORP lei ( MDL ) ( the equivalent of QUANTITY ( ORG ) at the time ) . The participation of minors in the demonstrations had been in breach of LAW , ORG and LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG , relying , inter alia , on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of ORG delivered its judgment , in which it dismissed the appeal lodged by the ORG . It endorsed the arguments of ORG and found , inter alia , that since the demonstrations organised by the ORG had been illegal , the sanction imposed on it had not been disproportionate . It also stated that in any event the decision of ORG had not had any negative effects on the ORG since it had not been enforced , the ORG 's accounts had not been frozen and the party could continue its activities unhindered .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not reply to ORG request of DATE for interpretation of the law and did not address any request to ORG . However , on DATE the government lodged an application with ORG asking it , inter alia , to declare the demonstrations organised by the ORG illegal and to order their cessation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled in favour of the government and declared the gatherings illegal . It stated , inter alia :", "\u201c Even if one could accept that the ORG had the initial intention of holding meetings with its supporters , those meetings later took on the character of demonstrations , marches , processions and picketing , which fall under the provisions of LAW . In these circumstances , the leaders of the ORG were required to comply with the provisions of LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and the judgment of DATE became final .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the present proceedings before ORG , the Government submitted a video with images of gatherings held by the ORG deputies on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE . The gatherings were held in FAC , in a pedestrian area , in front of the government buildings . The participants appeared to number CARDINAL and included people of different ages varying from schoolchildren to pensioners . According to the time displayed on the images , the gatherings commenced at TIME and lasted for TIME . Different personalities made speeches critical of the ruling ORG , the government and its policy . It appears from the video that traffic was not disrupted as a result of the gatherings held on those dates , and no signs of violence can be seen . \u201c The ORG 's Anthem \u201d ( PERSON DATE a song that originated in the DATE GPE student demonstrations ) was played frequently . The chorus of the song had the following wording :", "\u201c I 'd rather be a slacker than a traitor ( PERSON haimana , dec\u00e2t tr\u0103d\u0103tor )", "I 'd rather be a hooligan than a dictator ( PERSON huligan , dec\u00e2t dictator )", "I 'd rather be a layabout than an activist ( PERSON , dec\u00e2t activist )", "I 'd rather be dead than a NORP ( PERSON , dec\u00e2t NORP ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
