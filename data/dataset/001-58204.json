Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , a NORP national who was born in DATE , lives in GPE . At the material time , he was a deputy police sergeant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an airport and border police squad based in GPE stopped a vehicle on the motorway between GPE and GPE . There were CARDINAL people inside , of whom CARDINAL did not have valid papers for entry into NORP territory .", "CARDINAL . The driver , PERSON Fall , admitted that he had assisted these CARDINAL to cross the border illegally .", "CARDINAL . He implicated the applicant , who was at that time serving at the GPE frontier post , alleging that he had allowed him to enter GPE in exchange for a payment of MONEY ( ORG ) and the promise of an imitation ORG watch .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with accepting a bribe and remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG acquitted Mr Gu\u00e9rin , rescinded the order for his detention and ordered his immediate release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution appealed .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG - en - ORG , giving judgment in the applicant \u2019s absence , set aside the judgment at first instance and sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested a retrial .", "CARDINAL . The case was heard on DATE at a public hearing attended by Mr Gu\u00e9rin .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the Aix - en - ORG of Appeal found the applicant guilty of accepting a bribe , sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , DATE of which were suspended , and issued a warrant for his arrest . Although the applicant had been duly informed of the date of delivery of the judgment , he was not present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Gu\u00e9rin was admitted to a psychiatric institution , where he stayed until DATE , when the police enforced the warrant for his arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting through a lawyer with the right of audience in the Aix - en - Provence Court of Appeal , the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law within the time - limit of CARDINAL clear days laid down by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "In his statement of the grounds of appeal the applicant \u2019s lawyer put forward CARDINAL arguments , CARDINAL procedural and CARDINAL substantive , concerning the elements of the offence . He also explained that \u201c as soon as he knew [ ORG decision ] , the appellant tried to commit suicide \u201d .", "On the first point , he referred to the report adopted by ORG on DATE in the case of GPE v. GPE and pointed out that the Commission had referred to the ORG the question whether the relevant case - law of ORG was contrary to LAW .", "On the second point , the lawyer stated that as the applicant lived in GPE he had not attended the hearing at which the judgment convicting him was delivered on account of the distance he would have had to travel and because he was very perturbed by the proceedings against him .", "It would also have been materially impossible for him to comply with the warrant for his arrest in DATE between the reading of the judgment and the lodging of the notice of intention to appeal . Moreover , on learning that he had just been convicted , and immediately after instructing his lawyer to lodge an appeal on points of law , he had tried to commit suicide , and for that reason had been treated in a psychiatric institution from DATE to DATE . Having stayed in that institution throughout the period allowed for an appeal on points of law , it had been absolutely impossible for him to comply with the warrant voluntarily before lodging the appeal . Lastly , the arrest warrant had been executed on DATE at the clinic where the applicant remained at the disposal of the courts . The lawyer concluded in the following terms :", "\u201c There is no doubt that in such conditions applying the case - law established in DATE in order to declare the appeal inadmissible would mean unjustly depriving Mr Gu\u00e9rin of the right to determination of his appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible on the following grounds :", "\u201c It is apparent from the notice of intention to appeal that the applicant lodged his appeal through an attorney at a time when he was liable to arrest under a warrant issued at the hearing on DATE , which was not executed until DATE . It follows from the general principles of criminal procedure that a convicted person who has not complied with a court order is not entitled to act through a representative in order to lodge an appeal on points of law . It could not be otherwise unless he supplied evidence of circumstances making it absolutely impossible for him to surrender to custody at the appropriate time . In the present case the appellant has not supplied evidence of any such circumstances . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In NORP law an appeal on points of law , which is an exceptional remedy , may be lodged by any person who has an interest in doing so and gives notice within the time - limit , against any judicial decision given at last instance .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , which lays down the formalities to be observed in connection with appeals on points of law , provides :", "\u201c Notice of an appeal on points of law must be given to the registrar of the court which has delivered the decision being challenged .", "It must be signed by the registrar and by the appellant himself or by an attorney ( avou\u00e9 ) of the court which has given judgment or by a specially authorised agent . In the last - mentioned case , the authority to act shall be annexed to the document drawn up by the registrar \u2026", "\u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides :", "\u201c The prosecution and all parties shall have DATE after the date on which the impugned decision was given in which to lodge an appeal on points of law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides :", "\u201c During the time allowed for an appeal on points of law and , where such an appeal has been lodged , until ORG delivers judgment , execution of the judgment of ORG shall be stayed , except in respect of orders concerning civil matters , and unless ORG upholds the warrant issued by the trial court pursuant to LAW , first sub - paragraph , or unless it issues a warrant itself under the same conditions and according to the same rules . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The suspensive effect of an appeal on points of law is derived from statute and may therefore likewise be restricted by statute , particularly in the interests of speedier and more effective punishment . That is the case where an arrest warrant has been issued by the trial court ( see , to that effect , PERSON , PERSON , GPE , CARDINALth edition , DATE , \u00a7 MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides :", "\u201c If a person sentenced to a term of imprisonment of DATE has not surrendered to custody and has not obtained from the court which convicted him exemption , on or without payment of a surety , from the obligation to surrender to custody , his right to appeal on points of law shall be forfeit .", "The memorandum of imprisonment or the judgment granting exemption shall be produced before ORG not later than the time when the case is called for hearing .", "For his appeal to be admissible , it is sufficient for the appellant to establish that he has surrendered to custody at a prison , either in the place where ORG sits or in the place where sentence was passed . The governor of that prison shall admit him there on the order of ORG at ORG or of the head of the public prosecutor \u2019s office at the court of trial or appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has ruled on a number of occasions that an appeal lodged by the representative of a convicted person who has not complied with a warrant for his arrest is inadmissible ( PERSON . crim .
