THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP citizen , born in DATE . He is currently detained in ORG ( GPE ) with a view to his extradition to GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON - en - GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested at GPE airport under a warrant for his arrest , dated DATE , on charges of inter alia obtaining property by deception . The arrest warrant had been issued by ORG at the request of ORG .", "On DATE the applicant was extradited to GPE and was remanded in custody in FAC , GPE .", "The criminal charges brought against the applicant concerned events which occurred at DATE resulting in a loss of MONEY to ORG at GPE . The applicant , who was highly experienced in shipping , banking and international trade , was suspected of having purported , with the assistance of others , to be able to supply a large confinement of sugar to a NORP Company . There was no sugar , but the applicant by selecting a vessel about to sail from GPE to GPE with a cargo of sugar and , with reference to that vessel and its cargo , forged the documentation which ORG required to support the letter of credit before it would advance the money . Because the bank \u2019s payment was made before the due date , it was made before the absence of a sugar cargo could become apparent .", "In DATE , a NORP national , PERSON , who according to the prosecution was the applicant 's agent , pleaded guilty to obtaining from ORG a bill of exchange by deception , and to procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception . He received a DATE prison sentence .", "Soon after his arrival in GPE the applicant engaged and personally paid for the services of a large firm of primarily commercial law solicitors . He secured the payment of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL into the solicitors\u2019 client account between CARDINAL DATE and DATE . CARDINAL of this amount went on fees before DATE . A guarantor , PERSON , had also pledged the sum of GBP CARDINAL . PERSON subsequently agreed to increase the amount pledged to ORG and gave security for her guarantee in the form of a mortgage on a residence in GPE , GPE , where she lived together with the applicant . The applicant had provided the money for PERSON to purchase the property from her former husband . The value of the property was estimated to be GBP QUANTITY . It was not subject to a mortgage .", "On DATE the applicant signed an application form for legal aid to cover the costs of his defence . The form submitted by the applicant contained no information as to income or assets . According to the applicant he could not realise any of his assets while in detention . Since the application form was incomplete the applicant \u2019s legal aid request could only be considered by ORG on DATE , DATE on which the trial was due to commence . The applicant \u2019s solicitor helped him to prepare a detailed Statement of Assets and Liabilities for submission to ORG .", "Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant 's ORG ( \u201c FAC ) informed the trial judge , Judge PERSON , at a hearing in chambers in the presence of prosecution counsel , that a successful application for legal aid would necessarily be fraudulent . The applicant \u2019s counsel stated before the court :", "\u201c I do not think in all conscience a legal aid application can be filled in with sufficient openness to satisfy the court . It certainly could not satisfy me and , if it were to be filled in and signed as a result of my enquiries , I would feel so squalidly unhappy as to be positively professionally embarrassed and have to say to the court that I would be disinclined to act on that legal aid basis . \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s junior counsel agreed with this view .", "Counsel for the prosecution observed at the hearing that the applicant needed to be formally asked about his intentions concerning his legal representation , because once his defence counsel had withdrawn , he would be entitled to have alternative counsel . Counsel for the prosecution further observed that it would be helpful if the court record mentioned the applicant \u2019s views about this since he would not like it to be said later that the applicant misunderstood the situation and felt that he was obliged to go on and defend himself and had therefore been put at a grave disadvantage when other possible options were open to him .", "The Statement of Assets and ORG finally submitted to ORG disclosed that the applicant had the following assets :", "- The applicant was the owner of a shoe factory in GPE which , according to him , was no longer profitable .", "- The applicant had opened a bank account in GPE into which he had paid MONEY , the purpose of which was to invest in a shoe factory there . However , following his arrest in GPE , the money was not returned to him . He had instructed his lawyers in GPE to try to recover this money on his behalf .", "- The applicant had an interest in CARDINAL football teams in GPE . He had received an offer for CARDINAL of the teams of CARDINAL . He was reimbursed MONEY ( ITL ) in DATE , after having made a deposit of ITL MONEY for a second football team , and he did not make any money from the third football team .", "- The applicant owned a Mercedes Spider which , according to his estimation , was worth GBP CARDINAL .", "- The applicant \u2019s ORG watch originally worth CARDINAL had been damaged and was therefore worthless . His PERSON watch was worth about GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL . All of this jewellery was in GPE .", "- A house in which the applicant lived in GPE , GPE , and which was worth MONEY was owned by PERSON , the woman with whom he lived and the above - mentioned guarantor . The applicant had personally paid MONEY for the house DATE .", "- A large flat in the most expensive area of Genoa , where the applicant \u2019s ex - wife and daughter lived , was worth MONEY . It was owned by a company . His daughter was the holder of the shares and PERSON was the manager of the company . The applicant was unable to remove the bank charges on this property .", "- The applicant had bought a country property worth MONEY . There was a mortgage on this property of CARDINAL of its value . The property was registered in the name of PERSON parents .", "- In DATE the applicant made an investment in DATE of MONEY in a warehouse in GPE . Because he was detained it had not been possible to arrange for any reimbursements .", "- The applicant \u2019s only income was the money he received from his activity as a consultant and amounted officially to MONEY per year ; unofficially it was CARDINAL as much .", "- The total cost of university fees which he had to pay was MONEY CARDINAL per year . Maintenance to his ex - wife was about GBP DATE .", "- Since his arrest the applicant had no income at all and large sums of arrears had built up . In the period from DATE to DATE , Ms. NORP and his business associates had paid a total of GBP CARDINAL to his NORP solicitor .", "The Government drew attention to the fact that the Statement of Assets and Liabilities made no mention of the sum of GBP CARDINAL which remained in the applicant \u2019s solicitor \u2019s client account . Nor was any reference made to ORG guarantee to provide GBP CARDINAL towards the cost of the applicant \u2019s defence . The Government further stated that the Statement of Assets and Liabilities made mention of the applicant having in DATE ( date incorrectly stated by the Government , DATE ) MONEY in bank accounts outside GPE . The applicant replied that there is no evidence whatsoever of his having any such accounts at the time referred to by the Government .", "The applicant claimed that by DATE what was left of his property was no longer at his disposal .", "In a letter accompanying the submission to ORG , dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitors stated , inter alia :", "\u201c \u2026 We understand that if a defendant is assessed to have CARDINAL CARDINAL worth of capital that a court will order that he pay a contribution to any legal aid ; it would appear on the details that Mr Caresana supplied to us DATE that he has CARDINAL in capital in GPE .", "We are unable to verify any of the valuations given by PERSON but would stress that PERSON does not share the optimistic view of PERSON as to the assets\u2019 worth .", "In the circumstances , it appears to us that if any legal aid certificate were granted by the court , due to the serious and complex nature of the case , it would involve a substantial contribution being ordered . From our own experience of the case , we are of the opinion that whilst PERSON remains in custody at FAC he would not be able to satisfy any such condition .", "It is regrettable that in the circumstances my firm is not prepared to represent Mr ORG without private funding . Counsel can not represent Mr Caresana unless their fees are met . It would appear that he is unlikely to obtain a legal aid certificate and therefore in the circumstances the only way forward would appear to be for PERSON ORG to represent himself .", "\u2026 Mr Caresana knows the case very well . He is an intelligent individual and whilst he has no knowledge of LANGUAGE legal procedure , he has an in - depth knowledge of the facts of the case . Given all assistance by the court , he should be able to conduct his own Defence . \u201d", "At the hearing on the legal aid application before Judge PERSON in chambers on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitor described the difficulties which the applicant was experiencing in procuring funding for his defence either through the sale of his own assets or other means . The solicitor informed Judge PERSON that an unsuccessful attempt had been made to sell PERSON \u2019s flat in GPE , GPE . As to the possible sale of CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s football clubs , the solicitor observed that the applicant was concerned as to whether the offer he received of GBP CARDINAL was genuine and that in any event the club was saddled with debts in excess of that sum . Judge PERSON referred the applicant \u2019s solicitor to LAW of ORG DATE according to which representation shall not be granted to a person for any purpose unless it appears that his financial resources are such that he requires assistance in meeting the costs of the defence . Judge PERSON asked the solicitor :", "\u201c ... would you contend that [ the applicant \u2019s ] financial resources are such that he requires assistance in meeting the costs of his defence ; or would you recognise that really is straining to the limit the words of the regulation ? \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s solicitor replied :", "\u201c I would say we would be straining the regulation . I have no doubt about that ... \u201d", "In deciding to reject the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid , Judge PERSON pointed out that he was very reluctant to embark upon a trial involving an unrepresented defendant and was \u201c positively straining to find a way to grant [ the applicant ] legal aid \u201d . However , in his opinion the applicant \u2019s Statement of Assets and Liabilities showed that he had substantial assets upon which he could call if necessary . In the judge \u2019s opinion , the applicant \u2019s solicitor was unable to provide any satisfactory answers about the applicant \u2019s assets and even the solicitor seemed to acknowledge that it was unlikely that legal aid would be granted .", "Immediately before the trial opened Judge PERSON , in the absence of the jury , informed the applicant that if he needed his assistance in any way he should ask for it and that if he wanted to raise any points in the absence of the jury this facility could be granted to him .", "DATE and DATE the applicant stood trial at ORG . The applicant represented himself . During the trial CARDINAL documents were submitted to the court and CARDINAL witnesses heard . The transcript of the summing up , which was spread over DATE , runs to CARDINAL pages .", "On DATE the jury found the applicant guilty of all the charges , namely theft , obtaining property by deception , procuring execution of a valuable security by deception and using a false instrument with intent . The judge sentenced him to a total of DATE imprisonment .", "The applicant appealed against his conviction and sentence to ORG .", "In a letter dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s new solicitors , ORG , asked for legal aid in connection with the appeal .", "By letter dated DATE a case lawyer in ORG forwarded a Statement of Means for completion by the applicant .", "On DATE ORG was returned , signed and filled in by the applicant together with a handwritten memorandum which he had dictated to his solicitor . The applicant declared in ORG that he had no savings or articles of value . In the accompanying memorandum it was stated that PERSON had no assets apart from her home and that the applicant \u2019s Mercedes car could not be sold because the ownership documents were held by the NORP authorities .", "In taking its decision on legal aid , ORG relied only on the documentation submitted by ORG The latter confirmed that they did not have sight of the applicant \u2019s earlier Statement of Assets and ORG ; nor did they provide ORG with the transcript of the hearing in ORG on DATE before Judge PERSON . The Government are unable to confirm whether the transcript and the applicant \u2019s Statement of Assets and ORG came into the possession of ORG before or after the decision to grant the applicant legal aid . The applicant maintains that ORG was fully aware that that he had been refused legal aid for the purposes of his trial . He observes that the officials in ORG had full access to his case file including his Statement of Assets and Liabilities .", "On DATE , and on the sole basis of the applicant \u2019s new Statement of Means and the accompanying handwritten declaration , ORG granted the applicant legal aid for a conference with counsel and for the perfection of his grounds of appeal . Legal aid was later granted for the preparation and presentation of an application for leave to appeal and for the full hearing of the appeal once leave had been granted .", "The applicant produced extensive grounds of appeal ( CARDINAL hand - written pages ) . With the assistance of his defence counsel the applicant 's grounds of appeal were amended and reduced to CARDINAL grounds of appeal . The applicant alleged in particular that he was put at an unfair disadvantage in conducting his defence because his mother tongue was NORP . He also complained that he had no legal representation at his trial and that the trial judge refused to adjourn the trial to enable the key defence witness NORP to give evidence . In the applicant \u2019s submission , this witness , a NORP lawyer who speaks NORP , would have been able to prove that CARDINAL witnesses had not told the truth at his trial .", "The hearing before ORG took place on CARDINAL and DATE . The applicant was represented by counsel . On DATE ORG allowed his appeal against his conviction on the charge of theft but upheld the other convictions and the sentences imposed .", "ORG found that there was no substance whatsoever in the applicant 's allegation that he was put at an unfair disadvantage because the trial was conducted in LANGUAGE . In particular , the cross - examination of a witness showed the applicant to be not only astute but also at ease in the language which he was using to formulate the questions . Furthermore , he had the services of an interpreter whom he chose not to use . The applicant \u2019s arguments had been set out in detail and developed at considerable length in oral submissions before ORG . The jury had been told more than once to make every allowance for the applicant \u2019s lack of legal representation as well as for the fact that LANGUAGE was not his native language .", "As to the absence of legal representation and the refusal of legal aid , ORG observed , inter alia :", "\u201c \u2026 prosecution counsel and the trial judge took elaborate steps to assist the [ applicant ] to present his case . He was given advanced warning of when witnesses were to be called and procedural matters were carefully explained to him , such as the effect of formal admissions of fact , the effect of evidence being read , the need to put his case in cross - examination , and so forth . DATE the court sat at TIME to deal with any problem which the applicant might be experiencing before the trial continued . In addition the applicant was allowed time as and when he required it . \u2026", "Originally the [ applicant ] had legal representation for which he paid . As the trial was about to start it became clear to the representatives that no more payment would be forthcoming . It is quite clear from the transcripts we have seen that if the [ applicant \u2019s ] legal representatives had been satisfied that the [ applicant ] could not pay they would have supported an application for ORG , but they were not so satisfied and that is what they told the judge . The [ applicant ] had in fact signed an application form for ORG on DATE , but it contained no information as to income or assets , and boldly asserted that the Appellant could not realise any assets because he was in custody in GPE . On DATE his solicitor assisted him to prepare a statement of assets and liabilities , and that document we have seen . Having seen it we can understand why the [ applicant \u2019s ] lawyers felt unable to support an application for ORG . In those circumstances it seems to us that the trial judge had really no alternative but to proceed as he did . In general , ORG can not be granted to anybody unless it appears to the body entitled to grant it that the financial resources of the applicant are such to make him eligible for it ( see section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ) . As was pointed out during the course of argument , were it otherwise a defendant of ample means facing serious charges could abuse the system with impunity . He could simply decline to pay for representation and fail to provide adequate information as to his resources confident in the knowledge that in order to facilitate the trial process ORG would be granted to him \u2026 . \u201d", "As regards the witness NORP whom the applicant wanted to call , ORG pointed out that DATE proposed , namely DATE , was not the only date on which this witness could have given evidence . Subsequent enquiries revealed that in reality NORP was simply not prepared to attend . The suggestion that the court was not prepared to wait for him was unfounded . According to ORG , the evidence called on behalf of the applicant did not finish until DATE , and the court in fact adjourned for DATE in order to enable the applicant \u2019s final defence witness to attend .", "On DATE the applicant was transferred from FAC to GPE in accordance with ORG . He served his sentence first in GPE , then in GPE . He was released from prison on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE ( GPE ) and remanded in custody in PERSON with a view to his extradition to GPE following his final conviction and sentence in bankruptcy proceedings in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
