The applicant was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , when the applicant was DATE , she discovered that her stepfather had hidden a video camera in the laundry basket in the bathroom . The camera was directed at the spot where the applicant had undressed before taking a shower .", "CARDINAL . The incident was reported in DATE and on DATE the public prosecution indicted the stepfather for sexual molestation ( sexuellt ofredande ) under LAW , section CARDINAL of the Penal Code due to the said event .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , represented by an officially appointed counsel ( m\u00e5ls\u00e4gandebitr\u00e4de ) , the applicant submitted a claim for damages of MONEY ( SEK ) ( approximately EUR CARDINAL CARDINAL ) to be joined to the criminal proceedings . The basis of the claim was that the stepfather had , through the act for which he was being prosecuted , severely violated the applicant \u2019s personal integrity and should therefore pay compensation for the violation and for her pain and suffering .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG ( Falu Tingsr\u00e4tt ) , the applicant , her stepfather , her mother and a cousin were heard . The applicant explained that on the relevant day , just before she was about to take a shower , her stepfather had something to do in the bathroom . When she discovered the camera , it was in recording mode , making a buzzing sound and flashing . She did not touch any of the buttons . Crying , she took the video camera , wrapped in a towel , to her mother . The stepfather took the camera from the mother . Subsequently , the applicant saw her mother and stepfather burn a film , but she was not sure whether it was a recording of her .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s mother confirmed the applicant \u2019s statement and added that she did not know whether anything had been recorded since the film had been burned without her seeing it . She had not reported the incident to the police until DATE , when she had heard that the applicant \u2019s cousin had also experienced incidents with the accused .", "CARDINAL . The stepfather explained that he had lived with the applicant \u2019s mother from DATE to the autumn of DATE . They had separated due to , inter alia , the incident in question . He had wanted to try to film with a hidden camera , but it was an impulsive act . He was not sure whether the camera had been in recording mode or whether any film had been recorded . The applicant \u2019s mother had burned the film without any of them seeing it .", "CARDINAL . NORP By judgment of DATE ORG convicted the stepfather . It found it established that he had had a sexual intent in hiding the camera in the laundry basket and directing it at the part of the bathroom where it was usual to undress . It added that the buzzing sound from the camera perceived by the applicant strongly suggests that the camera was switched on and actually did record . Otherwise , there would be no point in hiding the camera among the clothes in the laundry basket . The hole in the laundry basket indicated that the approach was quite refined . Regardless of the fact that , afterwards , no one verified the contents of the film , it can under the present circumstances be considered established that the stepfather actually filmed the applicant when she appeared nude .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment , in which the stepfather was also convicted of CARDINAL additional acts of sexual molestation against the applicant and her cousin , a suspended sentence combined with compulsory community service for TIME was imposed on him . Moreover , he was ordered to pay the applicant damages in the amount of SEK CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , by judgment of DATE , ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) acquitted the stepfather of the incident in question .", "CARDINAL . The court found it established that the stepfather had put a camera in the bathroom and that he had started the recording system before the applicant was about to take a shower . Whether a recording had actually been made , however , was unclear . It was apparent , the court continued , that the stepfather \u2019s motive was to film covertly the applicant for a sexual purpose . Given this motive , it was also regarded as certain that the stepfather did not intend the applicant to find out about the filming . Nor was he , according to the court , indifferent to the risk that she would find out about it . The court thereafter assessed whether the act legally constituted sexual molestation within the meaning of LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW . It referred to a ORG judgment ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) in which ORG had held , among other things , that the filming of sexual abuse was not a crime in itself as in NORP law there was no general prohibition against filming an individual without his or her consent . Following that line of reasoning , and although finding that the act in question constituted a violation of personal integrity , notably in the light of the applicant \u2019s age and relationship to her stepfather , ORG found that the stepfather could not be held criminally responsible for the isolated act of filming the applicant without her knowledge . Even if she had indeed obtained knowledge of the filming , the court reiterated , this knowledge was not covered by the stepfather \u2019s intent .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on by pointing out that the act might , at least theoretically , have constituted an attempted child pornography crime ( f\u00f6rs\u00f6k till barnpornografibrott ) considering the applicant \u2019s age . However , since no charge of that kind had been brought against the stepfather , ORG could not consider whether he could be held responsible for such a crime . In conclusion , despite finding the stepfather \u2019s behaviour extremely reprehensible , he was acquitted and the applicant \u2019s claim for damages dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG domstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW ( ORG , TIME ) include the following :", "\u201c A person who by violence or threat which involves , or appears to the threatened person to involve an imminent danger , forces another person to have sexual intercourse or to engage in a comparable sexual act , that having regard to the nature of the violation and the circumstances in general , is comparable to forced sexual intercourse , shall be sentenced for rape to imprisonment for CARDINAL and at DATE .

( ORG ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) concerning a person who had secretly filmed sexual intercourse between himself and his girlfriend and who had subsequently shown the film to several persons , ORG noted that it was not prohibited under NORP law to film another person without his or her consent or to show the film to others . This was so , the court continued , even in situations where the deed in question deeply violated the personal integrity of the person concerned . Apart from certain exceptional situations , the only general sanctions available were the criminal provisions on defamation in conjunction with LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ( now LAW , section CARDINAL of the named act ) . The court found that the accused person had committed defamation by showing the film to others .", "CARDINAL . A further judgment dated DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) concerned a man who had filmed and photographed a sleeping woman while assaulting her and committing sexual offences against her . ORG found his acts to constitute , inter alia , sexual molestation . ORG and ORG held that the filming and photographing did not constitute criminal offences under NORP law and that these acts were thus to be disregarded when assessing the man \u2019s conduct under criminal law .", "CARDINAL . Yet another judgment dated DATE ( NJA DATE p. CARDINAL ) concerned , inter alia , a person who had covertly filmed his ex - girlfriend with another man in an intimate situation and who had subsequently emailed the film , together with certain descriptive messages , to others . ORG found the filming to constitute molestation and the sending of some of the e - mails to amount to defamation . It also awarded the exgirlfriend damages for , inter alia , violation of personal integrity . ORG granted leave to appeal concerning only the former alleged offence , namely the sexual molestation , and the issue of damages . The court reiterated that NORP law contained no general prohibition against covert filming . The court also noted that in cases where the covert filming did not constitute a crime , no damages could be awarded . Although the need for a strengthened legal scheme in this regard had been acknowledged in NORP legislative work already in DATE , the ORG further noted , it had so far not led to any concrete results . According to the court , it was highly questionable whether the fact that acts of filming of an individual in situations where such filming deeply violated the personal integrity of the person concerned were left wholly unsanctioned under NORP law , was compatible with the requirements of LAW . Given this finding , the court continued , it was legitimate to examine whether sanctions could be provided by interpreting otherwise non - applicable domestic provisions in a treaty - conform manner . In this regard , the court referred to domestic case - law concerning compensation for violations of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . However , the court noted , another requirement under the LAW was that no one should be punished for an act which , at the time when it was committed , was not clearly criminalised by law . After having found that the filming in the present case did not fall under any applicable criminal provision , it was left unsanctioned and no damages were awarded .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG issued a report on illicit photographing ( Ds CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) in which it proposed to criminalise such photographing - the term being used as meaning both photographing and filming - in certain situations . The aim of the proposal was in particular to protect individuals from interference in their private sphere by other individuals . It was proposed that the new criminal provision should cover anyone who , in a manner violating another individual \u2019s personal integrity , photographed or by other technical means recorded a picture of the individual in a home , bathroom , changing closet or a similar space . Moreover , the provision was proposed also to cover photographing or recording in any other space than the ones mentioned , if the act was committed in a pushy , covert or intrusive manner or if it constituted a serious violation of another individual \u2019s personal integrity in his or her capacity as a private person . It was proposed that sentences under the provision could range from penalties to imprisonment of DATE . According to the report , no need to criminalise attempted photographing had emerged and it was therefore proposed that such acts , an example being the placing of technical equipment with the aim to film someone , were not to be covered by the new provision .", "CARDINAL . In outlining the reasons for the proposal it was stated , inter alia , that acts of covert or unauthorized filming of individuals by other individuals had constituted a general problem for a long time and that the problem was growing . The technical development had resulted in that individuals could be photographed at in principal any place , at any time and in any circumstances . It was also acknowledged that such acts may violate an individual \u2019s personal integrity regardless of whether he or she was made aware of the filming while it was ongoing or found out about it at a later stage . The report also referred to domestic case - law and noted that although the showing of a photograph or film to other people had been found to constitute a criminal act in some cases , the mere filming had been left unsanctioned . The report furthermore referred to LAW and to the ORG \u2019s positive obligations under the article . In all , the report concluded , it was held unsatisfactory that acts such as the ones at issue were not prohibited by law .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , which concerned the photographing and filming of certain young individuals aged over CARDINAL but under CARDINAL , ORG held that the pubertal development of the individuals was clearly complete and that it was impossible , from the pictures alone , to determine whether they had attained the age of DATE or not . Their age could moreover not be read from any text accompanying the pictures or any other attending circumstances . In such a situation , and regardless of whether the person responsible for the pictures was aware of the ORG age or not , the act could not be held to constitute a child pornography crime .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) concerning a claim for damages brought by an individual against ORG , inter alia , on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW on account of the excessive length of criminal proceedings , ORG held that the plaintiff \u2019s right under LAW had been violated . Based on this finding , and with reference , inter alia , to ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention and the ORG \u2019s case - law under these provisions , in particular the case of GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXI ) , ORG concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation under NORP law for both pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , concerning length of detention , ORG held that the principle concerning a right to damages established in the above - mentioned case of DATE also applied with regard to the rights contained in LAW . ORG stated that the plaintiff \u2019s right to damages on account of a violation of the LAW should be assessed in the first place under domestic law which , to the extent necessary , should be interpreted in accordance with the Convention . If GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW could not be met by such an interpretation , the domestic courts should award compensation without the support of specific legal provisions .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to respect for their private life under LAW had been violated as a police decision on a medical examination of some of them had not been \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d . Having found that compensation for the violation could not be awarded directly on the basis of LAW , ORG held that there was no reason to limit the scope of application of the principle established in the above - mentioned CARDINAL cases to violations of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and concluded that the plaintiffs should be awarded non - pecuniary damages for the violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . A further ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) concerned a claim for damages brought by an individual against a private insurance company . The claim concerned an alleged violation of LAW related to secret surveillance undertaken in respect of the plaintiff . ORG noted that the LAW did not impose duties on individuals . Even if the ORG may have positive obligations under the ORG , the court continued , in view of the ruleof - law - value held by the principle of predictability , an individual could not be obliged to compensate another individual directly on the basis of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . Yet another ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) concerned a claim for damages against the NORP State on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW relating to the suicide of the plaintiff \u2019s father while in detention . ORG concluded that the case revealed no violation of LAW . However , in its reasoning leading to this conclusion , ORG noted , inter alia , that according to the ORG \u2019s case - law there was a right to an effective remedy under LAW connected to the ORG \u2019s duty under the ORG to take measures to protect the lives of individuals in custody or who were otherwise deprived of their liberty , which should , in principle , include a possibility of obtaining compensation for damage .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment in DATE ( NJA DATE n DATE ) , which concerned length of tax proceedings , ORG referred to the abovementioned caselaw and held it to be a general principle that in so far as the ORG had the obligation to compensate someone due to a Convention violation and such compensation could not be awarded on the basis of national law , the obligation was to be fulfilled by awarding compensation without a particular reference to domestic law . The ruling of ORG concerned only the amount of compensation awarded .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( NJA DATE p. CARDINAL ) , lastly , which concerned , inter alia , length of proceedings before ORG and ORG in a civil case against the ORG , ORG found violations of Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the ORG and awarded the plaintiff compensation .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the Chancellor of ORG has delivered decisions concerning compensation to individuals for violations of the Convention . In a decision of DATE , the Chancellor of ORG awarded an individual damages for violations found under , inter alia , ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL . The case concerned , inter alia , storage of certain personal information concerning the applicants in the data bases of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government decided to set up a working group on tort liability and the Convention to study the current legal situation . In DATE the working group submitted its report ( PERSON , ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) to the Government . In the report it is proposed that LAW be amended in order to allow natural and legal persons to obtain damages from the ORG or a municipality for violations of the LAW . Such an action against public authorities would be examined by a general court which would need first to establish that a right provided by the ORG has been violated . The aim of the proposal is to provide a legal basis for granting non - pecuniary damage arising from disregard of the LAW , and to fulfil , together with the other already existing legal remedies , GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse , drafted in DATE , ORG observed , inter alia , that the sexual exploitation of children , in particular child pornography and prostitution , were destructive to children \u2019s health and psycho - social development and that sexual exploitation and abuse of children had grown to worrying proportions at both national and international level , in particular as regards the increased use by both children and perpetrators of information and communication technologies . The Convention therefore obliged its Parties to take the necessary legislative or other measures to prevent all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children and to criminalise certain intentional conducts , including offences concerning child pornography .
