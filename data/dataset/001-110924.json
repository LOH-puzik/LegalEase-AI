In DATE the applicant arrived in GPE where he applied for asylum . His request was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was placed in custody in GPE as a result of several accusations made against him in different countries . The only one that was pursued was that of \u201c association de malfaiteurs \u201d .

On DATE he was found guilty by a NORP court of involvement , as a member of an organised group , in the preparation , DATE , of a terrorist act in GPE and several other countries and of forging identity documents . He received a DATE sentence and was excluded from the territory of GPE . The applicant did not appeal and was released immediately upon conviction on the ground that he had served the sentence in the context of his prior detention while awaiting extradition .

In the meantime , on DATE , an NORP court had convicted the applicant , in absentia , of membership of a terrorist organisation acting both in GPE and abroad , and of forgery . He was sentenced to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant married a NORP national in GPE . A child was born to the couple on DATE .", "CARDINAL . With effect from DATE the applicant \u2019s wife was deprived of legal capacity to act . The child was entrusted to the care and custody of the applicant \u2019s wife \u2019s mother .

The divorce proceedings are pending before ORG ; it is not clear from the parties\u2019 submissions whether a final decision has been given .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s first asylum request . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action challenging that decision .", "CARDINAL .

It ordered the administrative authority to establish all the relevant facts and to give comprehensive reasons for its conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again decided not to grant asylum to the applicant and not to provide him with subsidiary protection under LAW .", "CARDINAL . It was found that the applicant \u2019s fears were subjective in nature and unsubstantiated by objective facts , that he had failed to show that he was subjected to persecution and that such persecution was politically motivated . If returned to GPE , the applicant could seek a retrial on the ground that he had already been convicted in GPE and had served the sentence imposed in that context . Moreover , the applicant represented a security risk to GPE and to society . His arguments under LAW could not be taken into account because the matter under review concerned his asylum status and not his extradition .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . ORG held , in particular , that the applicant \u2019s wish to maintain ties with his wife and child , who were NORP nationals , was not a relevant ground for granting him asylum . Furthermore , the applicant had been convicted in GPE of criminal offences linked to the activities of ORG , the aim of which was to establish , by violent means , a fundamentalist NORP State in GPE . Armed attacks carried out by the group could not be considered as a means of political struggle justifying the applicant \u2019s protection from persecution for political opinions within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the alleged risk of the applicant \u2019s ill - treatment in GPE , ORG held that the ORG \u2019s case - law under LAW concerned cases of expulsion or extradition but not those relating to requests for asylum .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had not shown that justified reasons existed to believe that he could be persecuted for any of the reasons laid down in section CARDINAL of the Asylum Act DATE , namely on the ground of his race , ethnic origin , belonging to a social group , for religious reasons or because of his political opinion .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , the purpose of granting subsidiary protection was to avoid unsuccessful asylum seekers being removed from GPE in certain justified cases .

NORP The applicant \u2019s conviction in GPE , on DATE , of involvement in a terrorist organisation and his admission that he had been trained in GPE in handling weapons and explosives , as well as other information gathered by ORG , justified the conclusion that the applicant could provide assistance to persons suspected of involvement in terrorist groups operating worldwide . The decision not to grant subsidiary protection to the applicant was therefore lawful . That conclusion could not be affected by the express admission by ORG , in the context of the asylum proceedings , that the applicant could be exposed to a real risk of inhuman treatment if returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG noted that the applicant had unlawfully left for GPE while proceedings concerning his asylum request in GPE had been pending and that he had lodged an asylum request in GPE . It concluded that the applicant was not genuinely interested in protection by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment was served on the applicant and became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Furthermore , the law and practice in GPE did not exclude the use in judicial proceedings of evidence which had been extracted under torture . The NORP authorities had refused to co - operate with special rapporteurs or working groups established within the ORG system and with non - governmental organisations with a view to clarifying the position . Similarly , the NORP authorities had refused to allow monitoring the situation of people who had been returned to that country .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the relevant regulation did not list GPE as a safe country of origin . It concluded that there were justified reasons to fear that the applicant would be exposed to treatment contrary to LAW in the event of his extradition to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant was apprehended and placed in a detention centre for foreigners in LOC on the basis of the LOC and Foreigners Police decision of DATE .
