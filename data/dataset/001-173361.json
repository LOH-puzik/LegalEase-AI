The applicants , whose names and dates of birth are listed in the annex to this decision ( \u201c the applicants \u201d ) , are CARDINAL NORP nationals of GPE ethnic origin who live or used to live in ORG . They were represented before the ORG by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a non - governmental organisation based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , from ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are or used to be residents of the town of ORG . They are of GPE ethnic origin .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before DATE many of the applicants had lived in an informal GPE slum located in central ORG . In DATE their homes were destroyed by an accidental fire and they were rendered homeless . Afterwards they were forced to live outdoors in unsafe conditions and did not receive any assistance from the authorities .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants moved , with the local authorities\u2019 permission , into an unoccupied building in ORG that had belonged to a ORG - owned factory .", "CARDINAL . For DATE the applicants and other people continued to live in that building even though the living conditions were poor and overcrowded . Despite not having a lawful right to occupy the building , the applicants\u2019 presence there was tolerated and they paid charges for water and electricity .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , they asked the local authorities on numerous occasions to assist them with regularising their status but their requests remained unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were temporarily evicted from the building for the first time in DATE following a court order . After the eviction order was overturned , they returned to the building and continued to live there .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the building was sold by its former owner to a private investor , namely the company ORG to selling the building , the former owner had allegedly attempted to donate the building to the local authorities , but his offer was refused by them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a decision concerning the allocation of social housing in ORG that made higher education a decisive criterion for examining potential applications . The decision concerned social housing located in the city .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again adopted a decision concerning the allocation of social housing in ORG that made higher education a decisive criterion for examining potential applications . This decision concerned social housing located on a particular street .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the company GPE brought eviction proceedings against some of the occupants of the building , namely DATE , sixteenth , DATE , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and QUANTITY applicants . The remaining the applicants were not parties to the eviction proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the company \u2019s action for eviction . It held that the company was the lawful owner of the building and had a right to enjoy its use . The occupants had no lawful right to occupy the building and therefore had to vacate it . The judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE and by the final judgment of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants who were parties to the eviction proceedings contested the eviction order issued against them on the basis of the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the proceedings seeking to contest the eviction order on the grounds that the said order was lawful . There is no evidence in the file that any of the applicants appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the occupants of the building , including all the applicants , were evicted . Among the applicants there were children , elderly and less able people .", "CARDINAL . The only shelter option offered to the applicants by the local authorities was a former army barracks building that had been disused since DATE located QUANTITY outside ORG and known as \u201c Pichet \u201d . The aforementioned building was in an advanced state of disrepair and had been transferred to the local authorities in DATE in order to be converted into social housing . The area around the building was heavily industrialised and there were no other residential buildings in the same location . A large number of the applicants moved into the building , while the remaining applicants had to live on the street for DATE . In DATE those of the applicants who remained homeless after the eviction accepted the local authorities\u2019 offer , as a temporary solution , to move into mobile homes that were placed on a former rubbish dump .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , when they moved to \u201c LOC \u201d they found that the building was not connected to electricity , mains water or sewage facilities . The building had no doors or windows , no heating , a broken roof and damp and damaged walls . It was also infested by rats . The toilet facilities were communal and out of order and rubbish collection was rare . The available water supply had a visible heavy sediment and caused recurring stomach problems . Trucks unloaded bauxite and gravel directly behind the building . The trucks made a lot of noise and raised large quantities of dust which caused breathing difficulties . The noise caused by the nearby shipyard also affected the applicants\u2019 psychological well - being .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , they lived in overcrowded conditions because each family was assigned CARDINAL room and therefore CARDINAL people had to share it . Some of them had to abandon their jobs or found it increasingly difficult to find employment and the children were no longer able to attend school or kindergarten because of the travelling distance into ORG and the infrequent and unreliable public transport . Some of the children were too small to return home from school on foot unaccompanied by an adult . Others had been harassed or abused by drivers or other individuals when they returned home from school after dark .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , the mobile homes that were placed on the former rubbish dump were not meant to serve as long - term habitation , especially during extreme weather conditions . They deteriorated quickly and had to be repaired repeatedly by the authorities . Although they were connected to electricity , they were not connected to running water or sewage facilities . They had no heating system , were poorly ventilated and damp , and were very cold in the DATE and very warm in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The rubbish dump had been closed down in DATE and the land had not been properly decontaminated before the mobile homes were placed on it .", "CARDINAL . NORP In press statements published in the local newspapers PERSON and ORG on DATE , DATE and on an unspecified date during their eviction in DATE , the mayor of ORG stated in respect of the applicants\u2019 situation that : \u201c ... morally there could be a duty , but as mayor I have a duty towards law - abiding citizens , a duty towards the citizens who respect the community , a duty towards families with children who are gainfully employed . Some of them are living there without any papers to prove that they are citizens of ORG \u201d . Also : \u201c ... Some citizens accused me of racism and some of positive discrimination . I did not set out to become the king of the gypsies in this town , because this is not why I have been elected . I have done a lot to meet the problems of this social category , but now it \u2019s enough ... \u201d . And : \u201c We are doing everything possible to provide them with some comfort at \u201c LOC \u201d , where CARDINAL families have been relocated . For the rest other options were found . We have no houses available . Where would they like me to find a living space for them , at CARDINAL ? Perhaps close to the market ? Those who are not from ORG can go back to where they came from \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a press statement published on DATE in the local newspaper ORG the ORG stated that \u201c We are looking at an option with mobile homes , but I would like to say that many of the GPE faced with these problems have created them themselves . Many of them sold their homes and afterwards asked ORG for new ones . Of course , the GPE are confronted with many problems , but they are not frequent visitors of the jobs markets . Be that as it may , many non - GPE are in a similar situation to that of the GPE population and have no homes , but they do not knock at ORG door ; they try to rent , to work and so on . I think that your organisation should also be more involved this way and educate them to work \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the sixth , fifteenth , DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL , QUANTITY , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and QUANTITY applicants , all of whom were living in the \u201c LOC building , brought proceedings against ORG to obtain an injunction ordering the local authorities to carry out the urgent maintenance work needed on their building .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of DATE ORG allowed the action brought by the applicants . It held that ORG had signed lease contracts for the building with the applicants . Therefore , as a lessor , according to the relevant domestic legislation and the provisions of the lease contracts , it had an obligation to provide adequate living conditions , and to repair the building and keep it safe for the entire duration of the contract . However , according to the available testimonies at the time , the housing conditions had been unfit for habitation and the building had been in a poor state when the applicants moved into it . In DATE the building had still not been connected to the town \u2019s electricity grid and the sewage system was never fully functional . The building materials brought on site by ORG after the applicants moved there did not constitute fulfilment by the lessor of its obligations to repair the building because the quantity of materials was too small to ensure the complete repair of the building .", "CARDINAL . The argument that the building \u2019s problems were caused by some of the tenants themselves was not supported by any proof . In addition , the argument that the applicants failed to pay rent for long periods of time was irrelevant for the case , since the lessor could not use that argument to justify a breach of his contractual duty to maintain the building . Consequently , the court ordered ORG to repair the building and maintain it and the communal areas at an acceptable standard for the entire duration of the lease contract .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL CARDINAL of the applicants living both at \u201c LOC and in the mobile homes \u2013 all except DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , fortyeighth , and DATE applicants DATE and other people brought a general tort law action on the basis of ORG of LAW against ORG and the ORG mayor \u2019s office seeking CARDINAL NORP lei ( PERSON ) ( CARDINAL for each individual ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ( CARDINAL for each individual ) ) by way of compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage sustained as a result of having their access to education restricted , the inadequacy of the living conditions in the social housing , and the interference with their health and social personality as a result of the inaction of the local authorities .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the QUANTITY applicants\u2019 action . It held that the applicants had not suffered any damage and therefore CARDINAL of the conditions required for a general tort law action had not been met . The local authorities had taken steps to provide the applicants with suitable living conditions , even though they had failed to pay their outstanding taxes . Although the applicants had not paid their rent , the local authorities had not used the contract clause allowing them to terminate the lease contracts after the applicants\u2019 failure to pay rent for DATE . The means to help the disadvantaged were provided for by law . The responsibilities of ORG and the ORG mayor \u2019s office did not include the duty to secure the necessary conditions in social housing belonging to persons of GPE ethnicity or their health .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the judgment . They did not submit reasons for their appeal but argued that the objectivity of the social investigation reports produced during the proceedings was doubtful because they were carried out by ORG employees . In addition , the social investigation reports had not reflected their living conditions as they had avoided providing details about the available utilities , furniture and living conditions by using the expression \u201c equipped with the bare necessities \u201d .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal and upheld the judgment of the firstinstance court . It noted that the applicants had failed to provide reasons supporting their appeal and had submitted only objections in respect of the social investigation reports . It held that according to the relevant domestic legislation the local authorities had to assign social housing to various categories of people in an order of priority set out by law . Consequently , homeless GPE could be assigned social housing only if the order of priority set out by law had been observed and if they met the DATE income criterion provided for by law . Therefore , the local authorities could not be forced to satisfy the social housing needs of all the applicants as long as such housing had to be assigned on a priority basis to other categories of people expressly provided for by law . The ORG needs could be met afterwards , if and when social housing became available .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that , even though the applicants had failed to pay their dues towards the ORG budget , some of them had nonetheless been provided with social housing . Consequently , the local authorities had already taken steps to ensure they had suitable living conditions .", "CARDINAL . As far as the applicants\u2019 living conditions were concerned , the court noted that there was no evidence that the social housing was not connected to electricity or heating facilities , and this could also have been a consequence of the applicants\u2019 failure to pay their DATE invoices . Moreover , the responsibilities of the local authorities did not include the duty to ensure adequate conditions in social housing belonging to persons of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicants\u2019 health , the court held that it was not proven that the alleged failure of the local authorities to fulfil their duties had caused the applicants\u2019 state of health to deteriorate .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court also noted that it had not been proven that the local authorities\u2019 action \u2013 namely providing only some of the applicants with social housing based on availability \u2013 had restricted their access to education .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment . They argued that according to the relevant domestic legislation the local authorities were responsible for assigning social housing for renting to disadvantaged persons , a category to which the applicants belonged . The authorities had a statutory responsibility to ensure decent living conditions for ORG \u2019s citizens but they had failed to fulfil their duty by housing the applicants indefinitely in accommodation which was not connected to basic utilities . The absence of decent accommodation for ORG \u2019s GPE was one cause of the applicants\u2019 abandonment of school attendance and of their exclusion from the employment market . In these circumstances , the failure of the local authorities to fulfil their statutory obligations rendered them responsible for the non - pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants , estimated at RON CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) for each individual .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law in part , quashed the second instance court \u2019s judgment , annulled the action lodged by DATE applicant on account of her death and awarded each of the remaining applicants RON CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately LAW ) in respect of non - pecuniary damage . It noted that the parties had submitted the final judgment of DATE to it and that the seventeenth applicant had died on DATE and that no relatives had accepted her inheritance . Moreover , it stressed that the object of the applicants\u2019 action was strictly limited to the non - pecuniary damage claim of ORG CARDINAL for each individual in the light of having their access to education restricted , being provided with social housing offering inadequate living conditions , and the interference with their health and social personality resulting from the inaction of the local authorities . The applicants had not asked the court to examine the conditions in which their eviction in DATE had taken place . The aforementioned issue had been the object of another set of proceedings which were terminated by the final judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court held that the local authorities\u2019 failure to fulfil all their statutory duties and ensure adequate living conditions for the applicants in the housing rented to them after their eviction in DATE amounted to a breach of their right to private and family life and home guaranteed by LAW . It noted that , contrary to the ORG submissions , the local authorities\u2019 decision to assign and rent homes to the applicants at \u201c LOC \u201d had not been aimed at segregating the GPE families . Because DATE was approaching when the applicants were evicted , the local authorities had actually been trying to urgently secure shelter for CARDINAL of the evicted families and their small children . According to ORG , the lack of social housing was endemic nationwide and particularly in ORG , where CARDINAL social cases were solved DATE out of the CARDINAL pending requests for social housing .", "CARDINAL . As regards the \u201c LOC \u201d building , the court held that , according to the available evidence , the building was functional and had offered adequate conditions for housing on DATE when it was leased to the applicants . In particular , the building was connected to electricity , was fitted with stoves for heating , and running water was available from a tap located in the courtyard . In addition , on the date the applicants took over the building the local authorities provided the ORG representative , namely the ninth applicant , with some building materials in order to be able to carry out some maintenance work that was needed . However , according to the relevant domestic legislation it was not sufficient for a lessor to provide those who signed a lease contract with a functional building . The lessor had to provide during the entire period of the lease contract a building which was safe to use and which had functioning utililities . In the instant case , during the term of the lease contract the communal water , electric and sewage facilities were damaged .", "CARDINAL . Although the tenants reported the problems to the authorities , they had remained inactive and had failed to carry out repairs and the building had become unfit for habitation and a health hazard for the tenants . Although ORG established on DATE that the local authorities had failed to repair and maintain the building for the entire duration of the lease contract , and had ordered them to do so , the authorities had not demonstrated that they had complied with that judgment . Moreover , according to the available evidence , the building had become even more dilapidated and unfit for habitation . The fact that the building \u2019s problems were caused by some of the tenants themselves could not exonerate the authorities or explain their inaction . The relevant domestic legislation provided for sanctions against tenants who damage a building , namely the cancellation of their lease contract . However , the local authorities had failed to take any punitive measures against those tenants . At the same time they had also failed to repair the building , thus creating an unsuitable living environment even for those tenants who had maintained their homes and had not damaged the building .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the mobile homes located on the former rubbish dump , the court held that they had represented an effective temporary solution for the ORG problems . However , given that the applicants have had to continue living there , the homes in question and their location amounted to a breach of the applicants\u2019 right to enjoy their home in a healthy environment as guaranteed by LAW . The mobile homes assigned to CARDINAL families were placed on a former rubbish dump , without any preliminary operation to decontaminate the soil or have the level of soil pollution measured by a specialist agency . The local authorities were responsible for taking measures to locate the mobile homes in an area of the city that would be appropriate for the applicants\u2019 needs and would safeguard their right to a healthy environment . However , they had failed to fulfil their positive obligations under LAW and to inform the applicants that the land in question had been used as a rubbish dump prior to DATE and that their health and quality of life might be adversely affected by pollution . The failure of the local authorities to fulfil their duties and their passivity after DATE also amounted to a breach of the applicants\u2019 right to a home as guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , given the applicants\u2019 living conditions , namely the overcrowded and unhealthy environment , and its effect on the applicants\u2019 state of health throughout the long period of time they had to live under those conditions , combined with the general attitude of the authorities , the civil liability of the authorities could be engaged since the nature of the applicants\u2019 living conditions had a negative impact on human dignity and the applicants\u2019 right to private life and to a home .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the ORG claims that the local authorities had interfered with and restricted the applicants\u2019 children \u2019s right to education by renting them social housing located on the city \u2019s outskirts , the court held that the local authorities were responsible for the applicants\u2019 children \u2019s inability to attend school regularly and liable for the damage thereby caused .", "CARDINAL . It noted that , according to the available evidence , the applicants\u2019 children \u2019s schools were located CARDINAL kilometres from their homes . The absence of frequent public transport on those routes made travelling to school difficult and encouraged the abandonment of school attendance , particularly during adverse weather conditions . From DATE there was no public transport connecting the \u201c LOC \u201d building to the city centre and the form of transport referred to was introduced only after that date . In this context it pointed out that according to the case - law of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , in cases where a general measure has a disproportionately prejudicial effect on a particular group of people , that measure could be deemed to be discriminatory even though it had not targeted that group of people . Consequently , even though the authorities\u2019 cancellation of public transport in the area did not directly target the GPE and pursued a legitimate aim DATE namely to make public transport financially efficient \u2013 its effect did not strike a fair balance between the public interest and that of the applicants . By relying on the principles set out in the ORG \u2019s case - law concerning non - discrimination against people of GPE ethnicity and their right to education , the court concluded that the local authorities had indirectly breached the applicants\u2019 children \u2019s right to education by failing to discharge their duty of organising adequate public transport in the city .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicants\u2019 claims that their health was affected , the court noted that they enjoyed free medical assistance without any discrimination or bias . However , it considered that , based on the available testimonial evidence , the authorities\u2019 passivity in respect of the applicants\u2019 inadequate living conditions , the lack of hygiene in the rented housing and the polluted environment had affected the applicants\u2019 health .", "CARDINAL . Finally , in determining the non - pecuniary compensation to which the applicants were entitled ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court took into account the ORG individual situations , the fact that some of the applicants had failed to fulfill all their contractual obligations , that they had refused to comply with their lawful duty to participate in routine cleaning of the LOC , and that some of their actions had contributed to the deterioration of their homes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged civil claims in anti - discrimination proceedings against ORG , relying on LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on combating and punishing all forms of discrimination . The action did not name any of the applicants or any of the victims of the measures taken by the authorities . ORG asked the court to acknowledge that the relocation of GPE families in a building deemed unfit for human habitation outside the town and in mobile homes on a former rubbish dump breached the domestic legislation on antidiscrimination , as did the criterion set by the local authorities requiring a certain level of education for awarding social housing . In addition , ORG asked the court to order ORG to pay ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) to the victims of the discrimination , and to restore the previous situation , or to remedy the situation caused by the discrimination .", "CARDINAL . The ORG argued , amongst other things , that part of the evidence used to prove that the ORG local authorities\u2019 decision - making process had been influenced by their preconceptions about GPE was the racist language used by them in the press to describe the applicants on account of their ethnicity ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . Moreover , the local authorities had moved the families in question to remote locations , into a polluted area and on a former rubbish dump , had segregated them , had created physical obstacles for them which prevented them from accessing regular public services , had restricted their children \u2019s rights to education and had refused to fulfil their contractual and legal obligations . Furthermore , without any reasonable justification , ORG had added the criterion of higher education as a decisive condition for accessing social housing , even though the relevant domestic legislation did not impose this criterion as a requirement and it had been statistically proven that people of GPE ethnicity are less well educated than those of other ethnicities .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the action brought by ORG . It noted that following its request , ORG had submitted its opinion on the case . The court held that the actions of the local authorities had been motivated not by racial discrimination but by the lack of social housing affecting both the GPE and the non - GPE population . Moreover , the allegedly offensive statements made by representatives of the local authorities were not discriminatory , because the domestic anti - discrimination legislation could not restrict freedom of speech , or the freedom to hold an opinion , or to impart information . According to press articles submitted by ORG , the representatives of the local authorities had stated the reason for the GPE move to the impugned locations , namely the lack of any other social housing , not their ethnicity .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the criteria set by the local authorities for allocating social housing ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) could not be considered discriminatory because in the court \u2019s opinion it would be unconceivable that any one social group would have a better claim to social housing than another social group simply because the latter \u2019s members were not educated , or that the interpretation of the legal provisions would generate positive discrimination . The local authorities were free to set certain criteria for awarding social housing and they could not be held responsible for the fact that GPE are less educated than the rest of the population . The local authorities had a duty to safeguard the rights and well - being of all the members of the community and the relocation of the GPE families to the area they favoured would have created a situation of conflict in that area that the authorities were duty - bound to avoid . The court furthermore considered that ORG claims for compensation , or to remedy the problems caused by the discrimination , were unfounded because the authorities had not committed acts of discrimination and the question of whether or not the housing assigned to the families in question was fit for habitation was not an issue of discrimination and could be remedied through a general law action . At the same time , restoring the previous situation would have contravened a final court judgment which was res judicata and ordered their eviction .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed against the judgment and asked the appeal court to quash the first - instance court \u2019s judgment and to allow its action the way it was formulated . It argued , inter alia , that the first - instance court had misapplied the relevant anti - discrimination legal provisions and had failed to reverse the burden of proof as required by law , even though they had proven by statistical data that the relocated families had been discriminated against . In addition , it claimed that the court had failed to examine evidence held on file such as the discriminatory statements made by the local authorities , had founded its judgment on inexistent evidence , had relied on the principle of free speech as an argument for dismissing the claims DATE even though free speech does not excuse discriminatory statements \u2013 had ignored the fact that of the people who had claimed social housing , it was only those with GPE ethnicity who had been assigned housing in the impugned locations , had relied on the argument that there was no social housing available in ORG without seeking evidence to substantiate this , and had not examined the question of whether the GPE relocation and living conditions were discriminatory . The court had also failed to understand the argument concerning the higher education criterion , given that the organisation had contested not its actual existence , but rather the importance assigned to it for the purposes of awarding social housing . The local authorities had not shown any objective justification for assigning great importance to that condition .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It held that the relocation of the GPE families had not been motivated by racial discrimination as the decision for relocation had been taken on the basis of regulations provided for by law . Nor had the domestic authorities treated the GPE families differently from other families in a similar situation . In addition , the local authorities\u2019 public statements had not been discriminatory and , as they did not play a decisive role in assigning housing to GPE families , were irrelevant . The GPE families had been provided with housing on the basis of clearly established criteria set out in decisions that had not been contested . The available evidence had not demonstrated fulfilment of the cumulative conditions required for an act to amount to discrimination within the meaning of the relevant domestic legislation .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed on points of law against the judgment and asked the appeal court to quash the secondinstance court \u2019s judgment and to allow its action the way it was formulated . It argued that the second - instance court had failed to provide reasons for its decision and to fully examine the claims concerning the relocation to polluted areas , and had omitted altogether to examine the arguments about the higher education criterion . The lower court , meanwhile , had failed to explain the basis for its statement that GPE families had not been treated differently from other families in a similar situation . Moreover , the court had shifted the burden of proof in respect of the discrimination claim to the plaintiff , whereas it was for the authorities to show that there had been no discrimination . The court \u2019s argument that the GPE families had been provided with houses on the basis of clearly established criteria set out in decisions was irrelevant as it did not mean that the criteria in question were not discriminatory . In addition , the appellate court \u2019s reasoning simply ignored the racist and discriminatory nature of the public officials\u2019 statements , even though the same public officials were the ones who had ordered the relocation of the GPE families outside the city and on a former rubbish dump .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( available on DATE ) ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law . It held that if the interest in taking part in the proceedings lay in the purpose for which the non - governmental organisation was founded \u2212 namely , the protection of the rights of the persons in respect of whom the existence of the alleged discrimination was invoked \u2212 in the instant case the available evidence , including the succession of events as narrated by the media , did not confirm the existence of different treatment in a similar situation . TIME of ORG meeting of DATE and the press articles provided evidence of the efforts of the local authorities to remedy the problems caused by the eviction .", "CARDINAL . The local authorities had repeatedly attempted to delay the eviction pending the preparation of other housing solutions , and had succeeded in doing so . It was uncontested that after the eviction housing solutions had been found for all the families either at \u201c LOC \u201d or in mobile homes . It had also been proved that the local authorities had constantly tried to remedy the particular housing problems of individual families by granting them social housing and by overruling the opposition of some of the members of the community to certain GPE being granted priority treatment . In this context the court noted the statements made by the mayor and by another representative of the local authorities in respect of the PERSON and GPE situation after their eviction . ORG arguments that the relocation of most of the families to \u201c LOC amounted to segregation was therefore contradicted , since that had been the only housing option identified at the time of the eviction and there was no proof that alternative options had existed .", "CARDINAL . Also , the local authorities had tried to remedy the GPE social problems , even though it was not denied that some of them had owned homes which they had sold after moving into the unoccupied building in ORG , which had previously belonged to a ORG - owned factory . In addition , the area where the \u201c LOC \u201d building was located was connected to the town by public transport even though the bus service was infrequent . Travelling into the city was therefore possible , whereas by contrast it was a well - known fact that there were inhabited areas of the country which were not served by any transport connection at all , not even for children attending school . Furthermore , according to press reports about the investigation carried out by ORG , the area where the \u201c LOC building was located did not constitute a health hazard for humans . What is more , after some of the families moved to \u201c LOC \u201d , their homes had been connected to electricity .", "CARDINAL . As regards the mobile homes located on the former rubbish dump , the court considered that the lower courts had correctly dismissed the discrimination argument . In this connection it noted that DATE according to the press reports \u2013 the homes in question had initially been set up on a concrete platform at a separate location but were later moved at the request of the GPE representatives in order to have access to water and sewage facilities . Subsequently , they were connected to the town \u2019s electric grid .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , ORG had failed to prove the alleged stereotypical and offensive statements made by local officials about the GPE community , and the authorities\u2019 action argued against the existence of a discriminatory stance based on ethnicity . Furthermore , leaving aside the fact that ORG had assumed without proof that members of the GPE community were less well educated , the education criterion set by the local authorities for allocating social housing had concerned social housing located on a particular street and it had not been proved that it was a rule applied in a \u2018 blanket\u2019 manner when allocating all social housing in the city , or that it was relevant on the date of the eviction , or that it was a real obstacle for the members of the GPE community to enforce their rights as long as it was established that there were no other options available for shelter at the time . Also , the criterion had been imposed by a ORG decision dating back to DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) that had not been challenged by the victims before the domestic courts . In addition , the relevant domestic legislation allowed local authorities to determine the criteria for awarding social housing .", "CARDINAL .
