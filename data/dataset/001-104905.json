The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was convicted of sexual offences including attempted rape , sexual abuse of children , sexual assault , attempted sexual assault and dangerous assault in CARDINAL judgments and spent DATE in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of sexual assault . It sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his ( first ) preventive detention under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . It found that in DATE and DATE the applicant , acting with full criminal responsibility , had sexually assaulted CARDINAL hitchhikers whom he had taken with him in his car . Having consulted a neurological expert , it further found that owing to his criminal tendencies , it was very likely that the applicant would commit further serious sexual offences comparable to those he was found guilty of on release and was dangerous to the public . Therefore , his preventive detention was necessary .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his prison sentence until DATE and was then held in preventive detention until DATE , when the preventive detention order was suspended on probation and the applicant released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of attempted sexual assault and falsification of a driving licence . It sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his ( second ) preventive detention under LAW . ORG found that in DATE the applicant , acting with full criminal responsibility , had again attempted to sexually assault a hitchhiker . He had threatened her with a gas pistol , but she had succeeded in wresting the pistol from him and making good her escape . Having regard to the facts that the applicant had begun to reoffend almost immediately after spending DATE in detention and that , according to the convincing view expressed by an expert , it would take DATE to rehabilitate the applicant , if ever , the court further considered its second order of preventive detention to be proportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG revoked the suspension on probation of the applicant \u2019s first preventive detention , ordered in ORG judgment of DATE , as the applicant had reoffended and had not diligently continued his therapy .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his full prison sentence imposed in the judgment of DATE until DATE . Since CARDINAL DATE the applicant has been in preventive detention in FAC as ordered both in the judgment of ORG of DATE and in the judgment of that same court of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , reviewing the applicant \u2019s preventive detention , refused to suspend his preventive detention on probation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to order his release from preventive detention , arguing that preventive detention violated LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , examining the applicant \u2019s request under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , decided that his objections against the admissibility of the execution of his preventive detention were ill - founded . The applicant \u2019s preventive detention , ordered by ORG in DATE under LAW , constituted lawful detention after conviction by a competent court within the meaning of LAW ( a ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It added that preventive detention under LAW , which was to be qualified as a measure of correction and prevention and not as a penalty , neither violated the LAW nor LAW . Moreover , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in its version in force since DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , was constitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , referring to its leading judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; application no . CARDINAL to ORG ) , declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , in which he had complained that his preventive detention of an indefinite duration had violated LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE the Aachen ORG , reviewing the applicant \u2019s detention , refused to suspend the applicant \u2019s preventive detention on probation . It considered that it could not be expected that the applicant , who refused to make a therapy with an external psychologist offered to him , would not reoffend on release .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was in his first preventive detention as ordered in the judgment of ORG of DATE until DATE . From DATE , the applicant \u2019s preventive detention as ordered for the second time in the judgment of ORG of DATE is executed .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) . The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows :", "CARDINAL . The sentencing court may , at the time of the offender \u2019s conviction , order his preventive detention , a socalled measure of correction and prevention , under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence , a penalty , if the offender has been shown to be dangerous to the public ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied . Firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public ( see LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in its version in force prior to DATE , the first placement in preventive detention may not exceed DATE . If the maximum duration has expired , the detainee shall be released ( Article QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW was amended by the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other LAW of DATE , which entered into force on DATE . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , in its amended version , provided that if a person has spent DATE in preventive detention , the court shall declare the measure terminated ( only ) if there is no danger that the detainee will , owing to his criminal tendencies , commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims . Termination shall automatically entail supervision of the conduct of the offender . The former maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention was abolished . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to LAW , the amended version of Article CARDINAL of LAW was to be applied without any restriction ratione temporis .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that a court decision must be obtained if objections are raised to the execution of a sentence .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the ORG preventive detention beyond the former DATE maximum period ( compare the provisions in paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and about the retrospective order of the ORG preventive detention respectively ( file nos . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG held that all provisions on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective order of such detention were incompatible with LAW as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law , read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all provisions of LAW on the imposition and duration of preventive detention at issue were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of the persons in preventive detention because those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment ( PERSON ) . These provisions included , in particular , LAW in its version in force since DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with LAW remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until DATE at the most . In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged or ordered retrospectively , the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned , owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct , were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if , additionally , they suffered from a mental disorder . As regards the notion of mental disorder , ORG explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of \u201c persons of unsound mind \u201d in LAW sub - paragraph ( e ) of the LAW made in this ORG \u2019s case - law . If the above pre - conditions were not met , those detainees had to be released no later than DATE . The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be further applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality ; as a general rule , proportionality was only respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , ORG stressed that the fact that the LAW stood above the LAW in the domestic hierarchy of norms was not an obstacle to an international and NORP dialogue between the courts , but was , on the contrary , its normative basis in view of the fact that the LAW was to be interpreted in a manner that was open to public international law ( v\u00f6lkerrechtsfreundliche GPE ) . In its reasoning , ORG relied on the interpretation of LAW made by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
