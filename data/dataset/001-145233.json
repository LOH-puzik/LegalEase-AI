The applicant was born in DATE and currently lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . He entered GPE on DATE and lodged an asylum application . It remained undisputed by the NORP authorities that at that time he was still a minor , even though his exact date of birth is unknown . He was not accompanied by any family members , nor were any of his relatives present in another member ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that he had left his village in GPE DATE , crossed the border to GPE and then the border to GPE by QUANTITY . With the aid of a trafficker he reached GPE , where he stayed for DATE . Together with a group of other refugees , he crossed into GPE by boat , where he was arrested and processed . He was released shortly after with an order to leave the country . He travelled to GPE , where he stayed for DATE . He then left GPE together with CARDINAL other refugees via the Former GPE , from where he crossed the border to GPE by foot .", "CARDINAL . NORP In GPE , the applicant was arrested and processed . He claimed that he was forced to lodge an asylum request and placed in an open camp . Allegedly , the NORP authorities did not give any consideration to the fact that he was a minor . Because he had never planned to stay in GPE , but wanted to lodge an asylum application in GPE , he left the camp DATE and took a train to GPE .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant was interviewed by the NORP authorities on CARDINAL DATE , he stated that he did not want to return to GPE . He claimed not to know the status of his asylum proceedings there because he was illiterate . In a second interview on DATE , he stated that he was arrested and detained for DATE in GPE . He was not given enough to eat and suffered from hunger in detention . He claimed that the conduct of the police towards him was rough . Officers were armed at all times , and he was woken up during TIME for interviews . He further stated that he was afraid of being sent back to GPE .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant was asked why he had left GPE , he stated that his family had sent him away so he could live a safer life . His father had died in GPE DATE . His mother lived with the applicant and his CARDINAL young siblings in the ORG district in GPE . The precarious security situation and the lack of access to subsistence and education in the region prompted him to leave the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesasylamt \u2013 hereinafter \" ORG \" ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request and established GPE \u2019s jurisdiction in this regard in accordance with LAW ( c ) of ORG ( ORG ) No . MONEY ( \" the Dublin II Regulation \" ) . On DATE ORG ( Asylgerichtshof ) quashed that decision pursuant to LAW ) on the grounds that the facts had not been established exhaustively . It stated that ORG had failed to update its country information regarding the risk of refoulement of asylumseekers from GPE to GPE . Furthermore , the decision had not established the legal framework under which minors could be detained in GPE and what the conditions of detention were .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request and ordered his expulsion to GPE under GPE . In addition to general information on the situation of asylum - seekers in GPE , ORG referred to information obtained from ORG in GPE dated DATE and DATE . According to that information , the detention of minors could not be ordered in GPE . If a detained refugee claimed to be a minor , an age assessment was ordered and the minor was released if his or her age was confirmed . As regards the evaluation of GPE by GPE as a safe third country , the NORP authorities stated that they did not have a list of safe third countries and evaluated each case individually . However , in most cases GPE was considered to be a safe third country . GPE expelled asylum - seekers to GPE , if their first asylum proceedings were terminated and there was no obstacle under the non - refoulement rule . A person lodging a subsequent asylum request was not allowed to remain in GPE . The same applied for GPE returnees if their first asylum proceedings were terminated . If asylum proceedings were discontinued after an asylum - seeker left GPE , an asylum request after his or her return under the GPE regulation was considered a subsequent asylum request . It was further established that appeals against asylum decisions at first instance and during the first proceedings had automatic suspensive effect . However , appeals against decisions in subsequent asylum proceedings did not . It was in any event possible to lodge an appeal against the expulsion order itself . It was then up to the judge \u2019s discretion to award the proceedings suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . When it came to the personal credibility of the applicant , ORG stated that it found his allegations of having been detained in GPE for DATE unconvincing , as the country information had shown that the detention of minors could not be ordered in GPE . It further held that the information had shown that GPE did not practise refoulement to GPE . Finally , the NORP authorities had assumed jurisdiction over the applicant \u2019s asylum request under LAW ( c ) of LAW , which proved that the applicant still had access to asylum proceedings on the merits in GPE . ORG concluded that it hence did not consider itself legally obliged to make use of the sovereignty clause and rejected the asylum request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG awarded suspensive effect to the applicant \u2019s appeal against that decision , but on DATE dismissed it as unfounded . It pointed out that the NORP authorities had informed ORG that they had planned an age assessment , but could not carry it out because the applicant had left the country . Thereupon , on DATE the NORP authorities had discontinued his proceedings . However , ORG assumed that because of GPE \u2019s acceptance of jurisdiction under LAW ( c ) of LAW the applicant would have access to asylum proceedings on the merits in GPE . In its reasoning ORG took note of a letter from ORG in GPE dated DATE , seemingly citing problems with the techniques of age assessment in GPE , detention and the detention conditions for asylum - seekers , refoulement to GPE and the fact that a GPE - returner \u2019s asylum request was considered a subsequent asylum request if the proceedings had been discontinued in GPE . However , ORG noted a lack of sources in the ORG \u2019s letter and referred to the recently updated country information obtained by the NORP asylum authorities , which did not indicate systematic deficiencies in the NORP asylum proceedings and reception conditions that would have warranted an extensive use of the sovereignty clause of LAW of the Dublin II Regulation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , which was rejected on DATE . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE . An arrest order stated that a transfer of the applicant to the NORP authorities was planned for CARDINAL DATE . At that time , the applicant was still a minor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG applied an interim measure under Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of Court and requested ORG to stay the applicant \u2019s transfer to GPE until further notice . ORG complied with this request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the ORG that the applicant \u2019s asylum proceedings in GPE had been discontinued on DATE . The decision had become final on DATE . The first asylum proceedings would not be reopened upon his return to GPE . If he was returned to GPE , an asylum request would be considered a subsequent request which would not have automatic suspensive effect if there were no new circumstances supporting his application but there was a safe third country which he could be returned to . Regarding the issue of appointing a guardian for the minor applicant , the NORP authorities stated that unaccompanied minor asylum - seekers were usually immediately assigned a guardian , except when the applicant would reach the age of majority before the decision on the merits was taken . Unaccompanied minors were placed in a children \u2019s home in GPE , where care and education were provided to them according to their age . Having regard to the fact that the applicant would turn CARDINAL on DATE , it was very unlikely that a guardian would be appointed for him upon his return ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
