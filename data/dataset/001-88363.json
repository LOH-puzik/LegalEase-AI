It noted that the applicant had not been in possession of the car abroad for the required period of DATE . Also , she had not limited her stays in GPE to DATE allowed during DATE before the move , but had stayed in GPE for a total of DATE . She had informed the customs authorities that she had spent DATE in GPE . The customs office noted that practice regarding DATE allowed was flexible . However , by law , attention had to be paid to the length of and reason for the stays .

CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) it was held that LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , of LAW does not give rise to liability for damages on the sole ground that a decision based on a judicial assessment is subsequently overturned as erroneous following reassessment by an appellate body . In order for a judicial assessment to be considered so wrong as to give rise to liability for damages , regard must be had to various factors , in particular to the nature of the legal provisions , the application of which is the subject of the case .

When applying this provision , the authorities paid attention to both the duration of the immigrant \u2019s stays and their reason . Although the provision did not explicitly provide for a maximum duration of temporary stays , the authorities took account of the so - called \u201c DATE rule \u201d applied in cases of income taxation . Although the wording of the provision did not permit actual work - related visits , short working visits were permitted in practice and were not as such deemed to interrupt the stay abroad .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( tullilaki , tullagen ; Act no .
