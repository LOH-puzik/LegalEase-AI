GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , criminal investigations were initiated against the applicant on the suspicion of his participation in planning several transactions of illegal sales of weapons to GPE .", "On DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of several counts of offences under LAW ( PERSON ) . It found that he had counselled and participated in planning the illegal sales of weapons to GPE . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment on probation .", "On DATE , ORG , upon the applicant \u2019s appeal , amended the ORG decision to the effect that he was found guilty of CARDINAL offence under LAW . It imposed a fine amounting to CARDINAL DATE rates of CARDINAL DEM ( approximately CARDINAL Euro ) .", "On DATE , following the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , ORG repealed this decision and referred the case back to a different chamber of ORG . It found that the procedural delays caused by judicial organs had not been taken into account by the lower court .", "On DATE , ORG confirmed its decision of DATE . It briefly mentioned the delays in proceedings , but found that , bearing in mind the gravity of the offence , CARDINAL DATE rates was the lowest possible sentence .", "On DATE , ORG , following the applicant \u2019s second appeal on points of law , also quashed the decision of DATE and referred the case back to yet another chamber of ORG . It found that the judicial organs had unnecessarily prolonged proceedings for DATE and that this constituted a violation of LAW ) and of LAW . However , it found that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s submissions , this did not constitute a procedural impediment that would warrant for proceedings to be discontinued . Finally , ORG noted that in its decisions , ORG had failed to show if and to what extent the excessive length of proceedings had an effect on the sentence .", "On DATE , ORG amended the decisions of DATE and DATE while changing the sentence to the effect that the fine was reduced to CARDINAL DATE rates of CARDINAL ORG .", "It found that the following delays had been unnecessary and were attributable to the judicial organs : although ORG had been in possession of most of the relevant information by DATE , the indictment was not submitted before DATE , which amounted to a delay of DATE and DATE . ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , having been finalised for service on DATE , was not served upon the applicant before DATE , i. e. DATE . The proceedings were not furthered between DATE and DATE , when the case was transferred to ORG . In appeal proceedings before ORG , ORG took DATE and DATE ( DATE ) to submit its memorial to ORG . These delays amounted to DATE in total .", "ORG found that the delays and the excessive length of proceedings were in breach of LAW CARDINAL of the Convention . Having regard to all circumstances , ORG concluded that the procedural delays did not require that the proceedings be discontinued . Weighing all personal mitigating and aggravating factors , ORG found that , without taking account of the procedural delays , it would have imposed a fine of CARDINAL DATE rates of CARDINAL ORG . It reduced the fine to CARDINAL DATE rates , on account of the above - mentioned delays in the past , and , in a second step , further reduced the fine to CARDINAL DATE rates , considering the further delays caused by the appeal proceedings .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE , ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . ORG found , in particular , that ORG had given a detailed account of the delays attributable to the judiciary and had taken these delays into account when reducing the fine by CARDINAL DATE rates . The reduced fine did not reach the statutory limits for inclusion in a certificate of good conduct ( PERSON ) and would be removed from the applicant \u2019s criminal record after the minimum statutory period . ORG had therefore sufficiently reduced the sentence on account of the procedural delays ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
