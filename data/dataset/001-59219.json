The applicant assumed that these soldiers came from ORG . They carried out an identity check . Making CARDINAL of the villagers stand aside , including the applicant \u2019s son PERSON , they told the rest of the villagers to return home . Although the soldiers released GPE at first , they called him back TIME and ordered him to join the group of CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . From a distance , the applicant had seen PERSON and GPE being arrested . The soldiers ordered the detainees to strip naked to search them . When they left , the applicant tried to follow but was blocked by QUANTITY gendarmes . Later , she heard that the detainees had been taken to the regional boarding school . On QUANTITY occasions , she went to the commandos from FAC and asked about her sons . She was referred to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant explained that ORG was partially used by the military . The building housed students and teachers as well as soldiers .

When the applicant went to see ORG , a captain received her . The mayor of the village accompanied her , as she could not speak NORP . The captain told the applicant that he had no information about her sons , but that it was possible that gendarmes from the Bolu region might have information about this incident . However , when she visited the commander a second time , the gendarmes from Bolu were not mentioned .", "CARDINAL . The applicant explained that GPE had disputes with some of the villagers . He had been taken into custody DATE before his disappearance , on his way home from a wedding .

DATE after the disappearance of her sons , the applicant learned that her grandson , PERSON , had been arrested by the soldiers . She was not in the village at the time of the incident , but was told that PERSON had been taken away from their garden by soldiers . The applicant explained that she was concerned about her grandson \u2019s fate as he suffered from poor health .", "CARDINAL . The witness , who was born in DATE , was the applicant \u2019s daughter . She lived in GPE , where she had moved DATE . She gave the following account as regards the disappearance of her CARDINAL brothers and her nephew . At the time of the events , her brothers , PERSON and GPE , lived in GPE . GPE lived with his family in a house close to their mother 's and PERSON lived with his mother . DATE before the alleged incident GPE had been arrested on his way home from a wedding , upon a complaint filed against him by a young man . The witness had last seen her CARDINAL brothers DATE prior to their disappearance , when they brought her belongings to ORG . The witness explained that the family had no enemies in Dernek and that there was no conflict within the family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE towards TIME , she received a telephone call from GPE , the son of PERSON . GPE told her that CARDINAL people from the village had been arrested including his father and her QUANTITY brothers . She went to Dernek immediately .", "CARDINAL . She reached the village that TIME , and was told by her mother that the soldiers had raided the village in TIME , searching all the houses and ordering everyone to gather at the square by the mosque bringing their identity cards . The men and women had been separated . After an identity check , CARDINAL men were set apart , including PERSON . These CARDINAL men were stripped naked and searched .", "CARDINAL . According to her mother \u2019s account , there had been CARDINAL soldiers . The villagers also told her that there had been different types of soldiers ; the first group wore blue berets , while those in the second had none . She was further told that the soldiers had then gone to GPE \u2019s house to arrest him as well . The detainees were then taken away on foot . Although her mother and some other villagers tried to follow the group , they were told to turn back . The testimony of other villagers confirmed her mother 's story .", "CARDINAL . The witness explained that she had stayed in Dernek for DATE and then returned to ORG . DATE , when a minibus driver coming from PERSON told her that CARDINAL of the detained villagers had been released , she went back to Dernek .", "CARDINAL . In Dernek , she spoke to PERSON , released from custody that DATE . He told her that her brothers had been released DATE . PERSON also affirmed that they had been taken to the boarding school together and kept there blindfolded until TIME DATE . He recalled that first PERSON and then GPE had been taken away for interrogation . He told the witness that PERSON had been ill - treated and a statement had been taken from him . GPE did not mention what happened to GPE , though he told the witness that PERSON and GPE had been taken away . He did not know where they went but when he was given back his identity card , he got the impression that the CARDINAL brothers had already been released .", "CARDINAL . The witness submitted that apart from the CARDINAL villagers , a crippled man , also detained in the regional boarding school , had seen her brothers . A minibus driver , who drove this person to his house after his release , informed the applicant that there was someone who had seen her brothers in custody . Consequently , the witness went to see this man , who told her that he had been detained with CARDINAL brothers . The man said that CARDINAL of the brothers told him that he came from a village , which was not Dernek . He recalled that although he had not spoken to the other one , he had the chance to see both of them from beneath his blindfold . He described CARDINAL as a bit on the short side , plump and balding , and the second as very slim . The witness decided that the first description corresponded to GPE and the second to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover the witness learned from her mother that a certain GPE , also detained in FAC , told her mother that he and GPE had been chained together in prison for DATE . GPE had been more or less unconscious and had kept repeating the name of his daughter .", "CARDINAL . The witness further explained that DATE after the arrest of her brothers , her nephew PERSON , GPE 's son , had also been arrested . At that time she had been in the village . In TIME his mother put PERSON on a donkey and sent him to the fields . PERSON did not come back . TIME , they were contacted by a relative who claimed she saw PERSON being taken away by soldiers from the field along with CARDINAL other women . The witness recalled that the soldiers had passed through the village on DATE when PERSON was arrested .", "CARDINAL . The witness maintained that her mother had tried everything to locate her sons . She explained that she , herself , applied to ORG , where a lawyer prepared petitions for her . She took these petitions to ORG , who verbally replied that these people were not in custody . The petitions were not registered and nothing was written on them . However , she was given a paper and told to go to the security forces .", "CARDINAL . The witness was a non - commissioned senior gendarme sergeant . He was commander of the central gendarme station in ORG at the time of the events . He explained that in DATE , ORG was a very considerable ORG activity area , and the gendarmes from ORG paid frequent visits to the villages in and around the district . Military units , which came from time to time to ORG were lodged at the regional boarding school for a period of DATE . These units participated in operations with the gendarmes . However , they were under the command of their own unit commander , who generally held a higher rank than the district gendarmes commander . The witness explained that prior to an operation , the CARDINAL units studied maps of the area and shared out tasks . Before such a unit arrived or left the region , a written message was sent to all other units who had to ensure their security .", "CARDINAL . During operations all soldiers wore the same uniform for security reasons , including the commandos , who normally wore \u201c blue berets \u201d When gendarmes paid a visit to a village , they acted in accordance with the orders received . Sometimes they just talked to villagers to warn them not to support or help the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The witness stated that CARDINAL villages were within his jurisdiction . He dealt with their judicial and security problems , taking over the duties of the police . He recalled having gone to Dernek a couple of times , as it was his duty to visit the villages frequently . There were a few ORG supporters in that village and he had heard about PERSON . He explained that if GPE and PERSON had been taken into custody , their names would definitely appear in the custody records .", "CARDINAL . When soldiers planned to enter a village , the superior commander was immediately informed by a written message , which indicated the number of persons who would take part in the operation and the leader of the group . All messages were registered . They also kept a logbook , in which all incidents were recorded , if necessary , TIME . To verify whether soldiers had been to Dernek on DATE , it would suffice to check records , which would indicate exactly where the gendarmes had been on DATE . The soldiers lodged in the regional boarding school also kept records as they assisted gendarmes during operations .", "CARDINAL . The witness further submitted that the district gendarme headquarters had custody facilities for CARDINAL detainees . If there were more , they were put in an office under the supervision of a soldier . Detainees were initially kept in the offices and then placed in the detention area . At that stage , their names were not registered . Following the interrogation , if it was established that the detainee had committed an offence , he was transferred to ORG office . If not , he was released . The commando units did not have the authority to take people into custody . If they found a person who had committed an offence , they would hand this person over to the gendarmes .", "CARDINAL . There were no detention facilities at ORG . If an army unit , based at the boarding school , took part in an operation with the gendarmes and arrested a number of villagers , then it could be possible that these people were first brought to the regional boarding school before being referred to the gendarmerie .", "CARDINAL . If the military found people on the \u201c wanted \u201d list during an identity check , they had to inform the gendarmes by phone or radio who would then take over . When placed in detention , a person \u2019s name would be registered in a custody ledger book and he would be searched . Only after these steps , could he be placed in custody . Some detainees might be referred to the intelligence unit of the gendarmerie in ORG for further investigation .", "CARDINAL . The witness , who was a captain at the time of the incidents , was commander of ORG . He was based in ORG DATE and DATE .", "DATE . The witness , who knew ORG , had never actually entered it , though he had passed by frequently . Dernek was known to give considerable support to the ORG . He had not met PERSON personally although he had heard that the PERSON family had connections with the ORG . He recalled that PERSON was a name used by several families , not all of whom were ORG supporters . On the dates in question he had not taken part in an operation where suspected terrorists had been arrested or detained .", "CARDINAL . All military units , when engaged in an operation , sent a message or an operation information form / pro forma document indicating the time , place and purpose of the operation and the units that would be involved in it . This was conveyed to the superior officer . Such operations should be distinguished from the regular visits made by gendarmes to villages for administrative and judicial purposes . When the witness received information on terrorist presence in the area , he had to complete a pro forma message for his superiors . Whenever someone was taken into custody , be it during an ordinary visit or during an operation , soldiers had to inform their superior of this . Anyone taken into custody was registered in the ledger and the public prosecutor was subsequently notified .", "CARDINAL . Lice consisted of a settlement area involving CARDINAL villages divided into CARDINAL sections and each section was attached to a gendarme station . There were CARDINAL gendarme stations under the command of the witness , including the central gendarme station commanded by PERSON and to which Dernek was attached .", "CARDINAL . From time to time military units were based in the regional boarding school . In general , the gendarmes alone were responsible for security in rural areas . However , if the forces were insufficient to control a particular situation , reinforcements would be requested and infantry or ground forces deployed in the area . In joint operations , the most superior officer of the participating units would take command . Although the witness was independent in the execution of his administrative / judicial powers , he nevertheless had responsibility towards the Governor for his administrative acts and to the district public prosecutor for judicial ones .", "CARDINAL . The reinforcement units could never perform the gendarmes ' judicial duties . If these units went out on an operation in the mountain areas and found a suspect , they would wire the gendarmes to check whether the individual was wanted and , if so , then could bring him in . The reinforcement units had a totally different system of records and , as far as the witness knew , did not use service ledgers or custody records , given that they had no judicial functions to perform . During operations , the \u201c blue beret \u201d gendarme commanders removed their caps and wore normal army caps for camouflage .", "CARDINAL . The witness did not accept that anybody detained during a joint military and gendarme operation could be taken even temporarily to the regional boarding school . He explained the difference between taking a person into custody and putting him in a custody room . To render a suspect ineffective and perform a body search , the witness had the authority to keep the person near him , for example in the cafeteria under guard . That suspect might then be released within TIME . Such a person would not be put in a custody room and therefore would not be mentioned in a custody ledger . The witness said that this was \u201c taking somebody in for observation \u201d and not custody . The suspect \u2019s statement would be taken and , if guilty of an offence , he would be put in the custody room and mentioned in the ledger . If someone was clearly dangerous and required interrogation or was to be kept TIME , he would definitely be placed in the custody room and registered in the ledger . However , if somebody were to be sent straight to ORG for interrogation for terrorist offences , he might not be mentioned in the ORG records . As there was no interrogation unit in ORG , people were sent to ORG or sometimes an interrogation team was invited to come to ORG . Sometimes a person 's interrogation would reveal other names , in which case ORG might request their arrest and dispatch to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The witness further explained that he had not checked the records before coming to the hearing and did not remember exactly what he was doing on CARDINAL DATE . However , he had checked that he had not been in GPE on DATE . He could not recall anyone who had asked information about their relatives in detention . He had no comment on the fact that some people had disappeared in the Lice area in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The witness stated that he had been commander of ORG in DATE . His whole unit consisted of CARDINAL men . Mr PERSON was his district commander and PERSON , his station commander . His job was to secure an area . The administrative and judicial tasks were performed by other gendarmes . He had never seen commandos search or detain people or carry out identity checks . The \u201c blue berets \u201d of the commando units were not used in operations as they were too conspicuous .", "DATE . It was possible that commando units based in the regional boarding school be sent out on an operation . There was a unit of CARDINAL soldiers stationed at the regional boarding school to ensure security in the region , given the number of schools that had been burned down . ORG units did not keep separate written records or DATE service ledgers . They reported to the superior officer after completing their activities . If they had taken part in an operation , it would be indicated on the operation pro forma beforehand . However , the preparation of this form was not his task but that of the district gendarmes commander . His duty was training and exercise of his men . Anyone caught by his forces would be taken directly to the gendarmes headquarters . The district gendarmes had exclusive authority to detain people .", "CARDINAL . He knew the village of Dernek but had never actually gone into it . He had passed by . He had not participated in any operation in that village around DATE . It would be difficult to say which units had been involved in such an operation . If it was a major operation , then all the commando units in the area would have participated ; otherwise , it would have been just the local gendarmes .", "CARDINAL . The witness lived in Dernek . He knew GPE and PERSON , both fellow villagers . GPE was married and had QUANTITY children ; he lived in a house close to his mother \u2019s , near the mosque . He owned a taxi and was occasionally away from the village . PERSON was a bachelor and lived with his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL gendarmes came to the village on foot early in the morning . The villagers were already up for their TIME prayers . The witnesses could not recall whether the soldiers were commandos or gendarmes from ORG . He did not recognise any of the gendarmes or their commanders . He stated that , before DATE , when soldiers came to the village , they had gone straight to the mountains in search of terrorists . The villagers had not been disturbed .", "CARDINAL . The witness could not remember exactly on DATE they had been detained . He thought it might have been a DATE . On DATE of the operation , the soldiers ordered all the villagers to gather by the mosque . They took everyone \u2019s identity cards and compared the names with a list . The soldiers then returned most of the identity cards except for those of PERSON , GPE , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and himself . The rest of the villagers went home . The soldiers also searched the houses , and subsequently took the CARDINAL villagers directly to the regional boarding school on foot .", "CARDINAL . The witness said they were not blindfolded at first . They walked to the boarding school , which he knew well as his children had studied there . He confirmed that part of the building was used by the military . At the school they were blindfolded , but their personal belongings were not registered . Neither did they undergo a medical examination .", "CARDINAL . They were kept all together in the basement of the building near the toilet and washing area . Their hands were free but their eyes were blindfolded The witness asserted that he knew PERSON and ORG had been with him because they sat side by side and could talk quietly . At night they slept on chairs . They were given bread , biscuits and water .", "CARDINAL . During their detention no explanation was given as to the reason of their arrest . He was the only one to be interrogated . He was asked whether his son had joined the guerrillas in the mountains and he told the soldiers that his son was in GPE . Then he was asked about his son \u2019s precise address ; he told the soldiers that he did not know and was released . The soldiers only took his statement . He emphasised that no one had been ill - treated while they were in the boarding school .", "CARDINAL . The witness stated that they had stayed at the school for DATE . The soldiers released GPE and PERSON on DATE . He had heard someone say \" PERSON , PERSON , take your identity cards , you 're free \" . The others stayed TIME in the boarding school . On DATE the rest of the detainees were taken to the regiment on the border of ORG and released from there . The witness could not make out whether the soldiers were commandos or army regulars . A helicopter came and they were told that the villagers from Dernek were to go out . They were then told that they were free . The witness and the other detainees went to the ORG station DATE to get their identity cards back . The witness explained that the ORG gendarme station and the regiment were distinct organisms .", "CARDINAL . When the witness returned home , the villagers asked him about PERSON and GPE . He told them that PERSON and GPE had already been released . The witness stated that he never said to PERSON that either he or her sons had been ill - treated .", "CARDINAL . Tahsin had a son , called ORG . The witness had not been in the village at the time when PERSON disappeared .
