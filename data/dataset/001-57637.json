The judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG While he was serving his sentence , the applicant absconded on several occasions ; he remained at liberty a total of DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the Minister for ORG ordered his conditional release with effect from DATE", "This measure was however purely formal because the applicant had been placed in a psychiatric clinic on DATE . He absconded regularly from this establishment too . In its decision extending the confinement ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the court noted that , according to the director of the clinic , PERSON had spent , since his admission , DATE at the clinic and DATE outside .", "On DATE ORG - in accordance with an administrative practice not provided for by law - wrote to the Crown Prosecutors of GPE and of GPE , and to the director of the clinic , informing them that , unless extended , the applicant \u2019s placement would come to an end in DATE , on DATE and not DATE The applicant was , in the ORG \u2019s view , to be regarded as having been held at the Government \u2019s disposal during the periods which he had spent outside prison following his escapes . Neither Mr PERSON nor his counsel had any knowledge of this letter .", "On DATE informed ORG that she would be the applicant \u2019s lawyer in the proceedings relating to the extension of the confinement . It appeared from her letter that she expected the proceedings to open in DATE or DATE .", "On DATE the applicant escaped from the clinic once more . According to the authorities , he remained in hiding .", "CARDINAL .

ORG On DATE , following a hearing which was attended only by a member of the hospital staff and ORG , the court granted the request for an extension . According to the Government , ORG had instructed the police to serve on PERSON a summons to appear at this hearing , but they had not succeeded in contacting him .", "Mr PERSON was notified of the decision - which described him as having no known address - on DATE , when he telephoned the clinic . After having returned to it , he was held there from DATE in pursuance of the court \u2019s order .", "CARDINAL . ORG By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the order placing her client at the ORG \u2019s disposal would not be lifted in the immediate future .", "Having observed a significant improvement in his behaviour , the authorities released him provisionally in DATE . In DATE the ORG decided not to seek a second extension of the placement at the Government \u2019s disposal .", "CARDINAL . ORG Since DATE LAW ( PERSON ) has contained special provisions applying to persons suffering from a mental deficiency or mental illness . The provisions were substantially amended by an LAW of DATE , which came into force on DATE . According to LAW as applicable to the events in the present case ) , the perpetrator of an offence which can not be imputed to him because he suffers from a mental deficiency or mental illness is not liable to punishment . If the protection of public order so requires , the court may direct that such a person be placed at the ORG \u2019s disposal so that he can receive treatment at the ORG \u2019s expense .", "Such a measure may also be taken in conjunction with a criminal sanction if the convicted person \u2019s responsibility was merely diminished at the time of the offence ( LAW ( a ) ) .", "Under LAW ( b ) LAW , the placement lasts for DATE unless the Government terminates it earlier . This period commences as soon as the judgment ordering it has become final ( paragraph CARDINAL thereof ) ; it is suspended by any other deprivation of liberty resulting from a judicial decision ( paragraph CARDINAL , according to the most widely accepted interpretation ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The court which makes the initial order may extend the confinement , on each occasion for DATE ( Article CARDINAL ( b ) \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , on an application by the crown prosecutor , himself acting on the opinion of the director of the clinic . To this end , the crown prosecutor has to submit an application to the court in question not DATE and not less than one month before the placement period is due to expire ( Article CARDINAL ( f ) \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . According to case - law , failure to comply with this requirement renders the application inadmissible .", "The prosecutor must attach to his application a copy of the clinic \u2019s report on the physical and mental health of the person concerned together with a reasoned declaration - preferably by the doctor treating the patient - on the appropriateness of extending the confinement ( LAW ( f ) LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ( g ) governs the procedure to be followed for the examination of the application : if possible the court is to hear the person in question and , if it considers additional information to be necessary , interview witnesses and experts . The crown prosecutor and the lawyer of the person confined may attend any hearing , of which a record is drawn up .", "By a circular of DATE , the Minister for ORG issued instructions to the courts to hear the person concerned before extending his placement .", "CARDINAL . ORG By virtue of LAW ( h ) LAW , the court is to give its decision within DATE following the lodging of the application . However , LAW b ) \u00a7 CARDINAL states that the person concerned remains at the Government \u2019s disposal until the court has ruled on the extension . In a judgment of DATE ( PERSON ( GPE ) DATE , no CARDINAL ) , ORG ) took the view that the last - mentioned rule applied even if the court exceeded the DATE time - limit , which was merely of an exhortatory nature . While recognising how inconvenient this interpretation might be for the person concerned , the court noted that this did not mean that the latter was entirely without a remedy against such a breach :", "\" if , once the time - limit laid down in LAW ( h ) has expired , the decision provided for in that provision is arbitrarily delayed , the Government may find itself required , if necessary as a result of legal action by the person confined , to terminate the placement extended pursuant to LAW . \"", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) ORG ) gave the following clarification regarding the DATE decision : in itself , the failure to comply with the time - limit laid down in LAW ( h ) does not give rise to an obligation to terminate the placement ; the existence of such an obligation depends in particular on the extent to which , and the reasons for which , the time - limit is exceeded as well as the personal and social interests at stake .", "According to a judgment of ORG ) of DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , it falls to the court to decide to what extent it must state its reasons in the order extending the confinement , which is neither delivered in public nor appealable ( LAW ( h ) \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , but is served on the person concerned ( LAW ( h ) \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG A person placed at the Government \u2019s disposal may at any time request the Minister for Justice to revoke the measure . By virtue of LAW ) , the Minister may terminate the confinement at any moment , unconditionally or conditionally , if personal or material circumstances justify such a decision .", "In the above - mentioned extract from its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG was clearly alluding to interlocutory proceedings ( kort geding ) before the President of ORG . Thus it confirmed the fundamental role of these proceedings in the GPE legal system and practice . The importance of such a remedy in the specific field which is the subject of the present case is moreover illustrated by the CARDINAL judgments of ORG referred to in paragraph CARDINAL above . They were all delivered in interlocutory proceedings , CARDINAL of which resulted in the President of ORG ordering the immediate release of the person concerned . In addition , in the proceedings concluded by the judgment of DATE , the ORG had argued that the President lacked jurisdiction ; its objection was dismissed in accordance with a consistent line of cases decided in interlocutory proceedings and it did not appeal . The PERSON case also shows the extent to which the \" kort geding \" constitutes an obvious remedy in the field in question ( see the PERSON judgment given DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-B , pp . DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE ) .", "Furthermore the adversarial principle is , according to ORG decisions , one of the basic principles of GPE procedural law . At the time of the events in issue in the present case , ORG had already drawn striking inferences therefrom . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , it ruled admissible an appeal against an order extending the confinement of a \" mentally ill person \" , on the ground that it had been made without hearing the person concerned . It did so , having regard to the importance of the principle in question , in spite of the statutory rule restricting the right of appeal to persons heard at first instance . Similarly , by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , it declared admissible , notwithstanding the express provisions of the law , the appeal against a decision ordering the provisional hearing of witnesses , on the ground that the appellant had not been heard first ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-2", "5-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
