On DATE the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court , sitting as a court with CARDINAL professional and CARDINAL lay judges ( ORG ) under Presiding Judge PERSON , acquitted PERSON , a security officer at ORG , of a charge of raping PERSON , an asylum seeker from GPE , basing its ruling on the principle of in dubio pro reo .", "CARDINAL . The reasoning of the judgment contained the following passage :", "\u201c Lastly , the statement made by witness PERSON during her examination [ recorded on video tape in a separate room \u2013 kontradiktorische Einvernahme ] , to the effect that she had previously been engaged in prostitution in her country of origin , allows inferences to be drawn with regard to the statement by the accused [ P. ] that the witness might have become involved with him because she expected DATE for whatever reason \u2013 to gain some advantage . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In issue no . CARDINAL of Falter , an article was published on page CARDINAL concerning the criminal proceedings against P. , which read as follows :", "\u201c \u2018 Sex with a nigger woman\u2019", "The courts : An asylum seeker lodges a criminal complaint alleging rape against a security officer . The case takes on a political dimension because it exposes conditions in the Traiskirchen centre . DATE only the victim is still before the courts . The chronicling of a judicial scandal .", "PERSON", "She thought she had made it to safety . PERSON ( name changed , ed . ) had been ill - treated by police officers in GPE , kicked by them in the abdomen and placed with CARDINAL other women in \u2018 stinking , damp ORG for having demonstrated on behalf of her son , abducted by the authorities . She had survived her escape on a container ship , during which she \u2018 nearly went mad\u2019 because in mid - ocean she \u2018 no longer knew whether it was TIME or day outside\u2019 . Finally , after a lorry journey lasting DATE , she found herself in GPE , where all at once , she was \u2018 surrounded by white people\u2019 . She thought she was safe . Her case was so well documented that GPE , in the form of the normally very strict ORG , granted her asylum quickly and without red tape .", "But then this country revealed its other side . PERSON , DATE , a well - groomed businesswoman and mother of CARDINAL , holds on tight to her handbag during the interview and breaks down in tears repeatedly , says her life is a mess [ and that ] she can no longer trust the authorities here because they treat her like a liar and a prostitute .", "PERSON B. caused a media stir DATE when she became the first asylum seeker to lodge a complaint against a blind - drunk security officer who she claims abused his authority in the FAC centre in order to rape her . Now she faces trial for defamation . A few fellow NORP , as well as the campaigning lawyer PERSON and his colleague PERSON , are continuing to stand by her . \u2018 Otherwise I would have killed myself\u2019 , says PERSON .", "It \u2019s difficult to know where to begin in this case . With the then ORG Minister ORG who , while the proceedings were in progress , told ORG that the woman \u2019s accusations were \u2018 unfounded\u2019 ? With the company ORG , engaged by him , which ostensibly ran the centre on a much smaller budget than ORG , but in fact used subcontractors employing drunken nightwatchmen who had to be dismissed for sexual assault ? With centre director PERSON , who later commented on the attacks in the washrooms of the women \u2019s quarters by telling the court : \u2018 According to our information such incidents are very common and no one thinks anything of them\u2019 ? Or with Judge PERSON , who at the end of the drama would no longer \u2018 refute\u2019 the suggestion that PERSON was just a \u2018 prostitute\u2019 \u2013 although not even the accused security officer claimed that that was the case ?", "Spring DATE . With a thousand asylum seekers , PERSON is hopelessly overcrowded . CARDINAL arrive DATE . ORG is coming under political pressure and discredits ORG . Security officers at the centre later state in court that female asylum seekers could be paid for quick sex . They also tell of pimps rolling up to the centre in their cars . The sexual exploitation seems to have been unbearable . In a series of articles for profil , a female journalist published an email and statements from several women complaining of sexual assaults by security staff . \u2018 Please help us!\u2019 pleaded the women . ORG stated at the time that the police were confronted with a \u2018 wall of GPE .", "At that time PERSON from GPE demanded an interview with the head of the PERSON [ branch of the ] ORG . She placed a pair of torn red underpants on the interview room table and described \u2018 through her ORG how a drunken security officer had pursued her for DATE , pointing to his uniform and threatening to have her thrown out of the centre and to slit her throat . TIME he had crept into the room , switched on the light and told her to go with him . PERSON , who had not yet been granted asylum and feared his authority , wrapped a towel around herself and followed the uniformed officer into the office , where there was a bed and a roll of kitchen towel . He had prepared the kitchen towel for \u2018 ejaculating PERSON , as he later admitted . \u2018 At first I did n\u2019t realise what the man wanted . I thought I PERSON done something wrong . But there in that room I realised that he was going to rape GPE , stated PERSON could smell the drink on his breath and did n\u2019t dare cry out .", "The practising NORP from GPE is called upon to describe the incident many more times in the most intimate detail , without contradicting herself . She describes with precision how the man locked the door and removed the key . She tells of the pains in her lower abdomen afterwards and how she washed herself with warm water for DATE . She immediately identifies the security officer in a photo . The officials record in the minutes that PERSON appears disturbed .", "\u2018 We were in no doubt that it happened as she described it . The woman was intimidated and seemed very anxious\u2019 , recalls ORG PERSON , who investigated the case , DATE in court . His statement , like that of the victim , is disregarded .", "Disturbing errors occur . For the first interview in the interview room no trained interpreter can be found ; moreover , the traumatised woman is initially interviewed by a man . In TIME the police officers at times refer to PERSON not by her name but as \u2018 the nigger woman\u2019 . She is repeatedly linked to prostitution .", "ORG , DATE , is interviewed as the presumed perpetrator . When first questioned the trained bricklayer with the thick moustache states : \u2018 I did n\u2019t have sex with the nigger ORG The next time his recall is more accurate : \u2018 It \u2019s possible that I had intercourse with the nigger woman . I PERSON had CARDINAL and a QUANTITY of beer and QUANTITY of herb lemonade mixed with red wine.\u2019 He claims it was entirely consensual . However , he does n\u2019t recognise PERSON in a photo . Police officer : \u2018 Could the woman have left the room if she \u2019d wanted to?\u2019 Answer : \u2018 No , only I had a key\u2019 . Again the question : \u2018 Did you pay the nigger woman for sexual intercourse?\u2019 Answer : \u2018 No way!\u2019 Third [ interview ] record : \u2018 I \u2019d noticed the nigger woman DATE before we had sex . I fancied her from the beginning . I went into her room and gestured to her to come out.\u2019 According to him , she followed him out of her own accord , undressed in front of him , took hold of his penis , inserted it and then got dressed again . Then she disappeared for good DATE without making any demands . \u2018 Maybe she thought she PERSON be given asylum ORG speculates the security officer . Something else occurs to him . He had offered to buy the woman a drink in the bakery DATE before . She had stroked his back and \u2018 cosied up\u2019 to him .", "PERSON B. denies this version of events . She says that she had other things on her mind at the time . She is not a whore . She felt repelled by this fat man with a moustache who smelled of alcohol , she was afraid of him . Also : if she had really been hoping to be granted asylum , why would she then have defamed the security officer ?", "Next to take the witness stand are the employees of the bakery . The first to be examined is saleswoman PERSON : \u2018 She gave him a kiss . She was fairly young , I \u2019d say CARDINAL . The CARDINAL of them were talking quietly . I could n\u2019t describe the woman.\u2019 When confronted with PERSON says : \u2018 I \u2019m not quite sure whether it \u2019s her.\u2019 At the second confrontation DATE she suddenly says : \u2018 Yes , that \u2019s her!\u2019 She has something else to get off her chest : \u2018 I have to say that we \u2019re losing a lot of customers because of NORP . It \u2019s bad for business!\u2019 Likewise the second saleswoman . The first time she gives evidence : \u2018 I \u2019m not PERSON . The second time : \u2018 I \u2019m CARDINAL per cent certain.\u2019", "PERSON B. is DATE and speaks neither NORP nor LANGUAGE \u2013 only NORP . The quiet talk described could not have taken place . CARDINAL detail , however , is never mentioned : at the time , the bakery was delivering CARDINAL of bread rolls to the reception centre .", "ORG , which sees the NORP from ORG most often in connection with drug dealing , wants to discontinue the proceedings on the basis of the statements by the bakery employees . PERSON \u2019s lawyer , ORG , then brings a \u2018 subsidiary private GPE ( PERSON ) before ORG . The victim can take over the role of the public prosecutor at his or her own risk . The unexpected happens : ORG finds in the woman \u2019s favour and orders ORG to prosecute the security officer . \u2018 As the case file currently stands , both the factual element of the offence of rape and the element of coercion appear to be made out beyond PERSON , states the judgment . According to the court , the bakery employees could not have identified PERSON .", "The trial with judges and lay assessors before ORG does not last long . No evidence is taken either from other asylum seekers or from the female staff in DATE . Judge PERSON acquits the security officer . Of course , if she has doubts as to the defendant \u2019s guilt , she has to do so . But this judge and her lay assessors are in no doubt as to the woman \u2019s guilt . They have unfinished business with the NORP woman and attribute the basest intentions to her \u2013 without furnishing any proof . The reasoning is diametrically opposed to that of ORG : \u2018 It can not be established that the accused performed sexual intercourse against the will of PERSON And what of the statements of the bakery employees , called into question by ORG ? \u2018 Clear proof\u2019 that PERSON had also been lying about the sexual encounter . The fact that the bakery employees got her age wrong by DATE ? \u2018 The difficulty of correctly estimating the age of persons with a different skin colour is known to the courts.\u2019 And the constantly changing replies of the security officer ? \u2018 He is a very simple man\u2019 and it therefore spoke in his favour \u2018 that he himself admitted that intercourse with the witness was not easy to achieve.\u2019 The \u2018 black African\u2019 on the other hand , appeared \u2018 very confident\u2019 , with the result that \u2018 it is hard to imagine that she could have felt so intimidated by the accused , who appears somewhat unsure of himself , that she left her quarters against her will.\u2019 And what of the only piece of physical evidence , the torn red underpants ? \u2018 These have no evidentiary value\u2019 according to Judge PERSON Why not ? Because the accused said that the underpants had been \u2018 GPE .", "Not another word from the detectives who had been faced with a crying , completely intimidated woman . No mention of the fact that the security officer himself admitted locking PERSON in [ the room ] and removing the key . Not a single line about the predicament in which female asylum seekers found themselves at the time . Complete understanding , on the other hand , for the accused : \u2018 The accused \u2019s objection that the woman may have hoped , since her asylum claim had not been decided , to obtain NORP citizenship by marrying him , has not been completely PERSON . Even if this were true , why would she then lodge a complaint against him DATE ?", "The judgment fails to give rise to a scandal . \u2018 Flirtation in Traiskirchen\u2019 runs the title in the PERSON . Then , what women \u2019s shelters have been complaining of for years happens : the woman becomes the presumed perpetrator . With the approval of ORG Minister PERSON , the principal public prosecutor \u2019s office institutes preliminary proceedings for defamation . PERSON must appear before the investigating judge \u2018 or be brought by force\u2019 . She could face DATE in prison . \u2018 That \u2019s just routine , nothing ORG says a ORG spokesman . According to principal public prosecutor P. : \u2018 After [ the ] acquittal we have no choice but to initiate proceedings.\u2019", "Justice Minister PERSON has promised to do more to protect the victims of crime . She should study this case . She is the highest - ranking public prosecutor . She has the right to give instructions . She bears the political responsibility if this woman , in addition to everything else , faces charges . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , Judge PERSON brought an action for defamation against the applicant company under section CARDINAL of LAW and LAW , and requested that the applicant company be ordered to pay compensation and retract the following statements made in the article , which she claimed amounted to a statement that she had grossly misused her office as a judge :", "\u201c Judge PERSON alleges that the asylum seeker had immoral motives . \u201d", "Judge PERSON alleges in the judgment \u2013 without giving any reasons \u2013 that the asylum seeker was driven by the basest motives .", "\u201c Judge PERSON acquits the security officer . Of course , if she has doubts as to the defendant \u2019s guilt , she has to do so . But this judge and her lay assessors are in no doubt as to the woman \u2019s guilt . They have unfinished business with the NORP woman and attribute the basest intentions to her \u2013 without furnishing any proof . \u201d", "Judge PERSON had no doubt about the woman \u2019s guilt .", "The judge ignored relevant evidence and delivered a scandalous judgment ( \u201c The judgment fails to give rise to a scandal . \u201d )", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first hearing in the defamation proceedings was held . The applicant company argued that the impugned statements were true and sought to prove the truth of those statements by asking the court to call several witnesses and admit as evidence the files of the proceedings concerning PERSON \u2019s asylum request and the criminal proceedings against PERSON It considered that by publishing the impugned statements it had merely expressed criticism , protected by the freedom of speech , which had not concerned the acquittal itself but rather the way in which the victim of the crime had been treated in the written version of the judgment , which had neglected important evidence and had accused the victim , PERSON , of having been a prostitute .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant company sought the disqualification of Judge PERSON , the judge assigned to the media proceedings , for bias . It submitted that the lawyer representing the claimant , PERSON , had also represented PERSON in the past in court proceedings . As Judge PERSON had to decide on a case in which her previous lawyer was acting as representative of CARDINAL of the parties , there was reasonable doubt that she would not decide the case objectively . The president of ORG dismissed the motion on DATE and held that the issue raised by the applicant was not sufficient to give rise to doubt that Judge PERSON would not decide the case objectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a further hearing was held in the defamation proceedings . The hearing was adjourned in order to hear CARDINAL witnesses proposed by the applicant company . ORG refused to hear other witnesses proposed by the applicant company , as it considered that those persons could not make any statements relevant to the proceedings . The applicant company had sought to call NORP , who had been PERSON \u2019s lawyer in the criminal proceedings , in order to clarify the meaning of statements that PERSON had given during her examination as a witness which had been recorded on video in order to prevent her as the victim having to face the accused ( kontradiktorische Einvernahme ) . This request was refused by ORG on the grounds that the transcript of PERSON \u2019s examination had been included in the case file and therefore no additional witness was required .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held another hearing in the defamation proceedings in which it examined CARDINAL of the witnesses proposed by the applicant company . The third witness proposed did not appear . On DATE ORG found against the applicant company . It held that the impugned statements had constituted defamation under LAW and that PERSON was therefore entitled to compensation , which it set at MONEY ( ORG ) . It also ordered the applicant company to publish a summary of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the contents of the article had given a biased account of the taking of evidence at the trial of PERSON , taking the side of PERSON and characterising any statement of a witness which did not coincide with hers as lacking credibility . According to the article , the judge had acted arbitrarily and out of racist motives and had disregarded evidence produced , whereas the rape asserted by PERSON had been described as proven and the assessment of evidence by ORG as absurd . Such an account was not an objective critique of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . As regards the criminal proceedings against ORG , ORG observed that : ( a ) they had been discontinued by ORG ; and ( b ) upon a subsequent decision by ORG had been committed for trial ( PERSON in den LOC ) . Following CARDINAL hearings at which a total of CARDINAL witnesses had been heard , the tape recording of the questioning of the victim had been viewed in part by the court and a confrontation between CARDINAL witnesses and PERSON had taken place , the court had acquitted the accused .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court had found that it could not be excluded that the sexual intercourse which had taken place between PERSON and the accused had been consensual , in accordance with the version of events given by the accused and which had , to some extent , been corroborated by the statements of witnesses who had seen the accused and PERSON together in a coffee shop in town . PERSON \u2019s assertion that she had been the victim of an assault had not been excluded but because it contradicted the statements of witnesses it had been considered to be partially implausible . The accused had not therefore been acquitted because his innocence had been proven but rather on the basis of the principle of in dubio pro reo .", "CARDINAL . ORG also referred to one passage of the written judgment on which the article had put much emphasis , namely a reference to a statement by PERSON made in the course of her questioning as a witness to the effect that she had previously been engaged in prostitution in her country of origin , which the judgment stated had allowed inferences to be drawn with regard to the statement by the accused that the witness might have become involved with him because she expected DATE for whatever reason \u2013 to gain some advantage .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant company had not succeeded in proving the truth of the impugned statements . From the case file concerning the proceedings against PERSON and , in particular , the written version of the judgment it appeared that Judge PERSON had dealt with all the evidence taken and had assessed each item of evidence extensively . Therefore , it could not be established that Judge PERSON had made base insinuations ( \u00fcble DATE ) or disregarded evidence . The judgment had clearly indicated the court \u2019s reluctance to accept the version of events given by PERSON also . In addition , the indication of PERSON having been a prostitute in the past had been based on a statement from the questioning of that witness and had not been made up out of thin air . The relevant part of the transcript in question read as follows :", "< Original >", "\u201c PERSON : PERSON . Er sagt aus : \u201c i m FAC . CARDINAL gibt es Frauen die auf den PERSON gehen . \u201d PERSON was PERSON ?", "Zeugin : PERSON , ich nicht , nein .

CARDINAL there are women who walk the streets . \u201d Do you know anything about it ?", "Witness PERSON : No idea , not me , no . Since leaving my country I have n\u2019t dared it . \u201d", "An error in the translation of that statement could not be excluded , but that did not allow the conclusion that there had been no basis in the file for the above finding of Judge PERSON", "CARDINAL . The accusation that a judge , who was under the duty to act objectively and impartially , had without any factual basis and out of racist motives deliberately disregarded evidence in order to acquit an accused from the same country ( inl\u00e4ndischen ORG ) had to be qualified as defamation and there was hardly a more severe accusation which could be levied against a judge . The term scandal of justice was a value judgement , which , however , was based on assertions of fact which had been disproven in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Insofar as the applicant company had relied on LAW , ORG referred to the case of GPE and PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , and observed that the press had the right and the duty to impart information on matters of public interest , including questions concerning the functioning of the justice system , and to criticise any shortcomings found , but in doing so it had to be mindful of the special role of the judiciary in society . It was therefore necessary to protect public confidence in the judiciary against destructive attacks that were essentially unfounded . Taking these principles into account , the sharp critique of Judge PERSON in the impugned article , which had lacked any sufficient factual basis , had been excessive .", "CARDINAL . Taking the gravity of the attacks on the claimant \u2019s professional reputation , the broad public attention the article had received and the consequences it had had for the claimant , ORG found that the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation was appropriate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed on DATE against ORG judgment . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment .
