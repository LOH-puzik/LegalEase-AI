ORG held that the summons was in conformity with the relevant requirements under LAW ) and that , given the text and structure of the charges , there could be no misunderstanding that it concerned the commission of forgery in different factual forms .

After having weighed the applicant \u2019s interest in obtaining a determination of his case within a reasonable time against the interest of the prosecution , the court decided that it would accept the applicant \u2019s prosecution but that it would take this finding into consideration in the determination of the applicant \u2019s sentence .", "In the determination of the applicant \u2019s sentence , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s actions had deprived the community of an estimated amount of ORG . CARDINAL in taxes , this in a large part to the applicant \u2019s personal benefit , and that a prison sentence of DATE and payment of a fine of ORG . CARDINAL would be an appropriate sentence . However , on the basis of the finding that the proceedings against the applicant had exceeded a reasonable time , ORG decided to mitigate the prison sentence by rendering it conditional and to mitigate the fine by reducing it to ORG . CARDINAL .", "The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal in cassation was rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . The applicant \u2019s complaints about the rejection by ORG of his arguments in relation to the manner in which the charges against him had been phrased and the length of the proceedings were rejected by ORG under Article PERSON of LAW ( Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie ) as not prompting a determination of legal issues in the interests of legal unity and legal development .", "b.
