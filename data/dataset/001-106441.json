A children \u2019s services report of CARDINAL DATE related that the first applicant was failing to take the second applicant to children \u2019s services and that monitoring had become difficult since DATE .", "CARDINAL .

It held that the first applicant had accepted the GPE jurisdiction throughout all the proceedings and various decrees ; in effect this request had been made out of time .", "CARDINAL . On the merits of the pending case , the PERSON della PERSON found no reason to alter the current custody order . Joint custody had been opted for to protect the child from the unhappy situation in which the mother excluded the father from any decision - making . Joint custody and support from children \u2019s services allowed the creation of an educational programme for the parents to allow for the growth and well - being of the child . This was what the parents had to aim for during the current joint custody regime . Welcoming the appointment of ex parte experts / counsellors , it reiterated the need for supervision by children \u2019s services . Only upon further reports by children \u2019s services and experts would the tribunal be able to establish whether any modifications to the regime were necessary or whether schooling in GPE would be more appropriate .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the PERSON della PERSON requested children \u2019s services to draw up a report on the merits of schooling in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ensuing report of DATE considered that Mr X. was having difficulty seeing the child , as for a while the mother had unilaterally interrupted the father \u2019s visits ( for example , CARDINAL out of TIME stays with the father had not occurred and DATE visits had been missed ) , and that the mother was not cooperating with children \u2019s services . Consequently , the establishment of an educational programme had not been successful . It found on the one hand that the first applicant \u2019s anger towards the father was persistent and involved the child . On the other hand the father had shown consideration and put the needs of the child first . He sincerely loved his daughter and was cooperating with children \u2019s services . The father and the child had a warm and caring relationship , and the child felt comfortable and happy in his presence . It appeared however that the child might have fears of losing her loved ones , probably due to the various moves , which had also detached her from members of her extended family . The report therefore advised the grant of temporary sole custody to the father , with regular supervised visits by the mother , until this could be reversed . It concluded that schooling should be in accordance with the custody decision , as this would be favourable to the child \u2019s emotional stability , notwithstanding the unfortunate moves of house . It also advised psychotherapeutic and parental education support for the parents , together with further monitoring by children \u2019s services .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON della PERSON ordered that an extraordinary hearing of the parties ( comparizione delle parti ) be held on DATE . The order was notified on DATE .

On DATE the first applicant \u2019s representatives requested X. \u2019s lawyers to inform them where the child had been taken , the date of return , and arrangements as to the handing over of the child .

Thus , the first applicant \u2019s representatives informed children \u2019s services about what had happened and complained about the father \u2019s lawyers . In reply , PERSON lawyers explained that the child was on holiday with her father and that they did not know where they had gone . On DATE , the first applicant \u2019s lawyers requested that the hearing set for DATE be deferred due to the inability of her regular lawyer , who had dealt with the relevant experts , to attend the hearing for professional reasons . Mr X. \u2019s lawyers opposed this , however , it appears that no notification of this opposition took place .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the first applicant lodged written submissions , reiterating that in accordance with the decree of DATE the child had been placed with the mother for DATE . Complaining about Mr X. \u2019s actions and those of children \u2019s services , she requested the tribunal to restore the status quo ante .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the child was still missing , Mr X. \u2019s representatives requested that the minor be placed in GPE . They emphasised that the second applicant \u2019s presence outside GPE limited the GPE courts\u2019 power over the second applicant \u2019s rights abroad . The first applicant objected , maintaining that the child should return to PERSON . She further insisted that any missed paternal visits in DATE had not been malicious but had been the result of physical circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a substitute judge sat as the PERSON della PERSON . The first applicant , through her co - lawyer , referred to their request for a brief postponement in view of the absence of the habitual judge and her habitual co - lawyer , who was more aware of the case details . Moreover , there had been a lack of collaboration on the part of children \u2019s services and counsellors , her counsellors had not been summoned , and the child had been kidnapped by the father . Her request was refused without detailed reasons . The substitute judge considered it opportune to take a decision urgently . Consequently , the first applicant \u2019s co - lawyer withdrew from the case . A further request by the first applicant for a short suspension in order for another lawyer to be appointed was refused .", "CARDINAL . The case was therefore heard without representation for the first applicant . Mr X. was represented by his lawyers and enjoyed the assistance of a counsellor . After the cross - examination was over , the substitute judge delivered his decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . He found that , in view of the report by children \u2019s services of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , the child risked being denied the benefit of her father \u2019s presence , as the first applicant had prevented the father \u2019s visits and obstructed children \u2019s services\u2019 meetings . Any argumentation by the first applicant presented in her written pleadings had not been persuasive . Consequently , while upholding joint custody , it was ordered that the child live with her father in GPE and that she be transferred to the GPE nursery from DATE . The mother was entitled to supervised visits from DATE from CARDINAL to CARDINAL , or as children \u2019s services deemed opportune .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON della PERSON , acknowledging that there were no obstacles to acceding to the first applicant \u2019s request to spend DATE with her daughter at the father \u2019s house , requested the children \u2019s services to draw up a new calendar of visits . On DATE , following Mr X. \u2019s request for an authorisation ( \u201c nullaosta \u201d ) for the child \u2019s passport , the tribunal solicited the first applicant \u2019s agreement , noting that expatriation of the minor would in any case require the tribunal \u2019s authorisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE children \u2019s services submitted a report stating that the child frequently reiterated her wish to stay with the mother and was showing a certain reluctance to be with the father . The report concluded that persistent pressure by the mother may lead to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant submitted that the unavailability of the child for certain paternal visits while she was in the mother \u2019s care was for medical reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr X. requested the suspension of the time - limits for appeal , pending friendly settlement negotiations . On the same day children \u2019s services reported that mother - child visits should take place at the father \u2019s house . It proposed a new schedule of visits , which would eventually include an TIME stay . It also included visits with the maternal extended family .", "CARDINAL . The following day , Mr X. pointed out that the first applicant had not been favourable to the return of the second applicant to GPE . He alleged that she was in bad faith and reiterated that , according to LAW ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) , visits with a parent who had removed a child required special precautionary measures . On DATE children \u2019s services prepared a calendar of supervised visits up to DATE , the date of the entry into force of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an appeal was lodged against the interim order of CARDINAL DATE before the \u201c Giudice delle PERSON \u201d .

TIME , alternate DATE from TIME and alternate DATE from TIME , plus other visits by the extended family and in due course TIME stays by the mother .

She further submitted CARDINAL of the second applicant \u2019s passports to the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant appealed , complaining of procedural irregularities pertaining to the interim decree of DATE . In particular she alleged a breach of her right to defence , since she had not been represented . Unlike her , Mr X. had had the benefit of counsel . Moreover , there had not been adequate notification , and therefore the hearing had not been in accordance with the law . Furthermore , the substitute judge should have abstained , as he had decided another case between the same parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr X. cross - appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr X. , in his cross - appeal , lodged a request for sole custody and contended that the first applicant had breached her judicial obligations , having allegedly taken the child away , and had attempted to evade GPE jurisdiction . He emphasised that in view of GPE \u2019s delay in accepting GPE accession to LAW dated DATE , the latter had not yet entered into force between the CARDINAL states . In accordance with the treaty , transfer of the minor to GPE would be unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE first applicant submitted that she was having difficulty visiting her daughter due to TIME .
