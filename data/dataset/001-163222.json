The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , aged CARDINAL , was admitted to the Open Door children \u2019s crisis centre in GPE . Her placement was ordered as a protective measure under LAW by the Pleven municipal director of social assistance , at the request of the applicant \u2019s mother , who had claimed to be unable to look after her daughter .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE a criminal bench of ORG ( \u0420\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434 ) confirmed the applicant \u2019s placement and extended its validity for a further DATE . In its reasoning the court found that the conditions for the placement of a minor in a specialist institution were satisfied , namely that the child \u2019s parents were unable to provide her with adequate care and that she was living in a dangerous social environment , as she associated with \u201c men identified as delinquents \u201d . Lastly , it stated that no member of the applicant \u2019s family was able to take on responsibility for her upbringing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , finding that the conditions for the applicant \u2019s return to her family environment were not satisfied , the municipal director of social assistance ordered the extension of her placement in the centre . On DATE a civil bench of ORG in turn confirmed the measure and extended it for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local committee for combating juvenile antisocial behaviour ( \u201c the local committee \u201d ) asked ORG to order the applicant \u2019s placement in a correctional boarding school . On DATE a criminal bench of ORG held a hearing , following which it gave a decision imposing a less severe educational measure on the applicant , namely \u201c a ban on meeting and making contact with certain individuals \u201d . In its reasoning the court specified that placement in a correctional boarding school was liable to have a negative impact on the child \u2019s psychological and social development , given the \u201c unfavourable environment offered by that type of institution \u201d . It added that following the expiry of her placement in the Open Door centre , it would be appropriate to admit the applicant to another institution regulated by LAW in order to keep her away from the people who had forced her into prostitution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local committee sent ORG a new proposal for the applicant \u2019s admission to a correctional boarding school under LAW . It argued that the applicant did not have a favourable family environment and that , in particular , her father was serving a prison sentence and her mother had trouble assuming her parental responsibilities . This had caused the applicant to run away from home and develop a circle of friends including both adults and juveniles who were identified as \u201c delinquents \u201d and had allegedly incited her to engage in immoral conduct , such as the provision of \u201c sexual services \u201d . Lastly , the local committee noted that the applicant had also run away twice from the children \u2019s crisis centre and had behaved aggressively towards the staff .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal bench of ORG held a hearing . The applicant \u2019s mother was present , having been summoned to appear at the hearings , and asked to have a lawyer officially appointed to represent her daughter in the proceedings . The applicant also asked to have a lawyer appointed . The court granted their request . It heard evidence from the applicant , her officially appointed lawyer , a representative of the local committee , an inspector from the child protection team ( \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f ) , a representative of the district prosecutor \u2019s office , a representative of the municipal child protection department and CARDINAL social workers from the children \u2019s crisis centre where the applicant was living . The inspector from the child protection team stated that the applicant engaged in prostitution and had been found offering prostitution services on a motorway near GPE , QUANTITY from her home town . The CARDINAL social workers from the children \u2019s crisis centre pointed out that that factor had served as a ground for placing her in the centre as a protective measure for a child at risk . They added that after her admission to the centre , the child had remained in contact with the people who had incited her to engage in prostitution despite the steps that had been taken to protect her . In the social workers\u2019 opinion , the applicant \u2019s family environment was unsuitable for her . She came from a large family where the mother did not exert any parental control . The mother did not have a job and her partner drank and was violent towards her and her children . The mother had also stayed at the children \u2019s crisis centre with CARDINAL of her other children . After intensive psychological and social counselling , a positive development had been noted in the applicant and there were plans to find different accommodation arrangements for her . However , the social workers added that by the time of the hearing the applicant \u2019s situation had worsened as she did not follow the rules in place , came back late from school or was brought back by the police when she failed to return , and continued to associate with individuals known to the police , to engage in sexual relations and to behave aggressively towards the staff . She had attended a series of talks on prevention of \u201c lover boy\u201d-type human trafficking but had not been receptive to the protective measures recommended . The social workers expressed the opinion that the applicant faced a strong risk of being driven into prostitution and that the arrangements in place at the crisis centre did not afford her the necessary protection . In their view , such protection would only be provided in a secure centre with a restrictive regime . Lastly , the representative of the local committee stated that CARDINAL educational measures had already been imposed on the applicant , including strict monitoring by a supervisor , the ban on associating with certain individuals and the warning recommending placement in a correctional boarding school . He viewed those measures as insufficient .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court also obtained welfare reports . The applicant stated that she did not wish to be admitted to a correctional boarding school and preferred to remain in the children \u2019s crisis centre . The officially appointed lawyer called for the adoption of less severe educational measures . The representatives of the district prosecutor \u2019s office and of the municipal child protection department supported the proposal by the local committee . The representative of the municipal child protection department stated that during the hearing all the safeguards laid down in LAW had been observed . In his opinion , the possibilities for the child \u2019s upbringing in the crisis centre had been exhausted , the risk of her renewed involvement in human trafficking was very high and she was unaware of this . Accordingly , the measure of placement in a correctional boarding school was in fact in her interests .", "CARDINAL . Later on DATE ORG gave a judgment ordering the applicant \u2019s placement in the correctional boarding school in ORG ( \u201c the ORG school \u201d ) , a village QUANTITY away from LOC . In its reasoning the court held that despite the judicial decision of DATE in which a compromise solution had been adopted for the applicant , namely the confirmation and extension of her placement in the children \u2019s crisis centre , she was still failing to abide by the institution \u2019s internal rules , was not returning to the centre by the designated time after school , was in contact with individuals identified as \u201c delinquents \u201d and was still behaving rudely and aggressively towards the social workers at the centre . It noted that , in the absence of adequate parental control , the applicant had developed serious antisocial habits and that her placement in a children \u2019s crisis centre no longer had the intended educational and preventive effect on her behaviour . In the court \u2019s view , the applicant no longer displayed any willingness to abide by the rules of society , or even those of the institution in which she was living , and it was therefore advisable to remove her from her circle of acquaintances who were harming her personal development , and to provide her with enhanced educational support in order to eradicate her negative behavioural traits . The court noted that educational measures had already been imposed on her , but they had not produced a positive result . It concluded that the measure of admission to a correctional boarding school was necessary not only for her own benefit but in the interests of society .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , represented by her lawyer , appealed against that judgment . She challenged the measure imposed on her , arguing in particular that the court had not specified its duration , that her mother had not been given a hearing by the first - instance court and that she herself had not committed any criminal acts .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE a criminal bench of ORG upheld the first - instance court \u2019s decision . In its reasoning it held that the law did not oblige the court to hear evidence from the parents \u2013 in this instance the applicant \u2019s mother DATE and that the applicant \u2019s other complaints were unsubstantiated and ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant attempted to commit suicide and was admitted to the toxicology department of ORG . According to a medical certificate dated DATE , she had taken QUANTITY paracetamol tablets and QUANTITY NORP tablets and was in a fragile state . After her stomach was pumped , the effects of the intoxication were brought under control .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken to the ORG school . She was still there at the time of the most recent information submitted to the ORG , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Regarding life at the school , the applicant submitted in her application that the level of teaching was much lower than at her previous institution . In DATE prior to her application , CARDINAL pupils had obtained the secondary - school leaving certificate , and none at all in DATE or DATE . CARDINAL pupils had been awarded the certificate in DATE with an overall average mark of CARDINAL out of CARDINAL , the minimum pass mark being CARDINAL . The applicant added that in DATE and DATE the pedagogical council had not given any positive assessments of pupils\u2019 behaviour or school results , meaning that no proposals for the end of a placement had been submitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also asserted that she had continued to be threatened with forced prostitution by her former contacts after being admitted to the ORG school . On DATE she had attempted suicide for the second time , as part of a group with CARDINAL other girls , by ingesting chemical substances . She had then been taken to hospital for DATE . There had been other suicide attempts at the school .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted that her telephone conversations were monitored by a supervisor . For that purpose , a loudspeaker had been attached to the telephone and switched on during each conversation .", "CARDINAL . In addition , because of the significant number of violent incidents at correctional boarding schools , the prosecutor \u2019s office on DATE ordered an inspection of all secure educational institutions , including the ORG school . The results of the inspection are not known .", "CARDINAL . When submitting their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application , the ORG included a report dated DATE by the head of the ORG school about the applicant \u2019s situation . According to the report , during her previous placement in the Open Door centre , the applicant had been aggressive towards the staff , had encouraged other girls to engage in prostitution and had run away on CARDINAL occasions ( DATE ) . The report also stated that she had unashamedly admitted to having been sexually active since DATE and that she provided \u201c sexual services \u201d in return for payment .", "CARDINAL . The report mentioned , in addition , that the applicant did not have a favourable family background and that she was left unsupervised , which explained why she had previously run away and led a vagrant lifestyle .", "CARDINAL . According to the report , the ORG school offered an educational environment with experts qualified to work as teachers or supervisors in accordance with the requirements of ORG and ORG . The school curriculum and the courses followed in all specific subjects had been developed and approved in line with the ORG \u2019s standard procedures . The applicant had been deficient in many areas and the teachers had worked with her on a CARDINAL - to - CARDINAL basis as well as during lessons .", "CARDINAL . The file does not include a copy of the individual development plan that was supposed to have been drawn up at the time of the applicant \u2019s admission to the school and updated DATE . However , according to the report , the plan indicated that she was unaware of the risks she ran on account of her \u201c erratic sexual relations \u201d , that she did not question the consequences of such acts and that she was not ready to live independently . It added that she was na\u00efve , easy to manipulate , impulsive , emotionally fragile and prone to dishonesty .", "CARDINAL . The report went on to state that the individual plan as updated on CARDINAL DATE noted a positive change in the child \u2019s behaviour . Although she did not apply herself consistently , she had nevertheless shown some interest in schoolwork . The individual plan had recommended that she step up her efforts to acquire knowledge on an ongoing , in - depth basis .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report also noted that at the end of the DATE , the applicant had achieved an average mark of QUANTITY out of CARDINAL and had therefore moved up to the next class , that she had also been awarded a certificate as a qualified seamstress and that she would be receiving a similar mark for DATE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations , the report explained the applicable rules and stated that she had not been \u201c deprived of telephone contact with her mother \u201d or subjected to any restrictions on visits from her family , even though these had often taken place outside the times specified in the school \u2019s internal rules . In addition , the applicant had never received any letters or parcels from her family . She had gone on home leave CARDINAL times during DATE , from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , from DATE to DATE , from DATE to DATE , and from DATE to DATE . Each time , the applicant had returned late to the ORG school .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report also stated that according to information from the police , the child had been suspected of stealing a mobile phone and jewels from a house on DATE . On being questioned by the police , she had handed over the items in question of her own accord .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the report noted that the school \u2019s committee on preventing the risks of assault and harassment of juveniles had not received any information to suggest that the applicant had been \u201c sexually exploited \u201d within the school itself .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL reports issued in DATE and DATE by ORG for ORG include a summary of the findings of an assessment of the operation of the CARDINAL correctional boarding schools in GPE , including the CARDINAL in ORG . They indicate that these schools had a total capacity of CARDINAL places and that in DATE there were CARDINAL children attending them . There were CARDINAL girls at the ORG school , all of whom had been admitted under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The reports also note that there is a high pupil turnover rate during DATE because of the admission of juveniles on the basis of a placement order and because of their departure , in most cases on reaching the age of majority ( DATE ) or on the expiry of the statutory maximum duration of the placement . During DATE , CARDINAL children ran away from the schools and CARDINAL left them following a positive DATE assessment by the pedagogical council . During DATE , CARDINAL children had a positive assessment and were therefore able to leave the correctional boarding schools . During the DATE , there were no instances of children leaving the schools following a positive assessment . As regards the results achieved across all secure educational institutions in GPE , the reports indicate that in DATE , PERCENT of pupils were awarded a vocational qualification , PERCENT successfully completed their secondary education up to DATE PERCENT successfully completed their secondary education up to DATE . PERCENT of pupils failed to complete their education . The DATE report mentions a low success rate among pupils , with average marks of CARDINAL out of CARDINAL . According to the reports , these figures point to a problem as to the effectiveness of educational and rehabilitative measures , and even raise questions as to whether \u201c such measures exist in practice \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The reports further state that , in accordance with the applicable legislation , each correctional boarding school has a team responsible for educational and psychological assessment of pupils and a team of supervisors responsible for educational and rehabilitative support . The teams draw up DATE individual plans for pupils , which in most cases are set out in a standardised form . Objectives relating to learning , education and development are general in nature and do not include any specific activities tailored to the individual needs , abilities , age and interests of the children concerned . The DATE report is particularly critical of the prevalence of serious incidents involving suicide attempts or assaults on other pupils , and deplores the fact that no provision is made for follow - up action in the individual plans of the pupils concerned so that consideration can be given to the reasons for their actions and to their psychological state .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the reports note that the staff of the institutions concerned have undergone training covering matters such as alternative education methods for children in difficulty , development of their potential for autonomy and catering for individual needs . With regard to the ORG school in particular , the teaching and support staff are subject to external educational supervision . The reports nevertheless conclude that the number of people employed to run extracurricular activities is insufficient , although the children \u2019s wide - ranging needs and their vulnerability suggest that educational activities should be arranged in small groups . They also criticise the lack of any programme to foster closer relations between children and their families .", "CARDINAL . Two types of problems are highlighted . The first type concerns the school curriculum and the second concerns the programme for social integration and rehabilitation .", "CARDINAL . Regarding schoolwork , the reports note , among other things , that illiteracy levels are a cause for concern , particularly as children of a wide range of ages and abilities are grouped together in the same class . A large number of pupils are unable to read or write on their arrival at the schools , and the curricula taught do not allow them to redress their shortcomings and make progress . Furthermore , many children with behavioural difficulties also encounter problems at school and the development of their ability for effective learning and independent work is impaired . These children often run away , do not attend lessons regularly and have insufficient contact with adults .", "CARDINAL . As far as the programme for social integration and rehabilitation is concerned , the reports state that , in addition to staff shortages , the existing groups of CARDINAL or CARDINAL children in difficulty can not be effectively supervised , the activities on offer do not follow an appropriate methodology for vulnerable children , and no arrangements are made at the institutions to encourage contact between the children and their families , a shortcoming identified as a cause of aggressive behaviour .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the DATE report recommends in particular : ( a ) a general reform of the status of the institutions in question and of their operation , through the inclusion of alternative educational and preventive methods ; ( b ) the introduction and development of units for preventing deviant behaviour , and their involvement as soon as children display the first signs of such behaviour ; ( c ) shorter placements , with more emphasis on social rehabilitation and psychological support for children than on teaching ; ( d ) returning the children in question to the ordinary school system , including in schools in their home area , rather than keeping them apart in specialist institutions , through an intensive individual integration scheme managed by teams of educational experts ; ( e ) the introduction of programmes allowing young people to acquire vocational skills ; ( f ) instilling an atmosphere of cooperation with families ; ( g ) a reform whereby local committees for combating juvenile antisocial behaviour would no longer have a decisive role in taking educational measures and such decisions would be taken by a specialist judge alone ; ( h ) abolition of punishments for juvenile antisocial behaviour ; ( i ) abolition of criminal penalties for children DATE and their replacement by exclusively social and protective measures , applicable only in exceptional cases ; ( j ) admitting children DATE to specialist institutions only where there is a social need or a need for protection ; and ( k ) closure of the institutions in question , subject to the introduction of alternative protective and judicial measures in legislation and practice .", "CARDINAL . It appears that , following the DATE report by ORG , ORG and ORG undertook to reform the secure institutions for juveniles in order to ensure that the system was entirely focused on the child and offered an individually tailored approach . Measures were subsequently put forward in an action plan for the implementation of the national policy strategy on juvenile justice for DATE . Among the measures envisaged were : the repeal of ORG and the introduction of a new LAW for children in conflict with the law , with the aim of offering a wide range of social , educational and learning services to children in difficulty .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4", "8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-d"]}
