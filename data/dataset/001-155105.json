The applicant company is the owner of ORG , an Internet news portal that published up to CARDINAL news articles a day at the time of the lodging of the application .

Below these fields there were buttons labelled \u201c publish the comment \u201d and \u201c read comments \u201d . The part for reading comments left by others was a separate area which could be accessed by clicking on the \u201c read comments \u201d button . The comments were uploaded automatically and were , as such , not edited or moderated by the applicant company . The articles received CARDINAL ORG comments daily , the majority posted under pseudonyms .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , there was a system of notice - and - take - down in place : any reader could mark a comment as leim ( an NORP word for an insulting or mocking message or a message inciting hatred on the Internet ) and the comment was removed expeditiously . Furthermore , there was a system of automatic deletion of comments that included certain stems of obscene words . In addition , a victim of a defamatory comment could directly notify the applicant company , in which case the comment was removed immediately .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company had made efforts to advise users that the comments did not reflect its own opinion and that the authors of comments were responsible for their content .

Delfi was named as a source of brutal and arrogant mockery . The addressees of the public letter responded to it in DATE edition of ORG . The Minister of ORG emphasised that the insulted persons had the right to defend their honour and reputation in court by bringing a suit against Delfi and claiming damages . ORG referred to the legal grounds which made threats , incitement to social hatred , and sexual abuse of minors punishable under criminal law , and noted that liability for defamation and insults was dealt with under civil procedure .

By a judgment of DATE L. \u2019s claim was dismissed . ORG found that the applicant company \u2019s liability was excluded under LAW ( NORP teenuse seadus ) , which was based on ORG ( Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of ORG and of ORG on certain legal aspects of information society services , in particular electronic commerce , in FAC ) . The court considered that the comment environment in the applicant company \u2019s news portal was to be distinguished from the portal \u2019s journalistic area . The administration of the former by the applicant company was essentially of a mechanical and passive nature . The applicant company could not be considered the publisher of the comments , nor did it have any obligation to monitor them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed an appeal by L. It considered that ORG had erred in finding that the applicant company \u2019s liability was excluded under LAW .

On DATE ORG declined to hear an appeal by the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having re - examined the case , found for L. In accordance with ORG instructions , it relied on LAW and deemed LAW inapplicable . It observed that the applicant company had placed a note on its Internet site to the effect that comments were not edited , that the posting of comments that were contrary to good practice was prohibited , and that the applicant company reserved the right to remove such comments . A system was put in place whereby users could notify the applicant company of any inappropriate comments . However , ORG considered that this was insufficient and did not allow adequate protection for the personality rights of others . The court found that the applicant company itself was to be considered the publisher of the comments , and it could not avoid responsibility by publishing a disclaimer stating that it was not liable for the content of the comments .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the news article itself published in the Delfi news portal was a balanced one . A number of comments , however , were vulgar in form ; they were humiliating and defamatory and impaired PERSON \u2019s honour , dignity and reputation . The comments went beyond justified criticism and amounted to simple insults . The court concluded that freedom of expression did not extend to protection of the comments concerned and that PERSON \u2019s personality rights had been violated . PERSON was awarded EEK MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . It emphasised that the applicant company had not been required to exercise prior control over comments posted on its news portal . However , having chosen not to do so , it should have created some other effective system which would have ensured rapid removal of unlawful comments from the portal . ORG considered that the measures taken by the applicant company were insufficient and that it was contrary to the principle of good faith to place the burden of monitoring the comments on their potential victims .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s argument that its liability was excluded under ORG . It noted that the applicant company was not a technical intermediary in respect of the comments , and that its activity was not of a merely technical , automatic and passive nature ; instead , it invited users to add comments . Thus , the applicant company was a provider of content services rather than of technical services .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant company . It upheld ORG judgment in substance , but partly modified its reasoning .", "CARDINAL . ORG held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG finds that the allegations set out in the appeal do not serve as a basis for reversing the judgment of ORG . The conclusion reached in ORG \u2019s judgment is correct , but the legal reasoning of the judgment must be amended and supplemented on the basis of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The parties do not dispute the following circumstances :", "\u2022 on DATE the defendant \u2019s Internet portal \u2018 GPE published an article entitled \u2018 SLK Destroyed Planned Ice Road\u2019 ;", "\u2022 the defendant provided visitors to the Internet portal with the opportunity to comment on articles ;", "\u2022 of the comments published [ avaldatud ] on the aforementioned article , CARDINAL have contents that are derogatory towards the plaintiff [ L. ] ;", "\u2022 the defendant removed the derogatory comments after the plaintiff \u2019s letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legal dispute between the parties relates to whether the defendant as an entrepreneur is the publisher within the meaning of LAW , whether what was published ( the contents of comments ) is unlawful , and whether the defendant is liable for the publication of comments with unlawful contents .", "CARDINAL . The ORG agrees with the conclusion of ORG that the defendant does not fall within the circumstances precluding liability as specified in section CARDINAL of the ISSA [ Information LAW ] .", "According to section DATE ) of LAW , an information society service is a service specified in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON . According to the provision of the PERSON referred to , \u2018 information society services\u2019 are services provided in the form of economic or professional activities at the direct request of a recipient of the services , without the parties being simultaneously present at the same location , and such services involve the processing , storage or transmission of data by electronic means intended for the digital processing and storage of data . Hence , important conditions for the provision of information society services are that the services are provided without the physical presence of the parties , the data are transmitted by electronic means , and the service is provided for a fee on the basis of a request by the user of the service .", "Sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the PERSON establish the liability of providers of different information society services . Section CARDINAL of the PERSON states that where a service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service , the service provider is not liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service , on condition that : ( CARDINAL ) the provider does not have actual knowledge of the contents of the information and , as regards claims for damages , is not aware of any facts or circumstances indicating any illegal activity or information ; ( CARDINAL ) the provider , upon having knowledge or becoming aware of the aforementioned facts , acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information . Hence , the provision in question is applied in the event that the service provided consists in storing data on [ the service provider \u2019s ] server and enabling users to have access to these data . Subject to the conditions specified in LAW , the provider of such a service is exempted from liability for the contents of information stored by it , because the provider of the service merely fulfils the role of an intermediary within the meaning of the provision referred to , and does not initiate or modify the information .", "Since ORG is based on Directive CARDINAL of ORG and of the ORG on certain legal aspects of information society services , in particular electronic commerce , in ORG ( Directive on Electronic Commerce ) , the principles and objectives of that Directive must also be taken into account in the interpretation of the provisions of the LAW in question . Articles CARDINAL of the Directive , which form the basis for sections CARDINAL of the PERSON , are complemented by recital CARDINAL of the preamble to the Directive . According to this recital , the exemptions from liability established in ORG CARDINAL cover only cases where the activity of the information society service provider is limited to the technical process of operating and giving access to a communication network over which information made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored , for the sole purpose of making the transmission more efficient ; this activity is of a mere technical , automatic and passive nature , which implies that the information society service provider has neither knowledge of nor control over the information which is transmitted or stored . Hence , the providers of so - called \u2018 content services\u2019 who have control over the contents of the information stored can not rely on the exemptions specified in ORG CARDINAL of the Directive .", "The ORG shares the opinion of ORG that the activities of the defendant in publishing the comments are not merely of a technical , automatic and passive nature . The objective of the defendant is not merely the provision of an intermediary service . The defendant has integrated the comment environment into its news portal , inviting visitors to the website to complement the news with their own judgments [ hinnangud ] and opinions ( comments ) . In the comment environment , the defendant actively calls for comments on the news items appearing on the portal . The number of visits to the defendant \u2019s portal depends on the number of comments ; the revenue earned from advertisements published on the portal , in turn , depends on the [ number of visits ] . Thus , the defendant has an economic interest in the posting of comments . The fact that the defendant is not the writer of the comments does not mean that the defendant has no control over the comment environment . The defendant enacts the rules for the comment environment and makes changes to it ( removes a comment ) if those rules are breached . By contrast , a user of the defendant \u2019s service can not change or delete a comment he or she has posted . He or she can only report an inappropriate comment . Thus , the defendant can determine which of the comments added will be published and which will not be published . The fact that the defendant does not make use of this possibility does not prompt the conclusion that the publishing of comments is not under the defendant \u2019s control . The ORG agrees with the opinion of ORG that the defendant , which governs the information stored in the comment environment , provides a content service , for which reason the circumstances precluding liability , as specified in section CARDINAL of the PERSON , do not apply in the present case .", "CARDINAL . There is no legal dispute over the fact that the defendant is the publisher of an article entitled \u2018 SLK Destroyed Planned Ice Road\u2019 , published on the Delfi Internet portal on DATE . ORG found that the defendant too must be regarded as the publisher of the comments . ORG , agreeing with that opinion , noted that the fact that the defendant relied on a violation of its right to freedom of expression showed that it considered itself \u2013 and not the writers of the comments \u2013 to be the publisher of the comments . In the opinion of the ORG , in the present case both the defendant and the writers of the comments are the publishers of the comments within the meaning of LAW . The plaintiff has the right to choose against whom to bring the suit . The suit has only been brought against the defendant .", "The ORG has explained the definitions of disclosure and discloser in paragraph CARDINAL of its judgment of DATE in civil case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL , finding that for the purposes of LAW , disclosure [ avaldamine ] means communication of information to third parties and the discloser is a person who communicates the information to third parties . In addition , the ORG explained that in the case of publication [ avaldamine ] of information in the media , the discloser / publisher [ avaldaja ] can be a media company as well as the person who transmitted the information to the media publication . Publishing of news and comments on an Internet portal is also a journalistic activity [ ajakirjanduslik tegevus ] . At the same time , because of the nature of Internet media [ internetiajakirjandus ] , it can not reasonably be required of a portal operator to edit comments before publishing them in the same manner as applies for a printed media publication [ tr\u00fckiajakirjanduse v\u00e4ljaanne ] . While the publisher [ v\u00e4ljaandja ] [ of a printed media publication ] is , through editing , the initiator of the publication of a comment , on the Internet portal the initiator of publication is the writer of the comment , who makes it accessible to the general public through the portal . Therefore , the portal operator is not the person to whom information is disclosed . Because of [ their ] economic interest in the publication of comments , both a publisher [ v\u00e4ljaandja ] of printed media and an Internet portal operator are publishers / disclosers [ avaldajad ] as entrepreneurs .", "In cases concerning a value judgment [ v\u00e4\u00e4rtushinnang ] that prejudices and denigrates a person \u2019s honour and good name , in determining the definition of publication / disclosure and publisher / discloser it is irrelevant whether the value judgment is derived from the published / disclosed information or is derogatory because of its substantive meaning ... Hence , publication / disclosure is communication to third parties of a value judgment on a person ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) and/or of information which allows a value judgment to be made , and a publisher / discloser is a person who communicates such judgments [ hinnangud ] and information to third parties . In the present case the comments have been made accessible to an unlimited number of persons ( the general public ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to the allegations in the defendant \u2019s appeal to the effect that ORG wrongly applied LAW since , in justifying the interference with freedom of expression , it relied on the principle of good faith , and not the law , and that the removal of a comment from the portal is an interference with the freedom of expression of the person posting the comment , the ORG explains the following .", "The exercise of any fundamental right is restricted by LAW , which provides that everyone must honour and consider the rights and freedoms of others , and must observe the law in exercising his or her rights and freedoms and in fulfilling his or her duties . The first sentence of the first paragraph of LAW provides for everyone \u2019s right to freedom of expression , that is , the right to disseminate information of any content in any manner . That right is restricted by the prohibition on injuring a person \u2019s honour and good name , as laid down in LAW ( Article CARDINAL ) . The ORG is of the opinion that in handling the conflict between freedom of expression on the one hand , and honour and good name on the other , regard must be had to the fact that LAW , which is formulated as a prohibition , does not completely preclude any interference with a person \u2019s honour and good name , but only prohibits defamation thereof ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . In other words , disregarding the aforementioned prohibition would not be in conformity with LAW ( LAW ) . The second sentence of the first paragraph of LAW includes the possibility of restricting the freedom of expression by law in order to protect a person \u2019s honour and good name .", "In the interests of the protection of a person \u2019s honour and good name , the following provisions of LAW may be regarded as restricting the freedom of expression : sections CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ) , ORG ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , GPE ) and ( CARDINAL ) , and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . ORG found that injuring the plaintiff \u2019s honour was not justified ; it was therefore unlawful as there was no discussion of the topic in the comments but the plaintiff was simply insulted in order to degrade him . ORG also agreed with that opinion . The ORG finds that if section CARDINAL of LAW is interpreted in conformity with the LAW , injuring a person \u2019s honour is unlawful . The legal assessment by the courts of the CARDINAL comments of a derogatory nature is substantiated . The courts have correctly found that those comments are defamatory since they are of a vulgar nature , degrade human dignity and contain threats .", "The ORG does not agree with the opinion of ORG that the removal of comments of an unlawful nature interfering with the personality rights of the plaintiff is not an interference with the freedom of expression of the writers of the comments . The ORG considers that the application of any measure restricting a fundamental right in any manner may be regarded as an interference with the exercise of that fundamental right . Interference by an Internet portal operator with the freedom of expression of persons posting comments is , however , justified by the obligation of the portal operator - entrepreneur to respect the honour and good name of third parties , as arising from LAW ) , and to avoid causing them harm ( section CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the judgment of ORG , the contents of the comments were unlawful ; they were linguistically inappropriate . Value judgments ... are inappropriate if it is obvious to a sensible reader that their meaning is vulgar and intended to degrade human dignity and ridicule a person . The comments did not contain any information which would have required excessive verification on the initiative of the portal operator . Hence , the defendant \u2019s allegation that it was not and should not have been aware of the unlawfulness of the comments is groundless .", "On account of the obligation arising from law to avoid causing harm , the defendant should have prevented the publication of comments with clearly unlawful contents . The defendant did not do so . In accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , the disclosure of information or other matters is not deemed to be unlawful if the person who discloses the information or other matters or the person to whom such matters are disclosed has a legitimate interest in the disclosure , and if the person who discloses the information has verified the information or other matters with a thoroughness which corresponds to the gravity of the potential violation . The publication of linguistically inappropriate value judgments injuring another person \u2019s honour can not be justified by relying on the circumstances specified in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW : such judgments are not derived from any information disclosed but are created and published for the purpose of damaging the honour and good name of the party concerned . Hence , the publication of comments of a clearly unlawful nature was also unlawful . After the disclosure , the defendant failed to remove the comments \u2013 the unlawful content of which it should have been aware of DATE from the portal on its own initiative . In such circumstances , the courts have reasonably found that the defendant \u2019s inactivity is unlawful . The defendant is liable for the damage caused to the plaintiff , since the courts have established that the defendant has not proved the absence of culpability [ s\u00fc\u00fc ] ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
