Even though the applicant did not leave NORP territory voluntarily on that occasion , he ceased to be normally resident in GPE within the meaning of section CARDINAL of the above - mentioned GPE . He subsequently returned to GPE and stayed there unlawfully . The fact that he then applied for a residence permit and the assertion that he had received no explicit reply to an application for a residence permit he had made in DATE have no bearing on the fact that he remained in NORP territory unlawfully . It follows that the submission based on a breach of the provisions of the second paragraph of LAW of the LAW fails on factual grounds .", "The submission based on manifest error :", "It does not appear from the documents in the file that the aliens deportation board provided for in LAW or the Minister of the ORG failed to examine all the evidence relating to the applicant \u2019s conduct and the various aspects of his situation in order to determine whether , after he had committed a number of criminal offences and been sentenced both in GPE and in GPE to several terms of imprisonment , his presence in NORP territory , at a time when he was living there unlawfully , constituted a serious threat to public order . Although PERSON Driss PERSON asserts that he completed his studies in GPE , that he has a steady job there and pays rent , that some of his brothers and sisters have acquired NORP nationality , that he has committed no further offences since serving the sentences mentioned above , that he is perfectly integrated into NORP society and that he has not maintained any links with GPE , those facts are not sufficient to establish that the Minister of the ORG made a manifest error .", "The submission based on LAW :", "\u2026", "In support of his arguments to the effect that the impugned decision constituted such a serious interference in his family life as to exceed what was necessary to preserve public order , PERSON Driss PERSON asserts that he no longer has any family ties with the country whose nationality he possesses , that he does not speak its language and has not lived there since DATE , that his whole family lives in GPE and that his youngest brothers and sisters have acquired NORP nationality . However , it appears from the documents in the file that the impugned decision , which was based on defence of public order , was necessary , in view of the applicant \u2019s conduct and the seriousness of the offences he had committed , for the defence of that order .

Thus , aliens are not informed in advance that their deportation is being considered , do not receive any special notification , are not given an opportunity to make representations and do not appear before the board ; the board does not hold a meeting , not even in the alien \u2019s absence . No formal steps have to be taken before the deportation order is issued and the order does not have to contain reasons .", "CARDINAL . The condition relating to absolute necessity for the security of the ORG or public safety was introduced by the PERSON of DATE . It was replaced in the PERSON of DATE by a requirement of \u201c a particularly serious threat to public safety \u201d , but was reintroduced in the PERSON of DATE . In practice section CARDINAL also covers cases concerning violent and anti - social behaviour by an alien over a long period since DATE ( ORG d\u2019Etat , DATE , ORG , Recueil des arr\u00eats du ORG d\u2019Etat ( \u201c Rec . \u201d ) p.

To the extreme urgency requirement , laid down as DATE , a requirement of \u201c absolute necessity for the security of the ORG and public safety \u201d was added in DATE . Extreme urgency is in practice relied on to ensure that aliens who have been convicted by the criminal courts and are serving their sentence can be deported as soon as they are released . Its substance is assessed on a case - by - case basis by the Minister , subject to review by the administrative courts .", "For a long time the PERSON d\u2019Etat ruled that the question whether there was any urgency itself came within the unfettered discretion of the Minister . From DATE it interpreted the requirement so as to limit its application solely to cases where the deportation was to take place within a very short time ( PERSON d\u2019Etat , DATE , PERSON . p. CARDINAL ) . It later found that the urgency requirement had been satisfied where the alien was due to be released shortly ( PERSON d\u2019Etat , CARDINAL DATE , ORG v. PERSON , ORG . p. CARDINAL ) , then held that it was lawful to use the procedure against an alien who had been released from prison DATE before the deportation order was made ( ORG d\u2019Etat , CARDINAL DATE , ORG . , tables , p. CARDINAL , and DATE , PERSON , GPE DATE ) , or who had obtained early release DATE before the issue of a deportation order ( PERSON d\u2019Etat , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , application no . CARDINAL , ORG administratif , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . It also accepted that the Minister could use the extreme urgency procedure where , in connection with a deportation initially commenced under the ordinary procedure , the board had expressed an opinion against deportation . The PERSON d\u2019Etat held that practice to be lawful \u201c provided that the requirements of section CARDINAL were satisfied at the time the order was made \u201d ( Conseil d\u2019Etat , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , ORG . p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A deportation order issued by the Minister of the ORG remains in force indefinitely . Since DATE such orders embody authority to execute and may be enforced without further order , using force if necessary .", "CARDINAL . NORP In general , deportation is carried out without delay ; however , the effects of the deportation order are not exhausted as a result of its execution .", "Thus , deported aliens are precluded from returning to NORP territory for so long as the order has not been rescinded . If they do return , they are liable to the penalties applicable to cases of avoiding or attempting to avoid the execution of a deportation order and returning to GPE without leave to enter .", "Furthermore , according to a circular issued by the Minister of the ORG on DATE concerning the application of LAW August and DATE , although the celebration of the marriage of an alien on NORP territory is not subject to any condition regarding the lawfulness of his stay , a prefect who is informed that the alien wishing to get married is in breach of the immigration rules may , before the wedding , make an order for his removal under section CARDINAL of the Ordinance of DATE and , after the ceremony , decide to expel him pursuant to that provision . The ORG d\u2019Etat has held that an order for removal could lawfully be made against an alien who was about to marry a NORP national ( PERSON d\u2019Etat , ORG , CARDINAL DATE , ORG , application no . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . As deportation orders are not subject to any special rules , an application for judicial review may be made to the administrative court having territorial jurisdiction under the ordinary rules . Such applications have no suspensive effect and may therefore be accompanied by an application for a stay of execution even where the order has been enforced and the alien is outside GPE .", "On DATE ( application no . DATE ) , the ORG d\u2019Etat set aside a deportation order made against an NORP who was born in GPE and had always lived there , on the grounds that :", "\u201c ... his close relatives live in GPE", "CARDINAL . The alien concerned may , at any time , and as often as he chooses , apply for the deportation order to be rescinded .", "Where the application is submitted DATE after the final execution of the deportation order \u201d , the Minister of the ORG is not subject to any specific procedural requirements in reaching his decision . If the application is submitted \u201c after a period of DATE ... , it may be rejected only after the opinion of the deportation board for the d\u00e9partement has been sought ; the alien may be represented before the board \u201d . Consultation is required even where the deportation order was made under the procedure for cases of extreme urgency . Since the PERSON of DATE came into force , the board \u2019s opinion is no longer binding on the Minister .", "The PERSON d\u2019Etat had considered that a deportation order was executed on the date the alien left NORP territory and that , in consequence , even if he subsequently returned to GPE illegally , DATE period ran from DATE ( ORG d\u2019Etat , CARDINAL DATE , ORG . p. CARDINAL ) . However , section CARDINAL bis , added to the Ordinance of DATE by the Law of DATE , now prevents a deportation order being rescinded if the alien has not left GPE or if he has returned there illegally : \u201c An application ... for the rescission of a deportation order ... submitted after the expiry of the time - limit for making an application for judicial review can not be granted unless the foreign national resides outside GPE . \u201d", "An application to which there has been no response within DATE is deemed to have been rejected by the Minister of the ORG . Where the Minister of the ORG decides not to enforce a deportation order whilst at the same time refusing to rescind it , a compulsory residence order is made against the alien . If the alien continues to disturb public order , he may be deported . That constitutes a new decision , separable from the deportation order and in respect of which an application for judicial review may be made to the administrative court . In considering the application , the court examines the conduct of the alien during the period when his presence in GPE was tolerated . In reviewing the lawfulness of the measure the court therefore examines the position at the date of its judgment . However , a ground of appeal on the basis that the alien had mended his ways after the date of the order is ineffective ( ORG d\u2019Etat , CARDINAL DATE , ORG . p. CARDINAL ) .", "The fact that a deportation order has been rescinded does not constitute leave to enter . If leave is sought , it may lawfully be refused .", "CARDINAL .
