CYPRUS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen and sole heir and administrator of the estate of the late PERSON . She is represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "According to the applicant , PERSON and his siblings , plaintiffs in action No . CARDINAL in ORG , became the registered owners of CARDINAL properties situated at GPE in the village of GPE , after a local enquiry of ORG for the purpose of widening a street , and after the death of the GPE mother , PERSON , on CARDINAL SeptemberCARDINAL .", "Before that date the properties had been registered in the name of PERSON who had inherited it from his sister , PERSON , to whom the properties had been donated by their parents .", "In DATE a certain PERSON filed action No . CARDINAL in the GPE ORG claiming that she and her husband , PERSON , were the owners of the properties by purchase and/or by long uninterrupted adverse possession .", "On DATE the court made an order for a substituted service of the writ of summons on PERSON by publication of the writ in the newspaper the \u201c FAC \u201d , by posting a copy of the writ at CARDINAL coffee - shops in the village GPE ( where the properties were situated ) , by serving it upon a certain NORP PERSON of GPE and by posting a copy on the court \u2019s notice board .", "PERSON and his siblings failed to enter a notice of appearance and , when the action was fixed for hearing , the case was dealt with in their absence .", "Having heard the evidence of the witnesses , ORG was satisfied that PERSON had been in possession of the CARDINAL properties for more than the prescribed period , adversely , peacefully and uninterruptedly . On DATE the court ordered the cancellation of the registration of the properties in the name of PERSON and their registration in the name of PERSON , who subsequently had the plots registered in the name of his daughters by donation . Thereafter , one of the daughters mortgaged the properties in favour of ORG The writ of summons in action No . CARDINAL was never served on the plaintiffs who were at all times residents of GPE or GPE and whose address was unknown . They all had , however , a representative in GPE , Mr PERSON .", "In DATE PERSON retired to GPE . When he discovered that the registration of the properties had been cancelled , he lodged action No . CARDINAL on DATE with ORG in order to have the judgment in action No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL set aside . He was joined in this action by his siblings . They maintained that the judgment had been obtained by fraud and that there had been a breach of the procedural rules concerning the summons to appear . They alleged that they should have been personally notified of the writ of summons .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the action , referring extensively to NORP and NORP case - law on the matter . It held that , in deciding action No . CARDINAL , ORG had issued an order according to which the notification of the writ of summons was to take place by its publication in the \u201c ORG \u201d newspaper and a copy of it placed on the notice - boards of CARDINAL coffee - shops in the village of GPE , as well as that of ORG of GPE . In exercising its discretionary powers , ORG considered that such a notification was effective as the plaintiffs , whose nationality and address were unknown to the court , were abroad and the relevant documents , which had been sent to them by CARDINAL of their relatives , were returned undelivered . It concluded that , although this method of notification was not wholly efficient , it was important for citizens who had had their rights recognised by a court decision to be able to rely on such a decision .", "In particular , as to the allegation that the default judgment was obtained by fraud , the court found that the plaintiffs had failed to prove the existence of any such fraud . As to the allegation that there had been a procedural irregularity in that a notice of a writ of summons instead of the writ of summons itself should have been served upon them , being non - Cypriots , the court held that such an irregularity would result in the annulment of the judgment ex debito justitiae . However , the court concluded that PERSON and his siblings had failed to produce evidence to establish that they were not NORP nationals .", "The plaintiffs appealed to ORG which dismissed the appeal on DATE . ORG adopted the conclusions of ORG . It further observed that any procedural irregularity , which would have led to the proceedings in action CARDINAL being annulled , had become a \u201c mere irregularity \u201d by reason of the new LAW which was published on DATE and which ( in accordance with the case - law that followed ) had retrospective effect . This observation related only to the alleged irregularity that was brought about by the issue of the writ of summons instead of the issue of a notice of the writ . In any event , ORG dismissed the submission that there had been an irregularity with respect to the service of the writ , as PERSON and his siblings had failed to prove that they were non - Cypriots .", "Finally , ORG held :", "\u201c However , the respondents could submit to the ORG an application in action CARDINAL for setting aside [ the judgment ] , explaining the default of appearance as well as why such a period of time has passed until they took such a step [ filing the application ] and giving grounds for a prima facie case , so as to enable the ORG to exercise its discretionary power \u2026 The respondents did not follow such a course and no such issue was raised for determination . \u201d", "Order CARDINAL , Rule CARDINAL of ORG reads as follows :", "\u201c No writ of summons for service out of GPE of which notice is to be given out of GPE , shall be sealed without the leave of the ORG or a Judge . \u201d", "Order CARDINAL , Rule CARDINAL of ORG provides as follows :", "\u201c Any judgment by default , whether under this Order or under any other of these rules , may in a proper case be set aside by the ORG upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as the ORG may think fit . \u201d", "Domestic case - law has made it clear that the primary consideration for the court of review is whether the defendant \u2019s case has merits to which heed should be paid ( PERSON v. ORG , [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) .", "More recent authorities have reiterated the principle as follows :", "\u201c The effect of the case - law is that the court must not hasten to deprive a party of his right to be heard in his case , so long as he discloses merits . But the court may , nevertheless , decline to re - open the case if his conduct is such as to strike at the root of the administration of justice . Where the conduct of the party applying to set aside a judgment is inexcusable , contumacious , to the extent of grossly disregarding the judicial process or the rights of his adversary , the court may , in its discretion , refuse to set aside the judgment . \u201d ( NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL CLR CARDINAL ) .", "The Government stress that , in the context of an application to set aside a default judgment , the defendant does not have to show that he has not been personally notified of the proceedings in which the default judgment was delivered . He is only required to explain why he failed to appear in order to show that his non - appearance was not the result of any gross disregard for the judicial process ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
