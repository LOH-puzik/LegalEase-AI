The applicant \u2019s administrative appeal ( rozklad ) was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s subsequent numerous requests that ORG review his dismissal in a special procedure outside the framework of ordinary appellate proceedings ( mimo odovlacieho konania ) and that the proceedings be reopened failed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged his dismissal by way of an administrative - law action in ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) .

On DATE the applicant challenged the dismissal order of DATE in ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) under LAW . It was declared inadmissible on DATE as being belated . Moreover , and in any event , the review of the dismissal order fell within the jurisdiction of ORG . ORG review was merely subsidiary and did not apply to the dismissal order directly .

This presumption rendered his detention justified on the legal grounds referred to above .", "CARDINAL .
