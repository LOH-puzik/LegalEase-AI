DATE and DATE ; and the letter from PERSON , in which C. wrote to her female friend about the applicant \u2019s violent behaviour .", "CARDINAL . The court then stated :", "\u201c Based on such secured evidence , the court came to a clear conclusion , finding the defendant guilty as indicated in the verdict of the judgment . The defendant denies any such behaviour and actions on his part directed against [ C. ] as described in the judgment ; however , he has clearly been proved guilty by the evidence taken . The court relied in particular on the testimony of witness [ C. ] , who described the defendant \u2019s actions in great detail . The testimony is consistent with further evidence taken . This includes email correspondence , which corroborates the victim \u2019s statement and the victim \u2019s mother \u2019s statement to the effect that the victim had confided in her about everything on DATE . A brief description of the defendant \u2019s behaviour was also included in the letter sent by the victim to her female friend [ PERSON ] which was available to the court ... In his expert opinion , the expert concluded that it was absolutely possible and posed no problem for the defendant to use previously prepared straps to tie the victim to bed and partially undress the bottom CARDINAL of her body , and that it was absolutely possible and posed no problem for him to tie her up in the manner she had described ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In his extensive submissions of CARDINAL DATE , he requested that C. be questioned in order , inter alia , to clarify the contradictions between the statements given by C. , her mother , and her psychologist and the applicant \u2019s testimony . He also suggested that an expert opinion be drawn up by a psychiatric expert to assess the reliability of C. and to complete and assess other evidence , including the hearing of CARDINAL witnesses who had been rejected without adequate reasoning by the first instance court . He also requested that ORG ( m\u011bstsk\u00fd soud ) postpone the public hearing , without giving any reason in this respect .", "CARDINAL . The hearing before ORG was held on DATE in the absence of the applicant , who had apologised in writing on CARDINAL DATE indicating that he could not attend the hearing due to serious personal and family reasons , but agreeing that the court carry out merely the procedural acts allowed by LAW ORG and asking , at the same time , to postpone the hearing afterwards . At the hearing he was represented by counsel who , contrary to the applicant \u2019s written appeal , did not request that any further evidence be taken . The court , having rejected the applicant \u2019s request to postpone the hearing , examined his appeal , upholding the conviction of the first instance court .", "CARDINAL . The court found that the applicant \u2019s guilt had been securely established in particular by the statement given by ORG , which was not the only evidence against the applicant , her statements having been corroborated by further indirect evidence , such as the testimony of her mother , in whom PERSON had confided at the material time . The appellate court also found that , although C. and her mother had not had a close relationship before , PERSON contacted her out of fear for her and her brother \u2019s life and described the acts of coercion carried out by the applicant . Witness C. \u2019s mother also claimed that the initial anonymous criminal complaint sent by email to the GPE CARDINAL ORG had been sent by the applicant , who had thus lodged a false accusation . Her testimony was examined in detail . The indirect evidence also included text messages sent by the applicant on DATE and the criminal complaint filed by ORG in GPE on DATE . The time concurrence was thus a significant factor , too .", "CARDINAL . As regards the reliability of ORG and the assessment of evidence , the court stated :", "\u201c ... the assessment of the evidence is reasonable and convincing , as is [ ORG ] conclusion concerning the reliability of witness [ C. ] . ORG was not wrong in believing this witness , who proved the defendant \u2019s guilt of the criminal acts . The testimony of the victim was not the only convincing evidence against the applicant on which the ORG based its conclusion about the defendant \u2019s guilt , since the defendant \u2019s criminal acts are also proved by a chain of indirect evidence corroborating the testimony of the victim and confirming the credibility of her statements . This includes , in particular , the testimony of her mother ... in whom the victim confided during a phone call on DATE in which she described the defendant \u2019s actions , including the way he had tied her up in his apartment , threatened her and sent her threatening emails . The testimonies given by [ C. ] and her mother ... regarding the relevant facts correspond to the content of the criminal complaint filed by the victim at the police station in GPE , GPE ... on DATE . The defendant \u2019s complaint that the unreliability of the victim is proved by the fact that she did not confide earlier in her mother or a close female friend about his alleged behaviour is ill - founded : the evidence taken clearly shows that the victim and her mother did not previously have a particularly close relationship since she did not confide in her mother about her relationship with the defendant . This is understandable given that she was allegedly abused by the mother \u2019s partner ( as the victim confided in the defendant ) . Furthermore , the victim was already back in GPE at the relevant time ( as of DATE ) and her contact with the defendant was conducted solely via mobile phone calls and email correspondence . In these circumstances , the behaviour of the victim appears rather logical and understandable , i.e. confiding in her mother and brother concerning the threats to their health and her life in an SMS message . ... The reliability of the victim and the veracity of her testimony is also corroborated by the emails included in the ... These emails , which were submitted to the police by the victim , correspond case file to her testimony as to the timeframe and the contents ... It is hardly possible for ORG to believe that the victim would systematically and for DATE beforehand prepare all the evidence ... in order to be able to file a criminal complaint against the defendant . In addition to the above , the defendant \u2019s contacts with the victim ( which he himself did not deny ) and her reliability are also clearly shown in the defendant \u2019s affidavit of DATE ... , in which the defendant declared he did not have any financial claims against the victim . Finally , one should not disregard the statement of an impartial witness ... namely the victim \u2019s psychotherapist , who confirmed that the victim came to her because of relational problems with the defendant , confided in her about having been held by the defendant against her will and driven off somewhere in his car , and about his emails threatening to harm her if she left him . All this indirect evidence is interrelated and consistent with the victim \u2019s testimony . Consequently , the defendant \u2019s complaint concerning the unreliability of the victim is ill - founded ... As a result , ORG correctly believed the testimony given by the victim in relation to this matter , considering her testimony in general to be credible ...", "The defendant \u2019s behaviour and verbal aggression , as documented in the emails and SMS messages sent by him escalated at a later stage , prompting the victim to file a criminal complaint and change her contact details because she was afraid of the defendant \u2019s behaviour after he threatened to harm her mother and brother . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning ORG \u2019s interview , which was conducted as an urgent and non - repeatable measure under LAW ORG , ORG noted that :", "\u201c The victim was duly interviewed in the presence of a judge ... , with the unrepeatability of the measure being determined by the long - term residence of the witness in GPE . The justification of such a procedure and the unavailability of the witness were confirmed by the efforts of ORG to secure her attendance at the main hearing , which the witness repeatedly failed to attend , providing a written statement to the effect that she was residing abroad on a long - term basis and would not be able to attend the main hearing in the foreseeable future . Therefore , ORG deemed legal the procedure applied by the ORG whereby , after exhausting the possibility of examining the victim in the main hearing for unavailability due to her residence abroad , it read out the statement she had made ... in the pre - trial proceedings in accordance with Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(a ) of LAW . Although this was key evidence , it was not the only evidence proving the defendant \u2019s guilt ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appellate court admitted that the prosecutor had violated Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG in reclassifying the charges without notifying the applicant . It found , however , that this omission did not impact on the legality and correctness of the reviewed judgment to the extent that a duty to reverse it resulted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal on points of law ( dovol\u00e1n\u00ed ) which was rejected as unsubstantiated by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . The court stated that the appellate court had not proceeded erroneously in having decided the case in the absence of the applicant , who had not sufficiently substantiated his request to have the hearing postponed . It added that the applicant \u2019s counsel had not requested that further evidence be gathered and assessed and that , therefore , there had been no need to postpone the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional appeal ( \u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost ) which was dismissed by ORG ( GPE soud ) in a decision of DATE which was served on the applicant on CARDINAL DATE . Having analysed the testimony given by C. , ORG found that , although it was direct evidence , it was corroborated by a chain of indirect evidence , especially the testimony of her mother . In respect of the remaining complaints , the ORG agreed with the findings of the lower courts stating , in particular :", "\u201c The applicant \u2019s complaints regarding the search in his flat and non - residential LOC and lands are unsubstantiated . The search in the applicant \u2019s domicile was carried out in compliance with LAW on the basis of the search order issued by ORG . The applicant had the opportunity , if he was convinced that the search is unlawful , to lodge a constitutional appeal against this order ... In a constitutional appeal against the final judgment of conviction , it is possible , in connection with a search carried out unlawfully , complain in particular the inadmissibility of concrete pieces of evidence which were gathered and on the basis of which [ an applicant ] was found guilty . However , the applicant did not expressly submit any concrete evidence which would be gathered illegally . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to ORG a claim for compensation for damages caused by delays in the criminal proceedings under LAW ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .
