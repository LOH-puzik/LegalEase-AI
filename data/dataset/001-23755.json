On appeal , the decision was upheld on DATE by ORG ( PERSON ) . Both instances noted that the statement of events made by the applicant and his spouse respectively had been divergent . However , even accepting the applicant \u2019s statements as facts , they found that the harassment and incidents referred to failed to attain the minimum level of severity in order to fall within the notion of persecution set out in section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) . Also , reiterating that the applicant had never been politically active , and noting the improvement of the security situation in GPE , they found that no concrete danger existed that the applicant would be subjected to persecution , if returned . Finally , reiterating that the applicant and his family had lived without any problems in GPE , he was referred to reside elsewhere in GPE in case he did not wish to return to GPE . The applicant was ordered to leave the country immediately .", "On DATE the applicant requested that ORG ( NORP for PERSON , ORG ) grant him a residence permit on humanitarian grounds pursuant to section CARDINAL b of LAW .

The applicant in the present case was not among those evacuees . He entered GPE himself in DATE . A \u201c FAC \u201d of DATE created the legal basis at domestic level for receiving displaced persons from GPE with a need for temporary protection . The LAW was repealed in DATE . At the same time a provision was inserted in LAW introducing the possibility of granting a residence permit to distressed persons from GPE assumed to need temporary protection ( now section CARDINAL e ( CARDINAL ) ) . A precondition for obtaining a residence permit under this provision is that the person in question must be assumed to need temporary protection in GPE and formerly held a residence permit pursuant to the \u201c GPE Emergency Act \u201d or has been registered as an asylum - seeker before DATE .

Furthermore , under LAW it is possible to provide financial assistance if the person in question returns without undue delay voluntary .", "In connection with the forced return of aliens from GPE , UNMIK ( ORG in GPE ) is the relevant partner . In every case there is a close dialogue between the NORP National Commissioner of Police and UNMIK . Firstly the NORP National Commissioner of Police notifies UNMIK about the return to GPE of GPE whose applications for a residence permit in GPE have been refused . Such notifications state the time of the individual \u2019s departure from GPE and entry into GPE and inform of decisions made by the NORP authorities and the individual \u2019s personal situation , including his or her home town in GPE , the languages mastered by the individual and where his or her family members are staying . It also appears from the notification if the individual has been expelled due to crime . The notifications also state particulars on the individual \u2019s health status . This notification procedure was first established at a meeting held in GPE from CARDINAL to DATE between officials of ORG , ORG and UNMIK . The notification procedure was confirmed and expanded at a meeting in GPE on DATE between a delegation of high officials from the immigration authorities and UNMIK , who agreed that UNMIK will be provided with extended information , especially concerning the mental status of GPE who are non - voluntarily sent back to GPE in order to support UNMIK in its efforts to solve its task . Such information will be available to UNMIK by offering the GPE in question a voluntary medical status report prior to the return to GPE . ORG Commissioner of Police has presented to UNMIK a number of PERSON whose applications for a residence permit in GPE have been refused for which reason they have had to leave GPE . In some cases PERSON objected to the return of the persons in question . In such situations the NORP National Commissioner of Police has suspended the return until further notice .", "In the present case , the NORP National Commissioner of Police has not yet contacted UNMIK because the forced return of the applicant has not been planned yet . Normally a forced return takes quite some time , not CARDINAL or three months .", "Relevant international materials", "With regard to the current security situation in GPE , the following statements/ findings are of particular relevance :", "The Secretary General on ORG in GPE stated in his report of DATE covering the activities of UNMIK and the developments in GPE , GPE , and GPE among other things that given the continued violence , harassment and discrimination faced by minorities , achieving sustainable minority returns to GPE was difficult , time - consuming and resource - intensive ;", "In his report of DATE he stated inter alia that incidents of violence and crimes against minorities continued to be a cause for concern within GPE ;", "In his report of DATE he stated inter alia that despite setbacks resulting from recent violent incidents involving GPE NORP victims , the overall rate of returns continued to accelerate during the reporting period . Over CARDINAL displaced persons had returned so far that year to areas where they were a minority ( including CARDINAL ORG , CARDINAL ORG /Egyptians , CARDINAL NORP , CARDINAL PERSON and CARDINAL GPE NORP ) . Funding expected from several major donors had been provided in GPE and work on a number of returns projects had begun in earnest , including the return of GPE NORP to GPE ( NORP region ) and LOC ( NORP region ) , and ORG NORP returns to PERSON ( GPE ) and GPE town . The heightened level of security within ORG and other minority communities had not resulted in the cancelling of any returns project , but it had led to numerous postponements of returns activities , at a stage in DATE where such delays may mean that returns are not possible until DATE . It was also considered likely to have a dampening effect on ORG return .", "The Tenth Assessment of the Situation of Ethnic Minorities in GPE of DATE , conducted jointly by ORG and the ORG , stated that minorities continue to face varying degrees of harassment , intimidation and provocation , as well as limited freedom of movement , and that considering the overall situation described in the report , the changes noted during the reporting period were not yet fundamental enough to conclude that conditions would exist for large scale return of ethnic minorities in the near future , underscoring the continuing need for international protection for members of ethnic communities , in particular GPE NORP , GPE and NORP ;", "The UNHCR Position Paper on the continued Protection Needs of individuals from GPE of DATE stated that especially GPE NORP and GPE , but also GPE and NORP should continue to benefit from international protection in countries of asylum . ORG stressed that return of these minorities should take place on a strictly voluntary basis and be based on fully informed individual decisions . Any such voluntary return movements should be properly coordinated , and re - integration should be supported through assistance to ensure sustainability . ORG , GPE and NORP individuals or families should not be forced or induced to return to GPE .", "The First Vice - President of ORG on LAW , recommended in his mission report of DATE \u201c ORG and GPE \u201d for ORG , inter alia that GPE asylum seeker / returnees ( from LOC ) , who fled GPE , should not be returned to GPE unless they wish to return and they are advised by PERSON and UNCHR that it is safe for them personally to return to their homes , and", "In its report of DATE and GPE ( GPE ) \u201c Prisoners in our own homes \u201d : ORG concerns for the human rights of minorities in GPE - Amnesty International urged inter alia host countries not to end international protection for all minority refugees from GPE and ensure that refugees still in need of protection were not subject in any way to pressure or inducement to \u201c voluntarily return \u201d . ORG considered that the forcible return of members of minority groups to GPE would be a violation of the principle of non - refoulement and place minority individuals at risk .", "It follows from a \u201c Memorandum of Understanding \u201d between the Federal Minister of the Interior of GPE and GPE the Secretary - General of ORG for GPE of DATE that CARDINAL members of ethnic minorities from GPE are required to leave GPE . It was agreed that certain members of specific ethnic minority groups were no longer in need of international protection and could therefore be returned to GPE , as from DATE . In DATE GPE would return CARDINAL persons . This figure would include members of the NORP , NORP , PERSON and GPE minority communities , as well as GPE and NORP minorities . As to the latter CARDINAL groups of minorities , they would be returned depending on the results of an individualised screening process performed by UNMIK .
