The applicant is a lawyer by training and an auditor by profession . From DATE onwards , he was no longer authorised to practise as a lawyer . By a decision of ORG of DATE , the applicant was suspended from the roll , as the exercise of the profession of lawyer was considered to be incompatible with his practising as an auditor . This decision was published in ORG in DATE . When the applicant ceased his activity as an auditor in DATE , he continued to be suspended from ORG roll until DATE as the result of a disciplinary sanction imposed on him for having practised as a lawyer while not being authorised to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the context of a set of civil proceedings in which he was nevertheless acting as a lawyer , the applicant criticised the decisions taken by the judge hearing the case , saying that they were not worthy of a judge and that a judge could not lie or omit the truth in the exercise of his functions . The judge in question filed a complaint for insult with the public prosecutor \u2019s office . It is not clear from the material before the ORG on what basis the applicant was acting as a lawyer in the context of those proceedings given the suspension from the roll referred to above .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor \u2019s office at the ORG filed the prosecution \u2019s submissions against the applicant on a charge of insulting a judge . As the applicant had not instructed a lawyer , the public prosecutor \u2019s office appointed counsel on the basis of LAW ORG ) to conduct the applicant \u2019s defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request with ORG for the opening of adversarial investigation proceedings ( abertura de instru\u00e7\u00e3o ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He also sought leave to replace his officially appointed defence counsel and represent himself .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE the court agreed to open the investigation but dismissed the request for officially appointed defence counsel to be replaced and for the applicant to conduct his own defence . It held that the applicant was not entitled to act in the proceedings without the assistance of defence counsel . The court held that under the provisions of NORP law , in particular LAW and Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE below ) , the defendant had the right to be represented by independent counsel , a right which would not be made effective if self - representation were to be allowed . Referring to ORG case - law on the subject , the court found that a defendant who was a lawyer could therefore not act in proceedings as his own counsel .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against the order of DATE , challenging the decision not to allow him to represent himself in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It considered the appeal to be admissible despite the fact that it had been lodged by the applicant in person , as it concerned the very issue whether the applicant , as the defendant , was entitled to conduct his own defence . ORG stressed that NORP law on criminal procedure did not allow the procedural status of defendant to be combined with that of defence counsel in the same proceedings . It required that the defendant be assisted by defence counsel at the hearing before the investigating judge and at the trial in all cases where the proceedings concerned could give rise to a custodial sentence or a public - safety detention order . This reflected the premise that the accused would be better defended when the defence was conducted by a legal professional trained in advocacy . The latter , unencumbered by the emotional burden weighing on a defendant , could provide a lucid , dispassionate and effective defence . The law on criminal procedure was thus intended not to place limits on the defence \u2019s action , but to support the proper defence of the accused .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG decided that it was not necessary to adjudicate on the constitutional appeal lodged by the applicant in person , in which he had complained about the lower courts\u2019 refusal to grant him leave to represent himself . ORG found that the appeal had been neither signed nor endorsed by court - appointed defence counsel . The latter had not replied to ORG query of CARDINAL DATE as to whether she endorsed the constitutional appeal signed by the applicant himself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON - Vouga investigating judge held a hearing ( debate instrut\u00f3rio ) , of which the applicant had been notified in person . The judge had previously refused to adjourn the hearing at the applicant \u2019s request , finding that ORG had already given a final ruling on the applicant \u2019s application to represent himself . The applicant failed to attend the hearing , at which his court - appointed counsel was present . The investigating judge confirmed the charge against the applicant and referred the case for trial ( despacho de pron\u00fancia ) before PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Baixo - Vouga Criminal Court , following a hearing which the applicant again did not attend but at which his court appointed defence lawyer was present , found the applicant guilty of aggravated insult ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and ordered him to pay CARDINAL dayfines of CARDINAL ( ORG ) each as well as the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who at no point requested legal aid to cover the cost of his trial , court - appointed counsel or counsel of his own choosing , was ordered , in particular , to pay costs amounting to ORG CARDINAL for his representation by court - appointed counsel . He did not pay these costs and the execution of the cost order was later discontinued for lack of assets which could be seized .", "CARDINAL . In an order dated DATE PERSON rejected an appeal by the applicant against the judgment as inadmissible , on the ground that the appeal had not been signed by court - appointed defence counsel or by a lawyer instructed by the applicant . It confirmed that , as had previously been decided in a final decision , the applicant , as the defendant , did not have the right to represent himself in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By an order dated DATE ORG , acting through its President , dismissed a complaint lodged by the applicant in person against the order of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal reiterated that , according to NORP law and well - established case - law , defendants in criminal proceedings , even if they were themselves lawyers , could not represent themselves but had to be assisted by defence counsel . It stressed that , as had also been argued by ORG in Opinion No . E-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the provision of a criminal defence constituted a public - order interest . Therefore , the right to a defence could not be waived , even if this meant imposing a defence lawyer on the accused . Moreover , in adversarial proceedings the powers vested by law in the defence were incompatible in many situations with the position of the defendant . This was also clearly the case at the trial , taking into account , for example , the places to be occupied in the courtroom , the wearing of a gown and the cross - examination of witnesses .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that ORG had repeatedly confirmed , in particular in judgments FAC . CARDINAL and ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , that this interpretation and the corresponding legislation \u2013 including LAW ( d ) of the ORG , which stipulates that only defence counsel can lodge appeals ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) \u2013 was in keeping with the LAW . Likewise , this approach was not in breach of LAW ( ORG ) or of the LAW . In GPE , the accused had an array of procedural rights which went beyond the minimum standards guaranteed by these international instruments .", "CARDINAL . ORG explained that NORP law on criminal procedure granted accused persons ample opportunity to defend themselves in person . The defendant had a very comprehensive right to intervene in person at any time in the proceedings in order to make requests , offer points of clarification , reply , explain or submit statements ( see , in particular , Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL , ORG ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG ; CARDINAL , DATE and DATE below ) . He also had the right to be the last person to address the court , immediately following the pleadings and before delivery of the judgment ( see LAW ORG , paragraph CARDINAL below ) . There was a distinction between , and a dual safeguard emanating from , the mandatory instruction of a lawyer to ensure the accused \u2019s \u201c technical \u201d defence and the possibility for the accused to be present and to intervene in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG noted that , having no valid reasons to depart from an interpretation rooted in case - law and legal literature , GPE had not amended its law in this regard either before or after the Views adopted in DATE by ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant had not appointed counsel following his application to have the order of CARDINAL DATE quashed , PERSON judgment of DATE became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the material before the ORG , the applicant did not call into question the qualifications or quality of the court - appointed lawyer at any stage in the proceedings before the domestic courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"]}
