On DATE the tax authorities imposed additional income tax and also tax surcharges ( veronkorotus , skattef\u00f6rh\u00f6jning ) both on the company and on the applicant for DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . The applicant apparently did not appeal against those decisions and the bailiff seized the imposed sums . The period set for appeal in tax matters is DATE counted from the beginning of the calendar year following DATE when the initial taxation decision was taken . Therefore the taxation concerning DATE , DATE and DATE became final on DATE , DATE , and DATE respectively . The period for appeal for DATE elapsed on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the prosecutor brought charges against the applicant for accounting offence ( kirjanpitorikos , bokf\u00f6ringsbrott ) and aggravated tax fraud ( t\u00f6rke\u00e4 veropetos , grovt skattebedr\u00e4geri ) on CARDINAL counts . The first count concerned DATE and the applicant \u2019s activities as the managing director and a member of the board of directors of the company .

He relied also on the principle of ne bis in idem and the ORG \u2019s case - law in that respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after having held an oral hearing , upheld the judgment for the most part , but considered in part that the accounting offence was aggravated and ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL more compensation to the ORG . The court considered that , as long as the time - limit for appeal had not elapsed with regard to DATE at the moment of bringing the charges against the applicant in DATE , there was no issue of ne bis in idem . Furthermore , it considered that , as concerned DATE , the time - limit for appeal had elapsed on DATE and thus the taxation had become final before the charges were brought against the applicant . However , as there still existed another kind of tax appeal which the applicant could have used , ORG finally considered that the ne bis in idem principle did not prevent the examination of the charges against the applicant also concerning DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG dismissed , without examining the merits , that part of the criminal conviction that concerned DATE as it considered that the fact that the tax surcharges imposed on the applicant had become final in DATE , that is , before the charges had been brought against the applicant in DATE , prevented the examination of the matter . Otherwise the lower court \u2019s judgment was upheld . The court considered that as long as the time - limit for appeal had not elapsed with regard to DATE at the moment when the charges were brought against the applicant , there was no issue of ne bis in idem . As a part of the applicant \u2019s conviction was dismissed without examining the merits , his sentence was accordingly also lowered to imprisonment for DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL .
