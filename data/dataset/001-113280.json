The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Montresor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s predecessor owned property comprising also a park and a manor situated in LOC . By virtue of LAW DATE on ORG ( \u201c the DATE Decree \u201d ) ownership of private agricultural properties exceeding QUANTITY was transferred ex lege to the ORG . In DATE the ORG transferred ownership of the property to a ORG - owned company ORG . In DATE an entry confirming that company \u2019s right of perpetual use in respect of the property was made in the land register . After the collapse of the communist regime the applicant and other legal successors of the former owners instituted proceedings seeking to have the ownership restored to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted administrative proceedings . She requested the Podkarpackie Governor ( ORG ) to give a decision declaring the expropriation null and void . She argued that the expropriation decision was unlawful in that the property concerned had not fallen within the scope of the criteria for nationalisation stipulated by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Governor held that the property was covered by the Decree and therefore the expropriation decision had been lawful . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of Agriculture quashed the first - instance decision and remitted the case .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the Governor held that the park and manor were covered by LAW . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a complaint under LAW about the Minister \u2019s failure to give a decision in the case within a reasonable time . She reiterated her complaint on DATE . There was no reply to these complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister upheld the first - instance decision . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG quashed both the first- and second - instance decisions , finding that the first - instance authority had failed to inform the parties , including the applicant , about an administrative hearing it had held .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Governor discontinued the proceedings . It had regard to a decision given by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It held that in the light of that decision the administrative authorities had no jurisdiction to examine issues concerning the lawfulness of expropriation decisions given on the basis of the DATE Decree .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , referring to the resolution given by ORG on DATE ( I OPS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She argued that the authority had failed to provide the legal basis for the proceedings to be discontinued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister upheld the contested decision . The applicant appealed . On DATE the Minister noted that he was competent to quash his own decision if he found it to be unlawful . He accordingly quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE , having regard to the judgment of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He held that the first - instance administrative authority had jurisdiction to deal with the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again complained about the Governor \u2019s failure to give a decision . On DATE the Minister found that the applicant \u2019s complaint was ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Governor held that the provisions of the DATE Decree were not applicable to the park and manor and that therefore there were no legal grounds on which the property concerned could be expropriated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister upheld this decision .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , having regard to discrepancies in the case - law regarding the procedural situation of former owners and their legal successors , instituted civil proceedings with a view to having the ownership restored to her . She instituted proceedings against ORG and against the ORG public company before ORG , seeking rectification of the land register so as to make it reflect the actual legal status of the land ( CARDINAL o uzgodnienie ksi\u0119gi wieczystej z rzeczywistym stanem prawnym ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed her action . It noted , firstly , that under LAW Decree properties consisting of parks and manors ( zesp\u00f3\u0142 parkowo - pa\u0142acowy ) were not subject to expropriation . However , the applicant had failed to show that the property concerned had ever been formally separated from the agrarian property as a whole so as to constitute a separate subject of ownership . In any event , the applicant had failed to show that she had obtained a final administrative decision declaring the expropriation decision null and void . Such a decision was a necessary prerequisite for a civil court to hold that the ownership of the property had not been transferred to the ORG and to determine all consequences in the sphere of civil law resulting from such a decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . She submitted that the court had erred in refusing to stay the proceedings until an administrative decision was given , because such a decision was a necessary prerequisite for the civil court to rule on the merits of the case . She further submitted that the court had thereby breached the LAW by encroaching on the exclusive competences of the administrative authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed her appeal . It observed that it was obvious that a decision on whether the DATE Decree was applicable to the property could only be given by the administrative authorities . It referred to a judgment of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It emphasised that the case - law of the administrative courts also indicated that only the administrative authorities were competent to determine this issue . In the applicant \u2019s case , as no such decision had ever been given , no other course of action was open to the civil court than to hold that the claim to have the entries in the land register rectified had to fail .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE , ORG refused to entertain her cassation appeal . It noted that the applicant had instituted civil proceedings in the absence of an administrative decision declaring the expropriation unlawful and therefore null and void . In such situation the courts had no choice but to dismiss her claim .", "CARDINAL . DATE provides that \u201c the agrarian reform in GPE is a ORG and economic imperative and shall be realised ... pursuant to principles set forth in the manifesto of ORG \u201d .", "LAW , in so far as relevant , reads :", "\u201c The following agricultural estates shall be designated for the purposes of the agrarian reform : ...", "e ) being a property or a co - property of natural persons or legal entities , if the entire area of the estate exceeds either QUANTITY in total , or QUANTITY of arable land ...", "All real estate , referred to in items ... , e ) above shall , with no delay and without compensation , be taken over by the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG discontinued proceedings instituted by an individual constitutional complaint concerning the alleged incompatibility of LAW with LAW . It held that it could only examine the compatibility of binding legal provisions with LAW . LAW had never been formally abrogated and it was referred to by courts and administrative authorities in their decisions . However , it was not a decisive factor in assessing whether this provision was still in force . The decisive factor was that it could no longer provide the basis for any substantive changes in ownership . The courts , when referring to this provision , did not apply it in the strict sense of that term ; the reference to this provision was merely of a secondary nature and was used to decide whether that provision had been applied , during the expropriation proceedings conducted in the past , in a manner which had flagrantly violated the law ( in which case an expropriation decision had to be declared null and void ) . ORG concluded that this provision had therefore ceased to have legally binding force ( ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that only administrative authorities could examine restitution cases ( IV CSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . An identical resolution was adopted on DATE ORG ( I OPS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG discontinued proceedings instituted as a result of a legal question ( pytanie prawne ) put to it by ORG ( P CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It reiterated , referring to its decision given in DATE ) that the provisions of the DATE Decree could not be resorted to any more in order to confer substantive rights on individuals and that it had ceased to be binding law . It further noted discrepancies in judicial and administrative practice as to the jurisdiction to examine restitution cases . It further held that only civil courts had jurisdiction to examine such cases , despite the fact that in practice these cases were dealt with by the administrative authorities and , upon appeal , by the regional administrative courts and , in the last , resort , by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held in a resolution that that decision of ORG was not universally binding , essentially because it was only of a procedural character . The court held that the administrative authorities had jurisdiction to examine restitution cases ( I OPS MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL .
