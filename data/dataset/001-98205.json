AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , a firm of lawyers practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "On DATE , preliminary investigations ( Vorerhebungen ) were instituted against the applicant and CARDINAL other persons who were suspected of aggravated fraud , breach of trust , money laundering and forming a criminal organisation .", "During these proceedings ORG ( PERSON ) acting through its competent investigating judge , on DATE confiscated CARDINAL cars belonging to the applicant by an interim measure under section CARDINALa of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( NORP - ordnung ) in order to secure the levy ( GPE ) of property presumed to have been obtained by criminal acts . The court confiscated a Suzuki Kombi , a ORG Voyager Kombi and a Mercedes Cabrio . On CARDINAL DATE the court further ordered that the cars be kept at a motor trading company in GPE . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that his friend and not he was the owner of ORG .", "The applicant did not appeal against this decision .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of aggravated professional fraud and being a member of a criminal organisation . Under LAW ) it found that there should be a levy on the enrichment obtained from the crimes in the amount of CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) . The applicant made a plea of nullity to ORG . The applicant and ORG also filed appeals against the sentence .", "On DATE the court , referring inter alia to section CARDINAL of LAW ( Exekutionsordnung ) , ordered that the cars be sold at public judicial auction . It noted that the criminal proceedings were very complex and that ORG would presumably not render judgment until DATE . The sale of the cars was necessary in order to prevent excessive parking charges and loss of value due to the ORG decreasing sales value . The court finally noted that the interests of the car owner were protected by the fact that he could recover the cars by participating in the judicial auction . Furthermore , he would obtain the proceeds of the sale revenue if no levy would be imposed . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE . No formal remedy lies against this decision .", "Nevertheless , the applicant , assisted by counsel , lodged an appeal on DATE . He submitted that the reasons given for the sale were not plausible , as the cars had until now been kept for CARDINAL , and considerable parking charges had accrued . Therefore , the fact that the cars should be kept for DATE was of minor importance . He was not in a position to buy the cars at the judicial auction as he was currently living on emergency assistance ( Notstandshilfe ) . Furthermore , there was not sufficient legal basis for the court \u2019s decision to sell his property . The applicant finally argued that he was not the owner of the ORG Kombi and that the court had failed to inform the real owner .", "On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) rejected the appeal as inadmissible , as no appeal lay against such an order . It noted that the provisions of LAW alone were relevant and section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW only provided for the right to appeal against a decision ordering or cancelling an interim confiscation . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "On DATE the cars were sold at a public auction .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity against ORG judgment of DATE and , on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the appeals lodged by the applicant and ORG .", "Under LAW of LAW ) a person who has obtained property of value by or as a result of criminal acts should be sentenced to a fine in the amount of the unlawful enrichment . If the exact extent of the enrichment can not be established or can only be established by incurring disproportionate costs , the court has to assess the amount to be levied on an equitable basis .", "In case of suspicion of unlawful enrichment , presumably falling under the scope of LAW , and if there is reason to assume that otherwise the levy on the value of the property concerned is thereby placed at risk , section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( PERSON ) authorises the investigating judge , at the request of ORG , to issue an interim order of confiscation .", "Section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL further provides that , if not stipulated otherwise , the provisions of LAW ( Exekutionsordnung ) apply to these interim measures .", "Section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that ORG , the accused and any other person concerned have the right to appeal to the second - instance court against a decision ordering or cancelling an interim confiscation .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that , upon request , the court may issue any orders which are necessary to prevent obsolescence , disproportional costs or other losses concerning objects which belong to third parties and have been taken into legal custody . According to the legal doctrine , such a decision may also consist in the order to sell the objects concerned ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
