AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "John Freeland;R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG The applicants are NORP citizens and own a farm at GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Agricultural land - consolidation proceedings ( Zusammenlegungs - verfahren ) under ORG ( ORG - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) were instituted by LOC ( PERSON - \" ORG \" ) in DATE . They concerned CARDINAL landowners and covered some CARDINAL ha . The valuation ( NORP - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was adopted in DATE without opposition from the interested parties . On DATE ORG ordered the provisional transfer of the compensatory parcels ( ORG ) on the basis of a draft consolidation scheme ( PERSON - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . An appeal lodged by the applicants against this order was rejected by ORG ( Landesagrarsenat - \" ORG \" ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The consolidation scheme ( Zusammenlegungsplan - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was published in DATE and , in its essence , confirmed the situation created by the provisional transfer order .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , following an appeal from the applicants , ORG held that the parcels allotted to the applicants were of approximately the same value as the old ones . ORG pointed out that it did not share the opinion expressed in the private expert opinion submitted by the applicants , according to which the yield of their compensatory parcels was below that of the ORG former property . On the contrary , it held that , on the whole , the agricultural performances under the new situation were at least as good as under the old one and dismissed the bulk of the ORG arguments . However , with reference to a plot measuring CARDINAL ha ( plot no . DATE ) , ORG held that while not illegal its configuration could be rendered more functional ( zweckm\u00e4\u00dfiger ) . It therefore quashed the part of the consolidation scheme concerning that plot and ordered that ORG re - examine the issue . The applicants appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG ( Oberster Agrarsenat - \" ORG \" ) quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and referred the case back to ORG following the applicants\u2019 argument that the appeal could not be partly dismissed , as the applicants\u2019 claims for compensatory parcels were an indivisible whole . It further held , inter alia , that the question of lawfulness ( GPE ) also included considerations of functionality .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , in compliance with ORG decision , ORG set the consolidation scheme aside . ORG again pointed out that it did not share the opinion expressed in the private expert opinion submitted by the applicants . It established that the compensatory parcels attributed to the applicants were , on the whole , more advantageous , but that they also contained some negative aspects . The advantages were ( a ) the reduction of the splitting up of the plots and the resulting increase in the average size of the plots ; ( b ) the reduction of the length of boundaries and the concomitant abolition of unproductive plots ; ( c ) a better balance between length and width of the plots ; and ( d ) better access . The negative aspects were ( e ) the diminution of the average comparative values of the parcels ( by PERCENT ) ; ( f ) the increase of average distance from the farm ( by PERCENT ) ; ( g ) the slight increase of forest border ; ( h ) the inappropriate configuration of plot no . DATE ; ( i ) the hook - like form of plot no . DATE and the circuit line pylons on this plot part of which was unproductive .", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG concluded that the lawfulness of the compensatory measures was still in question . The file was referred to ORG for the adoption of a new scheme .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE ORG published a new consolidation scheme . The applicants also appealed against this scheme . Although they were now in agreement with the new land allocation , they demanded that the boundaries of CARDINAL of their plots be straightened ( Grenzbegradigung ) and that their share in the costs of communal measures and facilities - CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) - ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) - be scrapped or reduced to a minimum .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG dismissed the ORG appeal . It observed that the number of plots in the applicants\u2019 possession had been reduced from CARDINAL , whilst the difference in value between the new and the old land did not even attain PERCENT , well below the statutory maximum of PERCENT . All in all , the consolidation measures had led to an increase in productivity which compensated for certain small disadvantages . The applicants lodged a complaint with ORG ) , which , in summary proceedings , refused to deal with the complaint and referred the case to ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) which , in its turn , decided to discontinue the proceedings for procedural reasons in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE Mr and PERSON had applied for financial compensation in respect of the damages allegedly caused to them by the fact that they had received insufficient compensatory parcels by the provisional transfer which at that time was still in force . They submitted an expert opinion according to which they had suffered a loss of crops in the amount of approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG rejected the ORG claim as being inadmissible . It observed that ORG did not provide for any compensation in respect of damage suffered in the period between the provisional transfer and the assignment of lawful compensatory parcels by the final consolidation scheme ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In addition , the agricultural authorities were only competent to decide on facts concerning the implementation of the consolidation .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicants\u2019 appeal to ORG was dismissed on DATE on the ground that there was neither a legal nor a factual basis for a claim for financial compensation in their case . In the latter respect , the ORG pointed out that it had examined and rejected the ORG private expert opinion already in its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Although the original consolidation scheme had had to be quashed in consequence of the applicants\u2019 appeal , this did not mean that the applicants had suffered damage . In the instant case , it had been found in the earlier decision that among the total of CARDINAL ha of compensatory parcels allotted to the applicants only the configuration of CARDINAL measuring some CARDINAL ha ( no . DATE ) was objectionable . On the other hand , the applicants had also gained certain advantages . Therefore the ORG maintained the opinion already expressed in its earlier decisions that the applicants had not suffered any damage as far as yield and exploitation conditions were concerned .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged this decision before ORG alleging that the authorities had the duty to apply the provisions of the civil law . ORG , however , found that the administrative authorities were not competent to decide on compensation claims of a civil - law nature and dismissed the complaint on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicants lodged a complaint with ORG invoking LAW ( article CARDINAL ) and LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . ORG considered that in the light of its constant case - law the complaint did not have any prospects of success and , on CARDINAL DATE , refused to deal with it . In summary proceedings it observed , inter alia , that the facts in the applicants\u2019 case were different from those in the case of ORG and PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in that the consolidation scheme had already been published and that the applicants had never complained of the unreasonable length of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG The basic rules applying to the consolidation of agricultural land , as applicable to the present case , are embodied in ORG ( Flurverfassungs - Grundsatzgesetz DATE ) , as amended in DATE . Each Land has enacted its own agricultural and land planning legislation ( PERSON ) to regulate the matters of its competence within the federal framework . In GPE , consolidation is governed by ORG DATE ( \" LAW \" ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The purpose of consolidation is to improve the infrastructure and the pattern of agricultural holdings in a given area ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . It comprises communal measures and facilities and redistribution of land . The operation takes place in the following stages :", "- initial proceedings ;", "- ascertainment of the occupiers of the land in question and assessment of its value ;", "- planning of communal measures and facilities ;", "- provisional transfer of land , where appropriate ;", "- adoption of the consolidation scheme . None of these stages may begin until the previous stage has been terminated with a final decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG The initial proceedings , which the authorities institute of their own motion , serve to determine the consolidation area , which , in addition to farmland and forest , may include land voluntarily offered for consolidation and land required for communal facilities ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . The owners form an association ( ORG ) , which is a corporate body governed by public law . The institution of proceedings means that land use is restricted until the proceedings are concluded ; any change in use must be approved by the appropriate agricultural authority . This authority has exclusive jurisdiction , inter alia , over disputes concerning ownership and tenure of land in the consolidation area ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Once the decision to open proceedings has become final , the agricultural authority ascertains who are the occupiers of the land and assesses its value ( sections CARDINAL and DATE ) . Its decision ( PERSON ) determines the value of the land in accordance with precise statutory criteria ( LAW CARDINAL ) . Each of the landowners involved may challenge the valuation not only of his own land but also of the land of the others . Once the agricultural authority \u2019s decision has become final , however , it is binding on all of them .", "CARDINAL . Communal measures ( such as soil improvement , alterations to terrain or landscape ) and communal facilities ( private roads , bridges , ditches , drainage and irrigation ) are ordered , where they are needed , in a specific decision by the relevant authority ( Plan der gemeinsamen ORG ) , which must also settle the question of costs , these usually being shared by the landowners .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under LAW of LAW , land may be provisionally transferred before the adoption of the consolidation scheme , even if some owners object . Decisions by the competent authorities ordering provisional transfers are not appealable ; but section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( ORG , as amended in DATE - \" the CARDINAL/CARDINAL LAW \" ) provides that the final decision shall lie with ORG ( Landesagrarsenat ) , except in cases where an appeal lies to ORG Oberster Agrarsenat - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The main purpose of provisional transfer is to ensure that the consolidation area is rationally cultivated during the interim period . The land transferred becomes the property of the transferees subject to a condition subsequent : ownership of it reverts to the original owner if the allocation is not confirmed in the final consolidation scheme ( NORP unter aufl\u00f6sender PERSON , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . This provisional , conditional ownership is , as a rule , not entered in the land register since it is possible that the parties concerned may be allotted other parcels once the proceedings are completed . ORG has to authorise any entry in the land register ( sections CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the end of the proceedings , the agricultural authority adopts the consolidation scheme ( PERSON , section CARDINAL ) . Since DATE this has to be published within DATE of the final decision provisionally to transfer parcels of land ( section ORG ( CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL LAW ) , failing which the person concerned may request the higher authority to assume jurisdiction . The adoption of the scheme is an administrative act which is supported by maps and other technical data , and whose main function is to determine the compensation due to the landowners who are parties to the proceedings . LAW includes the following regulations on this matter :", "- when compensatory parcels are being determined , regard shall be had to the wishes of the parties directly concerned in so far as this can be done without infringing statutory provisions or interfering with important public interests served by the consolidation scheme ;", "- any landowner whose land is included in the consolidation scheme shall be entitled to compensation in the form of other land of equal value included in the same scheme or , if that is not possible , to be reallocated his previous parcels , including building land ( section DATE ) ;", "- changes in the value of land which come about in the course of the proceedings , including those occurring after the provisional transfer , must be taken into account in the final allocation under the consolidation scheme ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) ;", "- claims for financial compensation have to be submitted within DATE from the date on which the consolidation scheme becomes final ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The legislation of the ORG did not at the material time provide for any financial compensation for damage suffered , before a final consolidation scheme came into force , by landowners who had successfully challenged the lawfulness of compensation received through transfer of land .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following the judgments of ORG DATE in the cases of ORG and PERSON cited above and PERSON GPE ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) , NORP legislation has been amended to the effect , inter alia , that , once it is found that compensatory parcels were not lawfully allocated , the concerned parties may apply for financial compensation ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ) . The new legislation came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The first - instance authority in GPE is ORG , which is a purely administrative body .

By section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL LAW , the boards take their decisions after a private hearing .
