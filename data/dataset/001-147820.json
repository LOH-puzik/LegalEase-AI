NORP The applicant was employed by the C. company from DATE to DATE . On DATE he attended a trade show for young entrepreneurs and gave an interview to a journalist . In this interview , he stated that in his opinion it was only possible to develop ideas in one \u2019s own company , whereas this was difficult when working for an enterprise . He further declared that he intended to set up his own company together with a partner . He explained that they were not discouraged by the fact that a loan and a lot of work input was required . This statement was quoted on DATE in the DATE newspaper \u201c PERSON \u201d in a report on the topic why young people dared to become self - employed , under the headline \u201c We simply want more freedom \u201d . CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s superiors read the newspaper article and confronted the applicant with it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was told that the company wished to end the working contract . In order not to harm his future career , his superior advised him to either give notice out of his own motion , or end the contract in mutual consent ( einvernehmliche PERSON ) . If he did not choose CARDINAL of the CARDINAL options , the company would dismiss him .", "CARDINAL . After having reflected on the options , the applicant ended the contract in mutual consent with the company by a signed agreement dated CARDINAL DATE . The parties agreed that the contract ended on DATE and that the applicant received the statutory dismissal pay ( gesetzliche GPE ) of CARDINAL months\u2019 salary . They agreed that the applicant was off duty from DATE on . The parties however did not agree on the payment of a compensation for the dismissal of the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG upheld the decision on the merits and the value at issue , holding that the value as set by the first instance court was not against the law .
