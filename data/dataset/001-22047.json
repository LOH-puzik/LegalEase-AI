FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The CARDINAL applicants are NORP nationals , born in DATE and DATE respectively . The first applicant is a technical salesman and lives in GPE . The second applicant is an electromechanical engineer . He is the husband of the third applicant , who is a sales representative . They live in FAC ( Val - de - Marne ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants were hired in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively by a company called Mole Richardson GPE whose object was the manufacture , sale and hire of lighting and cinematographic equipment . The collective agreement applicable to the CARDINAL applicants was the CARDINAL for the metalworking industry .", "In DATE FAC GPE transferred its manufacturing department and part of its sales department to a company called ORG . The employment contracts of the staff employed in connection with the activities which had not been transferred , including the applicants\u2019 contracts , were transferred to ORG", "In DATE ORG transferred its ORG branch to a company called ORG , which was not subject to any collective agreement . The following year ORG closed down its ORG establishment .", "On DATE the second applicant was made redundant . On DATE the company obtained administrative authorisation to serve a redundancy notice on the other CARDINAL applicants , who , in their capacity as staff representatives , were protected employees . On DATE the company made them redundant on the ground that the establishment employing them had been closed down .", "On DATE the applicants lodged an application with the ORG for an order requiring their former employer to pay them all the sums due under their contract , pursuant to the provisions of the collective agreement for the metalworking industry .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG claims in their entirety and awarded costs against them . The tribunal found , inter alia , that while ORG had taken over PERSON assets and the employment contracts had been transferred to the new employer , the latter was not subject to the application of any collective agreement , \u201c the transfer of a contract under ... Employment Code [ not entailing ] the preservation of all previously obtaining advantages \u201d .", "The applicants appealed to ORG . They submitted in their grounds of appeal that ORG was obliged to apply the collective agreement for the metalworking industry because , in accordance with the provisions of an Act of DATE , that agreement continued to be effective for DATE following the transfer . They also submitted that their redundancies had breached ORG DATE relating to the information to be given to employees in the event of transfers of undertakings ( Directive no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG of DATE ) . The applicants complained , in particular , that , in breach of the directive , it was only their salary slips that had officially informed them , at DATE , of the transfer of FAC to ORG .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision that there had been genuine and substantial grounds for making the applicants redundant . It went on to hold that the applicants could not rely on the application of the collective agreement for the metalworking industry at the time of their redundancy because the transfer to ORG of FAC activity and equipment had taken place on DATE , that is , before they had been made redundant . Accordingly , ORG concluded that the applicants could not rely on the collective agreement for the calculation of their redundancy pay because their right to compensation had arisen when the agreement had ceased to be effective . Consequently , it dismissed the ORG claims and awarded costs against them . ORG did not deal with the ground of appeal relating to a breach of the NORP directive .", "The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG . In their grounds of appeal they complained , inter alia , that ORG judgment had not dealt with \u201c important points of law based on NORP obligations with regard to the ORG \u201d . They submitted that , accordingly , ORG had failed to comply with its obligations under LAW .", "In its defence pleadings , ORG , replying to the arguments put forward by the applicants \u2013 and after noting that \u201c the appellant complains that the decision did not deal with his objection based on a breach of ORG DATE \u201d \u2013 submitted :", "\u201c ... apart from the fact that it is not clear in which pleadings this point was raised , it should be reiterated that the judges of fact have a duty to deal only with genuine grounds , defined as the statement of a fact on the basis of which , using legal reasoning , the party intends to demonstrate the merits of a claim or defence . Even supposing that the employee did raise the point , he did not draw any legal inference from the alleged breach of the directive . It was therefore a mere argument which the judges of fact did not have to deal with \u201d .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeals . In particular , the ground of appeal based on a breach of the NORP directive was declared inadmissible on the ground \u201c that it does not appear either from the impugned decision or the pleadings that [ the applicants ] relied , before the judges of fact , on a breach of ORG DATE on the information to be given to employees in the event of transfers of undertakings ; it is therefore a new ground of appeal and CARDINAL of mixed fact and law ... \u201d .", "New Code of Civil Procedure", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c ... new grounds of appeal shall not be admissible before ORG .

Grounds of appeal arising out of the decision being challenged . \u201d", "That provision enshrines traditional case - law according to which ORG was instituted only to assess , from a legal perspective , judgments delivered at last instance . It is thus impossible to raise before ORG new grounds which have not been dealt with before the judges of fact . According to the established case - law of ORG , a ground which has not been raised before the judges of fact and is of mixed fact and law is a new ground ( see , to that effect , PERSON . App .
