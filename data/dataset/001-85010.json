On DATE Flux published an article entitled \u201c The Sabbath of the parvenus \u201d . It reported the alleged TIME enrichment of the Speaker of ORG , the President of ORG faction and the son of the President of GPE . The idea of the article was that before becoming public figures they had all been simple citizens without any significant fortune ; however , their fortunes had considerably increased after ORG had won the elections and they had become public figures .", "CARDINAL . The summary reads as follows :", "\u201c DATE I was editing a news item concerning the CARDINAL luxury cars used by the Speaker of ORG , PERSON , and I became more and more convinced that the term ' parvenu ' had NORP origins . Our political scene is full of examples .", "For example , the first thing done by E .O. after becoming Speaker of ORG , was to solve her housing problem . By abusing her position she was able to lay her hands on a huge apartment in downtown PERSON , paid for by public money . Who was PERSON before becoming Speaker ? A modest baker with a modest work history . Who is she now ? A big boss ! She can not fit into a ORG and so she also needs a ORG . Let 's take another example .", "Who was PERSON before becoming an MP ? A simple schoolteacher in the village of ORG with a modest IQ and a little bit hysterical . Who is he now ? He is not only a PERSON of the ORG , namely a dictator without whose approval even the flies do not fly in the ORG building , but also a prosperous businessman . He is an agent at the PERSON tobacco factory , he has made enormous profits from the sale of cigarettes , he owns buses , he controls the PERSON - Ialoveni bus route , and in general he looks like a genuine NORP dandy with a silk tie , NORP suits , NORP shoes and dirt under his nails .", "Who was PERSON before his father PERSON became the President of GPE ? A novice businessman specialised in the milking of profits from sugar plants in the north of the country . Who is he now ? He is the most prosperous businessman in the country . He is the majority shareholder of bank PERSON , the owner of construction company M , has contracts with the ORG worth CARDINAL and does business with PERSON tobacco factory . He is a star and a VIP of the financial press and is held up as an example to young businessmen .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Stepaniuc , the leader of the NORP parliamentary faction which had , at the time , CARDINAL votes out of a total of CARDINAL in ORG , lodged an action against the applicant newspaper . He did not pay any court fee when lodging his complaint , nor did he appear in court at any stage of the proceedings or delegate anyone to represent him . He argued , inter alia , that :", "\u201c ... the defendants disseminated false and defamatory information about me ...", "... Both in the title and in the body of the article I am described as follows : ' a dictator without whose approval even the flies do not fly in the ORG building , but also a prosperous businessman . He is an agent at the PERSON tobacco factory , he has made enormous profits from the sale of cigarettes , he owns buses , controls the PERSON - PERSON bus - line , and in general he looks like a genuine PERSON with a silk tie , NORP suits , NORP shoes and dirt under his nails . '", "None of these accusations is true and they are nothing more than dirty slander . \u201d", "Mr ORG asked the court to declare the above statements defamatory , to make the defendants publish a retraction on the same page of the newspaper and pay him compensation in the amount of the maximum provided for by LAW .", "CARDINAL . The case was put before Judge PERSON , the President of ORG at the time for examination .", "CARDINAL . In its defence the applicant newspaper presented the court with copies of open letters addressed to the President of GPE by a transport company in which Mr PERSON was accused of appropriating several of its bus routes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant newspaper informed the court that the information concerning Mr ORG 's involvement in illegal activities in the tobacco business had been obtained from sources in the NORP secret service and submitted that the secret service had prepared a report about the alleged involvement of high - ranking officials in illegal activities at the PERSON tobacco factory . The applicant newspaper informed the court that it had officially requested a copy of the report and asked that the case be adjourned until the secret service had provided the court with such a copy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON rejected the request to adjourn the case until after the secret service had provided the court with a copy of its report ; however , he did order that the examination be postponed until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant newspaper informed the court that the secret service had failed to reply to its request and that consequently it had commenced a court action seeking an order to provide it with a copy of the report . The applicant newspaper requested that the defamation proceedings be adjourned pending the conclusion of those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE and on DATE Judge PERSON held hearings in the case and rejected the request for adjournment pending the conclusion of the other set of proceedings . He decided though to postpone the examination of the case until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON examined the case in the absence of the parties and ruled in favour of Mr Stepaniuc . He found the statements complained of by the plaintiff ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to be defamatory and ordered the newspaper and the author of the article to pay Mr Stepaniuc CARDINAL,CARDINAL NORP lei ( MDL ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) at the time ) and LAW ( ORG CARDINAL at the time ) respectively . He also ordered the newspaper to issue an apology within DATE . The defendants were also ordered to pay the court fees .", "CARDINAL . NORP Judge GPE gave the following reasons for his findings :", "\u201c In the court 's view , the title , the text and the meaning of the published information should be qualified as defamatory of the plaintiff because the defendants made statements of facts without adducing any evidence . In particular they submitted that ORG , contrary to the provisions of LAW , practises activities which are incompatible with his status of deputy and that he is an agent of the tobacco factory , makes enormous profits from trading cigarettes , and that he controls the PERSON - Ialoveni bus route .", "During the examination of the case , the court had given the defendants the opportunity to present evidence ... however , neither the newspaper , nor the author brought any evidence to confirm the truthfulness of the published information . Nor in the article itself did the defendants adduce any evidence .", "[ a reproduction of LAW follows ]", "In the present case the information disseminated by the defendants can not be treated as a value judgment and accordingly it can not be protected by the provisions of the ORG stated above . The court also takes into consideration the fact that Mr ORG is a public figure and that in respect of such persons a higher degree of tolerance is required when it comes to defamation . However , the information spread by the defendants clearly exceeds the limits of any reasonable criticism against public persons in a NORP society . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant newspaper appealed against this judgment , arguing , inter alia , that Judge PERSON had lacked independence and impartiality on the ground of his close ties with Mr PERSON and ORG and his behaviour in other defamation cases between Mr ORG . The applicant newspaper also argued that the first - instance court had totally disregarded its arguments , namely the letters addressed to the President of GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and refused to give it a chance to bring evidence concerning Mr PERSON 's involvement in the tobacco business , by refusing to adjourn the case until after the end of the proceedings between PERSON and the secret service . The applicant newspaper also argued that its characterisation given to PERSON in the impugned article was a value judgment and that it could not be required to prove its truth .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of the first - instance court while repeating that the applicant newspaper had not adduced any evidence in support of its statements about Mr Stepaniuc . It did not refer to any of the arguments referred to in the applicant newspaper 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant newspaper lodged an appeal on points of law . It argued , inter alia , that Judge PERSON lacked independence and impartiality and that the lower courts had refused to adjourn the proceedings until after the end of the proceedings between LOC and the secret service , thus affecting the fairness of the proceedings . The applicant newspaper informed ORG that it had finally managed to obtain a copy of an annex to the report concerning illegal activities at the PERSON tobacco factory from the secret service and had attached it to its appeal . The annex was entitled \u201c scheme of the criminal interactions between the tobacco gangs \u201d and presented by means of a chart , the alleged interactions between the administration of the PERSON tobacco factory , CARDINAL criminal gangs , several companies and various high - ranking officials , including Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reduced the compensation to be paid to Mr Stepaniuc by the newspaper and the author of the article to MDL CARDINAL and MDL CARDINAL respectively . It argued that Mr ORG was a public figure and therefore had to be more tolerant towards the press and , moreover , had failed to appear before the courts . ORG did not , however , depart from the findings of the first CARDINAL instances in respect of the merits of the case and did not examine any of the applicant newspaper 's arguments .", "CARDINAL .
