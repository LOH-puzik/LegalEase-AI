He was again detained on DATE and was still in detention there when the parties submitted their observations .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that ORG had been overcrowded which , in addition to causing poor sanitary conditions , had resulted in the deterioration of their already fragile health . They maintained that all of them had been detained in hospital wards which had measured CARDINAL sq . m and which had been occupied by CARDINAL detainees on average for the period DATE . In addition , the second and third applicants had been detained in cells measuring QUANTITY m and which had held CARDINAL inmates . They further argued that they had not been able to move freely within the wards owing to the space occupied by furniture . In particular , bunk beds were not used in FAC and extra furniture , such as medical equipment , was required ; therefore CARDINAL the area of each ward had been occupied by furniture , which had resulted in them having a personal space in which they could move freely of below QUANTITY m.", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned conditions had led them to receiving inadequate health care . There had been a high risk of infection with contagious diseases as there had not been effective separation of detainees according to the disease from which they had suffered . In addition , CARDINAL toilets had been available for the detainees in a total of CARDINAL wards on the first floor .", "CARDINAL . Meals had been insufficient and of poor quality and the absence of recreational activities had affected their psychological health . Central heating had been inadequate and collection of rubbish , especially in the kitchens , had not been sufficient , creating hygiene problems and resulting in bad smells and the presence of pests . The applicants also complained of the lack of medical staff and properly equipped laboratories for their medical examinations . In particular , during the period DATE - CARDINAL only CARDINAL general practitioner had been available to the hospital .", "CARDINAL . The applicants acknowledged that the conditions of their detention had improved in DATE and that the medical - staff numbers had increased , resulting in conditions which met the requirements of LAW but only for the period after DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint with ORG under LAW , to which they have not received any reply to date .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , ORG official capacity was CARDINAL patients and at the time of the applicants\u2019 detention the hospital had held CARDINAL patients . Specifically as regards the applicants , some of them had been detained in wards CARDINAL and CARDINAL on the first floor of the hospital and some others in wards CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL on the second floor . The wards measured CARDINAL sq . m each , and each of them hosted CARDINAL to CARDINAL detainees . Therefore , the personal space available to them ranged from QUANTITY . m to QUANTITY m. It was also noted that toilets had been in the corridors , not inside the wards , which had remained unlocked so as to ensure unobstructed access to the bathrooms .", "CARDINAL . ORG was an establishment providing primary medical care by operating as a clinic . Detainees who required more intense or specialised care were referred to public hospitals , a procedure which was used for the third , fourth , ninth , fifteenth and seventeenth applicants . The patients were separated by disease . They were examined regularly by doctors and they were submitted often to general and specialised laboratory examinations .", "CARDINAL . Wards were sufficiently ventilated and heated and had adequate natural light via CARDINAL large windows . Hot water was ensured by solar water heaters and by boilers which operated for TIME . Wards were regularly cleaned by cleaning crews consisting of detainees and disinfected by specialist companies . The hospital \u2019s social service provided personal hygiene products to detainees who could not afford them . All wards and corridors had rubbish bins which were emptied regularly .", "CARDINAL . As regards detainees\u2019 meals , they were designed under medical supervision to ensure that patients received all necessary nutrients . The Government submitted the menu of DATE to demonstrate that they had been comprised of a variety of food .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , detainees were not obliged to spend DATE in the wards ; on the contrary , they could move along the corridors and spend time in the yard . Various recreational activities were organised and detainees had had the opportunity to enrol in educational programmes since DATE . Detainees were also granted DATE of leave that they could spend outside the prison hospital ; the third , fifth and eleventh applicants had benefitted from such leave .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , according to the ORG , during DATE and DATE conditions of detention in FAC were drastically improved . That was mainly due to measures taken to reduce overcrowding in prisons under PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which provided for early release schemes . In DATE a women \u2019s ward had been opened at the hospital and work had been carried out to improve the facilities . In addition , new and updated medical equipment was procured and medical - staff numbers had been reinforced by the recruitment of CARDINAL new doctors of various specialties . The Government specified that all the above - mentioned improvements had made ORG a detention facility significantly different to the image given in ORG ( ORG ) report , which had been prepared on the basis of a visit in DATE , that is to say on DATE that had no relevance to the present case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
