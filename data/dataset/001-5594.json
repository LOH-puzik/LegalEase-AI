TURKEY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Wilhelmina Thomassen", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and currently living in GPE , GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by Mr GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was a client of the ORG branch of ORG ( ORG : hereinafter \u201c the defendant \u201d ) .", "On DATE the applicant sought to withdraw the balance on the bank accounts which he had opened with the defendant namely , MONEY ( ORG ) and PERSON ( DEM ) . The bank refused to comply with his request giving as its reason that there was no longer any balance left on the accounts since all amounts previously deposited had been withdrawn .", "The applicant brought legal proceedings against the defendant before the CARDINALrd ORG of GPE ( PERSON ) .", "During the proceedings the court appointed experts to look into the defendant \u2019s accounts . The experts could not identify the existence of any document or record proving that the applicant had been paid the sum of USD MONEY from his accounts . Although the defendant had not been able at the start of the trial to supply any documents signed by the applicant in the form of bills , checks or payment orders , it submitted a report dated CARDINAL DATE indicating the existence of \u201c a general release \u201d ( genel ibraname ) which the applicant had signed on CARDINAL DATE affirming that he had irrevocably released the defendant from its obligation to pay him the money which he had deposited with it .", "The applicant contended that the defendant forged the so - called general release after he instituted proceedings against it . He maintained that the defendant , using a typewriter , filled in a blank page which he had signed and lodged with the defendant \u2019s Mecidiyek\u00f6y branch . The applicant claimed that he had done so since he had trusted the defendant \u2019s branch manager at the time and considered that this was in the interests of the smooth running of his financial dealings . He noted that the typed wording of general release bore a misspelling of his last name ( \u201c LOC \u201d instead of \u201c LOC ) . The applicant argued before the court that notwithstanding the existence of the so - called \u201c general release \u201d of DATE , the defendant had nevertheless made him a payment from his account no . DATE on DATE in the sum of ORG CARDINAL .", "During the proceedings before the CARDINALrd ORG of GPE the applicant requested that witnesses be heard by the court on the matter of the validity of the release . He submitted an expert legal opinion to the court stating that the court could only properly assess the applicant \u2019s claim by hearing evidence other than the general release letter . The applicant \u2019s request was refused .", "The experts commissioned by the CARDINALrd ORG of GPE on the matter of the alleged falsity of the general release letter stated in a report dated DATE that they \u201c did not find any proof that the disputed document had been prepared later by filling in blank pages signed by the applicant \u201d . The experts who investigated the history of the applicant \u2019s deposit accounts found that \u201c the bank had paid all sums of money , totalling ORG CARDINAL , without the applicant having signed any check , payment order or other document \u201d . As to the \u201c general release letter \u201d the experts concluded that : \u201c the existence of this release may legitimately close the accounts and bring to an end the bank \u2019s obligation to pay money out of them . \u201d The experts also stated that the general release letter had been signed by hand whereas the actual wording of the letter had been typed . This made it impossible to determine whether the wording used in the general release letter had been inserted after it had been signed by the applicant , as he alleged .", "In its judgment of DATE , the CARDINALrd ORG of GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . It found inter alia that there was no evidence to prove that the release given to the defendant by the applicant was a blank page which had been filled in later or that he had intended a signed blank page to be used by the bank for another transaction . The court found that although some of the documents concerning the payments made to the applicant did not bear the applicant \u2019s signature these documents were nonetheless valid having regard to his general release letter of DATE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG arguing that the judgment of the CARDINALrd ORG had not clarified a number of legal issues . The applicant requested ORG to examine the merits of these issues and to address them specifically and separately .", "The CARDINALth ORG of ORG upheld the decision of the CARDINALrd ORG of GPE . The ORG found that the applicant \u2019s release letter relieved the defendant from the obligation to make payments to him from his account . The court considered the applicant \u2019s argument that he had given the release to the defendant in the form of a blank page for the purposes of a banking transaction . The court noted that the CARDINALrd ORG of GPE appointed a group of experts to inquire into the allegation that the document had been unlawfully filled in at a later stage . However , the court - appointed experts found no evidence of forgery . The court also considered the issue whether the document could be regarded as a lawful release under NORP law . It noted that , according to doctrine , a release of debt was accepted as one of the ways of discharging a debt . The court concluded that the release letter showed that it was the intention of the applicant to discharge the debt owed to him by the defendant . Furthermore the release had complied with the requirements of the relevant provisions of LAW ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL judge dissented , being of the opinion that the first instance court should have allowed witnesses to be heard on behalf of the applicant . The judge also noted that there were indications that the general receipt could have been forged and that it was not normal practice for a bank to pay out money to a client without having a trace of his signature . The judge was not prepared to accept the defendant \u2019s argument that it had paid money in good faith from the applicant \u2019s account after the date indicated on the general release letter .", "On DATE the CARDINALth ORG of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for rectification of its earlier judgment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
