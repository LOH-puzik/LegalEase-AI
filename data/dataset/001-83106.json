MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( GPE ) . He is the director of the second applicant , ORG , a limited liability company located in GPE . The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr PERSON and PERSON , both lawyers practising in GPE ( GPE ) . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Attorney General .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant is the owner of a real estate in GPE . In his capacity as company director the first applicant was given authority to obtain from the administration , the authorisations needed for carrying out building work .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( the \u201c LAW \u201d ) issued a permit in which it authorised the first applicant \u201c to demolish the existing buildings and to re - erect ground floor and mezzanine shopping arcades with overlying flats and garages at basement level ... PERSON of building should not exceed CARDINAL floors plus underlying basement \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants this permit and the plans attached approved CARDINAL basement car park , a ground floor and mezzanine shopping arcade , and CARDINAL levels of flats . According to the Government this permit and the plans attached approved \u201c CARDINAL basement car park , a ground floor and mezzanine shopping arcade , and CARDINAL levels of flats \u201d . The Government noted that in the approved plans the seventh level was deleted by shading it in yellow . The parties appear to have become aware of these diverging views only during the proceedings before this ORG .", "CARDINAL . This permit was valid for DATE , and the work as the first applicant believed it to have been authorised was carried out within that period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new permit was issued , since an application had been made for a further permit connected to the same development but from a different side of the site ( PERSON ) . In so far as relevant , the first applicant was authorised \u201c to demolish the existing building and to re - erect CARDINAL basement / garages for private cars , plus ground floor shopping arcades ( double height ) ... with overlying flats ( CARDINAL floors ) including washrooms ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and the ORG agreed that the CARDINAL permit applications in DATE and DATE were substantially identical , except for the development on PERSON , which was not at issue . Both applications were for a development of a ground floor of a height of CARDINAL normal floors and CARDINAL upper floors of normal height , therefore a total height of CARDINAL normal floors .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the permit issued on DATE , the Government confirmed the wording quoted above and added that in CARDINAL of the drawings constituting the plans , the seventh floor had been erroneously reinserted while the applicants submitted that the ambiguous deletion of part of the mezzanine floor had been eliminated , but that the sixth floor had been deleted .", "CARDINAL . The applicants alleged that they had developed the site according to the permits and according to the plans approved by the LAW . The Government contested this on the basis of their exposition of the facts .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , the LAW issued of its own motion another permit in the name of the first applicant to remedy the situation created by the permit of DATE . In so far as relevant , this permit of CARDINAL DATE authorised the first applicant to develop the site in question in a different manner in particular \u201c to demolish existing building and to re - erect basement garages for private cars , plus CARDINAL floors shopping arcade ( including a ground floor of double height ) ... with overlying flats ( CARDINAL floors ) and washrooms \u201d . It was also stated that the plans which had been issued with the permit of DATE were being replaced .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the issue of the permit of CARDINAL DATE was meant to correct an oversight which had occurred during the drafting of the permit of DATE . On that occasion the LAW had deleted CARDINAL of the floors , marked as a mezzanine floor , from the plans submitted by the applicants . However , because of a clerical error , this deletion was not reflected in the permit of DATE . The applicants submitted that it was not possible for them to know whether the authorisation to build a mezzanine floor was due , as the ORG stated , to an \u201c oversight \u201d . They later stated that according to them the authorisation to construct apartments on the sixth floor and to build a mezzanine floor had been revoked .", "CARDINAL . The change in the building specifications was not notified to the applicants , who were not informed that the LAW was reconsidering the permits already issued to them . However , the permit of DATE was sent to the ORG architect , who on DATE requested the Chairman of the LAW to reconsider the permit in issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( the \u201c MEPA \u201d ) replied that ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) had decided that the permit of DATE should stand as issued .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that it was unclear to them and to their architect that the request of CARDINAL DATE was being considered by the ORG , which never invited them to present oral or written submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when over DATE had passed since the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE holding that the permit of CARDINAL DATE should stand as issued , the ORG issued an enforcement notice ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It observed that the \u201c seventh \u201d floor and the washrooms on the top floor were not covered by a development permit . The applicants were ordered to demolish those parts of the development already completed which were not authorised by the permit of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant appealed against this notice before ORG , which rejected his claim in a decision of DATE . ORG held that the only valid building permit was that issued on DATE and that the plans submitted by the applicants and the permits previously granted on the basis of these plans were not in conformity with the law .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant referred his case to ORG . He argued that the original permit had never been validly revoked . However , on DATE this appeal was adjourned sine die at the first applicant \u2019s request by reason of the fact that a constitutional claim , having a bearing on the proceedings before ORG , had been filed before ORG ( FAC ) . According to the information provided by the Government in DATE , at that date the proceedings before ORG had not been reactivated .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the ORG had issued against the applicants another enforcement notice ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , in relation to an illegal development of the facade of the building , which the applicants did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicants asserted that on the basis of the permits of DATE and of CARDINAL DATE they had undertaken several obligations vis - \u00e0 - vis third parties , including leases and sales , and had provided funding for the planned construction work . Due to the partial revocation of these permits , the applicants were unable to honour their obligations , thus suffering a significant financial loss .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( FAC ) . He alleged that the revocation of the permit of DATE by means of the issuing of the new permit of CARDINAL DATE had violated his right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions , guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL . He also requested that the permit of DATE be declared null and void . He further alleged that he had been denied a fair hearing since the LAW had failed to notify him of the changes in the permit and he had had no opportunity to make any submissions before the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the complaint on procedural grounds . It observed that the first applicant had brought his claim against the ORG ; however , this body was not a successor of the ORG which had issued the permit of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG observed that the aim of constitutional proceedings was to afford the highest judicial protection against a violation of fundamental rights , with the least formality and the maximum efficiency . ORG were not obliged to indicate with certainty those responsible for the violation . Therefore , nothing prevented ORG from precisely identifying those who were responsible for the violation alleged and from authorising the first applicant to bring an action against them . ORG therefore sent the file back to ORG , ordering that the case be continued according to law .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG refused to exercise its constitutional jurisdiction on the ground that the first applicant had used and was using ordinary remedies in order to protect his fundamental rights . ORG observed that the first applicant had requested the ORG to reconsider his case . There was still a possibility that this request would be accepted and an appeal was available to the first applicant in case of refusal . Moreover , the first applicant had appealed to ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal and confirmed ORG judgment . It observed that in the interests of the administration of justice , the constitutional courts should not be burdened with cases which might be dealt with by other courts or for which there were other remedies available under the domestic legislation . The first applicant \u2019s claim was that by reason of the issuing of the permit of DATE he was obliged to change what he had already developed or had planned to develop according to the previous permits . Therefore , a request for reconsideration of the case and the possibility of being granted a new permit were effective remedies available to the first applicant at the time of the introduction of his constitutional claim before ORG . In respect of his complaint regarding a fair hearing , it held that his complaint was against the ORG and not the LAW ; thus , the remedy he was seeking before ORG was different from that sought before ORG , and therefore the applicant was still making use of ordinary remedies and the ORG could not exercise its constitutional jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the first applicant had submitted a \u201c full development application \u201d to the ORG , requesting the retention of the mezzanine floor and to be authorised to change the top floor from washrooms to penthouses . This request was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the first applicant asked for a reconsideration of his request . His claim was upheld and on DATE a new building permit was issued .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE building development permits were regulated by Part I of the Code of Police Laws . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that Code provided :", "\u201c The Minister responsible for public works may , prior to the preparation , publication or approval of a scheme , order by notice in ORG the whole or any part of GPE to be a planning area ; and from the date of any such order no person shall lay out , construct or close any street , or erect any building or increase the height of or otherwise modify any existing building , or change the use of any land or building in any part of such area ( whether or not an approved scheme exists in respect thereof ) without a permit from the Minister responsible for public works who may , in his discretion , refuse the grant of a permit or , in granting it , impose such conditions as in his discretion he may deem proper . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister responsible for public works could delegate all or any of his powers to a body known as ORG ( the \u201c LAW \u201d ) . However , this body was abolished by the DATE LAW ( which entered into force on DATE ) , and a new autonomous public authority with the power to issue building permits , ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , was set up . According to ORG ( see judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON v. ORG ) the ORG \u201c enjoyed original powers even in relation to a development which occurred before the coming into force of Act I of DATE , and not continuing powers as a successor of the LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Section QUANTITY CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW provide :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If an applicant considers that conditions imposed upon a development permission , or a refusal of such a permission , is unreasonable he may , without prejudice to his right of appeal , either request the ORG or the ORG , as the case may be , to reconsider its decision or he may lodge an appeal with ORG ... A request for reconsideration shall not be made currently with an appeal . A request for reconsideration and an appeal under this sub - section , as the case may be , shall be made within DATE of receipt of the decision of the ORG or of the ORG , as the case may be .
