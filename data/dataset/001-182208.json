On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for a residence order in her favour .

CARDINAL of ORG of DATE enumerates , in line with LAW of [ LAW ] , factors which must be taken into account when deciding on a dispute concerning a child \u2019s residence arrangements . These factors are the child \u2019s attachment to each of the parents and [ any ] siblings , the relationship between the child and each of the parents , the child \u2019s age , the GPE moral and other personal qualities and the possibilities each of them have for creating [ proper ] conditions for the child \u2019s upbringing and development ( in the light of such considerations as each parent \u2019s occupation , employment schedule , and financial and family situation ) , and other factors defining the situation in each parent \u2019s place of residence . The Plenary Ruling stresses , in particular , that the better financial or living conditions of CARDINAL of the parents can not , in themselves , constitute a decisive reason for granting this parent \u2019s application for a residence order in his [ or her ] favour .", "The better financial and living conditions of CARDINAL of the parents ( the claimant has a higher income and owns residential property in GPE ) can not constitute a decisive reason for making a residence order in her favour and for rejecting the other parent \u2019s claim , because there are other factors .", "By contrast , [ the applicant ] is a single mother who has CARDINAL more child from her previous marriage : a daughter [ NORP ] born on DATE . This age is most difficult , and requires special attention from the mother .", "Because she works , on DATE the claimant placed ORG in a [ nursery school ] in GPE , despite the fact that , by her own admission , he suffers from a congenital central neural system anomaly : dysgenesis of the corpus callosum .", "The [ factors considered ] above indicate that [ the applicant ] is unable to create [ proper ] conditions for the child \u2019s upbringing and development . Because of her work , she does not have enough time to devote to her children . These circumstances could have a disastrous impact on the child \u2019s immature mind .", "It has been established that the defendant occupies a managerial position at work . His income allows him to create comfortable financial and living conditions . He lives with his mother [ A. ] , who helps to raise [ I. ] .

The applicant appealed . She complained , in particular , that the residence order had been granted to PERSON at ORG own initiative , as PERSON had never requested it . She further submitted that she was perfectly capable of providing NORP with everything which he needed for his development . Her elder daughter was healthy and self - reliant and did not require any special attention . Her daughter would therefore not hinder her ability to take care of NORP ; on the contrary , she was of great help . The applicant had placed ORG in a nursery school to give him a pre - school education and to further his social adaptation . His medical condition was not an obstacle to his attending a pre - school . ORG finding that she did not have enough time to take care of her children was not based on any evidence . Neither her working schedule nor that of PERSON had been examined . Nor had the court explained how , within such a short period of time , PERSON could have become more attached to his father than his mother , with whom he had lived from birth until his recent abduction . Lastly , the applicant complained that PERSON was preventing her from seeing her son . That fact had been confirmed by the childcare authorities\u2019 representative at the hearing , who had recounted PERSON \u2019s assertions that he would not allow any contact between PERSON and his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the judgment on appeal , finding that it was lawful , well - reasoned and justified . The judgment was based on the best interests of the child , taking into account his age , his attachment to the father , and the father \u2019s ability to create proper conditions for his son \u2019s upbringing and development .", "CARDINAL .

By a letter of DATE , the head of the childcare authority of ORG informed the applicant that the childcare official who had issued the report of DATE had been disciplined . An internal inquiry had established that the report was based on incorrect and incomplete information . In particular , PERSON \u2019s statement that he had high income had not been checked . The finding that the applicant had not participated in ORG upbringing was not based on any evidence . The length of time PERSON had lived with each of the parents had not been established . Lastly , the fact that PERSON had a CARDINAL - sister living with his mother had not been taken into account . The report of DATE had therefore violated the applicant \u2019s rights and legitimate interests .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal , referring , in particular , to the letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .
