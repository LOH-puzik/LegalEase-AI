ORG also held that the applicant had not refused to undergo a medical examination , and criticised the INML report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) on the ground that it had ignored the applicant \u2019s allegations that his eardrum had been perforated because he had been beaten up by members of the intervention squad .", "CARDINAL .
