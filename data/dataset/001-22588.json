SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE of GPE ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is an employee of ORG and a trade - union representative elected by the council employees .", "In DATE , in his capacity as a trade - union representative , the applicant asked the mayor to grant him CARDINAL ORG paid leave for trade - union activities for DATE . That request was turned down by the mayor . The applicant sought judicial review of that decision by ORG which , in a judgment of DATE granted his application , quashed the impugned decision and made a declaration that he was entitled to the requested paid leave . Following an exchange of correspondence between the applicant and the mayor , the latter granted the applicant the requested leave on DATE but required him to account for his time . By a memorandum dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant stated that he had spent the time he had been allocated studying new legislation on trade - union elections and its consequences on collective bargaining . On DATE the mayor decided to deduct CARDINAL days\u2019 pay from the applicant \u2019s wages for the time he had spent studying the legislation on trade - union elections , on the ground that it had been spent in his own interest rather than in that of the staff he represented . The mayor considered that the applicant should have used his own time if his aim was personal development . If , on the other hand , he wished to improve his vocational skills , he should have attended CARDINAL of the courses available .", "The applicant sought judicial review of that decision , considering that it ran counter to the right to trade - union freedom guaranteed by LAW . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed his application , holding that studying provisions of trade - union law was a private activity that could not be carried out at the taxpayer \u2019s expense . It said , inter alia :", "\u201c All this occurred in the context of appalling relations between the council and its employee , who had devoted his time over DATE to making scores of applications for judicial review on the most tenuous of grounds or on the slightest pretext , thereby demonstrating the lack of any common ground between the parties . That situation left the applicant dissatisfied and ill at ease with his work and his output was no more than the bare minimum . In the tense , antagonistic climate that prevailed between colleagues who were duty bound to cooperate and serve the general interest , the sole solution is to apply the law to the letter ... In that regard , it is clear that Mr PERSON has no absolute right to paid leave from work to allow him to train and learn about recent legal issues ... That is a private activity that should not be conducted at the taxpayer \u2019s expense . \u201d", "The applicant lodged an appeal against that judgment , in which he relied on Articles CARDINAL ( right to a fair trial ) and CARDINAL ( right to trade - union freedom ) of the LAW . By a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal as being unfounded , holding that ORG had applied the legislation without undermining the essence of the fundamental right to trade - union freedom .", "LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE on ORG , the Determination of Working Conditions and Staff Participation in Public Authorities provides that staff representatives shall be granted a number of ORG paid leave for trade - union activities . According to the applicant , the Act did not specify the trade - union activities for which paid leave was available ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
