The second applicant lives in GPE , whereas the others live in GPE , both in the Former GPE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , one of the applicants , a retired lawyer from GPE .", "The applicants\u2019 children , after attaining DATE , joined the monastic order of ORG . The applicants admit that they themselves are practising NORP . They allege that some of their children left their homes and joined the monastic order without the ORG prior knowledge or consent .", "In DATE the applicants lodged a complaint before ORG ( \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u043d\u0430 ORG ) , requesting it to assess the constitutionality of the internal rules of ORG ) , in particular LAW , CARDINAL and CARDINAL . In their submissions the applicants complained , inter alia , that they had been deprived of their rights as parents to receive proper care from their children in the event of illness or in old age because the religious canons allegedly forbade contacts between monks and their parents . Furthermore , they argued that the ORG could not establish monasteries as another form of \u201c life community \u201d because the only such form recognised and protected by LAW was the \u201c family \u201d . They argued that the ORG , in claiming ownership of monasteries , which were defined as life communities in its internal rules , was thereby asserting ownership of human beings , so that their children could be regarded as being held in slavery . They further alleged that their children had been deprived of many of their fundamental human rights and freedoms as a result of the monastic canons and the vows they had taken before entering the monasteries .", "On DATE ORG rejected the ORG complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the ORG \u2019s internal rules . In its decision , it referred to and summarised the most relevant provisions of the ORG \u2019s internal rules and quoted the impugned provisions .", "In particular , Rule CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c The monastery is a holy place having a temple and other necessary facilities , i.e. [ it is ] a life community of persons belonging to the monastic order who have joined together in a spiritual community and have taken a holy vow to live in accordance with the monastic canons . \u201d", "Rule CARDINAL provides inter alia :", "\u201c All the possessions of ORG , bishoprics , church communities and monasteries comprise the property of ORG . \u201d", "Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c All churches , monasteries , ... - holy waters , cemeteries and places of NORP worship , and their movable and immovable assets which are under the canonical and spiritual jurisdiction of ORG are the property of ORG . \u201d", "ORG reiterated the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion , and the right of every individual to express his or her faith and religious beliefs freely and publicly , either alone or in community with others . It stated that this freedom entailed the freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion . It further held that the manner in which an individual manifested his or her religious convictions or beliefs was a matter of private conscience , which ultimately determined the relationship between religious communities and the ORG . In that connection , ORG observed that ORG and other religious communities and groups were separate from the ORG and were equal before the law , and none of them could have a distinct and privileged position or be controlled by the ORG .", "ORG further held that the ORG and other religious communities or groups could not be regarded as institutional and formal associations of their adherents and that they had not been established pursuant to the provisions of the PERSON on ORG . It therefore concluded that their internal rules were not a matter for constitutional review , as was the case with political parties , other associations and foundations whose programmes and internal regulations and their compliance with the LAW might be assessed by the court .", "On an unspecified date , most probably in DATE , the applicants lodged a criminal complaint ( \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0432\u0430 ) with ORG ( \u041e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0458\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043c\u0438\u0446\u0430 ) , requesting it to institute criminal proceedings against ORG , who had allegedly held their children in slavery , and had thus committed the criminal offence defined in LAW of LAW .

ORG and other religious communities and groups are separate from the ORG and equal before the law . They are free to establish schools and other social and charitable institutions , by means of a procedure regulated by law .", "LAW CARDINAL of the LAW provides that parents have the right and duty to provide for the nurture and education of their children .
