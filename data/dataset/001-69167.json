The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG ( PERSON ) opened criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of having committed homosexual acts with adolescents contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after having held a trial , convicted the applicant under LAW and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment suspended on probation . It found that , in DATE , he had performed homosexual acts with CARDINAL adolescents .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant 's appeal , ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) requested ORG ( Verfassungs - gerichtshof ) to review the constitutionality of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed this request ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG filed a new request for review of the constitutionality of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court gave a judgment holding that LAW was unconstitutional ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The amendment repealing Article CARDINAL entered into force on DATE . While , according to the transitional provisions , Article CARDINAL remained applicable in all cases in which the judgment at first instance had already been given before the entry into force of the amendment , it could no longer be applied in the applicant 's case since it had been the case in point ( Anla\u00dffall ) before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , noting that ORG had repealed LAW as unconstitutional , acquitted the applicant . This decision was served on him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for reimbursement of his defence costs holding that under LAW ( GPE ) no right to compensation existed if the accused was not punishable on grounds which occurred after the indictment was filed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly granted the applicant 's appeal , awarding him reimbursement of a total amount of QUANTITY ( ORG ) for costs and expenses . It found that ORG had wrongly applied Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . The applicant 's case had been the case in point before the Constitutional Court leading to the repeal of LAW . His case had to be treated as if LAW had never existed . Consequently , it could not be said that he was acquitted on grounds which occurred after the indictment .", "CARDINAL . The court found that the applicant 's defence costs including the costs relating to the proceedings before ORG , in which the applicant , as an interested party ( mitbeteiligte Partei ) , had made detailed submissions , had been necessarily incurred . However , the law provided that only a maximum amount of ORG CARDINAL was to be reimbursed as contribution to the defence costs . In addition ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL were awarded for cash expenses .", "CARDINAL . Any sexual acts with persons DATE are punishable under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , in the version in force at the material time , read as follows :", "\u201c A male person who after attaining DATE fornicates with a person of the same sex who has attained the age of DATE but not the age of CARDINAL shall be sentenced to imprisonment for DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This provision was aimed at consensual homosexual acts , as any sexual act of adults with persons DATE are punishable under LAW if the adult abuses a position of authority ( parent , employer , teacher , doctor , etc . ) . Any sexual acts involving the use of force or threats are punishable as rape , pursuant to LAW , or sexual coercion pursuant to LAW . Consensual heterosexual or lesbian acts between adults and persons over DATE are not punishable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG decided to repeal Article CARDINAL . That amendment , published in ORG ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of PERCENT , ORG found that LAW was compatible with the principle of equality under constitutional law and in particular with the prohibition on gender discrimination contained therein .", "CARDINAL . The relevant passage of ORG judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The development of the criminal law in DATE has shown that the legislature is striving to apply the system of criminal justice in a significantly more restrictive way than before in pursuance of the efforts it is undertaking in connection with its policy on the treatment of offenders , which have become known under the general heading of ' decriminalisation ' . This means that it leaves offences on the statute book or creates new offences only if such punishment of behaviour harmful to society is still found absolutely necessary and indispensable after the strictest criteria have been applied . The criminal provision which has been challenged relates to the group of acts declared unlawful in order to protect \u2013 in so far as strictly necessary DATE a young , maturing person from developing sexually in the wrong way . ( ' Homosexual acts are only offences of relevance to the criminal law inasmuch as a dangerous strain must not be placed by homosexual experiences upon the sexual development of young males ... ' PERSON , in PERSON / PERSON ( publishers ) , PERSON , DATE , paragraph CARDINAL on Article CARDINAL ... ) Seen in this light , it is the conviction of ORG that from the point of view of the principle of equality contained in LAW those legislating in the criminal sphere can not reasonably be challenged for taking the view , by reference to authoritative expert opinions coupled with experience gained , that homosexual influence endangers maturing males to a significantly greater extent than girls of the same age , and concluding that it is necessary to punish under the criminal law homosexual acts committed with young males , as provided for LAW CARDINAL of LAW . This conclusion was also based on their views of morality , which they wanted to impose while duly observing the current policy on criminal justice which aims at moderation and at restricting the punishment of offences ( while carefully weighing up all the manifold advantages and disadvantages ) . Taking everything into account , we are dealing here with a distinction which is based on factual differences and therefore constitutionally admissible from the point of view of LAW read in conjunction with LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed ORG request to review the constitutionality of LAW of LAW .", "ORG had argued , inter alia , that LAW violated Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention as the theory that male adolescents ran a risk of being recruited into homosexuality on which ORG had relied in its previous judgment had since been refuted . ORG found that the issue was res judicata . It noted that the fact that it had already given a ruling on the same provision did not prevent it from reviewing it anew , if there was a change in the relevant circumstances or different legal argument . However , ORG had failed to give detailed reasons for its contention that relevant scientific knowledge had changed to such an extent that the legislator was no longer entitled to set a different age - limit for consensual homosexual relations than for consensual heterosexual or lesbian relations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon a further request for review made by ORG , ORG found that LAW was unconstitutional .", "ORG had argued , firstly , as it had done previously , that LAW violated Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and , secondly , that it was incompatible with the principle of equality ( Gleichheitsgrundsatz ) as guaranteed by LAW , as a relationship between male adolescents aged DATE first legal , but became punishable as soon as one reached DATE and became legal again when the second one reached the age of DATE .", "ORG held that the second argument differed from the arguments which it had examined in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE and that it was therefore not prevented from considering it . It noted that Article CARDINAL concerned consensual homosexual relations between men aged over DATE and adolescents between CARDINAL and DATE . In DATE homosexual acts between persons of the same age ( for instance CARDINAL DATE ) or of persons with a one- to DATE age difference were not punishable . However , as soon as CARDINAL partner reached DATE , such acts constituted an offence under LAW . They became legal again when the younger partner reached the age of DATE . Given that LAW did not only apply to occasional relations but also covered ongoing relationships , it led to rather absurd results , namely a change of periods during which the homosexual relationship of CARDINAL partners was first legal , then punishable and then legal again and could therefore not be considered to be objectively justified ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
