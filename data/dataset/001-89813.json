LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Remainder inadmissible;Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Nona Tsotsoria;Vladimiro Zagrebelsky", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE . The second applicant , his wife , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . They live together in GPE and have CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant \u2019s sister , LAW , and her partner , ORG ( senior ) , died , and the applicants were appointed as temporary custodians of the deceased couple \u2019s daughters - R\u0160 , aged CARDINAL , and D\u0160 , aged DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the paternal grandparents , S\u0160 and V\u0160 , applied to a court to adopt R\u0160 and D\u0160 . The applicants submitted a counter - claim for the adoption . On DATE the ORG accepted the GPE claim , recognising R\u0160 and D\u0160 as their adopted children . On DATE ORG upheld that decision . On DATE ORG quashed the lower decisions , remitting the case for a fresh examination at first instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG partly granted the claim of GPE and ORG , by recognising PERSON ( then DATE ) as their adopted daughter . However , it recognised R\u0160 ( then DATE ) as the adopted daughter of the applicants . The applicants and the grandparents were ordered by the court to ensure that there were no obstacles that would prevent R\u0160 and ORG from communicating with the applicants as well as with their grandparents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the decision , dismissing both adoption applications . The court considered that the dispute between the CARDINAL couples could be resolved without an adoption , but by a grant of permanent custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG appointed GPE and ORG as the permanent custodians of the QUANTITY girls . The court reached this decision on account of the better financial and living conditions of the grandparents compared to the applicants , as well as the fact that S\u0160 and V\u0160 were closer blood relatives to the girls . Noting PERSON \u2019s young age ( then DATE ) and her \u201c emotional instability \u201d when expressing herself in front of officials , the court rejected her express wish to live with her \u201c mother \u201d and \u201c father \u201d ( the applicants ) . ORG observed that a child \u2019s wish does not necessarily coincide with its future interests ; therefore the court was not bound by PERSON \u2019s opinion . The court took note of the request of ORG to give custody of the girls to the applicants , whom the girls recognised as their \u201c natural family \u201d and who had cared for them since their GPE death . However , it concluded that the girls were of a young , adaptable age . As R\u0160 had lived with the applicants for DATE , without any memory of her PERSON family , she was unable to understand where she would be better off .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and ORG appealed . On DATE the ORG confirmed the first - instance reasoning and decision after a written procedure , without an oral hearing of the parties .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and ORG lodged cassation appeals . On DATE the President of ORG suspended the execution of the Ma\u017eeikiai ORG decision until the cassation appeal could be examined . On DATE ORG held that it had no jurisdiction in child custody cases and dismissed the cassation application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the bailiff attempted to execute the courts\u2019 decision , R\u0160 refused to leave the applicants\u2019 home to live with her grandparents . D\u0160 was taken to the grandparents .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the Prosecutor General , defending the public interest , filed a request to reopen the proceedings . ORG reopened the civil proceedings and , on DATE , overruled the ORG decision of DATE . The court granted permanent custody of R\u0160 to the applicants , who lived in GPE , and permanent custody of D\u0160 to the grandparents , who lived in PERSON . When deciding to separate the sisters , the court noted the wish of R\u0160 to stay with the applicants and the wish of D\u0160 to stay with her grandparents . The court also observed that , since DATE , the girls had lived separately and were used to their current environments .", "CARDINAL . The grandparents appealed to ORG , which on DATE upheld the lower court \u2019s decision . The appellate court was of the opinion that it had been reasonable for the first - instance court to take into consideration the interests of each child and not to consider them as an inseparable unit . The court noted that the children should be provided with the most suitable and best conditions to meet their personal interests in the most advantageous way . Therefore the court found that the principle of not separating siblings had been justifiably overruled . It also held that the principle of placing children within the family had not been violated . The court pointed out that it was not only blood ties which mattered when choosing placements , but also the individuals to whom the child felt closest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a final ruling and upheld the decision of ORG . Agreeing with the reasoning of the lower courts , it observed that during the initial proceedings ORG had made a mistake by not giving primary consideration to the wishes of PERSON . ORG also noted that the evidence in the case showed the existence of a conflict between the CARDINAL guardianship families . It noted that proper conditions should be created so that the girls could communicate with each other , giving the primary importance of the children \u2019s interests over those of their guardians . This was an obligation for the ORG authorities to fulfil .", "CARDINAL .
