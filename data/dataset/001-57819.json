These reviews were commissioned by the Government and presented to ORG to assist consideration of the continued need for the legislation . The authors of these reports concluded in particular that in view of the problems inherent in the prevention and investigation of terrorism , the continued use of the special powers of arrest and detention was indispensable . The suggestion that decisions extending detention should be taken by the courts was rejected , notably because the information grounding those decisions was highly sensitive and could not be disclosed to the persons in detention or their legal advisers .

He noted in this regard that the police in GPE were frequently confronted by a situation where they had good intelligence to connect persons with a terrorist incident but the persons concerned , if detained , made no statements , and witnesses were afraid to come forward , certainly in court : in these circumstances , it was concluded , the reliance on forensic evidence by the prosecution was increasing , and detective work had assumed a higher degree of importance . He also set out the reasons which individually or , as often , in combination constituted good grounds for extending the various periods within which otherwise persons suspected of involvement in terrorism would have to be charged or taken to court . These included checking of fingerprints ; forensic tests ; checking the detainee \u2019s replies against intelligence ; new lines of inquiry ; information obtained from one or CARDINAL other detainee in the same case ; finding and consulting other witnesses ( Command Paper CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL - CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
