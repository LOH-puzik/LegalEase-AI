NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON Per PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , Attorney at the Attorney ORG ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was the Chief Executive Officer and a member of ORG company ORG , which was taken into bankruptcy in DATE . In this context , on DATE , LAW ( skifterett ) inter alia found ( i ) that the applicant had failed to operate advance tax deduction through a separate bank account and had been grossly negligent in this respect , in breach of sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL , ORG and CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( skattebetalingsloven ) ; ( ii ) that there was reasonable ground for suspecting the applicant of having taken up a loan in the company in breach of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL last sub - section of LAW DATE ( aksjeselskapsloven ) and ( iii ) embezzlement of the estate in breach of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Penal Code . ORG found reasonable ground for suspicion that such criminal acts as mentioned in section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( konkursloven ) had occurred . Moreover , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) it found that his business conduct had been inappropriate to such a degree as to make him unsuited to establish a new limited liability company or to take part in such a company . Therefore , under section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , the court ordered that he be disqualified ( konkurskarantene ) for a period of DATE from establishing or taking on responsibilities for the governing board of such a company . In addition , under section CARDINAL ) it extended the order to prohibiting the applicant from continuing existing responsibilities of this nature .", "The Probate and Bankruptcy Court \u2019s judgment contained the following reasoning :", "\u201c Pursuant to section CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL , see sixth sub - section , item CARDINAL , of LAW , a disqualification order may be imposed on [ the applicant ] as day - to - day manager of the company if there is \u2018 reasonable ground\u2019 for suspecting him of a criminal act in connection with the bankruptcy or the activities that led to insolvency . Further , a disqualification order may be imposed pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL ... if there is reason to presume that , on the ground because of unsound business conduct , the person is unfit to establish a new company , etc . There are sufficient grounds to impose a disqualification order if CARDINAL of the conditions is fulfilled .", "The taxation legislation contains provisions requiring separate tax deduction accounts in order to ensure that companies do not make use of funds that belong to the public authorities . Under sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , the amounts that are to be paid into tax deduction accounts are the part of taxable remuneration which is not to be retained by persons liable to pay tax ( i.e. employees , etc ) , but which is to be paid as advance tax deductions . The employer has the responsibility for collecting advance tax deductions from employees . In principle , advance tax deductions should not go through a company \u2019s operating accounts , but be paid directly into a tax deduction account , see section CARDINAL of LAW . It is therefore insufficient to argue that there was adequate liquidity in the company both before and after the bankruptcy . The point is not whether the company was in a position to meet its obligations , but whether the amounts in question had in fact been set aside . In this connection , it is important to note that the company never had any formal right to make use of the advance tax deductions . Any exemption from criminal liability would have to be based on the grounds that the amounts that were not set aside were in fact paid at the correct time , see section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW . This is not the case here .", "The requirements for strict criminal liability under section CARDINAL of LAW must be regarded as being fulfilled . With respect to whether [ the applicant ] \u2019s actions fulfil the subjective requirements for liability , section CARDINAL of LAW lays down intent or gross negligence . It is established that [ the applicant ] , as general manager , was grossly negligent in not ensuring that the payments in question were actually made . The fact that he delegated the task of deducting tax payments in advance does not exempt him from criminal liability .", "As regards the withdrawal of funds for personal use , the court finds that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that loans were raised in contravention of section CARDINAL of ORG . It has been claimed that the loans in question were within the framework of the company \u2019s free equity , but the court can not see that any security has been provided . This is an offence that is subject to penal sanctions , see section CARDINAL , last sub - section , of LAW . The loans were advanced to [ the applicant ] , and the requirements for both strict and subjective criminal liability must be considered to have been fulfilled .", "Furthermore , the court finds that there is just cause for suspecting criminal withholding of assets from the estate pursuant to LAW . Under LAW , an attempt to withhold assets is sufficient to incur criminal liability . The court finds that there is reasonable ground for suspecting [ the applicant ] of attempting to withhold assets from the estate , since it is a fact that the computer equipment has not been transferred to the estate as required . Here too , the requirements for both strict and subjective liability are found to be fulfilled .", "As regards the question of embezzlement of funds paid to the company by ORG , the court notes that this has been reported to the police by their letter of DATE . This letter indicates that the police consider there to be reasonable ground for suspecting [ the applicant ] of criminal acts .", "As regards whether the company operated at the LOC expense and how this relates to LAW , the court finds that in retrospect , it can be established that the company did operate at the LOC expense . However , the court does not have sufficient information to state with certainty whether there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the requirements for subjective criminal liability for violation of LAW are fulfilled . However , the court has found that there is reasonable ground for suspecting a number of other offences , and therefore does not consider it necessary to make a final decision on this question in order to determine whether or not a disqualification order should be imposed . Another question is whether this type of short trading in electricity can be considered to be sound business practice . In this connection , we can not set such strict standards for documentation of [ the applicant ] \u2019s subjective view of the matter . The court will return to this question below .", "The court finds that there is reasonable ground for suspecting [ the applicant ] of offences such as are mentioned in section CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL , of LAW . It finds that the balance of probability is that [ the applicant ] is liable to punishment for CARDINAL or more of the acts to which the ORG has called attention . Thus , the conditions for imposing a disqualification order on [ the applicant ] pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL , of LAW are fulfilled .", "The court finds that business conduct in this case has been so unsound that [ the applicant ] must be considered unfit to form or take part in the management of a new company , see section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL , of LAW . Particular importance is attached in this respect to the general disregard shown for companies legislation . This applies in particular to the provisions of LAW relating to withdrawal of funds for personal use and borrowing from CARDINAL \u2019s own company . Furthermore , a number of the financial transactions made in the company \u2019s name appear to have been carried out in [ the applicant ] \u2019s personal interest . These include the purchase of a number of vehicles not conventionally used by a limited liability company of this type . For example , expensive motorcycles , sports cars and pleasure boats were purchased . In connection with an evaluation of business conduct , it is of little importance whether these were intended for use by [ the applicant ] himself or by his employees . In the court \u2019s opinion , such transactions do not give a more favourable impression of the way the company was managed .", "Despite the way the power market developed in DATE , [ the applicant ] allowed PERSON to continue trading in electricity , even though the company did not have contracts for purchases of electricity to cover its sales . The company did not have sufficient funds for these transactions . The transactions thus became speculation at the purchaser \u2019s risk , and in the final analysis at the purchaser \u2019s expense . The company sold goods that it knew or should have known could not be delivered to the purchaser if electricity prices continued to rise . Short trading of this kind is acceptable if the company is in a strong enough financial position , which was not the case here . If the company does not have sufficient funds , its customers incur losses because they have to go out on the market and buy electricity at a higher price . In the court \u2019s opinion , this can not be in accordance with sound business practice .", "[ The applicant ] has a history of several bankruptcies and is involved in several bankruptcy proceedings at present . He can therefore be described as a serial bankrupt , so that he belongs to the category which disqualification is specifically intended to deal with . The court has found no circumstances indicating that it would be unreasonable to impose a disqualification order . In the assessment of reasonableness it is important that the conditions of both item CARDINAL and item CARDINAL of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW are deemed to be fulfilled .", "Nor can the court see that disqualification would be particularly unreasonable for [ the applicant ] on the grounds that he considers himself to be an entrepreneur and claims that disqualification would deprive him of the right to work . A disqualification order does not prohibit a person from working . [ The applicant ] could take up employment in a company or establish a company with unlimited liability to its creditors . The reason for issuing a disqualification order is that [ the applicant ] is considered unfit to establish a limited liability company .", "Since the conditions of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL , are fulfilled , the court further finds that , pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of LAW , [ the applicant ] should be removed from any existing offices in the management of companies , and he is therefore obliged to withdraw from any positions such as those mentioned in LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . \u201d", "This was the third time a disqualification order had been imposed on the applicant , who had been involved in several bankruptcies in the past .", "On DATE ORG ( lagmannsrett ) rejected an appeal by the applicant against ORG judgment and upheld the latter \u2019s findings under section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and , apparently also under ( CARDINAL ) , of LAW . ORG stated :", "\u201c ORG does not find it established that ORG has based its decision on erroneous facts or that the decision suffered from other errors that could lead to it being quashed .", "Against the background of what emerges from the Administrators\u2019 report , ORG agrees with ORG that there is reasonable ground for suspecting [ the applicant ] of breach of several penal provisions . It relates to breach of Articles CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , LAW and the taking up of loan in breach of LAW CARDINAL , see CARDINAL last sub - section , LAW . The conditions for disqualification under section CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL are therefore present , as the criminal offences refer to the bankruptcy and the activities that led to insolvency .", "ORG further agrees with ORG that the management of the company at issue can be characterised as so indefensible that [ the applicant ] must be deemed unsuited to form a new liability company and take part in such a company , with the meaning of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL .", "Having regard to the debtor \u2019s conduct and the circumstances as a whole , the High Court finds that it seems reasonable , under LAW ( CARDINAL ) , to subject him to a disqualification order . Reference is made to ORG extensive reasoning , with which ORG agrees in the main , and to the fact that [ the applicant ] , according to the Administrators\u2019 report , has been insolvent in also connection with a number of bankruptcies in the past and has also previously been subjected to disqualification .", "Therefore the Probate and Bankruptcy Court \u2019s decision is upheld . \u201d", "The applicant did not appeal against the above judgment by ORG which became final .", "Subsequently , on DATE , the applicant was charged on CARDINAL counts of aggravated embezzlement inter alia in breach of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and FAC of the Penal Code ; section CARDINAL ) of ORG Added Tax ( VAT ) Act DATE ( merverdiavgiftsloven ) ; and section CARDINAL of LAW . On DATE he was in addition charged of aggravated breach of confidence ( grovt utroskap ) under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Penal Code .", "On DATE , ORG ( byrett ) acquitted the applicant of all but one of the charges mentioned above , namely a charge of aggravated embezzlement , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and to loss for DATE of his right to run a business or to occupy a leading position in a company or be a member of a company board ( Article CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "On appeal by both the prosecution and the defence , ORG , by a judgment of DATE , increased the sentence to DATE , finding the applicant guilty also on the additional count of aggravated breach of confidence .", "In his appeal to ORG the applicant requested , firstly , that the case be dismissed ( avvist ) , arguing with reference to LAW that the disqualification order barred the subsequent prosecution in relation to the same matters . Secondly , the applicant appealed against his conviction for aggravated embezzlement under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Penal Code , challenging ORG interpretation of the law and reasoning .", "On DATE ORG rejected both of his appeal grounds . In so far as the submission under LAW No . CARDINAL was concerned ORG , referring to the reasoning in its judgment pronounced in a similar case on DATE , that the imposition of the disqualification order under sections CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) did not bar subsequent prosecution and conviction .", "The parallel judgment became the subject of an application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) lodged under the ORG by Mr Yngvar GPE against GPE , which is being dealt with simultaneously with the present case . An LANGUAGE translation of ORG reasoning is reproduced in the ORG \u2019s decision in the case of PERSON , delivered on DATE as the present decision .", "In so far as relevant , section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL LAW ) read :", "Section CARDINAL -Conditions for imposing a disqualification order", "\u201c If a debtor \u2019s estate is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings , the district court may impose a disqualification order on the debtor if", "CARDINAL ) there is reasonable ground for suspecting the person concerned of a criminal act in connection with the bankruptcy or the activities that led to insolvency , or", "CARDINAL ) if it must be presumed that for reasons of unsound business conduct , the person in question is unfit to establish a new company or to serve as a director or general manager ( managing director ) of such a company .", "In taking a decision on this matter , importance shall be attached to whether , having regard to the debtor \u2019s conduct and the circumstances as a whole , it appears reasonable to impose a disqualification order .", "The imposition of a disqualification order means that , for DATE from the opening of bankruptcy proceedings , the debtor may not establish such a company as mentioned in the fifth sub - section , or undertake the office or de facto exercise the powers of a member or deputy member of a board of directors or managing director of such a company . The district court may decide that the DATE period shall start from the date when the court takes its decision .", "In cases mentioned in the first sub - section , item CARDINAL , the district court may decide that disqualification shall also entail that the debtor shall be removed from any such offices as mentioned in the third sub - section held in such companies as mentioned in the fifth sub - section .", "The term company in sub - sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL means a limited liability company , a public limited liability company , a branch office of a foreign company , a business foundation , a housing construction cooperative , a housing co - operative , a company aimed at promoting its ORG consumer interests ( consumer co - operative ) , a mutual insurance company or a ORG company . \u201d", "For a summary of the legislative history of the provisions on disqualification under NORP law , reference is made to paragraphs DATE of ORG judgment quoted in the above - mentioned decision in the parallel GPE case .", "The Government provided some additional information , inter alia what is summarised here below .", "In the individual assessment of reasonableness to be carried out under LAW ) , account was to be had to such factors as the cause of the bankruptcy , the debtor \u2019s conduct during the bankruptcy proceedings and the time element . In the event of a significant and unwarranted delay from the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings until the submission of a request for a disqualification order , the court might conclude that it would be unreasonable to impose a disqualification order .", "In the preparatory works to LAW DATE , ORG had stressed that the rules would make it possible to stop persons who repeatedly were involved in limited liability companies which went bankrupt , and where there was reason to suspect improper business conduct . It had also been emphasised that disqualification orders should function as a supplement to loss of entitlement ( rettighetstap ) , a form of punishment pursuant to LAW . In this context , the Ministry had pointed to the advantages of the fact that a disqualification order could be imposed shortly after the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings , whilst it normally would take longer to investigate and prosecute possible criminal offences . The possibility of swift action was necessary to achieve the preventive purpose of the measure .", "The duration of disqualification period , ordinarily DATE , could be extended if the public prosecutor in a criminal case had requested or was contemplating requesting the trial court to sentence the person in question to a loss of entitlement pursuant to LAW . The disqualification period could then be extended until the court had decided the criminal case .", "The competent court could remit a disqualification order if any of the parties so requested and there was relevant new information . If a person subjected to a disqualification order was later acquitted in criminal proceedings for an offence which constituted the basis for a disqualification order , or further investigation showed that no such criminal offence had been committed , the public prosecutor was to request that the disqualification order be lifted ( PERSON , ORG of ORG ) .", "A disqualification order could be imposed by a court of first instance ( tingretten ) or by the probate and bankruptcy courts ( skifteretten ) . Such a measure was usually taken on the basis of written proceedings . However , the parties had the right to request an oral hearing . In his or her report to the probate and bankruptcy court , the liquidator was to provide information on whether , in his or her opinion , there were circumstances suggesting that a disqualification order should be imposed . Both the bankruptcy estate ( represented by the liquidator ) and the prosecuting authority had a right to intervene as parties in the proceedings concerning the disqualification order . The opposing party would be the debtor , board member etc . against whom the order would apply . It was rare that the prosecution or the bankruptcy estate intervened as a party to the proceedings . The court \u2019s decision would , accordingly , normally be taken only on the basis of the information and recommendation in the liquidator \u2019s report , and the information and objections provided by the defendant .", "Under section CARDINALA of LAW , a failure to comply with a disqualification order was a criminal offence punishable by CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and/or fines ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
