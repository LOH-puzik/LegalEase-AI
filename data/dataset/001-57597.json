THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-4;Violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of Art. 5-1;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON resides in the GPE . He married in DATE and several children were born of the marriage . In DATE , he was committed to a psychiatric hospital by direction of the local burgomaster in accordance with an emergency procedure . DATE , on his wife \u2019s application , he was confined to the same hospital under an order made by ORG ( kantongerecht ) of his place of residence . On his wife \u2019s further application and subsequently at the request of the public prosecutor ( officier van justitie ) , the order was renewed from DATE by ORG ( arrondissements- rechtbank ) on the basis of medical reports from the doctor treating the applicant .", "Mr. PERSON complains of the procedure followed in his case . In particular , he objects that he was never heard by the various courts or notified of the orders , that he did not receive any legal assistance and that he had no opportunity of challenging the medical reports . His complaints are also directed against the decisions on his requests for discharge and against his loss of civil capacity .", "CARDINAL . The detention of persons of unsound mind is governed by LAW of DATE on ORG supervision of mentally ill persons ( wet van CARDINAL DATE , FAC , tot regeling van het Staatstoezicht op krankzinnigen ) . Usually referred to as the Mentally Ill Persons Act ( krankzinnigenwet ) , the LAW has been amended several times , in the last instance by LAW of DATE which came into force on CARDINAL DATE , that is some time after the applicant had first been detained . A PERSON providing for a complete reform of the system is at present pending before ORG .", "The Mentally Ill Persons Act is divided into CARDINAL main chapters . Principally relevant for the present proceedings are the CARDINAL chapters dealing firstly with the admission of persons to psychiatric hospitals and their stay therein , secondly with leave of absence and discharge therefrom , and thirdly with the administration of the property of persons admitted to psychiatric hospitals .", "The LAW does not define who are \" mentally ill persons \" but lays down the grounds for committing such persons to hospital ( see the following paragraphs ) . It would appear from the evidence submitted that , according to the general practice currently followed , the GPE courts will authorise the confinement of a \" mentally ill person \" only if his mental disorder is of such a kind or of such gravity as to make him an actual danger to himself or to others .", "CARDINAL . In urgent cases , the burgomaster has the power to direct the compulsory admission of a \" mentally ill person \" to a psychiatric hospital .", "Until DATE , the burgomaster had to obtain prior medical advice only if circumstances permitted ; his decision was valid for DATE but the public prosecutor could shorten or extend the term ( section CARDINAL of the Act ) .", "This procedure was considerably changed by LAW , section CARDINAL being repealed and replaced by sections PERSON to CARDINALj . The burgomaster is now obliged to seek the prior opinion of a psychiatrist or , should that not be possible , another medical practitioner . Once he has issued a direction to detain , he must immediately inform the public prosecutor and send him the medical declarations on which the direction was based . The public prosecutor is in his turn required to transmit these declarations not later than the following day to the President of ORG with , where appropriate , an application for a continuation of the detention . Such continuation , if made , is valid for DATE but may be renewed by the President for a second period of similar duration . Thereafter the procedure concerning applications for a provisional detention order is to be followed ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the above - mentioned emergency cases , no one may be deprived of his liberty on grounds of mental illness or insanity except under a provisional detention order made by a court .", "ORG judge ( kantonrechter ) may issue a provisional detention order on written application ( verzoek ) made by a close relative by blood or marriage of full age , the spouse or the legal representative of the individual concerned and seeking his confinement either in the interests of public order or in his own interests ( section CARDINAL of the Act ) . The judge may also issue such an order on application by a person of full age who considers that his own condition is such as to require suitable treatment ( section CARDINAL ) . In addition , a provisional detention order may be made by the President of ORG following a request ( requisitoir ) by the public prosecutor ( section CARDINAL ) .", "The application or request must , according to LAW , be accompanied by a declaration drawn up not DATE by a doctor licensed to practise in the GPE but not attached to the institution to which it is proposed admitting the patient . The declaration must be to the effect that the person concerned \" is in a state of mental illness ( toestand van krankzinnigheid ) and that it is necessary or desirable to treat him in a psychiatric hospital \" . An application may also mention facts and documents giving a clearer indication of the state of mental illness , but this is purely optional .", "Since the entry into force of LAW , the medical declaration must be made by a psychiatrist who is not himself treating the patient ; as far as possible , it must state , with reasons , whether the patient \u2019s condition is such that it would be pointless or medically inadvisable for him to be heard by the court . The psychiatrist must , if he can , first consult the family doctor .", "CARDINAL . The judge makes a provisional detention order if the medical declaration , either on its own or in conjunction with the facts related or the documents supplied , adequately establishes that treatment in a psychiatric hospital is necessary or desirable ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Act ) .", "Until DATE , the examination of the application or request was not subject to any limitative formalities . Section CARDINAL , in the version in force when the facts of the present case occurred , provided that the judge had competence to hear beforehand the person whose detention was being sought . As a result of the above - mentioned amending LAW , the judge is now obliged to hear the person in question unless he concludes from the medical declaration that this would be pointless or medically inadvisable ; he may , either of his own motion or at the request of that person , provide the latter with legal assistance ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) . The judge must seek all possible information both from the individual who made the application or the request mentioned in sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL and from certain other individuals ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) . He retains the power to call witnesses and experts ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) and may , if he thinks fit , summon anyone who made an application for a detention order pursuant to section CARDINAL to appear before him ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A provisional detention order is not subject to appeal and is , moreover , not notified to the person concerned ( section CARDINAL ) ; it is valid for DATE ( section CARDINAL ) .", "The order , like detention orders ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , authorises rather than enjoins compulsory confinement and it may happen that it is not put into effect . In the case of a person who is not yet hospitalised , the admission to a psychiatric hospital or other specialised institution must take place within DATE , on production of the court order ( sections QUANTITY and CARDINAL ) . The closest relatives by blood or marriage , the spouse or the legal representative must be informed of the patient \u2019s admission by the burgomaster , who is notified thereof by the court or the public prosecutor ( section DATE ) . The medical declaration on which the judge based his decision must be transmitted to the institution \u2019s doctor treating the patient . This doctor has to enter his findings on a register every day for DATE , then on a DATE basis for the ensuing DATE and thereafter on a DATE basis ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Within TIME of the admission , the doctor responsible for the patient \u2019s treatment is required to send to the public prosecutor of the district in which the psychiatric hospital is situated a reasoned declaration on the patient \u2019s mental condition and on the necessity or desirability of prolonging his stay in a psychiatric hospital ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Within DATE following the issue of the provisional detention order , a further application or request , seeking the continuation of the patient \u2019s confinement in a psychiatric hospital for DATE , may be submitted to ORG . Any such application or request must be accompanied by the medical records of the doctor responsible , together with a reasoned declaration by him as to whether it is necessary or desirable for the patient to undergo further treatment in a psychiatric hospital ( section CARDINAL ) .", "The patient need not be notified of the application or request or of the proceedings relating thereto .", "CARDINAL . A decision on the application or request is taken by ORG ( section CARDINAL ) . Apart from being obliged to hear the public prosecutor , the ORG does not have to follow any set procedure . It may call for evidence from witnesses or other sources , hear the patient , grant him legal assistance and consult experts , but it is not bound to do so . During the examination of the case , the patient must remain in the institution , if necessary for DATE after the making of the provisional order .", "ORG decision , which is not subject to appeal , is not delivered at a public hearing , nor is it notified to the person concerned . In practice , it is left to the hospital authorities to determine if and when such notification is warranted from the medical point of view .", "The general rule is that , when hearing civil cases , ORG sits as a chamber composed of CARDINAL judges ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ) . However , this chamber may refer to a single - judge chamber ( enkelvoudige kamer ) such cases as it deems suitable ( LAW ( b ) of LAW ) . ORG has its own Rules of Order ( reglement van orde ) which are approved by LAW on the advice of ORG ( PERSON ) . Under LAW of ORG , as in force at the relevant time ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , jurisdiction in all cases regarding the detention and stay of persons in psychiatric hospitals was allotted to a single - judge chamber .", "CARDINAL . Not CARDINAL and not DATE before the expiry of the period covered by the ORG \u2019s detention order , an application or request for the prolongation of the patient \u2019s detention for DATE may be made to ORG ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "Subsequent procedure is the same as for the making of the detention order provided for in section CARDINAL of the LAW . The LAW does not specify when the ORG has to give its ruling .", "CARDINAL . Leave of absence ( verlof ) for a specified period may be granted to a patient by the doctor in charge of the institution ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The authorities of a psychiatric hospital may at any time grant the discharge ( ontslag ) of a patient on the basis of a written declaration from the aforesaid doctor to the effect that the patient shows no signs of mental illness or that his treatment in a psychiatric hospital is no longer necessary or desirable ( section CARDINAL ) .", "A written request for the patient \u2019s discharge may be made to the hospital authorities by the patient himself , the person who applied for his detention or , in the latter \u2019s absence , another of the relatives by blood or marriage mentioned in LAW para . CARDINAL , in the version in force prior to LAW ) . The authorities must at once consult the doctor in charge of the institution and , if his opinion is favourable , must discharge the patient . If the doctor \u2019s opinion is unfavourable , the authorities must transmit the request , together with the opinion , to the public prosecutor who will , in principle , refer it to ORG for decision . The ORG \u2019s procedure for this purpose is the same as that applicable to the making of detention orders ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; its decision is not subject to appeal ( section CARDINAL paras . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "However , the public prosecutor is not obliged to forward the request to the ORG if it appears manifestly impossible to grant the request ( indien het verzoek klaarblijkelijk niet voor inwilliging vatbaar is ) , if a previous request is still pending , or if the ORG has already dismissed a similar request during the period covered by the detention order and the circumstances have not changed ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) .", "The public prosecutor , being responsible for the supervision of psychiatric hospitals , has a duty to see that no one is unlawfully detained in such an institution . If the doctor in charge of the institution agrees , the public prosecutor may order the discharge of a patient whose continued confinement he considers unnecessary . If the doctor in charge does not agree , the public prosecutor may refer the matter to ORG . Should the public prosecutor have doubts about the need for the patient \u2019s continued confinement , he may refer the matter to the ORG ; he is obliged to do so if a public health inspector so requests ( section CARDINAL ) .", "When the period covered by a detention order expires , the hospital authorities must inform the public prosecutor of the fact within DATE and , if no application has been made to the ORG to prolong the detention , he must thereupon order the patient \u2019s discharge unless he concludes from a reasoned declaration in writing by the doctor in charge that such a step would present a danger to public order ; in the latter event , he must himself request the ORG to prolong the detention ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Any person of full age who is actually confined in a psychiatric hospital automatically loses the capacity to administer his property ( section DATE ) . As a consequence , all contracts entered into by the person concerned after his confinement are void and he can not legally transfer property or operate his bank account . The patient regains the capacity to manage his property only when he is formally discharged but not , for instance , when he is granted leave of absence .", "On application by any of the persons entitled to seek an individual \u2019s detention , or at the request of the public prosecutor , ORG may appoint a provisional administrator ( provisioneel bewinsdvoerder ) for anyone confined in a psychiatric hospital , should this be deemed necessary or desirable ( section CARDINAL ) . In addition , the general rule laid down in LAW enables ORG to nominate a guardian ( curator ) on behalf of a person , whether in custody or not , who , by reason of mental illness or dipsomania , is no longer capable of managing his own affairs .", "CARDINAL . The overall aim of the PERSON is to improve the position of the psychiatric patient : it seeks to strengthen the procedural guarantees accompanying his detention and to allow him more freedom within the hospital .", "The criterion justifying confinement in a psychiatric hospital would henceforth be that the individual , on account of his mental state , constitutes \" a danger for himself , for others or for the general safety of persons and goods \" . Further modifications of relevance would include the following : the competent court at all stages would be the single - judge chamber of ORG ; the provisional detention order would be valid for DATE only ; before making an order or determining a request for discharge , the court would as a general rule have to hear the person concerned ; the only occasion when the court might decide not to hear the patient would be when examining the application or request for the first detention order , that is DATE after the making of the provisional detention order ; the court would be obliged to grant legal assistance to the person concerned at his request ; there would be a right of appeal against orders authorising detention ; admission to a psychiatric hospital would not automatically bring about loss of civil capacity .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON received voluntary treatment in a psychiatric hospital from DATE to CARDINAL September CARDINAL . At some time prior to this , he had apparently suffered severe brain damage in an accident . On CARDINAL DATE , he was committed to the \" Zon en Schild \" ( \" Sun and Shield \" ) psychiatric hospital at GPE on the direction of the GPE burgomaster in accordance with the emergency procedure then in force under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The events prompting this decision were that the applicant had stolen documents from the local registry office , been detained by the police and then been found lying naked on a bed in a police cell . The term of the detention was extended by the public prosecutor , as was possible under paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during the currency of the \" emergency \" confinement , Mr. PERSON \u2019s wife applied to ORG on a standard form for his provisional detention in the \" Zon an Schild \" hospital in the interests of public order as well as those of her husband .", "The application was accompanied by a medical declaration , dated DATE , made out by a general medical practitioner who had examined the patient for the first time DATE . The declaration stated that the patient had been detained in DATE for \" attempted murder \" and had been under psychiatric treatment in DATE . It also stated that the patient was \" a schizophrene , suffering from imaginary and Utopian ideas , who has for a fairly long time been destroying himself as well as his family \" and that he \" is unaware of his morbid condition \" . The doctor concluded that \" for the time being \" the patient certainly could not \" be left at large in society \" .", "On DATE , on the basis of this declaration , ORG granted the application and authorised the applicant \u2019s provisional detention , without first exercising its power to hear him or to seek expert advice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s wife applied to ORG for a DATE detention order in respect of her husband .", "Her application was accompanied by the DATE and DATE records of the doctor in attendance as well as the declaration as to the necessity or desirability of further treatment in a psychiatric hospital .", "On the basis of these documents , the single - judge chamber responsible for hearing such cases made the order on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an application by Mrs. PERSON and on the basis of the DATE records of the doctor in attendance and his declaration , identical to that of DATE , the single - judge chamber made an order authorising the prolongation of the detention \" by DATE if necessary \" as from DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant was moved to the \" Rijks PERSON \" ( \" ORG \" ) at GPE . This hospital was further away from the home of his wife , whom he had previously been able to visit on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the public prosecutor at \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch requested the renewal of the detention order for DATE , on the basis of the DATE records of the doctors who had successively treated Mr. PERSON and a declaration by the doctor in attendance at GPE , which read as follows :", "\" The patient is suffering from a mental illness with the following symptoms : psychopathic personality , quarrelsome and scheming nature , paranoiac tendency , untrustworthiness ; shows signs of dementia in the shape of ... emotional withdrawal ; egocentric tendency ; in need of strict supervision and special care . Continued treatment in a psychiatric hospital must be considered necessary . \"", "On DATE , that is to say , DATE after the previous order had lapsed , the first ordinary chamber of ORG at \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch authorised detention for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE , the same court made further DATE renewals of the detention order following requests by the public prosecutor and on the basis of the DATE medical records and identical declarations by the doctor in attendance , who had however changed in the course of DATE . On DATE and DATE , ORG again granted similar requests by the public prosecutor . The most recent renewal order referred to in the evidence dates from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The medical records forwarded DATE to the courts , although fairly brief , indicated that the applicant showed schizophrenic and paranoiac reactions , that he was unaware of his pathological condition and that , on several occasions , he had committed quite serious acts without appreciating their consequences . For example , the records relate how , in pursuance of some fanciful schemes , Mr. PERSON went abroad with family savings and soon became penniless , without realising either the state of neglect in which he had left his family or his own dependence on the consular authorities who had to assist and repatriate him .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant had made a first request to the hospital authorities for his discharge in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The hospital authorities forwarded the request to the public prosecutor who in turn referred it to ORG . ORG , after hearing the patient at the hospital , dismissed the request .", "In DATE , the hospital authorities forwarded a second request to the public prosecutor with a negative recommendation . After hearing Mr. PERSON , the public prosecutor , pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL , rejected the request without referring it to ORG for decision . The same applied to a third request , made in DATE .", "On DATE , the patient made a further request for his discharge to the authorities of the \" Rijks Psychiatrisch Inrichting \" . On DATE , the medical director of the institution forwarded the request to the public prosecutor with his comments , which may be summarised as follows : the patient was suffering from a paranoiac psychosis which could be successfully treated by psychopharmacological methods , but during previous leaves of absence he had failed to take the drugs prescribed , with the result that he had had to be readmitted after a relapse ; steps were being taken to reintegrate the patient gradually into society and he was spending his TIME outside the hospital ; in the light of the past setbacks , there would have been little point in discharging him . On the strength of this opinion and after hearing Mr. PERSON , the public prosecutor again refused the request and refrained from referring it to ORG . He notified the applicant of his decision on CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s CARDINAL requests for discharge took the form of simple statements that he was not mentally deranged , that he had been falsely accused of misdemeanours and that he did not constitute a danger for himself or to others . The public prosecutor did not refer the CARDINAL later requests to ORG because it appeared manifestly impossible to grant them .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON has from time to time been given leave of absence for various periods . On CARDINAL occasions - DATE in DATE , DATE in DATE , DATE and DATE in DATE - he has been allowed to lodge outside the hospital on an experimental basis . Each time , he has had to be readmitted to hospital . Several reasons are adverted to in the evidence : he failed to follow the treatment prescribed ; his lodging was found to be in a filthy state ; and , most recently , he smashed a window in GPE where he was wandering .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON automatically lost the capacity to administer his property on being detained in a psychiatric hospital ( section CARDINAL of the Act ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . No provisional administrator was appointed ( section CARDINAL ) and his affairs were at first managed , so it seems , by his wife . Then , on DATE , a guardian was nominated by ORG ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) . The guardian has made no request for Mr. PERSON \u2019s release ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
