THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "The applicants\u2019 daughter ( \u201c S \u201d ) was born on DATE . S was conceived with the assistance of ORG treatment and she is the applicants\u2019 only child .", "In DATE an anonymous call was made to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , outlining a number of concerns about S. In particular , the caller said that she was inappropriately dressed , that she reported having seen \u201c horrible things \u201d on her father \u2019s computer , and that her mother had described her as \u201c sexy \u201d while she posed for a photograph . The ORG reported the concerns to social services , who contacted the applicants but felt that no further action was necessary . The applicants , however , were convinced that the call had been made by a teaching assistant at ORG school . They visited the school , where they became \u201c angry and vociferous \u201d and the headmistress threatened to call the police . They then visited the home of the teaching assistant who they believed had called the ORG , but she was not there .", "The applicants subsequently removed S from school . In or around DATE S reached compulsory school age . Although the applicants indicated that they were looking for a new school and that S was being home - schooled in the meantime , there was no evidence to support either of these claims and they subsequently admitted that they had misled the authorities .", "The applicants are dog breeders and on or around DATE a police officer visited their home following the theft of a puppy . She described the kitchen as clean and tidy and observed that S behaved in an appropriate manner .", "On DATE CARDINAL inspectors from ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) visited the applicants\u2019 property after receiving information that the tails of their dogs had been docked . The applicants were verbally aggressive and the inspectors left the property . They subsequently obtained a warrant under LAW and , on DATE , QUANTITY police officers , CARDINAL ORG officers and a vet went to the applicants\u2019 property to execute the warrant . On entering the conservatory they saw a large pool of urine on the floor and piles of dog faeces throughout . The whole house smelt strongly of ammonia and urine . A number of dead rabbits , which were used to feed the dogs , were spread around the house with trails of blood and entrails . There were blood stains on unwashed floors and a mincing machine in the front room close to LOC \u2019s clothing . The family bedroom contained only a tattered double mattress and the ceiling was partially collapsed above the bed . S was naked from the waist down and wearing only a grubby pink t - shirt . The applicants later attributed the state of the property to \u201c the raid \u201d and said that it was clean before the police arrived . They also explained that they were looking after additional dogs which belonged to a friend , and that the lack of clothes and furniture could be explained by the fact that the family was preparing to move .", "Following the visit a police officer requested that protective measures be taken in respect of S and authorisation was given for her to be removed from the property . She was taken first to a police station , where she told a police officer that she had seen her father , the first applicant , \u201c having sex with his girlfriend on his computer \u201d .", "S was placed with foster carers . Following the placement she stated that she did not wish to see the applicants .", "On DATE a social worker visited the applicants\u2019 property . Although some cleaning had been carried out , the applicants refused to engage with the social worker and instead insisted that they were perfect parents .", "Contact was arranged for DATE . On arrival at the contact centre , the first applicant became extremely upset and angry . S was distressed by his behaviour and at times was seen to be \u201c shaking with fear \u201d .", "The local authority initially planned to rehabilitate S to the applicants . They applied for an interim care order with a care plan that S would remain in care until assessments of the applicants could be carried out . In a judgment dated DATE , a ORG Judge found that the threshold criteria for making an interim care order had been met as S had suffered and was at risk of suffering serious harm in the applicants\u2019 care . In particular , the judge observed that the removal of S from school and the living conditions in the applicants\u2019 home provided reasonable grounds for believing that S was suffering significant harm . The judge also found that there was a risk of emotional damage because the applicants could not control their anger and resentment towards others . The judge noted , however , that the risk to ORG \u2019s physical well - being had diminished by DATE as a number of improvements had been made to the applicants\u2019 property . The judge declined to make any findings on the basis of anything said by ORG , either concerning sexual activity that she may have witnessed or about not wanting to see her parents . The judge made an interim care order .", "Directions were given at DATE for the instruction of experts to move the case forward . The position statements of the applicants at that date , which were prepared while both were legally represented , indicated that they accepted the need for a global psychological assessment . CARDINAL expert psychiatrists were appointed to look at the psychiatric background to the case . By CARDINAL DATE the applicants had dismissed their solicitors and counsel . They were acting in person and made it clear that they would only co - operate with a PERSON , who they considered was looking only at S and why she presented as she did . PERSON was able to conduct a TIME interview with the applicants but they subsequently refused to engage further with her and they refused to allow her to observe their contact with S. In her report Dr W described the applicants as having \u201c a habitual style of oversensitivity , persistent grudge bearing , misconstruing friendly actions , a combative approach to their own rights out of keeping with reality and preoccupation with unsubstantiated conspirational explanations of events . \u201d Without a process of assessment she found it very likely that S would experience further significant emotional harm if she were returned to the applicants\u2019 care and that there was an additional risk of neglect .", "PERSON concluded that there was no evidence either applicant suffered from psychiatric illness although there were concerns that they exhibited paranoid personality traits . As the issue of personality traits was considered to be a matter for a psychologist , she recommended that the applicants undergo a full psychological assessment .", "On DATE the judge ordered the continuation of the interim care order . The court also ordered a kinship assessment of ORG \u2019s aunt and uncle . In the course of the hearing the applicants indicated their unwillingness to agree to any further assessments . The court urged them to seek legal advice as , in the absence of co - operation , the case would have to be set down for a final hearing .", "Between the hearing and DATE , as a consequence of the first applicant \u2019s behaviour at a contact session , he was asked to sign a LAW . He refused to sign the agreement as he believed that it would be tantamount to admitting that he had done something wrong . On DATE the judge again ordered the continuation of the interim care order . She also made an order permitting the local authority to suspend the first applicant \u2019s contact with S until he signed LAW .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicants\u2019 applications for leave to appeal against the orders continuing the interim care orders , finding that there was no prospect of a successful appeal . The court strongly recommended , however , that the applicants obtain representation before the final hearing .", "The case came before ORG on DATE . The applicants had still not agreed to a psychological assessment , although the second applicant expressed her intention to instruct a solicitor . At DATE the case was again before the court , and the second applicant indicated that she was willing to seek leave to instruct a psychiatrist . It became apparent , however , that her intention was to re - open findings of fact made in the judgment of DATE . Directions were given for the filing of position statements . When the case came back before the court on DATE , although position statements had been prepared the bundles were not ready and it was not possible to hear the applications before the court .", "By DATE the applicants had sought legal advice but had still not agreed to a psychological assessment . The case was listed for hearing at DATE . The hearing could not proceed as planned as a positive kinship assessment of ORG \u2019s aunt and uncle was undermined by allegations of indecent assault made against the uncle .", "The application for a full care order came before ORG in DATE . By DATE of the hearing , the first applicant had again dismissed his solicitor and barrister and he represented himself . The second applicant was legally represented .", "Although the local authority had originally hoped to rehabilitate S to the applicants , their failure to co - operate throughout the proceedings forced the local authority to change their position . At the hearing the local authority \u2019s final care plan was for a permanent placement outside the family , unless the applicants would agree to a full psychological assessment .", "In the course of her evidence , the second applicant attributed her past behaviour to an internet site called \u201c Forced - Adoption.com \u201d , which recommended that parents in the applicants\u2019 situation refuse to co - operate with social services and refuse to be assessed by any experts until their children were returned .", "In a judgment dated DATE , the judge found that the applicants\u2019 behaviour in the course of proceedings demonstrated that LOC \u2019s emotional welfare took second place to their need to validate their feelings of injustice . She reiterated that at the time the proceedings were taken , S was suffering significant harm from the neglect of her schooling , the environment in which she was living and the applicants\u2019 inability to prioritise her needs over their own . With regard to the final care plan , the judge found that the first applicant had no intention of submitting to a psychological assessment . She also noted that if the second applicant were to agree to an assessment , she would be unlikely honestly to engage . In any case , she noted that an assessment of CARDINAL parent only would be pointless . Finally , she considered that it would not be safe to return PERSON to the applicants without such an assessment , and that ORG \u2019s interests would not be served by any further delay . The judge could not make a final order in the terms requested by the local authority as ORG \u2019s case had not been placed before a permanence panel . She therefore made a DATE interim care order .", "The case came back before the judge in DATE . It could not be considered earlier as there had been a failure to provide the permanence panel with the correct documentation in an appropriate form .", "At the hearing the judge noted that there was no evidence which would require her to vary the conclusions that she made in DATE . She therefore made a final care order , dispensed with the applicants\u2019 consent and made a placement order . Given S \u2019s age , she indicated that an order which did not allow for the possibility of direct contact between her and the applicants would be inappropriate , but that much work would have to be done before such contact could take place .", "On DATE the applicants were refused leave to appeal to ORG .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides for the making of care and supervision orders :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) On the application of any local authority or authorised person , the court may make an order\u2014", "( a ) placing the child with respect to whom the application is made in the care of a designated local authority ; or", "( b ) putting him under the supervision of a designated local authority or of a probation officer .", "( CARDINAL ) A court may only make a care order or supervision order if it is satisfied\u2014", "( a ) that the child concerned is suffering , or is likely to suffer , significant harm ; and", "( b ) that the harm , or likelihood of harm , is attributable to\u2014", "( i ) the care given to the child , or likely to be given to him if the order were not made , not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him ; or", "( ii ) the child \u2019s being beyond parental control . \u201d", "ORG provides for the making of placement orders :", "\u201c CARDINAL Placement Orders", "( CARDINAL ) A placement order is an order made by the court authorising a local authority to place a child for adoption with any prospective adopters who may be chosen by the authority .", "( CARDINAL ) The court may not make a placement order in respect of a child unless\u2014", "( a ) the child is subject to a care order ,", "( b ) the court is satisfied that the conditions in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act ( conditions for making a care order ) are met , or", "( c ) the child has no parent or guardian .", "( CARDINAL ) The court may only make a placement order if , in the case of each parent or guardian of the child , the court is satisfied\u2014", "( a ) that the parent or guardian has consented to the child being placed for adoption with any prospective adopters who may be chosen by the local authority and has not withdrawn the consent , or", "( b ) that the parent \u2019s or guardian \u2019s consent should be dispensed with .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL Parental etc . consent", "( CARDINAL ) The court can not dispense with the consent of any parent or guardian of a child to the child being placed for adoption or to the making of an adoption order in respect of the child unless the court is satisfied that\u2014", "( a ) the parent or guardian can not be found or is incapable of giving consent , or", "( b ) the welfare of the child requires the consent to be dispensed with . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
