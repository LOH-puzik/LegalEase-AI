It held that the lower court had , in breach of the rules of procedure , failed to indicate to Mr PERSON which of his allegations were unsupported by evidence . For instance , the lower court had held Mr PERSON \u2019s omission to present medical evidence on his state of health against him without instructing him to present such evidence . Since it was apparently of the view that such evidence was required , it could have even appointed a medical expert of its own motion . Its failure to do so could not be explained by Mr PERSON \u2019s inability to bear the costs of such an expert report . Such financial considerations could not be allowed to trump the fundamental constitutional right of access to an independent court . The lower court had in addition failed to rule in terms on several of PERSON PERSON \u2019s evidentiary requests . That , as well as its failure to obtain the medical documents concerning Mr PERSON \u2019s stay in FAC , had in effect prevented Mr PERSON from making out his claim .", "CARDINAL .

The applicable DATE limitation period had therefore expired on DATE , whereas Mr PERSON \u2019s claim had been lodged in DATE . Therefore , in as much as it concerned the period before DATE , the claim was time - barred . In as much it concerned the period after that date , it was unproved : there was no evidence of either unlawful acts or omissions on the part of the prison authorities or of harm suffered by Mr PERSON as a result of that .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed on points of law . He argued , inter alia , that ORG had completely disregarded part of the evidence and had erroneously found that there was no evidence in relation to the period after DATE .

[ T]he DATE limitation period [ therefore ] started to run on that date and expired on DATE . In these circumstances , and given that the statement of claim was lodged on DATE , it was proper to hold that , regardless of the veracity or otherwise of the allegations about the period of time DATE and DATE , the claim concerning that period was timebarred . As regards the remainder of DATE and DATE \u2013 the case file does not contain any evidence showing that the alleged unlawful acts and omissions of officials of FAC have indeed taken place .

He remained in this prison until DATE , when he was transferred to FAC . He arrived in FAC on DATE , and DATE was placed in FAC , where he remained until DATE , when he was transferred to PERSON open - type prison hostel , attached to FAC .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON alleged that the cells in which he was kept , first cell no . CARDINAL and then cell no . CARDINAL on the third floor , measured CARDINAL by QUANTITY , making for a total surface of QUANTITY , and housed CARDINAL inmates , which made for QUANTITY each . Since the cell had CARDINAL triple - bunk and CARDINAL double - bunk beds , CARDINAL lockers , and CARDINAL table , the actual amount of free space was even less , QUANTITY per person .

The cell had CARDINAL windows close to the ceiling , QUANTITY each , which allegedly did not allow direct sunlight into the cell or its proper ventilation . Since there were no cells for non - smokers , Mr PERSON had to share the cell with smokers , which was allegedly particularly problematic for him in view of the lack of ventilation . According to the Government , the issue of smoking was being resolved amicably among the cellmates ; according to Mr PERSON , that was absolutely not the case . He said that the problem could not be solved as up to PERCENT of inmates in FAC were smokers . Mr PERSON was not one , and he only received cigarettes from the outside to use them as currency , as was customary in the prison . He also said that there were CARDINAL or CARDINAL television sets in the cell that showed different programmes , which , given the little space available and the level of noise , made it impossible to watch television . There were no newspapers or magazines available in the prison either , and access to the poorly stocked library was only possible once DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to Mr PERSON , there was no running water or toilet in the cell , and inmates had to use a bucket to relieve themselves at TIME , when the cell was locked . Mr PERSON \u2019s floor had CARDINAL NORP - type toilets without running water for DATE inmates housed on that floor , and CARDINAL showers , which often did not work ( and , when they worked , had hot water only twice a week for TIME ) ; as a result , inmates had to use small cans to bathe themselves .

Mr PERSON also said that cleaning the toilets was very hard because the prison administration did not supply enough cleaning products .", "CARDINAL . According to Mr GPE , the prison canteen measured CARDINAL by QUANTITY and accommodated QUANTITY people at the same time , which caused severe overcrowding and discomfort while eating . According to the Government , the number of inmates in the canteen during meals was CARDINAL . Mr PERSON said that the quality of the food was very poor , and that outside food parcels did not compensate for that , especially since there were no refrigerators in which to store them . According to the Government , each inmate was provided with CARDINAL calories a day , in line with official tables . Each inmate was entitled to receive QUANTITY of food parcels a month and QUANTITY of fruit and vegetables . According to Mr PERSON , inmates were in practice given CARDINAL of what was necessary in terms of food .", "CARDINAL .

Mr PERSON said that he was allowed to take a shower twice a week , TIME However , the bathroom , which measured QUANTITY , featured CARDINAL shower and CARDINAL sinks and usually the inmates used small cans to pour water on themselves .

He further submitted that he had not been provided with cutlery and had been forced , like the other detainees , to eat with his hands from random boxes that had come into his possession .

The Government nevertheless submitted that at that time conditions in this prison had been fully compliant with the applicable legal framework and pointed out that , while Mr GPE had filed CARDINAL complaints with the prison authorities , he had not complained in terms of the conditions of his detention there . In reply , Mr GPE said that he had not made such complaints because conditions in the prison had been the same for all prisoners , but that , as evident from a complaint that he had filed on DATE , he had sought a transfer to PERSON precisely because of the poor conditions in FAC . That transfer request had been denied by the prison authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE was transferred to FAC . He was initially placed in prisoner group CARDINAL , and then in prisoner groups CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE alleged that the conditions of his detention in this prison were as poor as in the previous CARDINAL prisons . He said that in DATE heating had been turned on only twice a day for TIME . As a result of that and of the fact that the windows did not close properly , the temperature in the cell never went above QUANTITY . The Government submitted that the heating boilers in FAC had been fired twice a day , for CARDINAL to four hours . If Mr PERSON had had a problem with the window in his cell , he should have brought that to the attention of the responsible prison officials , who would have taken steps to tackle it . Mr GPE retorted that , while he could not say for how long the boilers had been fired DATE , the amount of time during which the radiators in his cell had been warm was TIME .", "CARDINAL .

Mr GPE further submitted that the toilets had been very dirty .

The Government submitted that , while in FAC , Mr GPE had visited a dentist twice , on DATE , when he had had a tooth extracted in order to treat his periodontitis , and on CARDINAL DATE , when he had been prescribed medication for bleeding in the gums . Mr GPE retorted that although he had not been health insured during his stay in ORG , the resident dentist there had provided him with the necessary medication free of charge . However , in FAC , despite being already health insured , he was not provided with medication free of charge , and experienced great difficulties in obtaining that medication .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE was transferred to FAC , a closed - type prison hostel in GPE attached to FAC .
