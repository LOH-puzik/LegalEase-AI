It then described the ill - treatment suffered by the applicant while in police custody and excluded the possibility that his injuries could have been caused accidentally . The court based its judgment on the evidence given by PERSON , who had made an excellent impression in the witness box , and by the witnesses , particularly the journalist who had seen the applicant on DATE when he was released from police custody and had taken notes . It went on to say :", "\" In summary , the court therefore notes that the injuries sustained by PERSON were seen by several people who were not in any way involved in the events giving rise to the case . These injuries consisted of several bruises - not a slight abrasion or a small bruise - on the upper right arm . The claim that a cervical syndrome was sustained is credible , given the description of how it occurred , namely by the head being pulled violently backwards by the hair . It is a fact recognised by the courts ( gerichtsbekannt ) that it is impossible to prove the existence of a cervical syndrome by objective means , even using X - rays . To have consulted a medical expert for this purpose would therefore merely have led to a delay in the proceedings . A haematoma about as big as an egg , many other bruises and a cervical syndrome constitute bodily harm . This is not a question for an expert ; it is a matter for the court , which it has duly determined in accordance with the consistent case - law .", "It is not only the testimony that has so far been heard which is persuasive of PERSON credibility but also his excellent memory of the persons concerned . In this connection , the court would refer to the identity parade on DATE , that is DATE after the offence ( file , item CARDINAL ) . At this identity parade , consisting of a total of QUANTITY persons , PERSON did not hesitate for CARDINAL moment in recognising those involved in the police interviews , and in particular the accused PERSON .", "Ranged against this evidence is the line of defence established by the accused , which can only be described as disquieting . Both he and his defence lawyer , as well as his superior officer , PERSON , attempted at the trial ( file , page CARDINAL in item CARDINAL ) to make PERSON out to be a despicable , work - shy individual . Apart from the fact that an officer of ORG does not have the right to beat someone up in order to induce him to make a confession , simply because he is unemployed , what is noteworthy here is the obviously misguided attitude of the accused to his legal obligations . In his efforts to portray the witness PERSON as a depraved individual , he suddenly claimed at the trial that the CARDINAL anonymous callers had been PERSON and PERSON . He had , he stated , in the meantime learned from them that \u2018 PERSON [ was ] a despicable creature ( eine miese PERSON ) because he [ sold ] washing powder to the poorest of the poor , the drug addicts\u2019 ( file , page CARDINAL in item CARDINAL ) . When the court asked him whether he had reported this , he was forced to reply that he had not . He subsequently went on to entangle himself in more and more contradictions concerning the statements made by these CARDINAL witnesses ( file , page CARDINAL in item CARDINAL ) . If the accused \u2019s claim were really true this would mean that an officer of ORG , who had good reason to suspect someone of , at the very least , deliberately inflicting grievous bodily harm by selling washing powder he passed off as heroin , did not consider it necessary in any way at all to perform his duty under LAW . The conclusion must be drawn that the accused PERSON would prefer to allow criminal acts to be committed with potentially fatal consequences than to run the risk of having people say that he now wants to pin something on PERSON - which he is obviously afraid of ( see page CARDINAL ) .", "With regard to the application for a forensic doctor to be appointed with a view to showing that the injuries and the haematoma could also have been caused by a fall against the edge of the car door and that the other bruises on the inside of the upper right arm were caused when the former suspect \u2019s arm was grabbed , the court notes as follows : The accused PERSON himself states in his ( wrongly dated ) report ( file , page CARDINAL ) that when PERSON was taken away for the voice comparison to be made he evidently missed his footing getting out of the car , which caused him to lose his balance and his right arm to bang into the edge of the car door , which had remained open . He , PERSON , who had been standing right next to him , had managed to grab his upper left arm but had not been able to prevent him from falling . However , due to his intervention the fall had been rendered much less serious , and PERSON had only fallen gently on to his behind . PERSON therefore himself states that he grabbed PERSON by the left arm , so that he can not have inflicted a bruise on the inside of the right arm by catching him in this way . However , this version of events in the report is also contradicted by the witness PERSON ( file , page CARDINAL in item CARDINAL ) . This witness stated that there had been a big problem finding a place to park . He had had to park very close to another vehicle , so that he had had a great deal of trouble getting out of his own . It is ` very strange\u2019 ( lebensfremd ) that , although the driver of the vehicle had great difficulty getting out of it on his side , and although , because of the tight squeeze , the suspect at the time ( PERSON ) must obviously also have had trouble getting out - PERSON stated that PERSON sat directly behind the driver - there was yet sufficient room for PERSON to fall against the edge of the door and then on to his bottom . If one considers PERSON size , that is impossible . Furthermore , the witness ORG , who is a general practitioner , made a statement as an expert witness that was both credible and ` easy to understand\u2019 ( nachvollziehbar ) , namely that whilst the largest bruise had been on the upper right arm it had not been the only one there . He continued by drawing attention to a phenomenon that the courts have recognised in many previous cases , namely that a person who falls against a hard edge normally has a graze or a skin wound , whereas when a person falls against or is struck by something without sharp edges , whether it is something with a large surface area or a fist , it is not the surface that is affected but the soft tissues underneath the skin ( file , page CARDINAL ) . Similarly , a cervical syndrome could be the result of PERSON \u2019s head being violently shaken .", "In law , both the objective and the subjective elements of the offence have been made out and PERSON is therefore guilty of the offence of assault occasioning bodily harm as defined in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW . The conditions laid down in LAW are not satisfied since this kind of behaviour can not be classified as a trivial offence . Moreover , the specific , and above all general , requirements of deterrence militate against the application of this rule . PERSON was unable to prevent himself from committing the acts in issue in the instant case , even though he must have known that similar proceedings ( where the facts were more serious ) had already been brought against one of his superior officers , Mr Gross .", "In sentencing the accused , the court considers the fact that the accused has no previous convictions to be a mitigating circumstance . On the other hand , his particularly brutal conduct constitutes an aggravating circumstance . Given a possible maximum sentence of DATE , the sentence imposed of DATE is reasonable in view of the offender \u2019s personality and the degree of culpability . For general reasons of deterrence - more and more accusations directed against the brutal policemen ( pr\u00fcgelnde Polizisten ) of the Security Branch have been made in DATE - a fine would not have been sufficient .", "In view of the length of prison sentence imposed , it must , however , be assumed that the threat of its execution will be sufficient to deter PERSON and others from committing criminal acts . For this reason , the court has been able to impose a suspended sentence . \"", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed against the judgment to ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG By an interlocutory decision of CARDINAL DATE the court ordered an expert opinion to be produced by ORG concerning the probability of there being a causal connection between PERSON injuries and the accident which had allegedly occurred when he was taken out under police escort , and the credibility from the medical point of view of the applicant \u2019s statements regarding the ill - treatment he had undergone .", "CARDINAL . ORG After interviewing both PERSON and PERSON and organising a reconstruction of the applicant \u2019s alleged fall against the rear door of the police car , the expert from ORG summarised his findings as follows :", "\" Therefore , judging by ORG medical records , PERSON had a group of bruises on the outside of his upper right arm covering an area of CARDINAL by QUANTITY . Moreover , the findings of the neurological examination also contain a description of bruising to the inside of the right arm . Thus , the only injuries established by doctors were the bruises on the outside and inside of the upper right arm described above . These bruises must be regarded as minor and are to be interpreted as the result of dull blows to these parts of the body ( lokale stumpfe PERSON ) . They are not likely to result in CARDINAL days\u2019 sickness or unfitness for work .", "Whether there was further bruising in the area of CARDINAL armpit and below the right knee must be left to the judge \u2019s assessment of the evidence , as no medical findings were available to form the basis for an opinion on this question . The decisive factor is the credibility of the witness evidence . Even if CARDINAL assumes that these haematomas existed it would make no difference to the assessment of the consequences of the injuries described above .", "The general practitioner PERSON diagnosed a cervical syndrome and pointed to vomiting , headaches and a raised body temperature . However , the neurological examination conducted at ORG did not reveal any evidence of a head injury or a displaced cervical vertebra . These symptoms can be interpreted in this case as non - specific complaints , resulting , for example , from a general infection ( PERSON ) ( PERSON stated that he was suffering from diarrhoea ) . On the other hand , from the point of view of forensic medicine , no connection can be proved with any trauma that may have been suffered .", "The results of the test carried out with the car - no big differences are to be expected with a ORG - showed that the bruising to the outside of the upper right arm was roughly consistent as far as its position was concerned with the bruise on the outside of the upper arm described in the outpatient records and visible in the photograph . From the medical point of view these injuries must be described as non - specific injuries , and they only support the conclusion that this area of the body was violently struck by a blunt \u2018 instrument\u2019 , without it being possible to conclude from the nature of the damage what kind of instrument it was . The possibility can not therefore be excluded that the injury was caused by a bump against the car door .", "Even if one proceeds upon the assumption that the injuries described by the witnesses existed , the general diagnosis must , on the whole , be described as non - specific , so that no certain conclusion can be drawn from the medical point of view as to whether there was maltreatment , although blows to the upper arm and , perhaps , a kick in the knee area can not be excluded . However , serious ill - treatment lasting TIME can not in any case be deduced from the overall pattern of the injuries .", "However , the version submitted by PERSON , namely that PERSON fell against the car door can explain CARDINAL of several injuries that may have been sustained . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG At the hearing on DATE the expert \u2019s report and a statement by the \" police detention centre \" to the effect that the prison doctor had seen PERSON at TIME on DATE and had declared him fit for detention were read out . The court then heard Police Officer PERSON , PERSON PERSON and the expert from ORG .", "In its report , the ORG gave the following account of PERSON and the applicant \u2019s declarations :", "\" CARDINAL . ORG Police Officer PERSON was again questioned on the accusations against him , brought both by the applicant and his wife . PERSON expressed the view that the applicant \u2019s wife had suffered from the fact of her detention as such and had , together with her husband , concentrated upon PERSON against whom to bring their accusations . PERSON remembered that upon his arrest the applicant had threatened to cause difficulties . At a later stage , when his superior PERSON had been present , there had , as usual , been a rather calm atmosphere . At the questioning on DATE , the applicant had shown him the bruising on his right upper arm , but had not wanted to see a physician . PERSON also repeated his version of the incident upon the applicant \u2019s escorted visit .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant was questioned about his professional training and his past occupations , his financial situation , furthermore about his contacts with drugs . Questioned about the alleged escalation of the interrogation , the applicant stated that the police officers had wished to find a culprit by any means . As regards the first questioning on DATE , he stated that Police Officer PERSON had disliked CARDINAL of his answers and , therefore , pulled him by his moustache out of the chair and later put him down again . As he had not resisted , his moustache had not been torn off . Police Officer PERSON had already hit him at that stage , however not in the face ; throughout the beating PERSON had attempted to avoid marks as far as possible . The applicant further stated that he had not suffered any accidental incident upon his escorted visit , and he insisted that at the time he had been driven in a CARDINAL - door car , whereas the reconstruction had been done with a CARDINAL - door car . The applicant was subsequently questioned in detail about the course of the maltreatment to which he had allegedly been subjected . He repeated his earlier statements that PERSON had mainly beaten and kicked him and pulled him by the hair , though , when lying on the floor , he had the impression of being kicked by CARDINAL person . Questioned about the varying statements in the course of the proceedings as to the shoe - print , the applicant insisted that the haematoma had been on his lower leg underneath his knee , as had the shoe - print on his trousers . He could not say with certainty that PERSON had kicked him , causing this particular haematoma . The applicant also said that he had chosen counsel to represent him in this matter only after having gathered information . The reporter of the public broadcast had coincidentally been present in a pub where he had told friends about the incidents . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG At the end of the trial ORG quashed ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE and acquitted PERSON . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , it referred the applicant to the civil courts in respect of his claim for damages .", "In its judgment of DATE the court set out its reasons as follows :", "\" However , the defence lawyer \u2019s written appeal against conviction and his oral pleadings at the hearing on DATE cause attention to be focused on the question whether on its own , and in context , the evidence incriminating the accused provides a sufficient degree of reliability to support a verdict of guilty , since it must be borne in mind that the civil party PERSON has been involved , from time to time at any rate , in the drug scene .", "The position confronting the appeal court as regards evidence ( ORG ) is as follows : while it is true that the statements made by all the witnesses informed by the civil party PERSON tallied perfectly with his own version of events , which always remained the same , the objective accuracy of this version stands or falls solely on the reliability of the evidence given by PERSON . Moreover , like the court of first instance , the appeal court has no doubt as to the subjective accuracy of the statements made by the witnesses PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , and can therefore base its decision on the record of their testimony , in accordance with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW . Nevertheless , it considers it necessary to inquire into PERSON credibility , to weigh up his story against that of the accused and to supplement the evidence adduced in the proceedings at first instance by consulting an expert from ORG . \"", "With regard to the applicant \u2019s credibility , ORG pointed out that on DATE ORG had found him guilty of drug offences and ordered him to pay a fine . Moreover , he had been unemployed for DATE and lived off his wife \u2019s income and social security benefits . These resources were not , however , sufficient to cover his expenses as a drug user who was the father of CARDINAL minor children at the material time , or his other personal expenses . The court then summarised the versions given by PERSON on the one hand and PERSON on the other of the events which had occurred while the applicant was in police custody , and went on to say :", "\" Neither PERSON account nor the testimony of his wife PERSON in the file have been able to satisfy the appeal court conclusively that there was a situation which could logically explain why the police interviews degenerated into criminal behaviour . Moreover , seeing that CARDINAL police officers were present and asked questions during the interviews , and were busy for part of the time interviewing PERSON , that Police Officers PERSON and PERSON , who were subsequently acquitted , were cleared of blame by PERSON himself ( vol . II , pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) and that neither PERSON nor his wife PERSON accused Police Officer PERSON , who treated them correctly , of any offence ( PERSON to PERSON , vol II , pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL ; PERSON , vol . I , page CARDINAL ) , the appeal court considers that it remains a completely open question which other ORG officers might have been PERSON accomplices ( Mit- oder PERSON ) . The view of the evidence taken by the court of first instance , to the effect that public pressure to solve the crime , which was reflected in TIME of overtime ( confirmed by the Chief of Police , PERSON , in vol . I , pages DATE and DATE ) , constituted sufficient motivation , does not appear to the appeal court to be capable of bearing scrutiny ( tragf\u00e4hig ) , since one can not simply assume that a police officer , and CARDINAL moreover who had good reason to be aware of the heightened vigilance of the media , would let himself be drawn into criminal acts in a way that defies all logic .", "PERSON version of events , according to which , ` TIME and CARDINAL p.m. on DATE he was questioned for periods of CARDINAL of an hour , each time by CARDINAL police officers , after which CARDINAL more officers banged his head against the floor and kicked him for CARDINAL of an hour\u2019 ( vol . I , page CARDINAL ) leads CARDINAL to expect a large number of injuries , especially to prominent parts of the face . Similarly , PERSON \u2019s claim ( loc . cit . ) that he was hit on the body in such a way \u2018 that this did not leave MONEY but was nevertheless very painful\u2019 would suggest that the officers had gone about their task in a methodical way , but this can not be reconciled with PERSON account , according to which the officers , in their efforts to force him to confess , had lost all control over their actions . This version of events does not tally with PERSON \u2019s assertion that it was possible for him to distinguish between the officers questioning him and those who were maltreating him , given that , according to other statements made by PERSON , PERSON participated both in the interrogation and in the ill - treatment . \"", "The court then turned to the question of the injuries noted on the applicant \u2019s person .", "( i ) It referred to Mr PERSON \u2019s statements to the effect that PERSON had lost his balance when he bumped into the car \u2019s rear door and had slid to the ground before he , PERSON , could grab hold of his left arm and break his fall . According to the forensic medical report , it was not impossible for the bruises on the outside of the applicant \u2019s right arm to have been caused by DATE , even though the general practitioner questioned by the court of first instance on this subject had stated that this was rather unlikely . Lastly , the expert from ORG , who had organised the reconstruction of the events , had stated that the more violent Mr PERSON \u2019s collision ( Anprall ) with the car door had been , the more likely it was to have caused the injuries , but that the more it resembled a mere slip to the ground ( ORG ) , the more improbable was the version of the events given by the accused .", "( ii ) ORG The court added that CARDINAL of the witnesses , namely the journalist , had noted the existence of a bruise on the inside of the right arm , which in any case was not by itself proof of ill - treatment . Moreover , Mr PERSON had stated in that connection that he could not be sure he had not also grabbed PERSON right arm to stop him falling .", "( iii ) As for the applicant \u2019s other symptoms , namely the cervical syndrome , stiffness of the fingers and diarrhoea , the court pointed out that , according to the report from ORG , these might also have been signs of a general infection .", "The court refused the applicant \u2019s lawyer \u2019s request that further evidence be taken , such as re - examination of the witnesses , production of the recording made by NORP radio , reconstruction of the events with a CARDINAL - door ORG and a psycho - neurological report ; it also refused the prosecution \u2019s request for production of the Security Branch log - books so that it could be checked whether a CARDINAL - door or CARDINAL - door car had been used . It concluded in these terms :", "\" Finally , if one considers the fact that the civil party PERSON did not see fit to report the offence , that he has been unable in the course of these proceedings to state why he did not do so , that , for incomprehensible reasons , he chose the course of making a public accusation on NORP radio and that during the proceedings he became entangled in contradictions concerning the alibi to be proven by the witness PERSON , then there are considerable doubts as to the reliability ( verl\u00e4\u00dfliche PERSON ) of his evidence .", "The appeal court is therefore unable to reach a conclusive decision either to reject the accused \u2019s evidence or to accept even in part the evidence adduced by the civil party PERSON with the certainty which alone may be made the basis of a verdict of guilty in criminal proceedings .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON then applied to ORG , which gave judgment on DATE . It held that the applicant \u2019s arrest , his detention in police custody and the searches carried out at his home had been unlawful and had infringed his right to liberty of person and respect for his home . The police had not been in possession of either an arrest warrant or a search warrant and had not been able to establish the risk of collusion or immediate danger . It ruled that it had no jurisdiction to rule on the question of the insults allegedly uttered by the police to the applicant . As for the ill - treatment he had allegedly undergone , it noted that the CARDINAL defendants had been acquitted by the lower courts and concluded :", "\" In the light of this outcome of the criminal proceedings ( during which a large body of evidence was presented ) , ORG considers that it is not in a position ( au\u00dfer PERSON ) to uphold the applicant \u2019s allegations and to consider the claims of ill - treatment made in the application to this court to have been proved beyond doubt . In summary , in the proceedings before ORG it was no longer possible , in the circumstances , to clarify the relevant facts any further , nor , consequently , to furnish proof of the alleged human rights violation .", "On this point also , therefore - in the absence of a valid object - the application must be declared inadmissible ( unzul\u00e4ssig ) . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
