The CARDINAL applicants belong to ORG to GPE , also known as ORG or ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG was dissolved by Decree no . MONEY , and its assets , with the exception of parish property , were transferred to the ORG ; an inter - departmental committee was given responsibility for determining the ultimate allocation of the parish property . However , the committee never completed this task and the parish property was transferred to ORG under Decree no . ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the property comprising the church building and the adjoining courtyard , which had belonged to the first applicant , was entered in the land register as having been transferred to the ownership of the PERSON I NORP Orthodox Parish ( \u201c the NORP parish \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . After DATE of the communist regime in DATE , Decree no . DATE was repealed by Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . ORG was officially recognised by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on certain measures concerning ORG to GPE . LAW of that LAW provided that the legal status of property that had belonged to the ORG parishes and that was in the possession of ORG was to be determined by joint committees made up of representatives of both ORG and NORP clergy . In reaching their decisions , the committees were to take into account \u201c the wishes of the worshippers in the communities in possession of these properties \u201d .", "CARDINAL . DATE no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was amended by Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and PERSON no . PERSON . Under the amended decree , in the event of disagreement between the members of the clergy representing the CARDINAL denominations in a joint committee , the party with an interest in bringing judicial proceedings could do so under \u201c ordinary law \u201d ( drept comun , see the procedure referred to in CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was legally re - established on DATE and the applicants brought proceedings before the joint committee to have their former properties returned to them , but without success .", "CARDINAL . The domestic law , in particular Legislative Decree no . DATE and the amendments made to it in DATE and DATE , is set out in DATE below .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant brought proceedings before the domestic courts against ORG and the NORP parish . It requested that the expropriation of the church building and cemetery in PERSON , carried out on the basis of Decree no . DATE , be set aside , and that the church be returned to the first applicant . The first and third applicants were mentioned in the initial statement of claim as representatives of the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) declared the action inadmissible on the ground that the dispute ought to be settled through the special procedure established by Legislative Decree no . DATE , that is , before the joint committee .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants lodged an appeal against that judgment . On DATE they requested a stay of proceedings so that the case could be resolved by friendly settlement . On DATE they applied for it to be restored to the court \u2019s list of cases . On DATE , ORG ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) dismissed the appeal , holding that the action was premature . In a final judgment of DATE , ruling on an appeal on points of law ( recurs ) by the first and second applicants , ORG and ORG ( \u201c the High Court \u201d ) , quashed ORG judgment and sent the case back to that court to be examined on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in application of the legislative amendments to Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL which gave the courts jurisdiction to rule on the merits of cases concerning properties that had belonged to the ORG parishes and were in the possession of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG upheld the second applicant \u2019s appeal and sent the case back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the case was restored to ORG list , the action was amended in order to add the first and the third applicants formally as claimants in the proceedings . On DATE the applicants supplemented their action with a claim for recovery of possession of the properties in question , on the basis of ordinary law .", "CARDINAL . ORG asked the parties to organise a meeting in order to decide the fate of the church building in question , and to inform it of the outcome of the negotiations by DATE . The parties met on DATE without reaching an agreement .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 action on the ground that the NORP parish had become the legally recognised owner of the contested property by virtue of Decree no . MONEY and that it had behaved as an owner , inter alia by ensuring that the church was maintained properly .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ruling on an appeal by the applicants , ORG set aside the judgment of DATE on grounds of a procedural defect and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found in favour of the applicants and ordered that the church be returned to the first applicant . Comparing the parties\u2019 title deeds in respect of the property in question , it noted that ORG had been entered in the land register as owner of the property from DATE , and that in DATE ORG had entered its ownership right to the same property , transferred to it under Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . It held that the repealing of Decree no . MONEY had had the effect in the present case of terminating the NORP party \u2019s right of ownership over the disputed property . It also pointed out that the first applicant did not have a place of worship and that it was obliged to hold its religious services in LOC which it rented from ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG allowed an appeal lodged by the NORP parish and dismissed the applicants\u2019 action . On the basis of the evidence in the case file , it noted , firstly , that the church building being claimed and CARDINAL parsonages in ORG had been constructed DATE by LOC NORP and NORP worshippers and that , after its construction , the church building had been used alternately for services by both denominations . It noted that in DATE the members of ORG had been obliged to convert to ORG and that this church building had been transferred to the ownership of ORG , which had maintained it and carried out renovation work .", "CARDINAL . ORG also examined statements , collected by ORG , from CARDINAL witnesses . It noted that these statements supported the statistical data indicating that there were more NORP than NORP worshippers in PERSON . It noted that , according to the most recent census , there were CARDINAL NORP worshippers and CARDINAL NORP worshippers in PERSON . It also compared the witness statements , written documents attesting to the number of NORP worshippers as declared when ORG was re - established in PERSON , and data from the most recent census conducted in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . It then reasoned as follows :", "\u201c ... although the action was based on the provisions of ordinary law , namely LAW of LAW , in view of its subject matter the court can not rule without applying the provisions of LAW no . DATE , to the effect that the legal situation of places of worship and parsonages ... must be determined taking account of the wishes of the worshippers in the community that is in possession of the properties \u201d .", "CARDINAL . It considered that , given that there were more NORP than NORP worshippers in PERSON , including the converts who no longer wished to return to ORG , their refusal had to be taken into account in ruling on the case . It found that \u201c having regard to the social and historical realities , ignoring the wishes and proportional strength of NORP worshippers , who are in the majority , in relation to the far fewer NORP Catholic worshippers , would be to undermine the stability and certainty of legal relations \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the fact that Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL had been repealed did not automatically mean that ORG title had been annulled , as this Decree represented the law in force at the time that the ownership right was transferred . In consequence , it considered that , although it had been granted under legislation which had subsequently been declared unlawful , ORG title had been valid from the date on which the transfer had been made , with the result that the action to recover possession was unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law before ORG , alleging that ORG had incorrectly applied the legal provisions governing actions for recovery of possession . They argued that the right of ownership could not be linked to a religion \u2019s majority status , since ownership was a legal concept that was independent of the numerical strength and wishes of the parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a majority , delivered a final judgment in which it set out , in detail , the decisions taken by the lower courts . Reiterating that those courts alone had jurisdiction to establish the facts , it endorsed their findings of fact . It dismissed the ORG appeal on points of law and upheld the judgment delivered on appeal . As to the applicable law , it held , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c Pursuant to Legislative Decree no . DATE ... a distinction is made CARDINAL situations : ( a ) that in which the property is in the ownership of the State ... ( b ) that in which the places of worship and the parishes have been taken over by ORG and in respect of which [ the question of ] restitution will be decided by a joint committee made up of representatives of the clergy of the CARDINAL denominations , a committee which will take account of the wishes of the worshippers in the communities in possession of these properties .", "In the light of those provisions , ORG , examining an action for recovery of possession of a place of worship , correctly applied the criterion of the wishes of the ( predominantly NORP ) worshippers of the community in possession of the property , while simultaneously emphasising the unlawfulness of the reasoning of the first - instance court , which had merely compared the title deeds and ignored the special law ...", "However , it appears that there are CARDINAL NORP worshippers and CARDINAL NORP worshippers in PERSON , that the worshippers who were obliged to transfer to ORG in DATE do not wish to return to ORG and that an attempt has been made to resolve [ the dispute ] through the joint clerical committee ( according to TIME ... the NORP party had indicated that the request for the return of the place of worship could not be granted , having regard to the wishes of the worshippers in the parish and the fact that since DATE the place of worship has been administered by the NORP believers ) ...", "The fact of supplementing LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] with a paragraph stating \u201c If the committee does not meet within the period established in its mandate , or if the committee does not reach a conclusion or if one of the parties is dissatisfied with the decision taken by the committee , the party with an interest in bringing judicial proceedings may do so under ordinary law \u201d does not mean that actions for restitution governed by the special provisions are transformed into applications to establish title under ordinary law .", "A court which is required to examine such an action can not ignore the special regulations in this area , which indicate the criterion to be taken into account in resolving such claims , namely the wishes of the worshippers in the community in possession of the property .", "In other words , by virtue of its full jurisdiction and in order not to compromise access to justice , a court may be called upon to decide an action on the merits , even though the prior procedure did not culminate in a decision by the joint clerical committee ; at the same time , however , it may not go beyond the limits imposed by the special statutory framework .", "The priority to be given to the criterion of the worshippers\u2019 wishes was decided by the legislature , which wished in this way to regulate an area which concerns the buildings assigned to a particular use ( places of worship ) , [ and so ] the court is not entitled to criticise the law .", "Moreover , in ruling on the alleged unconstitutionality of LAW no . MONEY and the criterion of the worshippers\u2019 wishes , ORG has stated that the text did not infringe the principle of democracy of GPE , nor that of the freedom of religious denominations ( ORG decision no . FAC , ORG decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ...", "In ORG view , the fact that the ORG unlawfully dispossessed ORG of its places of worship in DATE can not be remedied \u2013 in a ORG subject to the rule of law \u2013 by committing the opposite error , that is , by failing to take account of the wishes of the majority of worshippers at the point of adopting the given measure . Returning the properties which belonged to ORG without respecting the criteria imposed by LAW no . DATE would undermine the stability and certainty of legal relations . A right can not be reconstructed in abstracto , in disregard of social and historical realities , and mitigation of past damage must not create disproportionate new problems ...", "Moreover , in order to be able to bring an action for recovery of possession under ordinary law rather than under the special law , the appellants must rely on the existence of a \u201c possession \u201d , namely of a pecuniary right that could be relied upon by them .", "However , the NORP Catholic denomination was dissolved by Decree no . GPE and the assets of ORG passed into the ownership of the ORG . The building in question is currently entered ( in the land register ... as belonging to the PERSON I Romanian Orthodox Church .", "The fact that , through Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG to GPE ( NORP Catholic ) was officially recognised following the repeal of Decree no . FAC does not mean that all of its titles to property were restored , in so far as the right of ownership is subject to a procedure ( namely the provisions of Legislative Decree no . DATE and its subsequent amendments ) , and the hope of obtaining title to property is not to be equated with a possession ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a separate opinion , CARDINAL of the judges sitting in the case noted that the legislature \u2019s reference to ordinary law could not be reduced to a purely procedural dimension , but was to be interpreted as the application of a rule of substantive law . Referring to the rules governing the preparation of statutes , the judge expressed the opinion that if the legislature had wished to ascribe a specific meaning to this reference to \u201c ordinary law \u201d , it ought to have done so explicitly . As an action for recovery of possession involved a comparison of the relevant property titles , the judge concluded that ORG had no such title to the church building in question ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
