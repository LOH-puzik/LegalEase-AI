The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( \u201c the SFRY \u201d ) was a federal ORG composed of CARDINAL republics : GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . SFRY nationals had \u201c dual citizenship \u201d for internal purposes , that is , they were citizens both of the SFRY and of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL GPE . Until DATE , federal citizenship prevailed over republic citizenship : republic citizenship could only be held by a NORP citizen .", "CARDINAL . The regulation of citizenship was similar in all republics of the SFRY , with the basic principle of acquiring citizenship by blood ( jus sanguinis ) . In principle , a child acquired his or her GPE citizenship ; if the parents were citizens of different GPE , they jointly agreed on their child \u2019s citizenship . On the date of acquisition of the citizenship of another republic , a person \u2019s prior republic citizenship came to an end .", "CARDINAL . DATE a separate Register of Citizenship was kept at the level of the GPE and not at the level of the federal ORG . From DATE the citizenship data for newly born children were entered in the Register of Births and from DATE the entry of data in ORG ended , all citizenship data being entered in the Register of Births .", "CARDINAL . SFRY citizens had freedom of movement within the federal ORG and could register permanent residence wherever they settled on its territory . Full enjoyment of various civil , economic , social and even political rights for SFRY citizens was linked to permanent residence .", "CARDINAL . SFRY citizens living in the then GPE who were citizens of CARDINAL of the other SFRY republics , such as the applicants , registered their permanent residence there in the same way as NORP citizens . Foreign citizens could also acquire permanent residence in the SFRY under a separate procedure .", "CARDINAL . In the process of the dissolution of the SFRY , GPE took steps towards independence . On DATE , the then ORG of GPE adopted the \u201c Statement of Good Intentions \u201d ( PERSON o dobrih namenih ) , guaranteeing that all persons with permanent residence on NORP territory would be enabled to acquire NORP citizenship if they so wished ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE declared its independence . A series of laws termed \u201c the independence legislation \u201d were passed . This included the Citizenship of GPE ( Zakon o dr\u017eavljanstvu PERSON CARDINAL \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , LAW ( Zakon o tujcih , see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , ORG ( Zakon o nadzoru dr\u017eavne meje ) and FAC ( Zakon o potnih listinah dr\u017eavljanov PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , in contrast with some of the other former ORG , the NORP population was relatively homogeneous , PERCENT of the CARDINAL residents had NORP citizenship . CARDINAL NORP residents ( or PERCENT of the population ) , including the applicants , were citizens of the other former ORG . This proportion also broadly reflects the ethnic origin of the NORP population at that time .", "CARDINAL . NORP In accordance with the Statement of Good Intentions , CARDINAL of the DATE LAW provided that those citizens of other GPE of the former SFRY who , on DATE , the date of the plebiscite on the independence of GPE , were registered as permanent residents of GPE and actually lived there , held equal rights and duties to citizens of GPE , with the exception of the acquisition of property , until they acquired citizenship of GPE under section CARDINAL of LAW or until the expiry of the time - limit set out in section CARDINAL of LAW ( DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , which entered into force on DATE , provided that citizens of the former SFRY republics who were not citizens of GPE ( \u201c citizens of the former SFRY republics \u201d ) could acquire NORP citizenship if they met CARDINAL requirements : they had acquired permanent resident status in GPE by DATE ( the date of the plebiscite ) , were actually residing in GPE , and had applied for citizenship within DATE after LAW entered into force . As indicated in paragraph CARDINAL above , this deadline expired on DATE . After that date , the less favourable conditions for acquisition of citizenship by naturalisation provided for by section CARDINAL of LAW became applicable also for citizens of other former LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the official data , CARDINAL citizens of the former SFRY republics living in GPE applied for and were granted citizenship of the new ORG under LAW of LAW . Estimations are that CARDINAL persons left GPE .", "CARDINAL . Under the second subsection of LAW of LAW , citizens of the former GPE who either failed to apply for NORP citizenship within the prescribed time - limit or whose requests were not granted became aliens . The provisions of LAW became applicable to the former SFRY citizens either DATE after the expiry of the time - limit ( that is , by CARDINAL DATE ) , or DATE after a decision issued in administrative proceedings rejecting their application for citizenship became final ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . After the declaration of independence , ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) sent several unpublished internal instructions ( okro\u017enice , navodila , depe\u0161e ) to municipal administrative authorities relating to the implementation of the independence legislation , and in particular LAW . In a circular of DATE the ORG instructed the administrative authorities that citizens of other GPE living in GPE were henceforth considered aliens in all administrative proceedings and that , in accordance with LAW , they held equal rights and duties to citizens of GPE until the expiry of the relevant time - limits ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It further gave technical instructions in the field of passports and aliens . On DATE the ORG informed the municipal administrative authorities that , further to LAW between the European Community Ministerial Troika and representatives of GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , the enforcement of the independence legislation in the sphere of internal affairs had been suspended for DATE . During this period , citizens of other ORG would not be treated as aliens . CARDINAL further administrative circulars were issued on CARDINAL and DATE , drawing attention to the general problems relating to the implementation of LAW . The former circular stated that , when administering matters concerning the status of aliens , the personal documents of citizens of other LAW issued by the NORP administrative authorities should be kept and their passports revoked and destroyed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the date on which the second subsection of section CARDINAL of LAW became applicable , the municipal administrative authorities removed those who had not applied for or obtained NORP citizenship from ORG stalnega prebivalstva DATE \u201c the Register \u201d ) and , according to the Government , transferred them into ORG without a Residence Permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry indicated in its instructions to the municipal administrative authorities that it would be necessary to regulate the legal status of these persons . It drew their attention to the fact that numerous problems were expected to arise ; the legal status of the persons concerned should be regulated and , in parallel , \u201c the clearing of records \u201d should be undertaken . In addition , the ORG pointed out that the papers of such persons , even if issued by the NORP authorities and formally valid , would in fact become invalid owing to the ORG change in status ex lege . ORG also gave an interpretation of sections CARDINAL of LAW in cases of cancellation of residence and forcible removal .", "CARDINAL . The applicants stated that persons whose names were removed from the ORG received no official notification . They pointed out that no special procedure was provided for to that effect and no official documents were issued . They only subsequently became aware that they had become aliens , when , for example , they attempted to renew their personal documents ( personal identification card , passport , driving licence ) . The Government , however , maintained that , in addition to the publication in ORG , the NORP population was informed about the new legislation through public media and notices . In some municipalities , personal means of notification were allegedly also used .", "CARDINAL . According to official data from DATE , the number of former SFRY citizens who had lost their permanent residence status on CARDINAL DATE amounted to CARDINAL , of whom CARDINAL had been refused citizenship . They became known as the \u201c erased \u201d ( izbrisani ) , and included the applicants in the present case . New data on the \u201c erased \u201d were collected in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the \u201c erased \u201d became aliens or stateless persons illegally residing in GPE . In general , they had difficulties in keeping their jobs and driving licences and obtaining retirement pensions . Nor were they able to leave the country , because they could not re - enter without valid documents . Many families became divided , with some of their members in GPE and others in CARDINAL of the other successor GPE to the former SFRY . Among the \u201c erased \u201d were CARDINAL minors . In most cases their identity papers were taken away . Some of the \u201c erased \u201d voluntarily left GPE . Some were served with removal orders and deported from GPE .", "CARDINAL . After DATE the registration of permanent residence of citizens of other former SFRY republics was terminated if they had not acquired a new residence permit . However , under section CARDINAL of LAW , permanent residence permits issued to foreigners with citizenship of GPE other than the former SFRY republics continued to be valid after the entry into force of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the then Minister for the ORG sent a letter ( no . CARDINAL ) to the Government , informing them of the questions that remained open relating to the implementation of LAW , in view of the large number of persons from the other GPE of the former SFRY living in GPE without a regulated status . He also stated that , in his view , during the process of independence , all the rights of citizens of other LOC living in GPE , as resulting from international conventions and bilateral treaties , had been taken into account . The Government maintained that , further to this letter , they took action in order to attenuate the consequences of the \u201c erasure \u201d by interpreting the provisions of LAW in a more flexible manner ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In addition , on DATE another administrative circular with instructions on the implementation of LAW was sent to the municipal administrative authorities . It addressed a number of open questions relating to such matters as the allocation of military apartments , registration of temporary refugees from GPE , the keeping of records , transmission of personal information from the population register , and proceedings involving aliens . Personal identification cards issued to aliens by the NORP authorities were to be destroyed . In particular , as far as former SFRY citizens with permanent residence in GPE were concerned , it specified the dates to be entered in the register : either when they became NORP citizens or when they became aliens under section CARDINAL of LAW ( DATE or DATE after the date of receipt of the decision not to grant NORP citizenship ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Convention took effect in respect of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted a request for a referendum on the question whether or not citizenship granted to former SFRY citizens on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW should be withdrawn . On DATE ORG held that the request was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . In DATE that followed , several non - governmental organisations , including ORG and ORG , and ORG issued reports drawing attention to the situation of the \u201c erased \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared partly admissible a challenge to the constitutionality of the first subsection of section CARDINAL and the second subsection of LAW of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) , brought in DATE by CARDINAL individuals whose names had been removed from the ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG ) ORG declared that LAW of LAW was unconstitutional since it had not set out the conditions for acquisition of permanent residence for those subject to its second subsection . It noted that the authorities had deleted from the ORG the names of citizens of the former ORG who had not applied for NORP citizenship and entered them ex proprio motu in the Register of Aliens , without any notification . It further found that there was no legal basis for this measure ; the Inhabitants\u2019 Evidence of Residence and LAW did not provide for ex lege deregistration .", "CARDINAL . The provisions of LAW were , in general , designed to regulate the status of aliens who entered GPE after independence , not of those who were already living there . While section CARDINAL of LAW did regulate the legal status of aliens originating from outside the former GPE , no similar provision existed in respect of persons from the former SFRY . As a consequence , the latter were in a less favourable legal position than aliens who had lived in GPE since before independence .", "CARDINAL . A proposal had been made in the legislative process in DATE for a special provision regulating the temporary situation of former SFRY citizens living in GPE who had not applied for NORP citizenship . The legislature had maintained that their situation should not be regulated by LAW but rather by an agreement between the successor GPE to the former SFRY . Since the relevant agreements had not been concluded , notably because of the state of war in GPE and in GPE , their situation remained unaddressed . In ORG view , in the light of modern developments in human - rights protection , the situation of persons who had held the nationality of the predecessor but not of the successor ORG , with permanent residence on the territory of GPE that had disintegrated after DATE , had become a matter governed by international agreements .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL was therefore declared unconstitutional as it did not prescribe the conditions under which persons who either failed to apply for or were denied NORP citizenship could apply for permanent residence after the expiry of the prescribed time - limit . A legal void had thus formed and the principles of the rule of law , legal certainty and equality had been breached .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the provisions of LAW regulating the acquisition of permanent and temporary residence for aliens entering GPE ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) should not be used to regulate the status of citizens of the former LAW who had a reasonable expectation that the new conditions for retaining permanent residence in GPE would not be stricter than those set forth in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and that their status would be determined in accordance with international law .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further found that section DATE ) of LAW was not unconstitutional , because it applied only to aliens entering GPE after independence .", "CARDINAL . The legislature was given DATE in which to modify the unconstitutional provisions . In the meantime , ORG ruled that no citizen of the former SFRY who was registered as a permanent resident in GPE on DATE and was actually residing there could be forcibly removed from GPE pursuant to LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG also pointed out that the unregulated situation of citizens of the former SFRY republics who had found themselves in a precarious legal position could lead to a violation of , inter alia , the right to respect for family life , as protected by LAW ( extracts of this decision are quoted in paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence , the Act on Regularisation of the Legal Status of Citizens of Other Successor States to ORG in GPE ( Zakon o urejanju statusa dr\u017eavljanov drugih dr\u017eav naslednic nekdanje SFRJ v Republiki Sloveniji \u2013 \u201c LAW \u201d ) was passed on DATE to regulate the legal status of the \u201c erased \u201d by simplifying the requirements for acquiring a permanent residence permit .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , citizens of other successor GPE to the former SFRY who were registered as permanent residents on NORP territory on DATE , the date of the plebiscite , or on DATE , the date of independence , and had been actually resident there were entitled to a permanent residence permit , regardless of the provisions of LAW . They had DATE to submit an application . Section CARDINAL of the Legal Status Act provided for some exceptions for those with criminal convictions . Residence permits were granted ex nunc to those fulfilling the above conditions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Ruling on another constitutional challenge ( U - I-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , on CARDINAL DATE ORG set aside CARDINAL part of section CARDINAL of LAW as unconstitutional because it found that the requirements for the acquisition of permanent residence set forth therein were stricter than the grounds for revoking a permanent residence permit under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Relying on its leading decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , ORG has given several decisions in individual cases brought by some of the \u201c erased \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) it examined the case of a claimant who had been refused the renewal of his driving licence because of the \u201c erasure \u201d of his name from the ORG . ORG noted that following its decision of CARDINAL DATE , LAW had been drafted , but had not yet been passed . It decided that , until LAW entered into force , the claimant should enjoy the status he would have had before the expiry of the time - limit set forth in the second subsection of LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The administrative authorities were ordered to register the claimant as a permanent resident at the address where he had been living before his name was illegally deleted from the ORG and to renew his driving licence .", "CARDINAL . A similar decision ( ORG ) was adopted on DATE with regard to claimants who were all members of CARDINAL family and citizens of CARDINAL of the former SFRY republics , and had been denied permanent residence under LAW of LAW , because the father had lost his job .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and DATE ( ORG ) , in cases concerning the payment of a military pension to CARDINAL \u201c erased \u201d persons , ORG quashed the judgment of ORG and sent the case back for re - examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a case ( Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerning an individual \u2019s right to a childcare allowance , ORG quashed the decisions of the lower authorities and sent the case back for reexamination .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG has examined a number of cases brought by \u201c erased \u201d persons concerning the conditions for acquiring NORP citizenship . In a decision of DATE ( Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) it held that the condition of \u201c actually residing in GPE \u201d in section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and QUANTITY below ) could be fulfilled in a situation where a person \u2019s residence in GPE had been interrupted on justifiable grounds if there were other circumstances proving that the centre of his or her life interests was on NORP territory . It quashed ORG decision because there had been differential treatment of analogous cases and sent the case back for re - examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ruling on a challenge to the constitutionality of LAW in its version of DATE in a case ( ORG ) brought by ORG Erased \u201d and by other \u201c erased \u201d persons , ORG found LAW unconstitutional because it did not grant retrospective permanent residence from DATE of the \u201c erasure \u201d , it did not define the meaning of the words \u201c actually residing \u201d which appeared in section CARDINAL and it failed to regulate the acquisition of permanent residence for citizens of former ORG who had been forcibly removed from GPE pursuant to LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Although the exact number of those deported was unknown , ORG considered that the numbers would probably be low , since the unregulated status of the \u201c erased \u201d had generally been tolerated . It also struck down the DATE time - limit for submitting applications for permanent residence because it was unreasonably short and ordered the legislature to rectify the unconstitutional provisions of the impugned Act within DATE . ORG further observed that permanent residence was important in securing certain rights and benefits , such as military pension rights , social allowances and renewals of driving licences .", "CARDINAL . NORP In point no . CARDINAL of the operative part of the decision , ORG ordered the ORG to issue , ex proprio motu , decisions establishing permanent residence in GPE ex tunc with effect from DATE , the date of the \u201c erasure \u201d , to those who already had ex nunc ( non - retroactive ) permits in accordance with LAW or LAW ( extracts of this decision are quoted in paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG enacted the LAW on the Application of Point No . CARDINAL of ORG Decision no . CARDINAL ( Zakon o izvr\u0161itvi CARDINAL . to\u010dke odlo\u010dbe PERSON sodi\u0161\u010da PERSON \u0161t . U - I-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , also known as the \u201c LAW \u201d . This Act laid down the procedure for issuing ex tunc permanent residence permits to citizens of the former SFRY republics who had been registered as permanent residents in GPE on both DATE and CARDINAL DATE and who had already acquired a permanent residence permit under LAW or LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , a referendum on whether LAW should be implemented was held on DATE . The turnout was PERCENT ; PERCENT of valid votes were against its implementation , and therefore the LAW never entered into force .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in a decision ( U - II-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) handed down on DATE , ORG specified that the legal basis for the issuance of the supplementary residence permits by ORG was its decision of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) ; the Ministry was under an obligation to implement the decision .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in an individual case ( Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) brought by CARDINAL of the \u201c erased \u201d , claiming that his absence from GPE was due to the state of war , on DATE ORG set aside the judgments of ORG dismissing the claimant \u2019s request for a permanent residence permit under LAW , and remitted the case to ORG . It instructed the latter to make an appropriate assessment of the legal condition of \u201c actually residing on the territory of GPE \u201d from CARDINAL DATE and of the reasons for the claimant \u2019s absence from GPE .", "CARDINAL . In particular , ORG held that the fact that the legislature had been late in eliminating the inconsistencies did not prevent the courts from determining the case in conformity with its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG issued CARDINAL retroactive permits to the \u201c erased \u201d , solely on the basis of the above - mentioned ORG decision . The issuing of these permits by the authorities ex proprio motu was temporarily stayed and resumed in DATE , further to a change in government ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , CARDINAL applications had been submitted under LAW by DATE . As a result , CARDINAL permanent residence permits were issued .", "DATE . Following the parliamentary elections held on DATE , a new government was appointed in DATE . The regulation of the status of the \u201c erased \u201d in compliance with ORG decisions was established as CARDINAL of its priorities .", "CARDINAL . Further to an upgrading of the IT system , the Ministry collected new data on the \u201c erased \u201d and issued a report stating that on CARDINAL DATE the number of the people removed from the ORG amounted to CARDINAL , of whom CARDINAL had subsequently acquired NORP citizenship ; CARDINAL of them were still alive . A further CARDINAL had acquired a residence permit . CARDINAL \u201c erased \u201d persons did not have a regulated status in GPE on that date and their current residence was unknown .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG resumed the process of issuing , ex proprio motu , decisions establishing permanent residence in GPE ex tunc with effect from CARDINAL DATE under point no . CARDINAL of the operative part of ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to those who were already in possession of ex nunc permits . CARDINAL such decisions were issued .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG prepared amendments and supplements to LAW ( \u201c the amended LAW \u201d ) , regulating the incompatibilities between LAW and LAW , following ORG decision of DATE , in particular in respect of those who had been deported and those who had had to leave GPE because of other reasons related to the \u201c erasure \u201d . On DATE the amended LAW was passed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL parliamentarians requested that a referendum be held on the amended LAW , inter alia because it did not regulate the question of compensation for the \u201c erased \u201d ; as a result , its entry into force was postponed . On DATE ORG decided that the postponement of the entry into force of the amended LAW or its rejection in a referendum would have unconstitutional consequences and referred the matter to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE ( U - II-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG relied on its previous leading decisions and found that the provisions of the amended LAW were consistent with LAW . LAW was considered to provide for a permanent solution to the status of those \u201c erased \u201d persons who had been unable to regularise their status , including that of their children , and for the issuing of special retroactive decisions to those of them who had been granted NORP citizenship , without the requirement of having a prior permanent residence permit . ORG refused to allow a referendum to be held , considering that the potential rejection of the amended LAW would lead to unconstitutional consequences . It further found that the delay in implementing its leading decision of DATE had entailed a fresh violation of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . In paragraph CARDINAL of its decision ORG held that , by passing the LAW in question , which provided for the retroactivity of permanent residence status , the legislature had introduced moral satisfaction as a particular form of reparation for the \u201c erased \u201d . If damage was caused to individuals as a result of their \u201c erasure \u201d , the question of possible ORG liability could arise on the basis of LAW if other conditions provided for by that Article and the relevant statutory conditions were met . In any event , the amended LAW on its own did not entail a new type of ORG liability for damage or a new legal basis for enforcing claims for damages . It was legitimate for the legislature to pass specific legislation limiting the ORG \u2019s liability , as had been done , for instance , in respect of the victims of the Second World War . ORG held that the fact that the amended LAW did not address the question of financial reparation was not unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG publicly apologised to the \u201c erased \u201d ; the Minister for the ORG did the same on DATE .", "DATE . On DATE the amended LAW was published in ORG . It entered into force on DATE , DATE after the delivery of the ORG judgment . Prior to its enactment , CARDINAL requests for residence permits had been submitted , of which CARDINAL had been granted .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the amended LAW applied to aliens who had been citizens of other former LAW on DATE , had been registered as having their permanent residence in GPE on DATE or on DATE , and had actually resided there since then , regardless of the provisions of LAW . It provided for the acquisition of both ex nunc and ex tunc permanent residence permits by the \u201c erased \u201d . It also regulated the status of the children of the \u201c erased \u201d and provided for the issuing of retroactive decisions to those \u201c erased \u201d persons who had been granted NORP citizenship without having obtained a permanent residence permit .", "CARDINAL . In particular , section CARDINAL ( \u010d ) defined the meaning of the words \u201c actually residing \u201d in GPE , which was a precondition for obtaining permanent residence status , as a situation where the person had the centre of his or her life interests in GPE , this being determined on the basis of personal , family , economic , social and other ties demonstrating the existence of actual and permanent connections between the individual and GPE .", "CARDINAL . It further indicated that the condition of \u201c actually residing \u201d could be met in cases of justifiable absence for DATE ( forced removal from GPE , absence as a consequence of the \u201c erasure \u201d or impossibility of returning because of the state of war in other successor GPE of the SFRY ) . In the case of a longer absence , the condition of \u201c actually residing \u201d could be satisfied for the period of DATE and for a further DATE only if the person had tried to return to GPE \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the data submitted by the Government , from DATE to CARDINAL DATE the territorial administrative units received CARDINAL applications for ex nunc permanent residence permits and CARDINAL applications for supplementary , ex tunc permits . Including the permits issued by ORG , these applications resulted in the issuing of CARDINAL ex nunc permanent residence permits and CARDINAL ex tunc permanent residence permits , in some cases by the authorities ex proprio motu . Further proceedings were still pending . The deadline for submitting requests under the amended LAW expires on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an association , ORG of the \u201c Erased \u201d , together with CARDINAL other private individuals , lodged a petition with ORG for constitutional review of the amended LAW ( U - I-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The proceedings are currently pending .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , CARDINAL of the \u201c erased \u201d lodged a constitutional appeal challenging the rejection by ORG of his compensation claim , amounting to GPE euros ( ORG ) for loss of work and non - pecuniary damage . As far as pecuniary damage was concerned , ORG observed that the ORG authorities had not acted unlawfully and that LAW was therefore inapplicable . On DATE ( Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG rejected the constitutional appeal , upholding ORG view that , in spite of the decision of ORG subsequently abrogating the impugned provision of LAW , it could not be said that administrative authorities or courts had acted unlawfully at the material time . Furthermore , since the loss of work had been related to the refusal to grant NORP citizenship to the claimant and not to the refusal to grant a permanent residence permit , the leading decisions of ORG on the subject of the \u201c erasure \u201d could not be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government submitted some CARDINAL final judgments delivered by the courts of first and second instance and by ORG in compensation proceedings brought by the \u201c erased \u201d . All the compensation claims were in the end dismissed , mostly for failure to comply with the prescribed time - limits , although the courts had in some cases initially established that the compensation claims were well - founded . At that time , proceedings in CARDINAL cases brought by \u201c erased \u201d persons were pending before ORG . Finally , on DATE the ORG submitted a new decision delivered by ORG on DATE ( Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in a case brought by CARDINAL of the \u201c erased \u201d who had claimed compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .
