Being founded by and composed of persons who were not members of the former ORG , the ORG emphasises that none of the qualities with which the former ORG was credited , or the criticisms that party aroused , should be attributed to it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its political programme , adopted on DATE , the ORG stated that its aims were to defend workers ' interests and to adhere to the essence of communist doctrine , based on the following fundamental principles : non - exploitation of certain persons by others or by the ORG ; social justice based on labour and proper qualitative competition ; and genuine democracy capable of securing the rights of the majority through free elections in which all political tendencies should be allowed to take part . It deplored what it called the antisocial and anti - working - class direction in which NORP society had moved since the overthrow of the previous regime in DATE , and the country 's transformation into a \u201c colony of the NORP and global neo - colonialist empires \u201d . The programme also contained the following political ideas :", "\u201c The thesis underlying all policy and all doctrine is that the main advantage in politics is number . Those who are greatest in number are always right , irrespective of the way they think or act , and this is constantly being borne out , as , for example , on DATE when the anti - working - class , antisocial and antinational counter - revolution emerged victorious in several NORP countries .", "The starting - point of all workers ' action has been the desire to change what is evil ; in practice , only what is good has changed , and almost completely . What do we mean by good ? ... During DATE of socio - economic practice in the territory of former GPE [ ] , socialism achieved goals for the masses \u2013 despite the errors , excesses , failings and abuses on the part of the former ORG bourgeoisie DATE which workers can not abandon or forget : the highest material and spiritual living standards in history ; the highest level of culture and civilisation in history ... ; the broadest and most extensive democratic legal framework ...", "The ORG is a workers ' revolutionary political group that acts in an organised , conscious manner within the constitutional framework to eradicate the effects of the counter - revolution and to resume building the most humane and democratic society ever known \u2013 socialism . Regardless of its position in relation to the other political forces , [ that is , whether it is ] involved in the exercise of power and the administration of the ORG , the ORG will strive to attain such goals as may ensure the protection of the interests of the masses . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the Procurator - General of GPE informed the second applicant that he could see no reason to lodge an application ( recurs PERSON anulare ) to have the judgment of CARDINAL DATE quashed .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant lodged an application to set aside ( contesta\u0163ie \u00een anulare ) , which ORG dismissed as being out of time on DATE .", "CARDINAL . After DATE the second applicant continued to express his political opinions in the newspaper Pentru socialism ( \u201c For NORP \u201d ) , of which he was the editor . On DATE he published an article entitled \u201c The NORP manifesto \u201d , which proclaimed his attachment to communist doctrine and criticised both the direction taken by ORG leaders before DATE and the policy pursued by successive governments since then . A large number of articles which the second applicant published in the newspaper in DATE and DATE contained slogans such as \u201c Workers of all countries , unite ! \u201d , \u201c The struggle continues ! \u201d and \u201c Long live socialism ! \u201d . In CARDINAL article he stated that , once in power , he would \u201c accept only those who accept[ed him ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the second applicant published a book , The anti - socialist , anti - working - class and antinational counter - revolution , in which he replied to CARDINAL questions from a journalist .

He stated that , unlike the DATE communist regime , he was in favour of free , multi - party elections in which all the political forces could take part , except extremists and fascists , and voiced his support for a form of political competition based on respect for others and their political views . Among other things , he referred to the difficulties encountered since DATE in finding sufficient members to register the ORG and to the fact that the party was not well known in GPE , particularly among those for whom it was primarily intended , the peasants and workers .", "CARDINAL . Arguing that socialism had in the past been the subject of frequent \u201c attacks \u201d designed to destroy it , examples being the events in DATE in GPE , DATE in GPE and DATE and DATE in GPE , the second applicant stated in conclusion to his reply to a question from the journalist :", "\u201c As long as there are still capitalist , imperialist and religious brutes in the world , whose main aim is to enslave others , the conditions for further internal and external activities against socialism will continue to exist , ...

These attacks will not cease until the hideous and parasitic farmyard fowls , who commit crimes in all places and at all times , have been destroyed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He stated in the book that the political system would in time become structured according to social class , that the ORG sought to represent the interests of the peasants and workers , and that a democratic parliament should reflect the country 's social structure , with the CARDINAL classes in question holding the vast majority of seats according to their share of the population .", "CARDINAL . Arguing that capitalism encouraged theft , the second applicant stated in the book that the masses , who despised wealth , would move away from the DATE political parties and , over DATE , towards the ORG .", "CARDINAL . With regard to property , he stated that it was for the people to decide whether privatisation was beneficial and that \u201c the rich \u201d could enjoy possessions they had obtained by lawful means . As to the restitution of property that had passed into ORG ownership during the communist regime , the second applicant considered that property confiscated for political reasons should be returned , although entire buildings and factories should not , because the nationalisation measures carried out after DATE had been acts of social justice .", "CARDINAL .
