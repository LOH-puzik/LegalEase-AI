AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of P1-1;No violation of Art. 13", "JUDGES": "Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the owner of land in GPE ( GPE ) , registered under file No . CARDINAL of ORG ) . Before DATE it comprised , inter alia , parcel No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of QUANTITY marked as garden ( ORG ) and in the middle of it parcel No . CARDINAL of QUANTITY marked as building area ( Baufl\u00e4che ) . The borders of these parcels were recorded in the land tax register ( Grundsteuerkataster ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor of PERSON informed the applicant that a new border register ( PERSON ) for PERSON was under preparation and that on this occasion some parcels of land had to be united . As the applicant 's land was affected by this measure he was invited to give his consent on DATE at FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed ORG PERSON ) that he would not consent to a unification of any of the parcels belonging to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted a certificate ( PERSON ) to ORG , the competent ORG ( PERSON ) , in which it requested that the unification ( PERSON ) of the applicant 's parcels No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , be entered in the land register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended the land register as requested . It struck out parcel No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of the land register and united the respective piece of land with parcel No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . ORG found that ORG had issued the certificate of DATE under LAW of LAW ( Vermessungsgesetz ) . Under this provision , the consent of the owner of land to a unification of parcels was not necessary . ORG certificate fulfilled the requirements of LAW of LAW , namely that the parcels concerned had the same owner and that no different financial burdens were placed on them . The further criterion for a unification of parcels , namely that the unification was advisable for presenting in the map parcels which were put to the same use , could not be examined by ORG . In this respect they were bound by the findings of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a further appeal on points of law ( Revisionsrekurs ) with ORG . He submitted that the difference in treatment between owners of land which was registered in the border register and those whose land was registered in the land tax register was unconstitutional . There was no reason why unification of parcels only with regard to land registered in the border register was subject to the consent of its owner . Furthermore , the unification of his parcels violated his right to property in that it was impossible to divide them again and sell separately the former parcels No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL because the latter parcel would not meet the criterion of having a minimum surface necessary for creating a separate parcel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's further appeal on points of law . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE . ORG found that ORG had to amend the land register following a certificate of ORG if the land register did not disclose any elements which spoke against that measure . A certificate of ORG was therefore not a request to be examined by the courts but a formal statement about its official acts ( Amtshandlungen ) . In this respect ORG were bound by the certificate of the Surveyor 's Offices . Changes made by ORG must lead to corresponding entries in the land register .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that the difference in treatment between owners of land registered in the border register on the one hand and the land tax register on the other hand as regards the necessity of the owner 's consent to the unification of parcels of land was justified . As the border register relied on technically more advanced methods of surveying than the previous land tax register it was more reliable and merited a higher degree of protection . At present the land tax register had only a transitory function until border registers had been drawn up for all municipalities . ORG further noted that a later partition of the parcels which had been united might not be possible in view of their size . However , this effect could not constitute an interference with the applicant 's right to property because it was in accordance with the intentions of the legislator who wished to avoid the creation of parcels of land which were too small .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had filed an appeal with ORG , Measures and Surveying ( ORG f\u00fcr Eich- PERSON ) against ORG certificate ( PERSON ) and requested its annulment .", "CARDINAL . Since ORG did not decide on the appeal , the applicant , on DATE filed a request for transfer of jurisdiction to the superior authority ( PERSON ) with the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs ( PERSON f\u00fcr wirtschaftliche GPE ) . On CARDINAL DATE the Minister rejected the applicant 's request as he found that DATE time - limit within which a decision has to be taken had not yet expired .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also had filed , on DATE , a request for a declaratory decision with ORG . He argued that the certificate had been unlawful and requested the declaration that the conditions of LAW of LAW had not been met since he had not given his consent . The applicant submitted that he had promised his son to give him parcel No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Because of the unification of the parcels he could no longer keep this promise . Instead a partition map by a surveyor had to be drawn up which involved considerable expenses . Therefore he had a legal interest in the declaratory decision requested .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since ORG did not decide the applicant , on DATE , filed a request for transfer of jurisdiction with ORG , requesting it to issue the declaratory decision . Thereupon , on DATE , ORG granted the applicant 's request for transfer of jurisdiction but rejected the applicant 's request for a declaratory decision . The applicant filed an appeal with the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs .", "CARDINAL . At an unspecified date the applicant introduced a complaint with ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) against the Minister 's decision of CARDINAL DATE and the Minister 's inactivity in dealing with his appeal against ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided upon the applicant 's complaint . It quashed the Minister 's decision of CARDINAL DATE as in its view DATE time - limit had expired . As regards the appeal against ORG decision of DATE it decided in the place of the Minister and dismissed the applicant 's appeal as unfounded . In the present case the applicant 's consent to the unification of the parcels had not been necessary under LAW . A request for a declaratory decision could therefore not relate to this element .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant had also lodged a hierarchical complaint ( PERSON ) against ORG with the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister reacted to the applicant 's hierarchical complaint . He found that a certificate of ORG was an official document ( \u00f6ffentliche ORG ) and not a decision ( PERSON ) so that it could not be attacked by an administrative appeal ( PERSON ) . Furthermore , the unification of the applicant 's parcels No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL had been necessary for technical reasons in order to ensure a clear presentation of the borders of the applicant 's land and to avoid an unclear and fragmented presentation of parcels in the border register .", "CARDINAL . The Surveying Act of DATE , ORG . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( ORG , BGBl . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) regulates the surveying of land . According to LAW the borders of parcels of land have to be registered in a border register ( PERSON ) . This register is drawn up by ORG . In particular , ORG has to draw up maps for this purpose and to record the topographic marks ( PERSON ) for identifying the borders . The purpose of the border register is to indicate with binding force the borders of land and to indicate the various types of land , their use and scope as well as features intended to facilitate a clear presentation of the parcel of land . The border register is distinct from the land register , which has the purpose of recording the ownership over land . It will replace the former land tax register , which until its replacement continues to exist ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the LAW unification of parcels of land is subject to the following conditions : the parcels must be situated in the same land register district ( GPE ) and must be adjacent ; they must have the same owner and the same burdens ( Belastungen ) must encumber the parcels ; the unification of the parcels must be in the interest of expediency of the administration and no objections of surveying technique ( vermessungstechnische ORG ) must speak against it ( LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . ORG has to notify the unification upon request of the owner or ex - officio with the owner 's consent ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to land registered in the land tax register , Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Surveying Act provides that for the preparation of the border register , the Surveyor 's Office shall examine the size of parcels of land and the use to which they are put in land register districts or larger areas ( Riede ) . If in the course of such an examination it appears that the unification of parcels of land is advisable for the purpose of depicting in the map parcels which are put to the same use and if the conditions of LAW are met these parcels can be united . In such a case the consent of the owner is not required ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards parcels of land included in the land tax register , all single plots of land which belong to the same owner but are put to different use constitute different parcels . Newly created parcels of land included in the border register on the other hand are , as a rule , those parts of land belonging to a land register district which differ from the adjacent parts ( only ) in so far as they do not have the same owner and/or incumbrances . Parcels in the border register consist of CARDINAL or several use zones ( NORP ) according to the different use to which they are put . Which use zones belong to CARDINAL parcel can be seen from the cadastral map ( GPE ) and the register of parcels ( PERSON ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
