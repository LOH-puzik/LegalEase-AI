De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and GPE began living together in DATE . On DATE their daughter , GPE , was born . She was raised mainly by her maternal grandmother in GPE while both parents , whose relationship soon ended , left to work abroad .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE applied to ORG for her daughter to be officially registered as resident at her address . On DATE a summons was sent to the applicant at his registered address , informing him of GPE \u2019s action . According to the courier , the summons could not be served as the house was closed up and no one was living there . The summons was only sent once . On DATE the court of first instance , acting on the basis of LAW ( hereinafter , \u201c the ORG \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ordered information concerning the proceedings to be published in a DATE newspaper called TIME . On DATE the ORG granted GPE \u2019s application . The decision was taken in the absence of the applicant , whose whereabouts , according to the ruling , could not be established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , acting upon another application by GPE , ruled again by default that GPE could be issued with an international passport and leave the territory of GPE without her father \u2019s consent . No specific time - limit for that restriction of the applicant \u2019s parental rights was given in the ruling . The court again stated that the applicant \u2019s whereabouts were unknown and ordered the information about the proceedings to be published in TIME . Unlike the first set of default proceedings , the summons was sent twice to the applicant at the address he had registered at . It was again not delivered . The courier noted that the house was closed up .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the case file that the custody and guardianship authority , which represented the interests of the child in the above proceedings , made its own attempts to contact the applicant . In conclusions submitted to ORG , the authority noted that during its visit to the applicant \u2019s registered address it had learnt from neighbours that he had sold the house in DATE and left for GPE . Both default decisions were sent to the applicant \u2019s registered address and , as they could not be served , were consequently published in TIME according to the procedure provided for in LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , seeking to have both default decisions set aside . He stated that he had learnt about the decisions only in DATE . He also explained that he had not been living in GPE at the material time , which his former partner had well known . The default proceedings had been unfair as he had not been properly summoned to the hearings .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application . The court ruled , with reference to Articles QUANTITY and CARDINAL of the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , that the applicant had been duly informed about the proceedings via public notifications in a newspaper and that there was therefore no legal basis to set the impugned decisions aside . It noted that the applicant had been registered at the address where the summonses had been sent and that for the purposes of the proceedings the courts had been justified in using that very address .", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . It reasoned that the domestic courts had been right to send the summonses to the applicant \u2019s only available registered address . Furthermore , as it had not been possible to serve the summonses on the applicant , the procedure of delivering a summons via a public notification , as provided for in LAW , had been duly employed .", "CARDINAL . In his last communication with ORG on DATE , the applicant stated that he could still not have any contact with his daughter ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
