THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , born in GPE in DATE and , according to the most recent information contained in the file , living in the GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer attached to the \u2018 s - ORG Seekers ( PERSON ) based in GPE .", "The proceedings in question in the present case concern the applicant \u2019s application for recognition of his refugee status in the GPE .", "The following is a summary of the proceedings :", "The applicant entered the GPE on DATE on a valid NORP passport bearing his own name . A photocopy of the passport was made by the immigration authorities before it was handed back to the applicant . The applicant applied for recognition of his refugee status ( or in the alternative , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds ) DATE .", "According to the report of the interrogation referred to in the following paragraph , the passport contained a NORP visa .", "The applicant was interrogated ( nader gehoor ) by an official of ORG ( Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst ) of ORG on DATE . No lawyer or other assistant was present . The applicant spoke his own language , LANGUAGE , and was assisted by an interpreter .", "The applicant stated that the NORP visa had been arranged for him by an acquaintance called PERSON whose address he did not know . PERSON was an active member of the NORP organisation , which is illegal in GPE , but the applicant was unable to state particulars on PERSON \u2019s activities . ORG After arriving at FAC the applicant had given his passport to an assistant of the person who had arranged his journey for him . He had not had to pay for his journey ; PERSON had done that , apparently on the instructions of the Mujahedin .", "None of the applicant \u2019s relatives \u2013 parents , siblings \u2013 had ever been in trouble with the NORP authorities or with any organisations or groups in GPE . Neither had the applicant himself .", "The applicant claimed to be a member of the NORP but held no membership card . His activities in GPE had consisted of writing \u201c code - like slogans \u201d ( code - achtige leuzen ) on walls , on the instructions of one H. who was his contact with the party . He was unable to explain the meaning of these code - like slogans .", "In addition , he had taken part in a demonstration in the town of PERSON on DATE aimed at obtaining provincial autonomy for that locality . This demonstration , in which CARDINAL persons had participated , had been indirectly organised by the Mujahedin . It had resulted in the wrecking of a public building . The demonstration had been video taped . On DATE the applicant \u2019s contact PERSON had failed to turn up for an appointment and on DATE the applicant had gone into hiding .", "The applicant had been warned by PERSON on DATE that H. had been arrested and that his ( the applicant \u2019s ) life would be in danger if PERSON mentioned him to the authorities .", "The applicant had been able to leave GPE on his own passport because PERSON had contacts who could influence the passport officials via the Mujahedin organisation . PERSON himself had come to GPE airport to see the applicant off .", "The applicant stated that he had nothing further on which to base his request for recognition of his refugee status . He feared that , if returned to GPE , he would be imprisoned and made to tell the authorities everything he knew about the GPE , after which he would be executed .", "The Mujahedin are an organisation outlawed in GPE . It follows a NORP ideology and is opposed to the present NORP government .", "On DATE the Deputy Minister of ORG gave a decision refusing the applicant \u2019s applications . Firstly , he did not consider it credible that the applicant had ever been involved in the activities of the NORP , given that he had never held a party card and was unable to explain the code - like slogans which he had allegedly written on walls . The applicant \u2019s participation in the demonstration in PERSON on DATE was in itself not decisive , in view , especially , of the large number of participants and the fact that the applicant was not among its leaders . Secondly , the applicant had been able to return to his home and remain there in perfect safety at least until DATE ; if the NORP authorities had wanted to prosecute him they would presumably have arrested him immediately . Thirdly , the applicant had left GPE travelling under his own name and on a valid passport which was checked by the authorities at his departure . In view of these circumstances the applicant \u2019s application for recognition of his refugee status was manifestly ill - founded . Finally , no cogent reasons of a humanitarian nature to grant the applicant a residence permit had been suggested , nor were any such reasons apparent .", "The applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) to the Deputy Minister against this decision . In so far as it was directed against the refusal of recognition of his refugee status , against which no objection was possible , the applicant \u2019s objection was transmitted to ORG of The Hague to be dealt with on the basis that it constituted an appeal .", "The applicant also applied directly to the President of ORG of GPE for an interim measure consisting of a decision preventing his expulsion pending the further proceedings .", "A single - judge chamber of ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , dealt with all CARDINAL of the remedies instituted by the applicant \u2013 the objection against the refusal of a residence permit , the appeal against the refusal of recognition of his refugee status , and the application for an interim measure \u2013 together . A hearing was held on DATE . The applicant had not been expelled in the meanwhile .", "ORG gave a decision on DATE . It held that the applicant \u2019s story was not credible , and in so far as it was true , insufficient in any case to grant him recognition of his refugee status . The applicant was not able to provide any information at all about the Mujahedin DATE an organisation which , in any event , was active mostly outside GPE DATE , he had never even seen a party card and could not state whether other members had such a card or not , and he was unaware of the meaning of the slogans he had allegedly written on walls ; on these grounds it was held unlikely that he had been a member of that organisation . Moreover , the slogans were allegedly intelligible only for a select group , and the applicant had never been arrested in connection with his activities . That H. might betray the applicant was no more than a supposition and had not been substantiated . In so far as the applicant \u2019s fears were based on his participation in the demonstration in PERSON , it was noted that the applicant had not been able to substantiate his allegation that the authorities were aware of it , and he had moreover not found it necessary to flee until DATE . He had , moreover , been able to remain at his own home all that time . The objection , the appeal and the application for an interim measure were therefore all dismissed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
