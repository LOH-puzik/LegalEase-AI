In DATE the applicant was dismissed , with CARDINAL months\u2019 notice , from his post as tax inspector , and immediately suspended from office . He was deemed unable to perform his duties adequately and found to have continuously failed to comply with , or to have neglected , his obligations as a civil servant . His appeals were rejected , in the last resort by ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG ( ty\u00f6tt\u00f6myyskassa , arbetsl\u00f6shetskassan ) for ORG refused to pay the applicant a salary - related unemployment benefit for DATE . ORG had regard to an opinion from ORG ( ty\u00f6voimatoimikunta , arbetskrafts - kommissionen ) of GPE which concluded that the applicant had himself caused his dismissal . Under domestic law ORG was bound by ORG opinion . The applicant had received a copy thereof in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( ty\u00f6tt\u00f6myysturvalautakunta , arbetsl\u00f6shetsn\u00e4mnden ) , essentially contesting ORG opinion , as adhered to by ORG in an unsigned computer - printed decision . The appeal was first processed by ORG which requested ORG to comment on it . Having received ORG opinion , ORG forwarded it to ORG together with the appeal itself and ORG own opinion .", "CARDINAL . ORG opinion referred to ORG decision upholding the applicant \u2019s dismissal . The opinion further stated that no such evidence had been presented which would have warranted a change of ORG earlier opinion . ORG opinion referred to the earlier stages of the proceedings and noted that unemployment funds were authorised to dispatch electronically signed decisions . The opinion further stated that no evidence had been presented which could be considered by ORG and that , accordingly , its decision should stand .", "CARDINAL . None of the above opinions were communicated to the applicant in the proceedings before ORG . In its decision of DATE the ORG summarised the facts , the applicant \u2019s appeal and the opinions of ORG and ORG . ORG then dismissed the appeal , considering that a person who had himself caused the termination of his employment was not entitled to unemployment benefits for DATE . As the applicant \u2019s suspension from office had resulted in his dismissal , he was deemed to have caused the termination of his employment himself . He was therefore not entitled to unemployment benefits for the period in question . ORG relied on section CARDINAL of the LAW ( ty\u00f6tt\u00f6myysturvalaki , lagen om utkomstskydd f\u00f6r arbetsl\u00f6sa CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed further to ORG ( vakuutusoikeus , f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ) . In an opinion requested by ORG considered that no such evidence had been presented which it had been unaware of when making its decision of DATE . Accordingly , that decision should be upheld . ORG opinion was not communicated to the applicant in the course of the proceedings . ORG also obtained from ORG its decision regarding the applicant \u2019s dismissal .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG , referring to the reasons stated therein .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the LAW stipulates that a person who causes the termination of his or her employment shall not be entitled to an unemployment benefit for DATE . According to established practice , the period is shortened to DATE in certain circumstances . If a dismissal has been challenged the withdrawal of unemployment benefits should normally be based on a decision which has acquired legal force ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . The competent employment commission shall issue an opinion in respect of someone \u2019s entitlement to unemployment benefits . Such an opinion is binding on the competent unemployment fund ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , and section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , an appellant shall be given an opportunity to be heard in a matter before ORG or ORG , if such new evidence is presented of which the appellant is not aware .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time ORG applied mainly the principles derived from the rules of procedure of the courts of appeal . Insofar as relevant , LAW provided as follows . According to LAW , sections CARDINAL , the opposing party was to be heard in proceedings before appellate courts . According to LAW , section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , a copy of the observations of the opposing party was to be forwarded to the appellant on request . According to LAW , section CARDINAL , the court of appeal was to request written observations from the parties when it obtained evidence on its own initiative and such evidence could affect the decision in the case , unless such hearing of the parties was manifestly unnecessary .", "CARDINAL . From DATE onwards ORG has been applying LAW ( hallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen ORG ) except with regard to extraordinary proceedings , in respect of which special rules apply ( section CARDINAL of the Act on ORG , as amended by Act no .
