The applicant was born in DATE and is currently serving a prison sentence in ORG .", "CARDINAL . From DATE onwards the applicant has been suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia .

On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant , who , on DATE , was arrested and charged with CARDINAL count of voluntary homicide , inter alia , of children and CARDINAL count of illegal possession of explosives . The applicant was placed in the pre - trial detention facility of ORG , where he shared a cell with an unspecified number of prisoners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of a medical report which concluded that at the time of the commission of the offence the applicant \u2019s mental disorder was in a period of remission , ORG ruled that the applicant was able to stand trial . Subsequently , the court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel lodged an appeal with ORG , claiming that the proceedings had been unfair since the PERSON report had been biased and unsubstantiated . He asked the court to order a new medical report in order to establish his state of health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , ORG and ORG upheld ORG decision . Moreover , the domestic courts dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a fresh medical examination . They held that the first medical assessment had been performed by impartial professionals and had complied with procedural safeguards .", "CARDINAL .

He has shared cells with other inmates who were in good health and has received the same treatment as them , notwithstanding his state of health . He has also regularly visited ORG hospital , where he has been treated as an in - patient .", "CARDINAL . Given the applicant \u2019s increasingly disturbed state of mind , on DATE his counsel initiated proceedings before ORG seeking his release or transfer to a medical facility on the ground that his detention conditions were inappropriate to his state of health and put his life at risk . The applicant \u2019s counsel requested the court to order that the applicant be examined by psychiatric experts . The request was based on medical reports issued by practitioners who had treated the applicant in the period from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the request as unsubstantiated since the medical reports submitted by the applicant \u2019s counsel failed to prove that the conditions of his detention posed any threat to his life or state of health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG respectively upheld ORG decision . According to the applicant , ORG decision was not served on him until DATE .", "CARDINAL .

A delegation of the ORG visited GPE from DATE . The relevant parts of the ORG \u2019s report of DATE read as follows ( emphasis added by the ORG ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the report on the DATE visit , the ORG emphasised that , in several of the pre - trial detention facilities visited ( in particular , at GPE ) , detained persons were being held in conditions of detention which could easily be considered as inhuman or degrading . Indeed , the accumulation of execrable material conditions , the legal prohibition of any activity inside the cell , the almost total absence of activities outside the cell , and the prolonged duration of placements in the facilities concerned was described by ORG as \u2018 being , in its experience , unique in a NORP context\u2019 .", "It is a matter of grave concern that from the observations made at GPE during DATE visit , the situation has clearly remained virtually unchanged . It must be added that the situation found at ORG was scarcely more favourable .", "During the high - level consultations with the NORP authorities , the delegation \u2019s view was also shared by the Prime Minister who stated that the conditions of detention in pre - trial detention facilities were \u2018 a shame for Albania\u2019 .", "Already at this stage , the ORG must also express its serious concern about the absence of care for a severely ill detainee who was found in his cell in the pre - trial detention facilities at ORG . He had been left in a catatonic state on the floor of his cell for DATE , without receiving any medical attention .", "These issues will be addressed in detail in the following section of the present report , but the seriousness justifies them already being flagged in this section on ill - treatment .", "...", "CARDINAL . The DATE visit demonstrated that not a single of the specific recommendations repeatedly made in this respect by the ORG in previous visit reports had been implemented in practice , despite the explicit assurances given to the contrary by the NORP authorities in their response to the report on the DATE visit . In particular , in neither establishment visited were newly - arrived detainees subject to medical screening on admission ( except in cases of emergency or upon request ) . Further , medical examinations / consultations when they did occur were still systematically carried out in the presence of police officers . It should be added that in those few cases when medical files had been opened , they lacked basic medical data and were usually accessible to non - medical staff . Such a state of affairs is totally unacceptable .", "CARDINAL . Further , no improvements had been made as regards the general provision of health care in either establishment visited , notwithstanding various recommendations made by the ORG in the reports on DATE visits . More specifically , no steps had been taken to ensure the regular presence of qualified nursing staff ( on a full - time basis at GPE ) . It is particularly worrying that the NORP authorities , in their response of DATE to the report on the DATE visit , totally failed to address the recommendations made by ORG on this subject .", "CARDINAL . The health care provided in the pre - trial detention facilities at ORG appeared to be particularly problematic and , in a number of cases , even inexistent . In addition , conditions in the health - care facilities were appalling . The delegation received many complaints from inmates about delays in having access to the doctor and the quality of the health care provided ; the delegation observed itself , on the spot , the case of CARDINAL inmate in need of urgent medical care who had been left in a state of total neglect .", "As already mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL , a mentally ill detainee was found lying in a catatonic state on the floor of an overcrowded cell , below a leaking sewage pipe , without receiving any medical attention . He had apparently been in this situation for DATE . A physical examination by the medical member of the delegation also revealed that his right leg was of intensive red colour and swollen , painful on palpation . According to fellow inmates , he had sustained the latter injury DATE when he had fallen on the floor in the sanitary facilities ( to which he had to be carried by other inmates ) .", "Upon consultation with staff and cellmates , it transpired that the detainee had been hospitalised , due to his serious mental disorder , and returned to the establishment DATE before the visit . His health condition was said to have been stable for DATE on his return , but to have drastically deteriorated subsequently , apparently due to the fact that he had not received the medication prescribed by the hospital .", "When confronted with this case , the doctor claimed that he had seen the inmate concerned , but was not able to provide any precise information about his health condition or the treatment provided .", "When asked about the whereabouts of the medical file of the above - mentioned detainee as well as of other detainees , the doctor affirmed that such files existed in respect of every inmate , but claimed that he had no key to the cupboard where the files were said to be stored . After a considerable delay , a key was produced by a police officer , and it came to light that there was not a single personal medical file .", "The only medical documentation available was a register for ORG visits , the last entry dating back to DATE . The doctor \u2019s explanation for this state of affairs was that \u2018 he had not recorded anything , because he had not received any medication to prescribe ever since\u2019 . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . A previous visit by a ORG delegation to GPE took place from CARDINAL May to DATE . The delegation inspected , inter alia , ORG . The relevant parts of the ORG \u2019s report of DATE read as follows ( emphasis added by the ORG ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Material conditions of detention were appalling in all the pre - trial detention facilities visited . Many detainees were being held in very cramped conditions ( for example , CARDINAL persons in a cell of CARDINAL m\u00b2 at PERSON or CARDINAL persons in a cell of CARDINAL m\u00b2 at Durr\u00ebs ) . Cells were only equipped with foam mattresses and/or blankets . In addition , access to natural light was very limited and ventilation extremely poor .", "The worst conditions were found at GPE , where inmates were not even provided with mattresses or bed sheets . Further , some inmates were being accommodated in CARDINAL storage rooms , which were packed with food parcels of the entire inmate population . Some inmates were found to be in a state of torpidity , and the delegation was informed that , on occasion , inmates had even fainted , as a result of extremely high temperatures and a very high level of humidity . Further , hygienic conditions in most of the cells as well as in the sanitary facilities were appalling ( infested with cockroaches , etc . ) . Not surprisingly , many inmates were suffering from skin diseases and/or breathing problems . It must also be stressed that some of the inmates met by the delegation had already been held in this establishment for DATE . ...", "CARDINAL . During the follow - up visit to the prison hospital in GPE , the delegation mainly focused on the situation of psychiatric patients . It also reviewed the measures taken by the NORP authorities in the light of the recommendations made after the DATE visit regarding the prison hospital as a whole . ...", "CARDINAL . Material conditions in the prison hospital had significantly improved since the DATE visit . All cells were of a reasonable size , had good access to natural light and artificial lighting , and were well equipped ( bed , bedside table , table , chair , radio ) . However , the sanitary facilities were found to be in a very poor state of repair and hygiene . The ORG recommends that steps be taken to remedy these deficiencies .", "Further , many complaints were received from patients about the poor quality and quantity of the food provided . Steps should be taken to review the arrangements for the provision of food at the prison hospital .", "CARDINAL . The ORG remains very concerned about the almost total lack of out - of - cell activities for patients at the prison hospital .", "As regards patients who had been declared criminally irresponsible , no out - of - cell activities were organised for them , and outdoor exercise was only provided on an irregular , less than DATE , basis , and for TIME each time . It is all the more worrying that many of the patients concerned had been staying at the prison hospital under such conditions for DATE .", "Further , no outdoor exercise at all , nor any other out - of - cell activities were offered to any of the other patients . Thus , except for access to sanitary facilities , patients were usually confined to their rooms TIME per day , the only occupation being reading and listening to the radio . The hospital also had no library .", "Such a state of affairs is totally unacceptable and constitutes a flagrant failure on the part of the NORP authorities to implement a recommendation which had already been made after the DATE visit and reiterated after the subsequent visits to the prison hospital .", "The ORG calls upon the NORP authorities to take immediate steps to ensure that all patients whose state of health permits are offered TIME of outdoor exercise per day .", "Further , the ORG reiterates its recommendation that a wider range of activities be offered to long - term patients in the prison hospital and that special attention be paid to juveniles serving long - term sentences .", "CARDINAL . The ORG welcomes the recent reinforcement of health - care staff ( CARDINAL additional doctors and CARDINAL psychologist ) at the prison hospital . The delegation was informed that plans were afoot to increase the number of nursing staff . The ORG would like to receive updated information on this matter .", "CARDINAL . As regards the treatment provided to patients , the situation remained , on the whole , unchanged . As in DATE , psychiatric treatment was based exclusively on pharmacotherapy . There were no individualised treatment plans or individual psychotherapy , occupational therapy or group therapy . In this respect , the ORG wishes to stress once again that psychiatric treatment should be based on an individualised approach , which implies the drawing up of a treatment plan for each patient indicating the goals of treatment , the therapeutic means used and the staff member responsible . The treatment plan should also contain the outcome of a regular review of the patient \u2019s mental health condition and a review of the patient \u2019s medication . The treatment should involve a wide range of rehabilitative and therapeutic activities , including access to occupational therapy , group therapy , individual psychotherapy , and sports . In addition , patients should have regular access to suitably equipped leisure rooms ; it is also desirable for them to be offered education and suitable work ( cf . also paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG reiterates its recommendation that the psychiatric treatment offered to patients at the prison hospital be reviewed , in the light of the above remarks .", "CARDINAL . As regards contact with the outside world , it is praiseworthy that patients now have regular access to a telephone ( once per week ) . As regards visits , the entitlements of patients were identical to those of inmates held in prisons . In this connection , reference is made to the remarks and recommendation made in paragraph CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted that , since DATE , agitated patients were no longer shackled to their bed with hand- and ankle - cuffs . Further , no excessive recourse to means of restraint ( leather straps ; sedative medication ) or seclusion was observed . However , there was no special register on the use of means of restraint / seclusion . Steps should be taken to remedy this shortcoming .", "CARDINAL . The confidentiality of medical examinations / consultations and data was not respected at all at the prison hospital . In this connection , reference is made to the remarks and recommendations made in paragraph CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Persons who had been declared criminally irresponsible were subject to an involuntary placement order for an indefinite period . In such cases , [ LAW ] provides that the necessity of that placement be reviewed by the court ex officio after DATE . However , the delegation was informed that such judicial reviews had never been carried out ex officio , but only upon request by the person concerned or his lawyer .", "The ORG calls upon the NORP authorities to take immediate steps to ensure that the review procedure under [ LAW ] is carried out in respect of all persons who have been declared criminally irresponsible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Amnesty International Annual Report DATE stated , with reference to the state of human rights in NORP prisons :", "\u201c Conditions of detention", "Despite an ORG - supported programme of prison reform and some improvements to detention conditions , these were still generally very poor and characterized by overcrowding , poor hygiene and sanitation , and inadequate diet and health care . Contrary to NORP law and international standards , minors were still sometimes held together with adult detainees , and remand and convicted prisoners shared cells . Mentally ill prisoners were often held in prisons instead of being sent for medical treatment in specialized institutions in accordance with court decisions . Detainees held in remand cells in police stations suffered particularly harsh conditions , and there were frequent complaints . Conditions were particularly poor , largely due to overcrowding , in GPE , PERSON and PERSON police stations . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
