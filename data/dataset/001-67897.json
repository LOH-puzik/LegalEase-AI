Despite ORG decision of DATE the applicant was only released on DATE owing to a misunderstanding concerning the different cases pending against him .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant \u2019s initial detention order of CARDINAL DATE carried that reference . When later another file , no .

In his appeal to ORG of DATE the applicant had referred to file number CARDINAL , which also figured in the ORG decision of DATE ordering his release .", "CARDINAL . That decision was transmitted to the prison administration on DATE .

After several hearings , on DATE the ORG reserved judgment .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims on grounds that the period of his pre - trial detention had been deducted from the term of imprisonment to which he had been sentenced and that no compensation for non - pecuniary damage was due in such circumstances . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG partly upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment , quashed it for the remainder and decided on the merits .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the fact that the applicant \u2019s request for release filed on DATE had not been examined until DATE was in violation of domestic law . Nevertheless , the court considered that it was not possible to speculate whether or not his release would have been ordered had his application been examined before DATE . For these reasons , the court upheld ORG judgment dismissing the applicant \u2019s claims for the period DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG found , however , that from DATE until the applicant \u2019s release on DATE his detention had not been based on any legal ground . The court did not accept the reasoning of ORG as regards the deduction of the time spent by the applicant in detention , since that deduction had been made from a suspended sentence and , therefore , the applicant had not benefited from a shorter stay in prison . On that basis ORG ordered ORG , the body in charge of supervising the enforcement of pre - trial detention orders , to pay to the applicant MONEY ( \u201c BGN \u201d ) in non - pecuniary damages for his unlawful detention DATE and DATE . Since the applicant \u2019s claim had been for BGN CARDINAL and he owed court fees in an amount proportionate to the dismissed part of his claims , the applicant was ordered to pay BGN CARDINAL in court fees . The applicant was thus eventually entitled to BGN CARDINAL in compensation ( the equivalent of about EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a cassation appeal with ORG . As of DATE the proceedings were pending .", "CARDINAL .

On the other hand , the Government have not informed the ORG of any successful claim under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW in respect of unlawful pretrial detention orders in connection with pending criminal proceedings or proceedings which have ended with final convictions . It appears that rulings putting an end to pretrial detention in pending criminal proceedings have never been considered as decisions to \u201c set aside for lack of lawful grounds \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW .

In contrast with the solution adopted under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG has held that no liability arises under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) where the criminal proceedings were discontinued at the pre - trial stage on the ground that the accusation was not proven ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. \u043e\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e PERSON \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u041a\u0421 GPE \u0433.\u043e. ) .", "CARDINAL .
