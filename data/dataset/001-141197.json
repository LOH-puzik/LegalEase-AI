The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is the founder of the NORP TV station ORG and director of the management board of its operating company ORG PERSON CARDINAL \u2019s programme contents are broadcast nationwide in GPE and in GPE through the TV station ORG . The latter is operated by private limited - liability companies established under NORP law and , since DATE , by LAW ORG ( GPE beschr\u00e4nkter PERSON ) with the applicant as CARDINAL of its shareholders . The applicant alternately occupied the position of managing director ( Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer ) or authorised signatory ( NORP ) in such companies .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE a specific programme slot in the channel \u2019s broadcasting schedule had been allocated to the non - profit association Deniz PERSON , founded , inter alia , by the Kanal CARDINAL head of human resources who was also a member of the association \u2019s board of directors . During that programme , broadcast in GPE and in GPE , the association reported on charitable aid projects being run by it and appealed for monetary donations . In DATE a similar association was founded in GPE under the name of PERSON . PERSON ( hereinafter \u201c LOC \u201d ) by PERSON , CARDINAL of the other shareholders and managing directors or , alternately , authorised signatories of LAW Fernseh- und Marketing GmbH. PERSON was also appointed chairman of the association and remained in that position until DATE . In its donation appeals on television PERSON stressed that the funds donated would be used directly and exclusively for charitable purposes and for the funding of social projects .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE am GPE prosecution authorities ( ORG ) launched investigations against the applicant and several co - suspects , including PERSON , on suspicion of having fraudulently used the majority of funds donated to the associations for commercial purposes and their own benefit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the preliminary criminal proceedings against the applicant were separated from the investigations against the co - suspects .", "CARDINAL . In DATE criminal investigations based on the same allegations of fraud were also initiated against the applicant in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment , the operative part of which together with a summary of its reasoning was pronounced orally on DATE ( file no . CARDINAL PERSON TIME CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG ( ORG ) of the GPE am ORG convicted CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - suspects , PERSON and PERSON , of aggravated fraud ( FAC in einem besonders schweren Fall ) acting as members of a joint criminal enterprise with its leaders in GPE . Another co - accused , PERSON , was convicted of having aided and abetted the commission of the offence . PERSON and NORP were sentenced to prison sentences of DATE and DATE and DATE and DATE respectively , while PERSON was given a suspended prison sentence of DATE and DATE . The full judgment , with the complete reasoning , was subsequently delivered in writing DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG found it to be established that PERSON had created and maintained a complex structure for the purpose of concealing the fact that the majority of the donations obtained for charitable purposes as advertised by PERSON were in reality earmarked and used to finance the entrepreneurial activities of private companies in which PERSON and the applicant , among others , became shareholders . At PERSON \u2019s request , T. had contributed to the fraudulent misrepresentation by , inter alia , fabricating CARDINAL of virtual association meetings of Deniz Feneri in order to conceal the unauthorised use of donated funds from the tax authorities . PERSON , for his part , also acting upon instructions from PERSON , had omitted to record the actual use of the donations in the association \u2019s official accounts and had documented them in separate unofficial accounts ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The court \u2019s findings were primarily based on confessions made by ORG , PERSON and PERSON following a plea bargain reached between the court , the prosecution authorities and the defence and also on further evidence obtained in the course of the trial . PERSON maintained that he alone had decided how the donated funds would be used without having consulted any contact persons in GPE , GPE and PERSON testified that PERSON had been integrated into the hierarchy of a criminal organisation whose leaders were in GPE and in which the applicant had played a leading role . According to T. and PERSON \u2019s testimony , PERSON had to obtain the applicant \u2019s prior approval with respect to all essential decisions relating to the use of donations obtained by the association . The court was therefore satisifed that PERSON had not been at the top of the criminal organisation \u2019s hierarchy but had received orders from its leaders residing in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The judgment \u2019s reasoning is divided into CARDINAL parts headed by ORG numerals . Part I provides information on the personal background of the accused . Part II contains a description of the circumstances of the case . Part III sets out the type of evidence on which ORG based its establishment of the facts and the court \u2019s assessment of the veracity and credibility of the relevant evidence . Parts PERSON and V contain the legal assessment of the offences committed by the accused and the determination of their relative guilt and the resulting sentence . Part VI stipulates that the accused are to bear the costs of the proceedings . The judgment refers on several occasions to the role that the heads of the criminal organisation in GPE played in connection with the use of donated funds for non - charitable purposes . In that context the applicant \u2019s full first and last names are mentioned numerous times in the judgment running to some thirtytwo pages . The most relevant passages of the judgment in parts II to V of its reasoning read as follows :", "...", "It was neither the association \u2019s chairman nor the registered members of the association [ Deniz Feneri ] who decided on the use of funds obtained on behalf of the association but the accused PERSON in coordination with and upon the instructions of the separately prosecuted ( gesondert Verfolgte ) PERSON , ... , ... and ... , ... ( pp . CARDINAL to CARDINAL )", "...", "The accused PERSON and the persons in charge of FAC in GPE were ... aware that donations collected in the NORP association \u2019s [ Deniz Feneri ] name would only partly be used for charitable purposes or social projects . At any rate , since DATE it had been the intention of PERSON and the separately prosecuted persons behind the scenes ( PERSON ) to also use a large part of the collected funds for economic activities , in particular for the start - up financing of entrepreneurial projects of private - law companies in which PERSON or the separately prosecuted PERSON , ... , ... and ... became shareholders . ( pp . CARDINAL )", "...", "For this reason , the accused PERSON and the separately prosecuted PERSON instructed the co - accused PERSON to keep unofficial accounts ( PERSON ) . ( p. CARDINAL )", "...", "DATE the contents of the unofficial accounts in GPE were coordinated between PERSON and ... , ... or PERSON . ( p. CARDINAL )", "...", "According to the entries in the unofficial accounts a total amount of QUANTITY was handed over to the separately prosecuted Zekeriya PERSON . ( p. CARDINAL )", "...", "The separately prosecuted Zekeriya PERSON , ... , ... , ... and ... decided on the use of the funds collected by means of donations . In his capacity as director of the management board of ORG , PERSON was accorded a pre - eminent role in this respect . ( p. CARDINAL )", "...", "The accused ORG was not aware of the exact amount of donated funds that had been used for non - charitable purposes . However he endorsed appeals for further donations while knowing that they were to a large extent going to be used for unauthorised purposes ... Following PERSON \u2019s arrest in DATE he was the contact person of PERSON with respect to all matters related to PERSON in GPE . The latter provided him with a mobile phone and a prepaid card in view of suspected telephone surveillance . ( p. CARDINAL )", "...", "ORG ) have been established ( steht fest ) on the basis of the confessions made by the accused and further evidence obtained in the course of the trial as set out in the record of the hearing . ( p. CARDINAL ) .", "...", "The ORG did not follow PERSON \u2019s submissions that he alone had decided on the unauthorised use of donated funds without consulting the persons behind the scenes in GPE . The accused PERSON and the accused ORG had stated in the course of their confessions during trial and during previous police questioning that PERSON had been integrated into a hierarchy and had to coordinate all essential decisions with the separately prosecuted PERSON , ... and ... , while PERSON , in his capacity as director of the management board of PERSON , played a pre - eminent role . ( p. CARDINAL )", "Such integration into a structure controlled from GPE , as described by the QUANTITY coaccused , is sufficiently proved by the implementation of an unofficial accounting system , a parallel structure to the television station and the association PERSON in GPE and GPE for the collection of donations , the shareholding in the companies funded by donations , and the fact that cash withdrawals had been handed over at the LOC of FAC in GPE . By assuming sole responsibility for the donation appeals and the unauthorised use of the donated funds , the accused PERSON apparently tried to protect the persons behind him in GPE from criminal prosecution in GPE and/or GPE . ( p. CARDINAL )", "...", "...", "The accused ORG is guilty of fraud committed in his capacity as successive joint offender ( in sukzessiver PERSON ) pursuant to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . Not only did ORG want to support the actions of others but he also wanted to participate in a joint operation ( gemeinschaftliche ORG ) together with PERSON and the persons behind the scenes in GPE . ( p. CARDINAL )", "...", "...", "Furthermore , it had to be considered in [ PERSON \u2019s ] favour that he was not positioned at the top of the hierarchy which organised the fraud ( ORG ) but received instructions from the persons behind the scenes in GPE . He could not decide alone on the unauthorised use of the donated funds but only develop ideas that ultimately had to be approved by the persons behind the scenes in GPE . He was an executing organ rather than a decision maker ( mehr ausf\u00fchrendes als bestimmendes Organ ) . ( p. CARDINAL )", "...", "[ T. \u2019s ] confession was not limited to his own participation in the commission of the offence . He also revealed his knowledge regarding the background and in particular concerning the persons behind the scenes . His knowledge was limited since PERSON and the persons behind him deliberately granted him only a restricted insight . In the hierarchy he was placed far below PERSON and the responsible persons in GPE . ( p. CARDINAL )", "...", "By keeping unofficial accounts [ E. ] made a significant contribution to the functioning of the overall system . The fact that he was not only requested by PERSON but also directly by the separately prosecuted PERSON to keep off the recorded accounts demonstrates the importance of such unofficial accounting . ( p. CARDINAL )", "...", "The persons behind the scenes in GPE had previously attempted to prevent [ E. ] from testifying before the investigative authorities by establishing contact with his first counsel and members of his family . \u201d ( p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . According to an article published by the NORP newspaper PERSON on the Internet on DATE , the Acting President of the GPE am ORG had stated , when delivering the judgment , that the donated funds had been used by the persons behind the scenes for a mixture of their own economic and political purposes even though part of the money had indeed been spent on aid projects . The same newspaper had reported in an article published on the Internet on DATE that the prosecution authorities ( ORG ) had referred to the applicant as the \u201c main perpetrator and leader ( f\u00fchrender PERSON ) of the whole organisation \u201d . Similar quotations were published in several NORP newspapers on CARDINAL and DATE . For instance , according to an article published in the NORP newspaper PERSON on DATE , the presiding judge had declared when delivering the judgment , that \u201c strings were pulled at the level of FAC . PERSON and NORP acted in accordance with instructions they had received from ORG , in particular from PERSON , ... , ... and ... The main persons in charge were located in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judgment was published on ORG website on DATE . In the judgment \u2019s Internet version the names of the accused and separately prosecuted were replaced by letters and the names of the companies involved by numbers . The introductory comments to the Internet publication included a paragraph stating that the judgment had become final and was binding only on the CARDINAL convicted persons . It was specified that references and findings in the judgment with respect to the actions of other persons , in particular those separately prosecuted , were not binding in relation to those persons and that the latter still benefited from the presumption of innocence . The text of the judgment itself does not contain a similar specification .", "CARDINAL . The judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By written submissions dated DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . He argued that the references in the reasoning of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE to his role in the fraudulent use of the donated funds had violated the principle of the presumption of innocence , which constituted CARDINAL aspect of the constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair trial taken in conjunction with the principle of the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , served on the applicant on DATE , ORG dismissed the complaint as inadmissible ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court found that while defendants were not categorically prevented from challenging a judgment delivered in proceedings conducted against third persons , an applicant who had not been party to the proceedings did have to be able to claim that his or her legitimate interests were directly affected by the impugned decision and not only in an indirect de facto manner . ORG reiterated its established case - law according to which , by virtue of the constitutionally guaranteed principle of the presumption of innocence , no measures effectively amounting to a penalty could be taken against an accused without his guilt having been established beforehand in the course of a fair trial . Furthermore , that finding of guilt had to become final before it could be held against the person concerned . However , in the context of criminal proceedings the presumption of innocence did not prevent the law - enforcement authorities from making an assessment as to whether and to what degree a person could be suspected of having committed a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . NORP , ORG pointed out that the presumption of innocence did not protect the applicant ab initio from any factual impact of statements made in a judgment rendered in criminal proceedings against third persons with respect to his own involvement in the commission of the offence . That judgment did not constitute a decision that required the determination of the applicant \u2019s guilt or exposed him to disadvantages amounting to a conviction or sentence . Statements made in criminal proceedings against third persons did not have a binding effect on the courts or the prosecution authorities , whether with respect to preliminary proceedings pending against an applicant or in relation to any other court or administrative proceedings to which an applicant might possibly become a party in the future . The applicant could not be regarded as guilty on the basis of that judgment and was still protected by the principle of the presumption of innocence . The fact that the establishment of the facts by ORG not only concerned the accused , who were convicted at the end of the proceedings , but also the applicant was an inevitable consequence of the fact that in complex criminal proceedings it was hardly ever possible to conduct and terminate the proceedings against all the accused simultaneously .", "CARDINAL . A request for legal assistance was sent to the NORP authorities on DATE with a view to obtaining the applicant \u2019s examination in GPE . No information was submitted to the ORG as regards compliance with that request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am GPE prosecution authorities brought charges against the applicant and CARDINAL co - accused in connection with the events in issue . It further appears that on DATE ORG brought similar charges against the applicant and that his trial in GPE commenced on DATE . According to the ORG \u2019s submissions , the GPE am ORG , by an order dated DATE , opened the main hearing in the proceedings against the applicant . These are apparently still pending ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
