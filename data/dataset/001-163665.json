The applicant was born on CARDINAL DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was employed at ORG on DATE . On DATE he was promoted to the position of assistant officer and on DATE he was authorised by the director of the department to sign payment orders as authorising officer . On CARDINAL DATE a complaint was made by the director following an irregularity in a compulsory acquisition case . It emerged from the investigation that a series of cheques had been issued as alleged compensation to owners of land that had been compulsorily acquired , but that the cheques had never reached the payees named on them .", "CARDINAL . A number of criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant and an accomplice . It also appears that a third person was charged but those proceedings were terminated following the filing of a nolle prosequi by the ORG . The proceedings against the applicant involved a total of CARDINAL criminal charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received concurrent sentences ranging from DATE imprisonment from ORG ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on a plea of guilty , following a plea bargain to twenty-", "CARDINAL charges concerning a number of offences . These included , inter alia , obtaining the amount of CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL GPE pounds ( ORG ) ( MONEY ) by false pretences , issuing false documents , forging cheques , abuse of office , and concealment . Part of the agreement reached between the parties was that the applicant would repay the sum of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately CARDINAL,CARDINAL euros ) , and a confiscation order for that sum was issued in respect of his property . In imposing the sentences ORG also took into consideration another CARDINAL cases pending against the applicant before it as well as ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against his sentence ( criminal appeal no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s conviction , and having received the Attorney - General \u2019s advisory opinion that the offences committed involved dishonesty or moral turpitude , the ORG instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant . Similar proceedings were also instituted against his accomplice , on whom the ORG imposed compulsory retirement pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(i ) of LAW of DATE ( Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; hereinafter \u201c LAW \u201d ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the ORG informed the applicant of the Attorney - General \u2019s opinion and invited him to appear before it on DATE and to make representations before proceeding with the imposition of a disciplinary penalty .", "CARDINAL . NORP The ORG convened on DATE . The applicant \u2019s lawyer requested DATE to prepare his pleadings , as he had only recently been appointed and in view of the special nature of the case . The ORG granted the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant , who was represented by a lawyer , was heard by the ORG . He put forward a number of mitigating factors , which included his dire financial situation following suspension from his duties , the fact that he had paid off most of the sum agreed upon with the authorities , the conviction and sentence he had received from ORG , his significant DATE of service , and the less severe punishment imposed on his accomplice . He also submitted a socio - economic report by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to dismiss the applicant . In its decision the ORG observed that this case had been one of the most serious cases it had been faced with . The conception and planning of the crimes committed showed a well - set - up fraud which had dealt a blow to the prestige and credibility of the procedures of ORG and also to the image of ORG in general . The ORG noted that the offences of which the applicant had been convicted included some of the most serious offences against property , as well as abuse of office and concealment . The gravity of the offences was evident from the severity of the sentences applicable under the law , the substantial sum the applicant had secured through his unlawful actions , and the fact that CARDINAL more cases pending against him concerning similar offences had been taken into account by ORG when imposing sentence . The ORG also pointed out that the applicant had faced CARDINAL charges in total , which was unprecedented for GPE and which disclosed the seriousness and the magnitude of the case .", "CARDINAL . In reaching its decision the ORG observed that it had taken into account the circumstances and conditions under which the applicant had committed the offences . He had been authorised to sign payment orders and had been entrusted by the Republic with the important post of promoting cases concerning compulsory acquisition and serving citizens involved in these cases . The applicant , however , did not live up to his responsibilities , exploited his position , and developed his criminal activities with unprecedented effrontery and recklessness . He had been the mastermind , instigator and main executor of the criminal activities .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also noted that it had taken into consideration what had been said by the applicant \u2019s counsel in mitigation , in particular , the applicant \u2019s personal and family circumstances , as well as the fact that he had undertaken to compensate for the damage and/or part of the damage suffered by the Republic as a consequence of his criminal acts . Further , the ORG pointed out that he had been the main protagonist and this had been stressed by ORG when distinguishing the sentence passed on him from that passed on his co - accused .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the disciplinary penalty of dismissal resulted in the forfeiture of the entire applicant \u2019s public service retirement benefits ( hereinafter \u201c retirement benefits \u201d ) . This entailed the loss of a retirement lump sum and a DATE pension .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the ORG decided that the part of the applicant \u2019s salary that had been withheld during the period of his suspension from service would not be returned to him .", "CARDINAL . Up to the date of his dismissal the applicant had worked for DATE in the public service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant withdrew his appeal .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , his wife received a widow \u2019s pension . This amounted to CARDINAL ( ORG ) per year .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a recourse before ORG ( revisional jurisdiction ) under LAW , seeking the annulment of the ORG \u2019s decision to dismiss him from ORG and of the consequent forfeiture of his pension rights ( recourse no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that the forfeiture of his retirement benefits had been in breach of LAW and LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . In this respect the applicant argued that his pension rights constituted a \u201c possession \u201d , and that their automatic forfeiture consequent to his dismissal was disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in an ex tempore decision , held that the recourse was admissible . The court observed that the case concerned the discretion of the ORG in deciding on the dismissal , taking into account all relevant parameters and , in particular , the consequences dismissal would have for the applicant . Therefore , the decision on the penalty and the consequences were very closely linked , bringing to the forefront the principle of proportionality as the main aspect of the ORG \u2019s discretion . It was obvious from the ORG \u2019s decision that in exercising its discretion when choosing the penalty to be imposed it had taken into account the automatic , as it considered , by law , loss of retirement benefits . As a result the court concluded that the extreme severity of the case justified , despite its grave repercussions on the applicant \u2019s retirement rights , the penalty of dismissal . If in the end the court were to accept the applicant \u2019s claims , the setting aside of the penalty of dismissal could not be excluded . ORG therefore concluded that it could continue to examine the merits of the recourse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the recourse , but did not award costs against the applicant in view of the nature of the legal issues raised .", "CARDINAL . ORG , after having ruled that the retirement benefits of a public servant in GPE constituted a possession under LAW No . CARDINAL , went on to examine whether or not there had been a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under this provision . Drawing guidance from the ORG \u2019s case - law , and in particular the judgments in the case of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , and [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIII ) , and the decision in the case of ORG v. GPE ( ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALXI ) , ORG first pointed to those factors which justified the deprivation of the right to property in this case . CARDINAL such main factor in the court \u2019s view was the gravity of the offences committed . It considered in this respect that the characterisation of the case by the ORG as one of the most serious in its history did not appear to be an exaggeration . The impression given by the offences was such that not only did they entail a well - organised fraud but they also , most importantly , as the ORG asserted , dealt a blow to the prestige and trustworthiness of the administration . The court considered that sentencing the applicant to DATE imprisonment , as well as dismissing him , did not necessarily exhaust the limits of the discretion of the ORG to put things right . Besides , as in ORG , the non - deprivation of pension benefits in the case of a pension plan to which the employee did not make contributions would amount to rewarding the applicant .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , the serious consequences of the applicant \u2019s punishment - a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and dismissal - had also to be considered , particularly the financial difficulties arising from the deprivation of the said rights as an additional \u201c punishment \u201d for the applicant and his family . The court observed that this was an important factor to be taken into account , according to the circumstances of each case . If the deprivation had not been automatic but discretionary within the framework of enacted procedures , as in GPE , it would have been possible to examine whether there should be a deprivation and to what extent . The court noted in this respect that it would indeed be good for the State to consider seriously the prospect of an amendment to the law so as to make the system more flexible and fairer in each case . Moreover , there was also the fact that the applicant had to a great extent returned the money he had embezzled , a fact which , although the ORG had said that it had taken it into account , did not appear to have affected its decision , since the punishment imposed on the applicant was , of the CARDINAL forms provided for , the extreme one of dismissal instead of choosing the second most serious form of punishment , that of compulsory retirement , which would not have entailed the loss of retirement rights .", "CARDINAL . In the end , however , ORG considered that the fact that the case in question arose and was heard on the basis of a different statutory regime from that in PERSON as regards the consequences of dismissal entailing the loss of pension rights , tilted the scales , albeit slightly , in favour of the Republic . The proviso in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) that the applicant \u2019s pension from DATE of his dismissal would be paid to his wife and dependent children as if he had died on that date reduced for the family the hardship resulting from the dismissal . Despite this , the court observed that it was likely that there would be cases with even more dire consequences for the dismissed employee , such as when there was no wife or dependent children , or their relationship was such that the dismissed employee could not reasonably expect to benefit through them . Nothing , however , had been said to include the present case among those cases , except for the theoretical possibility that his wife could die before the applicant . The court stated that , if matters were otherwise , it was likely that it would have ruled differently .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG stressed that the competent bodies should seriously study the possibility of amending the statutory framework on the basis of the law in force in GPE , so that deprivation of retirement rights was not automatic but could be looked at with the help of enacted procedures and with the exercise of discretion in order that the ORG might determine , by means of a reasoned decision , the extent to which it was just to forfeit , if at all , in any particular case , according to the individual \u2019s special circumstances and needs . ORG considered that both the rule of law and the modern conception of individual justice demanded this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( appellate revisional jurisdiction ; appeal no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . He first challenged the first - instance finding concerning section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . He submitted that this section was contrary to LAW and LAW , as the forfeiture of his retirement benefits had been automatic , without the exercise of any discretionary power . In this respect he argued that the first - instance court had applied the proportionality principle incorrectly during the examination of the penalty imposed by the ORG , and therefore had been wrong when it decided that the measure was proportionate and in line with LAW . Secondly , the applicant claimed that the finding of the first - instance court that the consequences of this decision were reduced because he was married and thus his wife and dependent children would receive a pension , was discriminatory on the ground of marital status and thus in violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the respondent Government also appealed ( appeal no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) challenging the first - instance findings ( a ) that in the present case the retirement benefits could be considered a \u201c possession \u201d ; ( b ) that in the disciplinary dismissal of a public servant there was no enacted framework providing for the exercise of discretion as to whether the retirement benefits would be granted ; and ( c ) that the payment of the pension to the applicant \u2019s wife was the only essential factor which tilted the scales in favour of the Republic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed both appeals without awarding costs , in view of the importance of the matter raised . It agreed with the first - instance court \u2019s finding that the right to a pension and its conditions constituted a possession of the employee . This right was created by the appointment of the employee . The fact that a pension was given to the wife and dependent children suggested that pension benefits were considered as \u201c property \u201d which could be transferred . In this respect the court referred to its judgment in the case of GPE v. the Republic ( revisional appeal no . DATE , ( DATE ) CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The court went on to find , however , that the deprivation of the applicant \u2019s retirement benefits had been justified . In this respect , the court noted that the ORG had chosen the penalty of dismissal under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , after exercising its discretion and after considering the consequences and the fact that such a penalty was in the public interest . The first - instance court had examined whether the imposition of the penalty of dismissal , which brought about the automatic forfeiture of retirement benefits , was disproportionate . It had examined whether the ORG , when exercising its discretion , had applied the principle of proportionality in deciding on the penalty of dismissal , which itself resulted in the automatic deprivation of retirement rights . In this respect it held that the ORG had exercised its discretion when deciding to impose the penalty of dismissal . The ORG had had a variety of available penalties at its disposal , such as compulsory retirement , which did not bring about the forfeiture of the pension . It decided , however , in view of the offences committed by the applicant , that such deprivation was justified .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed out that ORG had acknowledged that the administration had wide discretion in deciding on such matters .", "CARDINAL . It went on to agree with the first - instance court that the deprivation of the applicant \u2019s retirement benefits had been justified in view of the seriousness of the offences , which had dealt a blow to the trustworthiness and credibility of the administration . The relevant domestic law provision was aimed at discouraging public servants from committing serious offences and at protecting the smooth running of the administration . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW was not contrary to LAW , since the deprivation of retirement benefits was not a punishment on its own , but a consequence of the imposition of the penalty of dismissal .", "CARDINAL . The court went on to distinguish the applicant \u2019s case from that of ORG , in which the forfeiture had been automatic following a criminal conviction and had entailed deprivation of both pension and social security rights and therefore of all means of subsistence . In the present case , although the applicant had been deprived of his retirement benefits as a public servant , he had been entitled to receive benefits from ORG , which were calculated on the basis of contributions made by the employer and the employee . Referring to the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , it found that the applicant had not been deprived of all means of subsistence .", "CARDINAL . As to the question of discrimination due to marital status , raised by the applicant , ORG held that the first - instance court \u2019s comments on the matter did not support the applicant \u2019s claim of discrimination . The comments in question had been made on a hypothetical basis and did not apply to the present case .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG dealt with the remaining grounds of appeal put forward by the Government . It observed that the first - instance decision was to the effect that in the event of dismissal the law did not provide for a procedure concerning the exercise of discretion for forfeiting retirement rights , but it did not say that it was not possible to exercise discretion on the matter , since it recognised that there was a choice between dismissal entailing forfeiture of rights and compulsory retirement , which did not . Finally , it pointed out that the first - instance court had set out in its decision all the facts which it had taken into account in deciding on the proportionality of the forfeiture , and had rightly concluded that the payment of the pension to the wife meant that the deprivation was not disproportionate . The court did not award costs in view of the important issues raised .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been receiving a social security pension from ORG since DATE , when he reached DATE . The pension therefore received by his wife pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW was then reduced by the complementary sum received by him from ORG . According to a letter dated DATE sent to her by ORG \u2019s ORG , her pension was reduced by ORG DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
