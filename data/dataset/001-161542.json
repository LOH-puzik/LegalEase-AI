The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of a flagrant breach of public peace and order , committed in concert by an organised group . The events in question took place in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE remanded the applicant in custody during the investigation . In particular , the court noted as follows :", "\u201c When deciding whether a preventive measure should be imposed , the court takes into consideration whether [ the applicant ] has been charged with a serious offence which entails a custodial sentence of DATE imprisonment . [ The offence in question ] was committed against public peace and public order .", "Further , the court takes into consideration the fact that , at the time of the arrest , [ the applicant ] did not reside in GPE , did not reside at his registered address and , according to him , was staying at his friend \u2019s place in LOC ; and that he had applied for DATE leave of absence from his studies at university . During that period he did not have a permanent place of residence and did not reside at his registered address . [ The applicant ] is not employed . The source of his income or means of subsistence for his family are not known .

On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of DATE . He argued that ORG had failed to justify its decision to remand him in custody and had not considered the possibility of using a less restrictive preventive measure in his case .

Lastly , he pointed out that he was residing at the address known to the authorities together with his wife , who was pregnant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the decision of DATE justified and upheld it on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until DATE . The court reasoned as follows :", "\u201c As can be seen from the materials submitted to the court , [ the applicant ] is charged with a serious offence which carries a custodial sentence of DATE . The crime was committed in concert with other persons . Some of them have not been identified by the investigating authorities to date . The others have been arrested . [ The applicant ] was not residing at his registered address . He does not have a registered address in LOC . He is unemployed .", "Under LAW of LAW , a preventive measure can be imposed if there is evidence that a defendant might abscond or interfere with the administration of justice in his case . Neither [ the applicant ] nor his lawyer presented evidence to show that the existence of such a risk could not be justified . Furthermore , it can be seen from the documents submitted to the court that there is a risk that [ the applicant ] might engage in unlawful acts as defined in the above - mentioned provision of the law , regard being had to the nature and seriousness of the offence with which he is charged , to and to his character", "...", "Accordingly , the court concludes that the circumstances justifying the [ applicant \u2019s ] remand in custody have not changed . There is no reason to change or lift the preventive measure imposed earlier . The statements of guarantee submitted by the [ applicant \u2019s ] lawyer can not be taken into consideration by the court because they were not submitted to the investigator or presented by the signatories in person . ... Some of the statements are not duly authorised and the court has doubts as to their authenticity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE on appeal .", "CARDINAL .

He further pointed out that the investigation in the case had already been completed and that he could not interfere with the administration of justice or put pressure on witnesses . He had no intention of doing so or of absconding . The court ruled that the applicant should remain in custody pending trial . In particular , the court stated as follows :", "\u201c Having examined the prosecutor \u2019s request to detain [ the applicant and CARDINAL other defendants ] pending trial , the court grants it . It discerns no grounds on which to change the preventive measure imposed on the defendants , regard being had to the seriousness of the charges , the factual circumstances and the defendants\u2019 character . In particular , PERSON and [ the applicant ] do not have a registered address in GPE or LOC . They were not living at their registered address . They are unemployed . The circumstances underlying their remand in custody have not ceased to exist or changed . The fact that the investigation in the criminal case has been completed has no effect to the contrary .", "Regard being had to the foregoing , the court discerns no grounds on which to change the preventive measure imposed earlier on the defendants and apply a less restrictive measure , including the [ applicant \u2019s ] release upon a statement of guarantee signed by a surety . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG for release . He submitted that on DATE his wife had given birth to their child . He also relied on the statements of guarantee submitted by his sureties .
