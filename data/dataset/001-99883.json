In DATE the applicant acquired NORP citizenship by registration in consequence of his marriage to a NORP national . Subsequently , on DATE the marriage was annulled by court order as it had been found to be a marriage of convenience . However , the applicant retained NORP nationality according to the law in force at the time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant married a NORP national in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE following DATE the applicant applied to ORG to have his marriage registered in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions , notwithstanding the presentation of his NORP identity card and a NORP passport , ORG required \u201c as a matter of policy \u201d that the applicant submit a letter from ORG declaring that he was a citizen of GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government the authorities also noted that the requisite translation of the NORP marriage certificate presented by the applicant had not been apostilled by ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite his contention that the request for a letter from ORG did not have a legal basis in domestic law , the applicant requested the ORG to issue the letter . ORG refused to issue such a letter , allegedly replying that he was not bound to issue it then , if at all .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant 's request , by a decision of ORG dated DATE , the Director of ORG was directed to register the marriage , upon the applicant submitting his original act of marriage in NORP together with an LANGUAGE translation authenticated by his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's request remained unsatisfied notwithstanding this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision of CARDINAL DATE was revoked by ORG . The latter , while expressing doubts as to whether the applicant could apply to ORG , held that a NORP passport was not conclusive evidence of citizenship . Furthermore , the Director was vested with discretion to demand documents which he considered reasonable to prove the authenticity of what was submitted to him . The court therefore agreed that the NORP certificate of marriage produced by the applicant was not sufficiently authenticated evidence satisfying the Director of ORG , having regard to LAW ( see relevant domestic law , below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction . He complained that the refusal to register his marriage was in violation of his LAW alone and in conjunction with LAW .", "CARDINAL . It appeared from the evidence given by an official employed at ORG that there were CARDINAL reasons for the refusal to register the marriage . Firstly , the documents presented by the applicant had not been authenticated by ORG of GPE , which is the competent authority to attach apostilles to such public documents , and , secondly , that every person who applied for registration was asked to produce a letter of citizenship .", "CARDINAL . According to the evidence of the relevant Minister , the request for such a certificate did not result from a law or legal notice but from an internal regulation . While in the course of the present proceedings a circular , applicable to all Government departments , was issued stating that NORP passports could be accepted as proof of citizenship , the Minister stated that a letter of citizenship was the best evidence to prove citizenship at any precise moment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during these proceedings , the Head of ORG also confirmed that the applicant was a NORP citizen .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant withdrew his complaint in relation to Article CARDINAL taken in conjunction with Article CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the court rejected the application , with legal costs to be paid by the applicant . It held that Article CARDINAL had not been breached , since the Director of ORG had not categorically refused to register the marriage , but had merely requested appropriate documentation . Moreover , Article CARDINAL did not extend to a general obligation on the part of a Contracting State to respect the choice by married couples of the country of their matrimonial residence and to accept the non - national spouse for settlement in that country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court invited the Director of ORG to indicate the law on which the Registry based its insistence on the \u201c letter of nationality \u201d .

Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant was called upon by the ORG to register the marriage . He was asked to submit the original or an authenticated copy of his marriage certificate . No further documents were requested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the marriage was registered on the basis of the documents originally submitted by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , before ORG , the appeal was maintained as the Director of ORG did not accept that the first judgment should be revoked and the costs refunded to the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

Although an identity card and a passport were prima facie evidence of nationality they were not conclusive , especially when citizenship had been obtained through registration ( as in the case of the applicant ) or naturalisation , both being subject to revocation according to section QUANTITY of LAW ( see relevant domestic law ) . The Minister 's deposition in respect of the recently issued circular was irrelevant , since responsibility for ascertaining the compliance with the requirements of Article CARDINAL ) was for the Director of ORG . Thus , the requirement of a letter of nationality was in accordance with the law , pursued a legitimate aim and was proportionate . However , ORG noted that from the witness testimony at the hearing of DATE , it was clear that the applicant was a NORP citizen ; however , interdepartmental lethargy had meant that the Director of ORG only called upon the applicant to register the marriage on DATE .
