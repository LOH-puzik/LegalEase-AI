{"ITEMID": "001-60933", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NOR", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF RINGVOLD v. NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-2", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( straffeloven ) with the sexual abuse of a minor , PERSON , born in DATE , during the period from DATE . Under these provisions he was charged with having , on CARDINAL or several occasions , threatened to hit PERSON if she cried out , and/or having held her tight , whereupon he had introduced his penis into or pointed it towards her sex and/or made her masturbate him . At the time , PERSON \u2019s father was cohabiting with the applicant \u2019s mother . The alleged offences were said to have occurred in the applicant \u2019s home when the child visited her father .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings were instituted before ORG ( lagmannsrett ) which heard the case DATE , including PERSON \u2019s compensation claim of ( up to ) MONEY ( ORG ) for non - pecuniary damage , made under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( skadeerstatningsloven ) , and joined to the trial in accordance with LAW ( straffeprosessloven ) . By a judgment of DATE , ORG , noting that the jury had answered the questions concerning criminal guilt in the negative , acquitted the applicant of the charges . Moreover , it decided to reject PERSON \u2019s compensation claim .", "CARDINAL . PERSON subsequently appealed to ORG ( PERSON ) under the rules of LAW ( tvistem\u00e5lsloven ) against the refusal to award compensation . ORG then ordered the taking of oral evidence by ORG ( byrett ) . Evidence was taken DATE , DATE and DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , during which time CARDINAL witnesses were heard .", "CARDINAL . In the appeal proceedings before ORG , PERSON \u2019s lawyer requested that documents produced in the context of the criminal case be submitted as evidence to ORG . These included records of the judicial examination of PERSON , medical certificates , letters and witness statements given to the police in connection with the criminal proceedings . The applicant \u2019s lawyer , relying on LAW , objected to this request .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG authorised the documents from the criminal case to be joined to the case file in the compensation proceedings . Its decision included the following reasons :", "\u201c In their pleadings , the lawyers for the parties have dealt extensively with the issue under LAW . The only question for ORG to determine is whether the submission of the criminal - case documents in the civil case would as such violate this LAW provision . The question as to the significance of this provision for the decision on the compensation claim falls to be considered in connection with the decision on the merits of the appeal .", "The use of documents from the criminal case as evidence in this case does not in my view fall foul of the requirement in LAW ... The submission of the documents does not as such imply that the acquittal in the criminal case is open to doubt .", "The statement in the PERSON case , which the lawyer for the defendant has referred to , must be read in its context . The ruling can not be perceived as a general procedural bar against the production of the case documents from criminal proceedings in a later case .", "Furthermore , I should like to add that , although this is not decisive for my view on the issue under LAW , both parties were given the usual opportunity to supply evidence in connection with the taking of evidence by ORG .", "In my view , the request for submission of the criminal - case documents in question must therefore be granted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the case under the rules of civil procedure . After hearing the parties and a large number of witnesses , ORG , in a judgment of DATE , ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to PERSON in compensation for non - pecuniary damage , under section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The first voting judge , PERSON , stated on behalf of a unanimous court , inter alia :", "\u201c In so far as the appeal concerns the merits , CARDINAL general questions arise , namely the relationship to the acquittal in the criminal case ( see LAW ) and the requirement of proof in such cases .", "Under LAW of LAW , civil compensation claims may ... be made in criminal proceedings by the prosecution or by the injured party . This arrangement is intended to make it easier for the injured party to have a civil compensation claim examined , but it does not preclude the possibility of making such a claim in separate civil proceedings instead .", "Contrary to what followed from the old LAW , it is not a condition for the examination of civil compensation claims that the accused person should have been convicted in respect of the charge . Thus , it is in principle possible to either reject or uphold a civil compensation claim , irrespective of the decision concerning criminal liability . This has its background in the fact that the injured party , who does not enjoy rights as a party in the criminal case , should not forfeit his or her compensation claim as a result of an acquittal in the criminal case . Although it will hardly be a frequent occurrence that the decision on the civil compensation claim goes in a different direction from that on criminal liability , this may happen for various reasons . Amongst others , the requirement of evidence for the criminal and the civil consequences of an action ... is different .", "By LAW , a person who is charged with a criminal offence is to be deemed innocent until proved guilty . The presumption of innocence applies even after an acquittal ( see in this connection the PERSON case and the decision reported in PERSON DATE , p. CARDINAL , dealing with the significance of the presumption of innocence in a case concerning the right of the accused to compensation after an acquittal ) .", "However , in my opinion it must be clear that the said provision can not constitute an obstacle for a person injured by an act to claim compensation from the alleged perpetrator , even though the latter has been acquitted of a criminal offence , and that the court in such a case can rely on a finding that the defendant has in fact committed the act in relation to which he has been acquitted . Even assuming that the ORG provision applies to the treatment of such claims , it has not been infringed as long as no disagreement or doubt has been expressed with regard to the decision on criminal liability . I can not see that the arrangement under NORP criminal procedural law , whereby it is possible to have civil compensation claims determined after an acquittal , gives rise to any particular problems in relation to LAW [ of the LAW ] . Moreover , in the case at hand , it is above all ORG decision concerning compensation which has been brought before ORG under the provisions of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the requirement of evidence , PERSON noted that under the law on compensation the test was normally the balance of probabilities . However , bearing in mind the burden which an allegation of reprehensible conduct might have for the defendant and the serious consequences it might have for his or her reputation , the requirement as to the strength of the evidence had to be stricter than that which applied to the test of the balance of probabilities . Nevertheless , the requirement could not be as strict as that which applied for establishing criminal liability . In a case of the kind under consideration , the test had to be whether on the balance of probabilities it was clearly probable that the alleged abuse had been committed .", "CARDINAL . In dealing with the particular facts of the appeal concerning compensation , ORG had regard to the video recording of the judicial examination of the alleged victim in the criminal proceedings before ORG . ORG did not share ORG view that the evidentiary value of the video recording was diminished by certain misgivings concerning the lack of synchronisation of sound and picture when shown to ORG . Those shortcomings had been remedied before ORG . ORG also had regard to evidence taken by it from this person , which deviated slightly from the judicial examination before ORG . It further had regard to the statements of an expert witness and the statements of a therapist who had treated the alleged victim . Considering the evidence as a whole , Justice Gj\u00f8lstad found that the evidence satisfied the standard of proof , establishing that sexual abuse had occurred and that , on the balance of probabilities , it was clear that the applicant was the abuser . Accordingly , there was a basis for awarding the victim compensation under LAW CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW . However , Justice PERSON emphasised that this decision was taken independently of the decision in the criminal case and that it did not undermine the acquittal . Finally , as regards the amount of compensation , she observed , inter alia , that she based her assessment on her finding that several infringements had occurred and that , even though their extent was not possible to ascertain with precision , there had been serious violations involving a certain use of force or threats , as a result of which PERSON had sustained damage .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP criminal law there are CARDINAL basic conditions that must be met in order to establish criminal liability :", "( CARDINAL ) the accused has committed an act or omission ( actus reus ) which is contrary to a provision of LAW or to a special statutory criminal provision in force at the time when the act or omission occurred ;", "( CARDINAL ) there are no exonerating circumstances ( for example , self - defence ) ;", "( CARDINAL ) the accused has acted with intent ( mens rea ) , unless otherwise expressly stated in the relevant criminal provision ; and", "( CARDINAL ) the accused was of sound mind at the time of the commission of the offence .", "CARDINAL . As a general rule , the prosecution has to prove these CARDINAL elements beyond reasonable doubt . Any reasonable doubt must benefit the accused ( in dubio pro reo ) .", "CARDINAL . Under the NORP jury system , when an accused is acquitted the jury is not entitled to disclose whether any of its members held a different opinion , and no records are kept which could disclose that a negative answer as to the applicant \u2019s guilt was not unanimous . CARDINAL conclusions are possible in a criminal case \u2013 guilt or acquittal ( see Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . There is no third alternative , such as that formerly known in some other NORP countries , where a criminal charge could result in the finding that there was not sufficient evidence to establish guilt .", "CARDINAL . Under the DATE LAW , a civil claim may be pursued in connection with a criminal trial , provided that the claim arises from the same set of facts . The civil claim of a victim may be decided either in connection with a criminal case or in separate proceedings . Article CARDINAL reads :", "\u201c Any legal claim that the aggrieved person or any other injured person has against the person charged may , in accordance with the provisions of LAW , be pursued in connection with such cases as are mentioned in LAW , provided that the said claim arises from the same act that the case is concerned with . On the above conditions the following claims may also be pursued :", "...", "The claims specified in the first and second paragraphs shall be deemed to be civil claims and shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of LAW ... \u201d", "Other provisions concerning civil compensation claims may be found in LAW of LAW , notably the following :", "\u201c In a public prosecution the prosecuting authority may on application pursue such civil legal claims as are specified in LAW . ...", "When civil claims are pursued against a person other than the person charged , the person concerned assumes the position of a party to the case in so far as this issue is concerned . ... \u201d", "\u201c Any person who has any such civil claim as is specified in LAW may himself pursue it in connection with a public prosecution if a trial hearing is held . ... \u201d", "\u201c A separate appeal against a decision on civil claims shall be brought in accordance with the provisions of LAW . The same shall apply to a reopening of the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW DATE , the alleged victim may , regardless of the outcome of the criminal proceedings , claim compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .", "Section DATE , as in force at the relevant time , read as follows :", "\u201c Anyone who with intent or through gross negligence has", "( a ) caused personal injury or", "( b ) committed ... an act of misconduct as mentioned in section CARDINAL", "may ... be obliged to pay the victim such a lump sum as the court deems would constitute reasonable compensation [ oppreisning ] for the pain and suffering and other non - pecuniary damage caused thereby . ...", "A person who with intent or through gross negligence has caused the death of another person may be ordered to pay such compensation to the deceased \u2019s ... parents . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL - CARDINAL , referred to in the above provision , expressly applies to misconduct mentioned in , amongst other provisions , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "A claim for compensation for nonpecuniary damage submitted by a victim under section CARDINAL of the LAW is subject to his or her showing that the alleged perpetrator , with intent or through gross negligence , committed the wrongful act . The test is normally the balance of probabilities and the burden of proof lies with the claimant . This burden may be heavier where liability may have serious consequences for the respondent \u2019s reputation , though it will be less than for criminal liability . The competent court has to determine liability in the light of all the evidence available at the time of the adjudication of the case .", "CARDINAL . The objective constitutive elements of acts which may give rise to both criminal liability and civil liability to pay compensation are not always the same . The subjective constitutive elements in principle differ : normally criminal liability requires intent whereas liability to pay compensation requires gross or simple negligence . There may be exonerating circumstances \u2013 such as self - defence , necessity , provocation or ignorance \u2013 which exclude criminal liability but which do not exclude liability to pay compensation . A person of unsound mind may be exempted from criminal liability but not necessarily from civil liability to pay compensation ( see PERSON GPE ( NORP Official Reports ) CARDINAL , \u201c Erstatning til ofrene hvor tiltalte frifinnes for straff \u201d ( \u201c Compensation to victims in cases where the accused has been acquitted on the criminal charge \u201d ) , a study by PERSON , Professor of PERSON , LAW , section CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "The purposes of the criminal law and the law on compensation are not identical . While deterrence and restoration are important considerations in both areas of law , the former places emphasis on retribution and the latter on the allocation of financial loss . The CARDINAL systems also supplement one another in important respects . While criminal - law sanctions are particularly designed to deter actual and potential offenders from committing offences , those of the law of compensation are particularly designed to meet the aggrieved person \u2019s need for economic redress ( ibid . , LAW , section CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
