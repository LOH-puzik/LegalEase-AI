The applicant was born in DATE . He is currently serving a prison term in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in the context of criminal proceedings for large - scale money laundering conducted against the applicant before GPE for GPE ( \u201c the GPE District Court \u201d ) , the NORP courts were requested under letters rogatory to seize assets which had been found in CARDINAL safes in GPE rented by the applicant . On DATE the GPE ORG ordered the seizure and put the assets , mostly cash and bearer bonds , at the disposal of the GPE Island District Court as evidence in the criminal proceedings against the applicant , on the condition that the assets were to be returned upon termination of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The parties disagree as to whether or not the applicant was the owner of the assets at issue . The applicant claims that the assets stemmed from lawful business activities carried out until DATE , while the Government claim that they stemmed from the money laundering in DATE and DATE of which he was convicted ( see below ) and that he was holding them as a trustee for the drug cartel for which he had worked .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE District Court convicted the applicant of money laundering and related charges , finding that he had headed an organisation which had laundered CARDINAL million United States dollars ( ORG ) in DATE and DATE , and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . Subsequently , on DATE , the court issued a preliminary forfeiture order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , ORG , dismissed an appeal by the applicant against his conviction and against the forfeiture order . The reasons , in so far as relevant in the context of the present case , were as follows . As to the applicant \u2019s claim that he was represented at his trial by counsel ( H. ) who had a conflict of interest , the court noted that the applicant had been informed of his rights but had insisted on being represented by counsel PERSON Finally , he had executed a written waiver retaining ORG as counsel and confirming that he had been fully advised and had considered the possible adverse consequences for his defence . Since counsel PERSON had only informed the court in vague terms that he feared being charged or called as a witness in the applicant \u2019s case , ORG was justified in accepting the waiver . In any event , the applicant was represented by a second , conflict - free counsel , NORP As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that he had had no hearing in the forfeiture proceedings , the appellate court noted that the applicant , represented by counsel , had waived his right to a jury hearing in the separate forfeiture proceedings on the ground that they purely concerned matters of legal argument . The case had been heard on DATE in the presence of the applicant \u2019s counsel . The applicant had not been present since he had to appear before another court . Counsel had requested that the applicant be heard but had refused the court \u2019s offer to have a further hearing in the presence of the applicant before the delivery of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected an appeal on points of law by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Rhode Island District Court issued a final forfeiture order relating to a total amount of MONEY , including MONEY in respect of the applicant , \u201c being the proceeds of narcotics money laundering for which the following property has been partially substituted \u201d . There followed an enumeration of cash amounts in GPE , GPE dollars and NORP schillings seized in GPE in DATE and a list of bearer bonds issued by NORP banks and , finally a bank account in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Rhode ORG issued letters rogatory which , so far as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c ... GPE for GPE requests enforcement in GPE of the enclosed Final LAW against said cash , bonds and other financial instruments . To the extent possible under NORP law and consistent with any sharing agreement between GPE and GPE , please convert the cash and the proceeds of the bonds and other instruments into GPE dollars and transfer those funds by wire into the above referenced ORG . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG transmitted this request to the NORP authorities on DATE . On DATE ORG requested ORG to open \u201c exequatur \u201d proceedings to enforce the foreign court \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) , as an interim measure , ordered the confiscation of the applicant \u2019s assets , of a total value of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG \u2013 CARDINAL ) , in cash , bearer bonds and a bank account , for the purpose of securing the enforcement of the final forfeiture order of DATE . It referred to the above request and noted that enforcement proceedings under LAW ( Auslieferungs- und Rechtshilfegesetz \u2013 \u201c the ELAA \u201d ) were pending .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on DATE , submitting in particular that ORG decision amounted to an unlawful interference with his right to property , as it lacked a legal basis . Moreover , an enforcement of the forfeiture order for the benefit of GPE was not admissible in GPE as section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ELAA provided that any fines or forfeited assets obtained by executing a foreign decision fell to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Further , the applicant claimed that the final forfeiture order also included \u201c substitute assets \u201d , i.e. assets not connected to or derived from criminal activity . Thus the measure requested did not correspond in any way to forfeiture ( ORG ) or withdrawal of enrichment ( GPE der GPE ) within the meaning of LAW ) . In any event these penalties could not be applied in his case , as the relevant provisions had not been in force at the time he committed the offences . Furthermore , he had been convicted of money laundering in GPE , an offence which had not been punishable under NORP law at the time of its commission .", "CARDINAL . Relying on section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON , the applicant also argued that the forfeiture proceedings had failed to comply with the requirements of LAW , since the proceedings had not been public and he had not been heard . Moreover , his defence rights had been violated in the underlying criminal proceedings , his defence lawyer having been caught in a conflict of interests .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant claimed that there was a lack of reciprocity as decisions of NORP courts were not enforceable in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG had made a formal request to GPE authorities to hear the applicant in connection with the request for execution of the final forfeiture order . On DATE ORG transmitted the applicant \u2019s submissions to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG addressed a note to ORG concerning reciprocity in providing legal assistance in forfeiture proceedings . The applicant denies that this note contains assurances of reciprocity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the LAW between the Government of GPE and the Government of GPE on ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) entered into force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that ORG decision was based on Article CARDINALa of LAW ( GPE ) . In this connection , the court noted that pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , the provisions of LAW had to be applied mutatis mutandis unless explicitly provided otherwise .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s assertion that a forfeiture for the benefit of GPE would be contrary to LAW , the court observed that the letters rogatory requested first and foremost that any measures required under NORP law for the execution of the final forfeiture order be taken . Only as an additional point did they ask for the transfer of the assets , provided that this was admissible under NORP law or any bilateral treaty . In this connection it referred to Article CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s assertion that the final forfeiture order covered substitute assets which could not be subject to forfeiture under NORP law , the court observed that it followed from the judgment concerning the applicant \u2019s conviction that he had led an organisation which had laundered large sums of money derived from drug dealing and had usually received a PERCENT commission for each amount laundered . DATE and DATE he had transferred MONEY of drug - related money from the account of a sham company to various foreign bank accounts . Thus , there were good reasons to assume that the applicant \u2019s NORP assets were monies received for or derived from the commission of a crime and subject to withdrawal of enrichment under LAW , or monies directly obtained through drug dealing , subject to forfeiture under LAW , in the version in force since its DATE amendment . The final forfeiture order made a clear link between the offence of money laundering of which the applicant had been convicted and the forfeiture of all monies obtained thereby .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL and CARDINALb in the version in force since the DATE amendment of LAW were not regarded as penalties under NORP law , but as measures sui generis . The fact that they had not been in force at the time of the commission of the offences was therefore not material .", "CARDINAL . Even if CARDINAL applied the law in force at the time of the commission of the offences , the requirements for withdrawal of enrichment were met . Article CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of LAW , in the version in force at that time , provided that an offender who had unjustly enriched himself could be ordered to pay an amount equivalent to the enrichment if the latter exceeded ORG CARDINAL . Although there had been no offence of money laundering under NORP law at the time , the facts constituted the offence of receiving stolen property ( GPE ) under LAW , which made it an offence to assist the perpetrator of an offence ( here , the drug dealers ) in concealing assets derived from or received for the commission of the offence or to acquire such assets .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s allegation that both the criminal proceedings against him and the proceedings resulting in the final forfeiture order had failed to comply with LAW , the court referred to the documents of those proceedings contained in its file and noted the following . In the criminal proceedings , the applicant had been present and had been represented by CARDINAL counsel . It noted that it was the applicant who had insisted on being represented by counsel PERSON although the latter had voiced concerns , albeit without substantiating them , that he might himself be charged . In any case , the applicant had been represented by a second counsel , who was free from any potential conflict of interests . In the forfeiture proceedings he waived his right to a public hearing before a jury since they only concerned questions of law . On DATE the judge had heard the case in the presence of the applicant \u2019s counsel but without the applicant being present . The applicant \u2019s lawyer had requested that the applicant be heard but had refused the court \u2019s offer to hold a further hearing in the presence of the applicant before the delivery of the judgment . In sum , ORG found no indication that the proceedings before GPE courts had failed to comply with LAW .", "CARDINAL . As regards the alleged lack of reciprocity , the court noted that when the request for enforcement of the final forfeiture order had been made , there had been no bilateral treaty between GPE and GPE . Thus , only the provisions of the PERSON had to be applied , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of which required reciprocity . ORG had duly investigated the issue in that it had required ORG to submit information as to the possibilities of enforcing an NORP forfeiture order in GPE . Meanwhile , however , LAW had entered into force . Under LAW ) of LAW , it applied irrespective of whether the underlying offences were committed before or after its entry into force . LAW provided for mutual legal assistance in forfeiture proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE central authority , relying on the CARDINAL Treaty , made a new request for enforcement of the final forfeiture order of DATE . According to the applicant , this second request for legal assistance was not served on him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made submissions on DATE , on DATE and on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without holding a hearing , decided to take over the enforcement of the final forfeiture order of DATE and ordered the forfeiture of the applicant \u2019s NORP assets for the benefit of GPE .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to LAW , the requirement of reciprocity was fulfilled . The submissions by the applicant which disputed this were no longer relevant as they referred to the legal position before the entry into force of LAW . As to the question of the beneficiary of the forfeiture , it noted that Article CARDINAL ) of the DATE Treaty provided optionally that each State party could hand over forfeited assets to the other party .", "CARDINAL . Referring to ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , it noted that the applicant \u2019s conduct had been punishable under NORP law . Thus , the forfeiture was not contrary to LAW . Finally , the court noted that the applicant had been given an opportunity to comment on the request for legal assistance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on DATE . He asserted that the DATE LAW provided for legal assistance in pending criminal proceedings , but did not contain a legal basis for mutual execution of final decisions . Even assuming that LAW applied in the present case , the enforcement of the final forfeiture order would violate LAW as the said LAW had not been in force in DATE when the forfeiture order was issued . Moreover , money laundering had not been punishable under NORP law at the time of the commission of the offences . Consequently , his assets could not be subject to forfeiture or withdrawal of enrichment under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the applicant repeated his argument that his NORP assets were substitute assets and claimed that , at the time of the commission of the offences , such assets had not been subject to forfeiture or withdrawal of enrichment under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . Relying on expert opinions submitted by him , the applicant maintained that the condition of reciprocity required by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON was not fulfilled , as GPE constitutional law did not permit the enforcement of decisions given by foreign criminal courts . He further submitted that the DATE limitation period for enforcement had started running on DATE , when the preliminary forfeiture order was issued ( as it was , despite its name , a final and enforceable decision ) , and not only on DATE , when the final forfeiture order was issued .", "CARDINAL . In addition the applicant alleged that the criminal proceedings and the forfeiture proceedings before GPE courts had not complied with the requirements of LAW . He submitted the same arguments as in the proceedings relating to the preliminary confiscation of his assets . Moreover , he referred in general terms to the fact that GPE still applied the death penalty .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant also complained about a number of procedural shortcomings as regards the proceedings in GPE . He alleged in particular that ORG had refused to take into account the aforesaid expert opinions submitted by him , which showed that GPE constitutional law excluded any enforcement of decisions of foreign criminal courts . Moreover , he had not been given sufficient opportunity to advance his arguments as , in his view , that would have required his personal presence in court . Finally , he complained that ORG had failed to hold a public oral hearing and requested that such a hearing be held by the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . ORG also appealed . Its appeal was served on the applicant for comments , which he submitted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . Upon the public prosecutor \u2019s appeal , it amended ORG decision and ordered the forfeiture to the benefit of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The court noted at the outset that , pursuant to its LAW ) , LAW applied irrespective of whether the underlying offences were committed before or after its entry into force . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that the said LAW did not provide a basis for the mutual enforcement of decisions . LAW , paragraphs ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW , in conjunction with LAW , governed legal assistance in forfeiture proceedings . As to the alleged lack of reciprocity , it was sufficient to refer to those provisions . It was therefore not necessary to examine questions of GPE constitutional law .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , referring to its decision of CARDINAL DATE , the court reiterated that the facts underlying the applicant \u2019s conviction for money laundering would have been punishable as receiving stolen property under LAW at the time of the commission of the offences . Further , it reiterated that withdrawal of enrichment pursuant to LAW and forfeiture pursuant to LAW , both in the version in force since DATE , were not regarded as penalties , but served the purpose of neutralising proceeds of criminal activities . These measures covered any proceeds of an offence , irrespective of whether they were directly derived from the offence or given for its commission or whether they had already been converted into other assets .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the proceedings in GPE had not complied with the requirements of LAW , the court referred to the reasons given in its previous decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s plea that the enforcement of the final forfeiture order was time - barred , noting that ORG , on DATE , had refused leave to appeal against the provisional forfeiture order , whereupon the final forfeiture order had been issued on DATE . Consequently , the DATE limitation period pursuant to section QUANTITY of LAW had not expired .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s procedural rights , the court noted that he had been represented by counsel throughout the proceedings and had had the opportunity to submit extensive written pleadings .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court considered that the public prosecutor \u2019s appeal was well - founded in that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ELAA provided that forfeited assets fell to GPE . Thus , forfeiture to the benefit of GPE under Article CARDINAL ) of LAW was not admissible .", "CARDINAL . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Extradition and Legal Assistance Act ( Auslieferungs- und Rechtshilfegesetz , ORG no . CARDINAL ) provides that the LAW applies where international or bilateral agreements do not provide otherwise .", "CARDINAL .
