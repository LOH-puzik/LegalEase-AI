The ORG \u2019s definition of forced labour comprises CARDINAL basic elements : the work or service is exacted under the menace of a penalty and it is undertaken involuntarily . The work of the ORG supervisory bodies has served to clarify both of these elements . The penalty does not need to be in the form of penal sanctions , but may also take the form of a loss of rights and privileges . Moreover , the menace of a penalty can take many different forms . Arguably , its most extreme form involves physical violence or restraint , or even death threats addressed to the victim or relatives . There can also be subtler forms of menace , sometimes of a psychological nature . Situations examined by the ORG have included threats to denounce victims to the police or immigration authorities when their employment status is illegal , or denunciation to village elders in the case of girls forced to prostitute themselves in distant cities . Other penalties can be of a financial nature , including economic penalties linked to debts . Employers sometimes also require workers to hand over their identity papers , and may use the threat of confiscation of these documents in order to exact forced labour .", "CARDINAL . As regards \u201c voluntary offer \u201d , the ORG supervisory bodies have touched on a range of aspects including : the form and subject matter of consent ; the role of external constraints or indirect coercion ; and the possibility of revoking freely - given consent . Here too , there can be many subtle forms of coercion . Many victims enter forced labour situations initially out of their own choice , albeit through fraud and deception , only to discover later that they are not free to withdraw their labour , owing to legal , physical or psychological coercion . Initial consent may be considered irrelevant when deception or fraud has been used to obtain it . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["4"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["4-1", "4-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["4"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["4-1", "4-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
