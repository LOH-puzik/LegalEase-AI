On DATE the public prosecutor for the district of GPE asked the psychiatric clinic of ORG ( PERSON ) to carry out a psychiatric assessment of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Doctor PERSON , a psychiatrist , issued his report . He found that the applicant had been suffering for DATE from chronic paranoid schizophrenia and had a drug addiction . He took the view that the offence had been directly related to his illness and drug abuse . He concluded that at the material time the applicant had not been criminally responsible for his actions . In view of the serious danger he represented for public safety , PERSON recommended his confinement .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG found , having regard to the evidence before it , that the applicant had killed his wife and that he had been totally lacking in criminal responsibility for his actions at the material time .

On DATE , at the request of the Probation and Sentence - enforcement Service of the GPE of GPE ( Bew\u00e4hrungs- und Vollzugsdienste des Kantons Z\u00fcrich ) , the applicant \u2019s mental health was examined by a head doctor and an assistant doctor of ORG of Rheinau ( Kantonale PERSON ) , who drew up a second psychiatric report .", "CARDINAL . The expert psychiatrists observed that the applicant had not encountered any particular difficulties in the custodial facility where he had been held since DATE . In the prison he had successively worked as a bookbinder , in the dispensary , as a gardener and lastly as a cook . The experts took note of the fact that , according to a psychological report of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant had not displayed any awareness of his illness and no capacity for introspection . As regards his mental health , the experts concluded that he was suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia and that in the \u201c not very stimulating \u201d atmosphere of the prison , \u201c the positive symptoms of the illness had become less noticeable \u201d , even though he \u201c still display[ed ] a delirious interpretation of the details of his offence \u201d . His situation had thus changed little since his psychiatric assessment in DATE . In view of the lack of treatment , the experts took the view that \u201c no indication c[ould ] be given as regards alternative arrangements for the enforcement of the measure or the possibility of discharge on probation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , ORG of GPE ( ORG ) refused the applicant \u2019s discharge on probation . The applicant challenged the decision of DATE before ORG of the Canton of GPE ( ORG ) , which dismissed his appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Psychiatry and Psychology Service of ORG issued an annual therapy report , signed by CARDINAL psychologists , CARDINAL of whom had treated the applicant . The report confirmed the findings of the psychiatric assessment carried out in DATE and indicated an unfavourable legal prognosis on account of the applicant \u2019s personality and the impossibility of treating his residual psychotic symptoms . The applicant continued , in particular , to deny that he was ill and refused to follow the medical treatment that had been prescribed for him . The psychologists concluded that the conditions for his discharge on probation were not satisfied . At the end of their report they indicated that they had discussed the report with the applicant and had given him a copy .", "CARDINAL . Refusal to discharge the applicant and the proceedings before the domestic courts", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing the applicant in person in an interview of DATE , ORG of GPE refused his discharge on probation .

Assisted by a lawyer , the applicant appealed to ORG and ORG of GPE , arguing that a fresh expert \u2019s assessment was necessary . He applied for legal aid . ORG and ORG dismissed his application in a decision of DATE . He was exempted from paying administrative costs , but was denied the free assistance of a lawyer , on the ground that his appeal was devoid of any prospect of success , as his discharge on probation had already been refused several times and there had been no change in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG the Canton of GPE . Once again , he submitted that the verification of the need for his confinement had to be based on a fresh psychiatric assessment by a neutral doctor . He also sought free legal assistance and requested a hearing , submitting as follows :", "\u201c It is is essential that the person concerned should have access to a court and the opportunity to be heard either in person or , where necessary , through some form of representation , failing which he [ can not be ] \u2018 afforded the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of PERSON ( ECtHR judgment PERSON v. the GPE , DATE , Series A , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "While the requirements of LAW ORG [ can be distinguished ] from those laid down in DATE , which applies to civil and criminal proceedings , this provision dictates , according to legal science , that sufficient safeguards be afforded in order to guarantee effective judicial supervision .", "Should a fresh expert \u2019s opinion not be ordered , it would at least be justified for the author of the report to give evidence at a hearing of the court and for [ the applicant ] to put questions to him .", "As already stated , NORP legal science guarantees in such cases an adversarial hearing and the examination of witnesses . It entails that a fresh expert \u2019s opinion may prove necessary in order to uphold the rights of the person confined . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal by a decision of DATE . It found that in view of the circumstances , the expert \u2019s report of DATE was still valid . The doubts expressed by the applicant concerning that report had already given rise to a final judgment of ORG DATE . Moreover , it was unnecessary for the expert to give evidence as he had already expressed his opinion clearly and comprehensively in his report . No new pertinent information could thus be expected of such a hearing . In addition , the applicant had not shown how his right of access to a court had actually been impaired . He had failed to indicate the reasons which led him to believe that ORG was not able to comply with the basic rules of procedure or to exercise sufficient supervision . Lastly , he had been denied legal assistance on the ground that his appeal appeared devoid of any prospect of success , CARDINAL appeals in the same case already having been dismissed without any change in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an administrative - law appeal with ORG . He reiterated the complaints he had submitted to ORG : the last expert \u2019s report was now DATE , and the therapy report was not a neutral assessment and was insufficient . In addition , given that various findings of the expert \u2019s report were based on misinterpretations it was necessary for a fresh expert \u2019s report to be drawn up or for the expert to give evidence with the possibility of cross - examination . The applicant was , moreover , entitled to the holding of a public and adversarial hearing . Lastly , the denial of legal assistance by the court below had impaired his right of access to a court . As the applicant was entitled to regular scrutiny of the lawfulness of his detention , the fact that he was appealing again against a refusal could not constitute a ground for refusing legal aid . The applicant also sought free legal assistance in the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It declared inadmissible the complaint concerning the lack of a public hearing , on the ground that no formal application to that effect had been lodged with the cantonal authorities . As regards the need for a fresh assessment by a neutral expert , it first noted that LAW did not require one , even though case - law had found it necessary in particular circumstances . In the present case , ORG found that a fresh psychiatric assessment was not necessary , because the initial diagnosis had been confirmed in subsequent therapy reports and \u201c no change c[ould ] be identified \u201d . It concluded that no other measure of sentence enforcement could be considered , with the result that the maintaining of the applicant \u2019s confinement was to be regarded as proportionate . As regards , lastly , the complaint about the refusal to grant the applicant legal aid , ORG first observed that he had been able to use the remedies available to him . It then noted that LAW required scrutiny of the lawfulness of detention only at reasonable intervals , and that such intervals were longer with regard to persons of unsound mind , where circumstances only changed in the medium term . The last decision to have been taken by a court in the present case dated from DATE . At the time of the DATE assessment by the prison administration in DATE , it had been found that the circumstances had clearly not changed since that decision . The appeal thus appeared to be devoid of any prospects of success . In ORG view , that constituted a legitimate ground on which to deny legal aid . In view of the foregoing , legal aid was also denied in respect of the proceedings before ORG itself .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
