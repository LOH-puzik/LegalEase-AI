What is of importance in the present case is the principle set out in the case of PERSON and not the differences in the details of the facts . The principle then that has been laid down in the case of PERSON is that LAW applies only to the sentence that is imposed and not to the manner of serving the sentence . LAW CARDINAL does not prohibit a retrospective change in the law or in practice concerning release or conditional release from prison of a prisoner .", "I am therefore of the view that the principle set out in GPE can be applied in the present case . Everything that the learned counsel of the applicant has pleaded has to do with the practice of release from prison . In the instant case ORG imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the applicant and explained to him at the same time that life imprisonment meant imprisonment for the remainder of his life . What the prison authorities then did , with the CARDINAL form , constitutes an action concerning the execution of the sentence . After the case of LAW on the basis of which the prison authorities gave the applicant the CARDINAL form , have ceased to apply , with the result that the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on the applicant by ORG is applicable . What happened was a change in the legal situation concerning the time of the applicant \u2019s release . As in the PERSON case , LAW is not applicable .", "...", "I endorse the principle set out in GPE . I consider that the applicant can not derive a right to judicial review on the basis of LAW because of the alleged change in the date of his release from prison which does not change the legal basis for his detention . It should be emphasised that his detention is founded on the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on him by ORG and this had been explained to him as \u2018 imprisonment for the remainder of his life\u2019 . It follows that the relevant suggestion by PERSON does not stand and is dismissed .", "On this occasion , I should add that the decision of the Commission on the issue of interpretation of LAW is in line with the jurisprudence of ORG ( see PERSON , Ooms and PERSON v. GPE ( \u2018 LOC cases ) DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) ...", "The fact that PERSON is a decision of the ORG does not render it less persuasive . It constitutes a decision of a specialised organ with vast experience in interpreting the LAW . It therefore constitutes an authority of great persuasiveness . I am satisfied about the correctness of the ORG \u2019s decision in GPE , which I have endorsed .", "It was further the suggestion of Mr PERSON that \u2018 this kind of sentence imposed on the applicant without the possibility of examination by ORG does not conform with LAW .", "...", "I endorse the above approach [ in GPE ] . Its essence is that the change in release policy does not constitute a violation of LAW . The existence or not of ORG does not form part of the ratio of the decision . This answers the suggestion of Mr PERSON concerning the absence of ORG in GPE . Consequently , his suggestion based on LAW does not stand and is dismissed .", "...", "Finally , I must note that the applicant has sought his release from prison through an order of habeas corpus . As stated , however , in the case of PERSON ( Civil Appeal no . DATE , DATE ) , adopting the relevant position of LANGUAGE jurisprudence ( see GPE \u2019s ORG , CARDINALth edition , Volume CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL ) :", "\u2018 In general the writ of habeas corpus will not be granted to persons convicted or in execution under legal process , including persons in execution of a legal sentence after conviction on indictment . The writ of habeas corpus will not be granted where the effect of it would be to review the judgment of CARDINAL of the superior courts which might have been reviewed on appeal or to question the decision of an inferior court or tribunal on a matter within its jurisdiction ; or where it would falsify the record of a court which shows jurisdiction on the face of it.\u2019", "Consequently , the granting of a habeas corpus order in the present case would have been tantamount to reviewing the sentence that had been imposed by ORG , whereas this could have been done in the context of an appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( appeal jurisdiction ) .", "CARDINAL . In his grounds of appeal , the applicant challenged the interpretation of the term \u201c life imprisonment \u201d made by ORG when sentencing him in DATE in view of the prison regulations applicable at the time and the notice given to the applicant by the prison authorities upon his admission to prison . He argued that the fact that he had not challenged his sentence following conviction could not be interpreted as an acceptance of ORG interpretation of the term \u201c life imprisonment . \u201d He relied upon , inter alia , LAW and DATE of the LAW in relation to the lawfulness of his continuing detention .", "CARDINAL . As regards LAW , the applicant claimed that the conduct of the authorities had been contrary to this provision . In particular , ground CARDINAL of his appeal read as follows :", "\u201c The existence on the date on which the sentence was imposed on the convicted person of the ORG that defined a sentence of life imprisonment as being DATE , the issuing of the FCARDINAL notice , the admission that the applicant would have been released on DATE if the aforementioned ORG had been applicable and the sudden annulment of all the above constituted inhuman and degrading treatment .", "The Republic can not behave in this way towards the applicant \u2019s life without any consequences for anyone apart from the applicant , who had to live with this uncertainty .", "The aforementioned change of DATE imprisonment to imprisonment for life following an error by ORG and/or the Attorney - General of the Republic and/or the President of the Republic constitutes , without any fault on the applicant \u2019s part , inhuman and degrading treatment which , on account of its uncertainty , violates LAW .", "The aforementioned change from the imposed DATE imprisonment to a death sentence , which will take effect on an unknown date given the fact that there is no possibility of re - examining the matter , constitutes inhuman treatment contrary to LAW . Indeed , this becomes even more obvious , when one considers that the death penalty has already been abolished in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Concerning LAW , the applicant in ground CARDINAL of his appeal noted that he was not requesting judicial review of his sentence on account of a change in policy concerning DATE of his release but the examination of the lawfulness of his detention , given that even the prison authorities had admitted that he should have been released on DATE . In this connection , he complained of the lack of a mechanism to examine the lawfulness of his detention .", "CARDINAL . When challenging ORG ( first instance ) interpretation of LAW , the applicant distinguished his case from that of NORP v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , ORG and Reports CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , in that GPE related to the manner of application of the sentence in view of the change in the policy of the parole board whereas in his case the issue raised was that of a retrospective change of the law due to unconstitutionality and the increase of his sentence from DATE to life . In this connection , he emphasised that in GPE there was no parole board unlike in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It stated , inter alia :", "\u201c The appellant is essentially raising CARDINAL issue . And his learned counsel has acknowledged that judgment as to this [ issue ] will determine the conclusion ... We summarise the appellant \u2019s positions as set out in the grounds of appeal as explained .", "He does not invoke the ORG as an autonomous ground for his release , especially since ... they are not applicable any more . Furthermore , he does not suggest or attempt a review of ORG judgment , as was wrongly perceived at first instance . We are not going against , as he explained , ORG judgment but the ORG as a whole . The ORG were then applicable at that time and since ORG had not annulled them for being unconstitutional , we must conclude that it considered them valid . And since the law does not provide a definition of the term \u2018 life imprisonment\u2019 , it was an element of the regulation of the sentence provided . As Mr PERSON put it , the overall legal situation at the time of the imposition of the sentence , indicated that life imprisonment meant in essence DATE imprisonment . In addition , even if there was doubt , this had to be taken to the applicant \u2019s benefit . Hence , in view of this fact , there was no reason to lodge an appeal against ORG judgment especially since the applicant had been served with the FCARDINAL notice .", "...", "The suggestion of the appellant presumes that a judicial assessment of unconstitutionality , or , more precisely , that the ORG are ultra vires in relation to the law on the basis of which they were issued , brings about legislative change of whatever form . However , as has been decided ( see PERSON v. ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL A.A.D. CARDINAL , at CARDINAL and PERSON v. GPE , DATE ) , judicial assessment necessarily adjudicates retrospectively on the law or regulation and , as the principle of separation of powers dictates , it does not entail a legislative development . It is a fact , however , that this question , both at first instance and before us , has not been touched upon from this point of view so as to raise the issue of PERSON no . CARDINAL(CARDINAL)/CARDINAL .", "In any event ORG imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the appellant , expressly specifying that this meant imprisonment for the remainder of his life . This was the reason for which it did not examine the question of possible consecutiveness and the appellant \u2019s perception that it is inferred that ORG recognised the Regulations as valid is wrong . ORG essentially considered that the Regulations were not connected with the issue of the sentence envisaged for it did not consider that the then existent Regulations changed the fact that in accordance with the law , imprisonment for the remainder of the appellant \u2019s life was imposed .", "Was this approach wrong ? Did in reality the law , viewed as a whole , even in the light of the interpretation suggested by the appellant comparing LAW , envisage imprisonment for DATE ? We would say that the first - instance judgment was not wrong in finding that this situation corresponded to the one in the case of GPE . The principle applied , namely that LAW does not concern the enforcement of the sentence , which remains CARDINAL of life imprisonment , is not in question . The ORG were made on the basis of and for the purposes of ORG , whereas it is LAW that determines the sentence , in this case mandatory life imprisonment and no other .", "Nevertheless , and as Mr PERSON also agreed , we are not reviewing the correctness of the judgment of ORG . Such review does not fall within the [ court \u2019s ] jurisdiction in the context of a habeas corpus application .", "...", "The appellant is being detained on the basis of an ORG judgment after being sentenced to life imprisonment , determined as imprisonment for the remainder of his life . Thus , he is being detained on a lawful basis and his application for release was correctly rejected with the final observation that \u2018 the granting of a habeas corpus order in the present case would have been tantamount to reviewing the sentence that had been imposed by ORG , whereas this could have been done in the context of an NORP . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In the case of PERSON v. GPE ( ( DATE ) CARDINAL C.L.R.

The second , to vest competence in the legislature to fix such measure of punishment as mandatory in the exercise of its legislative power ...

They are not bound but may do so if they deem it appropriate . By necessary implication they may ordain any other fixed measure of punishment including , no doubt , a sentence of life imprisonment . ... Obviously the constitutional legislation singled out the crimes listed in LAW for exceptional treatment in view of their gravity and their repercussions on the well - being of society . In the case of premeditated murder what marks the gravity of the offence is the element of premeditation that necessarily renders the crime particularly heinous .

[ i]n support of his suggestion he referred to the case of NORP v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL All E.R. CARDINAL .", "... In contrast , PERSON argued that the ORG must order that the sentence imposed should be served after the one already being served by the accused because , on the basis of the Regulations of CARDINAL ( ORG , Part CARDINAL of CARDINAL ) , which were made by ORG and published in ORG after being put before ORG , the interpretation of the term \u2018 life imprisonment\u2019 is given as meaning \u2018 imprisonment for DATE . Regulation CARDINAL of these ORG provides that a person sentenced to life imprisonment may be granted remission of his sentence on the ground of good conduct and industry , not exceeding in total CARDINAL of this sentence . Therefore , Mr GPE continued , the sentence of life imprisonment has been determined at a period of DATE , or DATE if the convicted person demonstrates good conduct . Consequently , what Lord PERSON said in the case of R v. PERSON , on which counsel for the accused relied , does not apply . Mr PERSON also showed his concern , as Senior Counsel of the Republic , about the possible cases , such as the present one , where CARDINAL person commits many murders but is only given CARDINAL sentence of imprisonment for DATE or DATE .", "Our opinion is that neither Mr GPE nor PERSON is treating the legal issue correctly .", "...", "On the basis of everything said by Lord PERSON [ in the case of NORP v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL All E.R. CARDINAL ] , life imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the time for which the applicant is alive . Accordingly , and since a sentence of life imprisonment has been imposed on the accused , no other such sentence can follow . PERSON suggests , however , that the court must issue this order , for he is also basing himself on the Regulations of DATE and is concerned that , since these Regulations are in force , the accused may possibly be released in DATE and thus is not facing the danger of serving another prison sentence of QUANTITY or DATE , if the second sentence follows the first one .", "LAW CARDINAL of the LAW provides that a court may not impose a longer sentence than that provided for by the law at the time of the commission of the offence . LAW indeed provides that the sentence of life imprisonment is mandatory and the only sentence following conviction for premeditated murder . In our judgment , the sentence \u2018 imprisonment for life\u2019 means exactly what is stated by the simple NORP words , that is , imprisonment for the remainder of the biological existence of the convicted person . This interpretation was also given by ORG in the case of NORP v. PERSON ... As we have already stated , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW is the only provision prescribing the sentence of life imprisonment as mandatory , and this in the light of the provisions of LAW . LAW were drawn up on the basis of ORG PERSON . CARDINAL ) , which still applies on the basis of the provisions of the LAW even though it was enacted just when GPE became an NORP colony . The provisions of this law , however , have to be applied in such a way that they comply with the express provisions of LAW . We wonder whether these Regulations are not unconstitutional and whether the interpretation of the term \u2018 imprisonment for life\u2019 , which is encountered in the LAW and LAW , so as to mean \u2018 DATE , is arbitrary . We say \u2018 we wonder\u2019 since such an issue has not been raised before us and thus we have no right in this procedure to convey an opinion on this . Another observation that can be made , however , is the following : it appears that the drafters of the Regulations , even if they are valid , did not notice the special provision of LAW of the above PERSON ( PERSON . CARDINAL ) which concerns life prisoners and provides that they may be released on licence by a decision of the \u2018 PERSON , which may be revoked . The life sentence is specifically provided for in the above PERSON to last for life , along the lines of the LANGUAGE legal system . This is why Lord PERSON stated what we quoted above . Another issue that is raised , even for the purposes of academic debate , is to what extent a law or regulation can provide for the remission , suspension or commutation of a convicted person \u2019s sentence in view of the express provision of LAW which bestows this privilege on the President of the Republic with the concurrence of the Attorney - General .", "It has been established by judicial precedent that when the court imposes a sentence , it does not take into account regulations , even if they are applicable , that allow for the remission of the sentence when a convicted person displays good conduct . The Regulations of DATE were made in order to serve the purposes to which the court does not refer when passing the sentence , which is determined on the basis of the applicable legislation and LAW . It is therefore up to the competent authorities , when and if the matter is raised at the appropriate time , to take into account what we have mentioned above in the form of legal observations .

On DATE ORG ( first instance ) in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ruled that the Regulations were unconstitutional and ultra vires . The prisoner in that case had also been convicted of premeditated murder and sentenced to life imprisonment . He had submitted a habeas corpus application to ORG when he was not released on the date that had been given to him as a release date by the prison authorities . ORG dismissed his application and affirmed that the term \u201c life imprisonment \u201d under LAW meant imprisonment for the remainder of the life of the convicted person .

This would anyhow be contrary to the provisions of these CARDINAL sections of LAW since life imprisonment is mandatory for the crime of premeditated murder whereas for the purposes of section CARDINAL , where life imprisonment is a discretionary measure , the courts have the discretion to impose a sentence of a shorter period . A prison sentence for a period shorter than life imprisonment may comprise a sentence longer than imprisonment for DATE with which life imprisonment is equated on the basis of LAW of FAC .

The matter of the sentence of life imprisonment , in the light of the regime in force , is being discussed both by ORG and by the competent committee under the aegis of ORG , which also had the initiative in promoting the subject . The central component of this process now in progress is the regulating by law of life imprisonment in a way which will give the possibility to those serving life sentences of being released once they have served a significant part of their sentence and previously received the appropriate treatment and preparation . Reservations are expressed about whether such regulating is constitutional .", "CARDINAL . I am of the opinion that the regulating by law of the matter is permitted by LAW . It is not a procedure for granting a pardon but the regulating of the serving of a sentence which in no way conflicts with the prerogative of the President of the Republic to remit , commute or suspend a sentence by virtue of LAW . In accordance with the separation of powers , the regulating by law of the matter could include , in the case of the imposition by the courts of the sentence of life imprisonment , empowering the same court to fix a minimum term for the sentence which would be served obligatorily before examination of the possibility of the conditional release of the prisoner .

The following paragraphs contain a summary of the information provided by the Government in the context of the present proceedings as to the position under their domestic law concerning the operation and validity of the DATE and CARDINAL Regulations .", "CARDINAL . Prior to ORG judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) , the Regulations \u2013 in particular LAW and DATE \u2013 were understood by the executive and administrative authorities of the Republic , including ORG , as imposing a maximum period of DATE to be served by any person who had been sentenced to life imprisonment . Any prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment after the above Regulations came into force would , in practice , have had a period of DATE automatically deducted from the time to be served in prison by way of remission pursuant to LAW . DATE of remission could be deducted from this DATE period as a consequence of misconduct by the prisoner . It was understood by the LOC \u2019s executive and administrative authorities , including ORG , that a life prisoner \u2019s misconduct could not result in him being detained beyond the DATE point . In fact , because of the very limited number of life prisoners in GPE and the dates of their respective convictions , no life prisoner had ever reached the point in his sentence when these provisions were applied directly so as to lead to his release . The release of the CARDINAL life prisoners in DATE had been pursuant to LAW in the light of how the Regulations would have operated in their cases .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment in the case of PERSON , ORG declared Regulation CARDINAL to be unconstitutional and ultra vires in relation to the enabling primary legislation , namely FAC . Under NORP domestic law , the position was that in proceedings where the constitutionality of subsidiary legislation was raised by a party by way of collateral challenge , the court \u2019s judgment only took effect in relation to the particular subject matter of the proceedings . Thus , ORG judgment in the case of LAW , in which the constitutionality of LAW had been raised as a collateral issue to PERSON habeas corpus application , was only operative so as to determine the ongoing legality of his detention . It also followed from LAW that the above judgment did not operate so as to render LAW unconstitutional and invalid as against persons other than the parties to that case . In other words , it did not result in LAW being rendered invalid vis - \u00e0 - vis other individuals .", "CARDINAL . Because ORG judgment in PERSON had been binding on the parties to the case , including the executive and administrative authorities of GPE could not thereafter lawfully be applied by the above authorities . Nonetheless , the judgment could not be understood as having retrospective effect such as to impugn the validity of Regulation CARDINAL as it had been applied to other individuals affected by that Regulation . Therefore , the fact that Regulation CARDINAL was declared unconstitutional and ultra vires by ORG in DATE did not have retrospective effect such as to render the Regulation void ab initio for all purposes . It did not , for example , render unlawful any action taken pursuant to LAW between the date of its enactment and the judgment in Hadjisavvas . Accordingly , at the time of the applicant \u2019s offence in DATE or at the time he was sentenced in DATE , LAW could not have been void or without legal effect in respect of the applicant . After the Hadjisavvas judgment , however , the administrative and executive authorities of the Republic could not lawfully take action , in reliance on LAW , treating it as reducing a life sentence imposed by a court to a maximum of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment since this would have been inconsistent with the LAW as authoritatively interpreted by ORG in that judgment .", "DATE .
