He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Drugs use is prohibited in prisons in GPE . In DATE ORG carried out an anonymised survey in CARDINAL prisons , the results of which indicated that the prevalence of HIV was PERCENT , Hepatitis B was PERCENT and Hepatitis C was PERCENT . PERCENT of the prisoners surveyed had injected drugs at some stage , PERCENT of whom had injected whilst in prison . PERCENT of those who injected in prison shared equipment . The most recent ORG CARDINAL , DATE ) suggested that PERCENT of prisoners inject drugs while detained , acknowledging that there may however have been significant under - reporting due to the stigma attached to drugs use . ORG identify Hepatitis B and C and HIV as the most common serious viruses carried in the bloodstream . They can cause serious long - term health problems or be life - threatening . ORG considers Hepatitis C as being the certified cause of death in CARDINAL people per year and as contributing to a further CARDINAL deaths DATE from the complications of chronic liver disease . It has also identified the sharing of needles by intravenous drugs users as being responsible for PERCENT of cases of Hepatitis C DATE .", "Needle exchange programmes , whereby equipment is exchanged for sterile needles and syringes , are generally acknowledged as an important way of reducing the risk of infection from the sharing of needles and syringes . Reports suggest that once - only use of sterile needles and syringes is the most effective measure for preventing infections . There are also a number of studies suggesting that in practice disinfection of needles is less effective at preventing transmission . ORG statistics suggest that PERCENT of health authorities have needle exchange programmes available to the general public . In prisons there have never been needle exchange programmes .", "In DATE ORG recommended that disinfecting agents be made available to prison inmates in GPE and GPE as a measure to lessen the risks of spreading infections from shared use of drug injecting equipment . This recommendation was implemented but withdrawn after DATE due to health and safety concerns surrounding the tablets . DATE a pilot project was launched , involving CARDINAL prisons , which was evaluated by ORG in a detailed report . It concluded that there were real benefits from reintroducing disinfecting tablets and recommended that tablets be made available throughout prisons . On DATE Prison Service Instruction No . CARDINAL issued , introducing a scheme to make tablets available as from DATE . The scheme is currently being implemented and evaluated .", "Tablets have been available in NORP prisons DATE , in which jurisdiction a pilot needle exchange programme has been reported to have been recently initiated .", "The applicant is a prisoner . In DATE , he instructed solicitors as he was concerned that the provision of tablets instead of needle exchange programmes failed sufficiently to address the risks caused by the sharing of infected needles . Such risks were not confined to drugs users but also other prisoners or prison staff who could be accidentally infected .", "In correspondence with his solicitors , ORG acknowledged that tablets would only disinfect , not reach the clinical standards of sterilization . They stated that there was no plan to introduce a needle exchange programme . In correspondence with his solicitors , ORG explained that the introduction of tablets was a reasonable and proportionate response as Hepatitis B and C would be inactivated by several moderately potent disinfectants and stated the view that needle exchanges would increase drugs use and the number of needles in circulation . It was stated that it was not always possible to replicate health care provided in the community and that disinfecting tablets provided an effective way of cleaning needles and fell within the range and quality of health services to be provided to prisoners .", "On DATE , the applicant commenced judicial review proceedings arguing that the failure to introduce a trial of needle exchanges into LANGUAGE and NORP prisons violated ORG , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention . He did not specify whether he was himself an intravenous user of drugs , claiming that other prisoners and staff could be affected by the risks of needle sharing . Permission to pursue such proceedings was refused after consideration of the papers by ORG . The application was renewed orally and there was a full hearing before Mr Justice PERSON at which the applicant and the Secretary of ORG were represented by counsel .", "The Secretary of ORG relied on the following grounds :", "ORG was concerned not to increase drugs use and there was no safe way of injecting drugs ;", "drugs use was dropping in prison DATE this might in part be due to a lack of needles and a concern about infectious diseases ;", "needle exchanges would increase the number of syringes in prison ;", "the introduction of needle exchanges was to be kept under review .", "It was accepted that if a prisoner did inject drugs it was safer to use a new syringe rather than a disinfected syringe . Later , in the oral proceedings , counsel for the Secretary of ORG also alleged that syringes could be used as weapons .", "At the conclusion of argument , Mr Justice PERSON refused the applicant \u2019s renewed application for permission to apply for judicial review . He found that steps taken by the Secretary of ORG to protect the health of prisoners were not unreasonable , noting that providing syringes would remove CARDINAL of the disincentives to prisoners injecting themselves and that the effect of a decision to introduce a policy of distributing disinfecting tablets had yet to be assessed . He also found that the security considerations of managing a prison population in which people lived cheek by jowl meant that it was not realistic to assume that the same regime could apply as in the community . He found no issues arising under LAW .", "The applicant \u2019s legal representatives obtained new evidence which was submitted in the renewed application to ORG . This was a report dated DATE from the Addiction Development Officer of ORG which inter alia noted that rigorous evaluations in GPE and GPE consistently found that needle exchange programmes did not increase drugs use , drugs users or the amount of drugs in circulation ; that the provision of bleach was only a partial solution and its use often inadequate ; lower transmission rates of HIV and hepatitis had been found to result from needle exchange schemes which had been in operation in CARDINAL prisons in CARDINAL NORP countries for DATE , without any increase in drugs use , interference with drugs prevention strategies or attacks on either staff or prisoners . It was stated : \u201c ... it could be argued that the refusal to make sterile equipment available to prisoners is actually condoning the spread of HIV and ORG among prisoners and , indirectly , to the community at large . \u201d", "On DATE , ORG refused the renewed application for permission to apply for judicial review . It noted that it was far from clear on the facts of this case that LAW was engaged . On the assumption that it was , it was nonsense to suggest that the failure to attempt a trial of needle exchanges amounted to a violation of the positive right to life . The applicant himself had only argued for a trial period which was an indicator in itself that the overall benefits of such a policy had yet to be established . There was no satisfactory evidence as to the difference in the decreased risk to life inherent in a needle exchange programme as opposed to a disinfectant scheme . Also GPE was far from alone in refusing to introduce such programmes . It was satisfied that there remained a legitimate concern that a needle exchange programme might increase drugs use and the number of syringes in prison . While in the future the balance might tip in favour of needle exchange programmes this was not inevitable and ORG had put in place an effective and sensible policy of assessing such programmes and the results thereof . It was emphasised that the matter should be kept under review .", "ORG policy provides as follows :", "Standards : ORG ( DATE )", "\u201c To provide prisoners with access to the same range and quality of services as the general public receives from ORG . \u201d", "ORG has set out in its general standards the following approach to medical services in prison ( Chapter III Health Care Services in Prison ) :", "\u201c b. Equivalence of care", "i ) general medicine", "CARDINAL . A prison health care service should be able to provide medical treatment and nursing care , as well as appropriate diets , physiotherapy , rehabilitation or any other necessary special facility , in conditions comparable to those enjoyed by patients in the outside community . Provision in terms of medical , nursing and technical staff , as well as LOC , installations and equipment , should be geared accordingly .", "d. Preventive health care", "CARDINAL . The task of prison health care services should not be limited to treating sick patients . They should also be entrusted with responsibility for social and preventive medicine .", "... ii ) transmittable diseases", "CARDINAL . A prison health care service should ensure that information about transmittable diseases ( in particular hepatitis , AIDS , tuberculosis , dermatological infections ) is regularly circulated , both to prisoners and to prison staff . Where appropriate , medical control of those with whom a particular prisoner has regular contact ( fellow prisoners , prison staff , frequent visitors ) should be carried out . \u201d", "Rule CARDINAL of ORG", "\" Medical services in prison shall be organised in close relation with the general health administration of the community or nation . ...", "Prisoners shall have access to the health services available in the country without discrimination on the grounds of their legal situation . \"", "Drug use was common in prison , with most studies reporting prisoners who have used drugs as at PERCENT or greater . While it was true that some prisoners stopped injecting on entering prison , some continued : a DATE ORG report showed that PERCENT of the prison population injected while incarcerated . Elevated risks of HIV and ORG flowed from the prevalence of sharing needles , often home - made ( with additional risks of scarring , vein damage and other infections ) . HIV infection ran from a reported PERCENT in GPE to PERCENT in some prison populations in GPE . The vast majority of peer - reviewed studies put ORG infection at PERCENT of prison populations .", "Cleaning syringes with disinfectant such as bleach did not sufficiently reduce the risk of infection . Bleach was not fully effective in reducing ORG transmission . While repeated applications of bleach had been shown to eliminate HIV in syringes , field studies indicated users ( amongst those who bothered to avail themselves of available bleach ) had trouble following the instructions correctly and thus the method offered no , or little , protection .", "Needle exchange programmes ( NEPs ) had been acknowledged to be the most effective harm reduction method in the community , reducing infection substantially without increasing the initiation , duration or frequency of illicit drug use . NEPs had been in operation in prisons since DATE and now existed in CARDINAL prison within CARDINAL jurisdictions : GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . NEPs were also in development in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . The evidence and experience from the prison schemes showed that they reduced needle - sharing , reduced drug overdoses and led to a decrease in abscesses and injection - related injections and facilitated referral of users to treatment programmes . It had not been demonstrated that they resulted in an increase in drug consumption , increase in drug injection or in any incidents of intentional use of needles as weapons or accidental needle - stick injuries .", "HIV prevalence in drug injectors ( IDUs ) was PERCENT in GPE and GPE . PERCENT of ORG infections occurred in current IDUs and PERCENT in ex - IDUs as opposed to PERCENT in non - IDUs . Infection rates were substantially higher amongst the prison population than the general population . ORG identified NEPs as the key to preventing infections amongst IDUs in the community . This was also the established opinion of ORG . PERCENT of IDUs in GPE and GPE had accessed a needle exchange service . No such facilities were available in prisons . CARDINAL prisons appeared to be using disinfectant tablets , which were to be made available in all prisons during DATE . ORG nonetheless had the responsibility , under guidelines , to ensure that prisoners had access to health services broadly equivalent to those in the community . ORG did not consider that disinfectant tablets were an adequate response to risks of HIV and ORG transmission for the general public . There was strong evidence from around the world that NEPs in prison did not produce countervailing effects that could outweigh the benefits to prisoners . There had been no instances of needles being used as a weapon , nor any increase in drug use or injections . The only difference was that the possession of needles had ceased to be illegal . The fact that drugs use did drop on entry to prison was probably a consequence not of the absence of clean needles but of the fact that possession and use were illegal in prisons and that prisoners were closely supervised ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
