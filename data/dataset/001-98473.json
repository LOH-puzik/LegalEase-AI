In his report for DATE , the Commissioner noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

In my oversight work I am conscious of these concerns . However , I am as satisfied as I can be that the concerns are , in fact , unfounded . Interception of an individual 's communications can take place only after a Secretary of ORG has granted a warrant and the warrant can be granted on strictly limited grounds set out in LAW , essentially the interests of national security and the prevention or detection of serious crime . Of course , it would theoretically be possible to circumvent this procedure , but there are in place extensive safeguards to ensure that this can not happen , and it is an important part of my work to ensure that these are in place , and that they are observed . Furthermore , any attempt to get round the procedures which provide for legal interception would , by reason of the safeguards , involve a major conspiracy within the agency concerned which I believe would , for practical purposes , be impossible . I am as satisfied as it is possible to be that deliberate unlawful interception of communications of the citizen does not take place ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He said of the section CARDINAL safeguards :", "\u201c DATE . In addressing the safeguards contained within CARDINAL of RIPA , ORG developed a new set of internal compliance documentation for staff , together with an extensive training programme that covered staff responsibilities under both ORG and LAW . This compliance documentation was submitted to the Foreign Secretary who was satisfied that it described and governed the arrangements required under LAW . I have also been told it also constituted the written record of the arrangements required to be put in place by the Director , ORG , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the Intelligence Services Act DATE ( to ensure that no information is obtained or disclosed by ORG except so far as is necessary for its statutory functions ) . In discharging my functions under LAW ) , I examined the documentation and the processes which underpin it and satisfied myself that adequate arrangements existed for the discharge of ORG duties under LAW . Of course , ORG recognises that its compliance processes must evolve over time , particularly as they become more familiar with the intricacies of the new legislation and develop new working practices , and that the process of staff education remains a continuing one . To this end , ORG has developed further training programmes and is issuing revised compliance documentation as part of the ongoing process ( see also ... paragraph CARDINAL under Safeguards ) .", "CARDINAL . In advance of the coming into force of ORG , ORG approached me as to the warrants it would seek after that date and provided a detailed analysis as to how those warrants would be structured \u2013 this was helpful as it gave me an insight into how ORG saw the workings of ORG and permitted me to comment in advance . Since the commencement of ORG , in reviewing warrants I have looked carefully at the factors to be considered by the Secretary of ORG when determining whether to issue an interception warrant , and especially the new requirement to consider ' proportionality ' under section [ CARDINAL ) ] of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Again , he commented on the diligence of the authorities in carrying out their duties under LAW :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG lay a duty on the Secretary of ORG to ensure that arrangements are in force as safeguards in relation to dissemination , disclosure , copying , storage , and destruction etc . , of intercepted material . These sections require careful and detailed safeguards to be drafted by each of the agencies referred to earlier in this ORG and for those safeguards to be approved by the Secretary of ORG . This had been done . I have been impressed by the care with which these documents have been drawn up , reviewed and updated in the light of technical and administrative developments . Those involved in the interception process are aware of the invasive nature of this technique , and care is taken to ensure that intrusions of privacy are kept to the minimum . There is another incentive to agencies to ensure that these documents remain effective in that the value of interception would be greatly diminished as a covert intelligence tool should its existence and methodology become too widely known . The sections CARDINAL and QUANTITY requirements are very important . I am satisfied that the agencies are operating effectively within their safeguards . \u201d", "DATE .

This is provided for by LAW . I must be diligent to ensure that this does not happen , and alert to ensure that there are systems in place so that this does not and can not happen . Over the long period that I have held my present post , I have found no evidence whatsoever of any desire within the ORG or the Law Enforcement Agencies in this field to act wrongfully or unlawfully . On the contrary , I have found a palpable desire on the part of all these GPE to ensure that they do act completely within the CARDINAL walls of the law . To this end , they welcome the oversight of the Commissioner and over DATE have frequently sought my advice on issues that have arisen , and they have invariably accepted it . In any event , I believe that the legislation together with the safeguards and ORG that are in place make it technically virtually impossible to deliberately intercept a citizen 's communications unlawfully with intent to avoid legal requirements .", "( b ) To assist the Agencies to do the work entrusted to them and , bearing in mind the number of organisations that I am now required to oversee , this occurs quite frequently .

It is clear to me that each of them gives a substantial amount of time and takes considerable care to satisfy himself or herself that warrants are necessary for the authorised purposes , and that what is proposed is proportionate . If the Secretary of ORG wishes to have further information in order to be satisfied that he or she should grant the warrant then it is requested and given . Outright and final refusal of an application is comparatively rare , because the requesting agencies and the senior officials in the Secretary of ORG 's ORG scrutinise the applications with care before they are submitted for approval . However , the Secretary of ORG may refuse to grant the warrant if he or she considers , for example , that the strict requirements of necessity or proportionality are not met , and the agencies are well aware that the Secretary of ORG does not act as a ' rubber stamp ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In its joint ruling on preliminary issues of law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG clarified a number of aspects of its procedure . The ORG sat , for the first time , in public . As regards the ORG procedures and the importance of the cases before it , the ORG noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The challenge to rule ORG ) [ requiring oral hearings to be held in private ] and to most of the other rules governing the basic procedures of the ORG have made this the most significant case ever to come before the ORG . The ORG are left in no doubt that their rulings on the legal issues formulated by the parties have potentially important consequences for dealing with and determining these and future proceedings and complaints .

Specifically on the applicability of LAW to the proceedings before it , the ORG found :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The conclusion of the ORG is that LAW applies to a person 's claims under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) and to his complaints under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of ORG , as each of them involves ' the determination of his civil rights ' by the ORG within the meaning of Article CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After a review of the ORG 's case - law on the existence of a \u201c civil right \u201d , the ORG explained the reasons for its conclusions :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG agree with the Respondents that there is a sense in which the claims and complaints brought by virtue of s CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG fall within the area of public law . They arise out of the alleged exercise of very wide discretionary , investigatory , state powers by public authorities , such as the intelligence and security agencies and the police . They are concerned with matters of national security , of public order , safety and welfare . The function of the ORG is to investigate and review the lawfulness of the exercise of such powers . This is no doubt intended to ensure that the authorities comply with their relevant public law duties , such as by obtaining appropriate warrants and authorisations to carry out interception and surveillance .", "CARDINAL . The public law element is reinforced by the directions to the ORG in sections ORG ) and CARDINAL ) of ORG to apply to the determinations the same principles as would be applied by a court in judicial review proceedings . Such proceedings are concerned with the procedural and substantive legality of decisions and actions of public authorities .", "CARDINAL . The fact that activities , such as interception of communications and surveillance , may also impact on the Convention rights of individuals , such as the right to respect for private life and communications in DATE , does not of itself necessarily mean that the ORG make determinations of civil rights ...", "CARDINAL . Further , the power of the ORG to make an award of compensation does not necessarily demonstrate that the ORG determine civil rights ...", "CARDINAL . Applying the approach in the GPE cases that account should be taken of the content of the rights in question and of the effect of the relevant decision on them ... , the ORG conclude that the public law or public order aspects of the claims and complaints to the ORG do not predominate and are not decisive of the juristic character of the determinations of the ORG . Those determinations have a sufficiently decisive impact on the private law rights of individuals and organisations to attract the application of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The jurisdiction of the ORG is invoked by the initiation of claims and complaints by persons wishing to protect , and to obtain redress for alleged infringements of , their underlying rights of confidentiality and of privacy for person , property and communications . There is a broad measure of protection for such rights in LANGUAGE private law in the torts of trespass to person and property , in the tort of nuisance , in the tort of misfeasance in a public office , in the statutory protection from harassment and in the developing equitable doctrine of breach of confidence ...", "CARDINAL . Since DATE there has been added statutory protection for invasion of Article CARDINAL rights by public authorities . This follows from the duties imposed on public authorities by section CARDINAL and the rights conferred on victims by section CARDINAL of the [ LAW ] . The concept of ' civil rights and obligations ' is a fair and reasonable description of those common law and statutory rights and obligations , which form the legal foundation of a person 's right to bring claims and make complaints by virtue of CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The fact that the alleged infringements of those rights is by public authorities in purported discretionary exercise of administrative investigatory powers does not detract from the ' civil ' nature of the rights and obligations in issue ...", "...", "CARDINAL . For all practical purposes the ORG is also the only forum for the effective investigation and determination of complaints and for granting redress for them where appropriate ...", "CARDINAL . In brief , viewing the concept of determination of ' civil rights ' in the round and in the light of the GPE decisions , the ORG conclude that ORG , which puts all interception , surveillance and similar intelligence gathering powers on a statutory footing , confers , as part of that special framework , additional ' civil rights ' on persons affected by the unlawful exercise of those powers . It does so by establishing a single specialised ORG for the judicial determination and redress of grievances arising from the unlawful use of investigatory powers . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the proper construction of Rule CARDINAL regarding oral hearings , the ORG found :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The language of rule CARDINAL ) is clear :", "' The ORG shall be under no duty to hold oral hearings but may do so in accordance with this rule ( and not otherwise ) . '", "CARDINAL . Oral hearings are in the discretion of the ORG . They do not have to hold them , but they may , if they so wish , do so in accordance with Rule CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG should explain that , contrary to the views apparently held by the ORG ' advisers , the discretion in rule ORG ) neither expressly nor impliedly precludes the ORG from exercising their general discretion under rule ORG ) to hold inter partes oral hearings . It is accepted by the Respondents that the ORG may , in their discretion , direct joint or collective oral hearings to take place . That discretion was in fact exercised in relation to this very hearing . The exercise of discretion must take into account the relevant provisions of other rules , in particular the ORG 's general duty under rule CARDINAL ) to prevent the potentially harmful disclosure of sensitive information in the carrying out of their functions . As already explained , this hearing has neither required nor involved the disclosure of any such information or documents emanating from the Complainants , the Respondents or anyone else . The hearing has only been concerned with undiluted legal argument about the procedure of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG have reached the conclusion that the absence from the Rules of an absolute right to either an inter partes oral hearing , or , failing that , to a separate oral hearing in every case is within the rule - making power in section CARDINAL ) . It is also compatible with the Convention rights under LAW . Oral hearings involving evidence or a consideration of the substantive merits of a claim or complaint run the risk of breaching the [ neither confirm nor deny ] policy or other aspects of national security and the public interest . It is necessary to provide safeguards against that . The conferring of a discretion on the ORG to decide when there should be oral hearings and what form they should take is a proportionate response to the need for safeguards , against which the tribunal , as a judicial body , can balance the ORG ' interests in a fair trial and open justice according to the circumstances of the particular case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Regarding Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) which stipulates that oral hearings must be held in private , the ORG held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The language of rule CARDINAL ) is clear and unqualified .", "' The ORG 's proceedings , including any oral hearings , shall be conducted in private . '", "CARDINAL . The ORG are given no discretion in the matter . Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) stiffens the strictness of the rule by providing that the ORG may not even disclose to the Complainant or to any other person the fact that the ORG have held , or propose to hold , a separate oral hearing under rule ORG ) . The fact of an oral hearing is kept private , even from the other party ...", "...", "CARDINAL . ... the very fact that this rule is of an absolute blanket nature is , in the judgment of the ORG in the circumstances , fatal to its validity ... the ORG have concluded that the very width of the rule preventing any hearing of the proceedings in public goes beyond what is authorised by LAW .", "...", "CARDINAL . There is no conceivable ground for requiring legal arguments on pure points of procedural law , arising on the interpretation and validity of the Rules , to be held in private ...", "CARDINAL . Indeed , purely legal arguments , conducted for the sole purpose of ascertaining what is the law and not involving the risk of disclosure of any sensitive information , should be heard in public . The public , as well as the parties , has a right to know that there is a dispute about the interpretation and validity of the relevant law and what the rival legal contentions are .", "CARDINAL . The result is that rule ORG ) is ultra vires section CARDINAL . It does not bind the ORG . The Secretary of ORG may exercise his discretion under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) to make fresh rules on the point , but , unless and until he does , the ORG may exercise their discretion under section CARDINAL ) to hear the legal arguments in public under rule CARDINAL ) , subject to their general and specific duties , such as rule CARDINAL ) in the Rules and in ORG . It is appropriate to exercise that discretion to direct that the hearing of the preliminary issues shall be treated as if it had taken place under rule CARDINAL ) in public , because such a preliminary hearing of purely legal arguments solely on procedural issues does not pose any risk to the duty of the ORG under rule CARDINAL ) or to the maintenance of the [ neither confirm nor deny ] policy . The transcripts of the hearing should be made available for public consumption . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Regarding other departures from the normal rules of adversarial procedure as regards the taking of evidence and disclosure in Rule CARDINAL , the ORG concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... that these departures from the adversarial model are within the power conferred on the Secretary of ORG by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , as limited by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . A reasonable rule - making body , having regard to the mandatory factors in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , could properly conclude that these departures were necessary and proportionate for the purposes stated in LAW ) . In the context of the factors set out in that provision and , in particular , the need to maintain the [ neither confirm nor deny ] policy , the procedures laid down in the Rules provide a ' fair trial ' within Article CARDINAL for the determination of the civil rights and obligations arising in claims and complaints under section CARDINAL of RIPA .", "CARDINAL . They are also compatible with Convention rights in Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL , taking account of the exceptions for the public interest and national security in Articles CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ORG ) , in particular the effective operation of the legitimate policy of [ neither confirm nor deny ] in relation to the use of investigatory powers . The disclosure of information is not an absolute right where there are competing interests , such as national security considerations , and it may be necessary to withhold information for that reason , provided that , as in the kind of cases coming before this ORG , it is strictly necessary to do so and the restriction is counterbalanced by judicial procedures which protect the interests of the Complainants ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , as regards the absence of reasons following a decision that the complaint is unsuccessful , the ORG noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
