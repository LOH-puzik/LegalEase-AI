Mr PERSON appealed to ORG of GPE , ORG , against the decision which ORG had given on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , as did CARDINAL other recipients of similar decisions .", "CARDINAL . The complaints and arguments were essentially the same in both cases . The appellants argued that CARDINAL and ORG and LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL offered them the choice to opt out of the social - security regime of their home country . In the alternative , they argued that the absence of such a choice violated LAW CARDINAL , or both , of LAW establishing ORG ; in the further alternative , they argued that the method used to calculate the country of residence correction factor was flawed .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decisions on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In Mr Ramaer \u2019s case , it held that LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL provided a conflict rule , not an option . LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL did not suggest otherwise ; moreover , the latter regulation related to the application of Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL . There was no violation of LAW establishing ORG : since the appellants were not put at a disadvantage as compared to those already employed or self - employed in the member GPE concerned , and since the appellants were not made to pay contributions without any corresponding entitlements , and since , moreover , their contributions were subject to a country of residence correction factor , there was no interference with the right to freedom of movement . Finally , the situation was not the same as that which the provisional measures judge of ORG of The Hague had considered in the judgment of DATE : not only were the applicants foreign residents , from which it followed that they were not in a relevantly similar situation to GPE residents and therefore subject to different health care regimes , but country - specific country of residence correction factors had been introduced which removed any equal treatment of fundamentally unequal cases . The calculation of the country of residence correction factors was not arbitrary ; the GPE legislature had remained within its margin of appreciation in its choice of method .", "CARDINAL . In Mr PERSON \u2019s case , it held that primary responsibility for implementing the legislation in question was vested in ORG rather than ORG which had little power of decision in the matter . As for the merits , it confined itself to referring to the decision in the case of PERSON , which it appended to the decision in Mr PERSON \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants appealed , together with their fellow appellants , to ORG ( ORG ) against the decisions of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Act on proceedings concerning the withholding of contributions from treaty beneficiaries ( GPE rechtsgang bronheffing verdragsgerechtigden ) entered into force . Its effect , as relevant to the present case , was to substitute ORG for ORG as the defendant in the proceedings brought by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision noting that an entitlement to health care in the country of residence under LAW and CARDINALa of Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL arose only if the person concerned had registered with the competent authority in accordance with LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL . This the person could refuse to do , which raised the question whether in case of such refusal LAW could be construed as nonetheless justifying the deduction of contributions from their pension . At the same time , although since the introduction of the country of residence correction factor there appeared no longer to be any disadvantage preventing pensioners from settling in other ORG member GPE , the applicants and their fellow appellants were in a dissimilar position in that they had already been resident in other ORG member GPE while the former system was still in existence and they alleged that they were faced with higher costs for health care allegedly of a lower standard . This might affect freedom of movement and residence , protected by ORG DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW establishing ORG ( as in force at the time ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG therefore addressed a request for a preliminary ruling under LAW establishing ORG to ORG of ORG in the following terms :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Should Articles CARDINAL , CARDINALa and CARDINAL of Regulation No CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the provisions of point CARDINAL ) and ( b ) of section R of ORG Regulation No CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and LAW No CARDINAL/CARDINAL be interpreted as meaning that a national provision such as LAW ] is incompatible therewith , in so far as a pensioner who in principle has entitlements under LAW and CARDINALa of Regulation No CARDINAL/CARDINAL is obliged to report to the [ ORG ] and a contribution must be deducted from that person \u2019s pension even if no registration has taken place under LAW No CARDINAL/CARDINAL ?", "CARDINAL .

ORG of ORG gave its preliminary ruling ( case C\u2013CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON , ORG , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON v. College voor Zorgverzekeringen ) on DATE . It was in the following terms :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL , CARDINALa and DATE of Council Regulation ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE on the application of social security schemes to employed persons , to self - employed persons and to members of their families moving within the ORG , as amended by ORG ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG and of ORG DATE , in conjunction with LAW ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE laying down the procedure for implementing ORG ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the application of social security schemes to employed persons , to self - employed persons and to members of their families moving within the ORG , as amended by ORG ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , must be interpreted as not precluding legislation of a Member ORG , such as that at issue in the main proceedings , under which recipients of pensions payable under the legislation of that ORG who reside in another Member ORG in which they are entitled under LAW and CARDINALa of Regulation No CARDINAL/CARDINAL to the sickness benefits in kind provided by the competent institution of the latter Member ORG must pay , in the form of a deduction from their pension , a contribution in respect of those benefits even if they are not registered with the competent institution of their Member State of residence .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL TFEU [ i.e. LAW on the Functioning of ORG ] must be interpreted as not precluding legislation of a Member State , such as that at issue in the main proceedings , under which recipients of pensions payable under the legislation of that ORG who reside in another Member ORG in which they are entitled under LAW and CARDINALa of Regulation No CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as amended by Regulation No DATE , to the sickness benefits in kind provided by the competent institution of the latter Member State must pay , in the form of a deduction from their pension , a contribution in respect of those benefits even if they are not registered with the competent institution of their Member State of residence .", "On the other hand , LAW must be interpreted as precluding such national legislation in so far as it induces or provides for \u2013 this being for the national court to ascertain \u2013 an unjustified difference of treatment between residents and non - residents as regards ensuring the continuity of the overall protection against the risk of sickness enjoyed by them under insurance contracts concluded before the entry into force of that legislation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG gave separate final decisions ( in Mr Ramaer \u2019s case : PERSON ( ORG , ORG BUCARDINAL ; in Mr PERSON \u2019s case : PERSON ) on DATE . The reasoning in the ORG cases was identical and extensive . It may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In view of ORG of ORG answer to the first question , ORG found that a right to opt out of the withholding of contributions under LAW of ORG did not exist .", "CARDINAL . In view of the answer to the second question , it found that withholding contributions under LAW of ORG did not in itself impede ORG citizens\u2019 freedom of movement .", "CARDINAL . This left ORG having to ascertain \u201c whether an unjustified difference of treatment between residents and non - residents as regards ensuring the continuity of the overall protection against the risk of sickness enjoyed by them under insurance contracts concluded before the entry into force of that legislation \u201d existed , given that the applicants had been insured privately on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that provision had been made for a statutory transitional arrangement on the basis of which private insurance contracts of residents and non - residents partially lapsed ex lege , in comparable fashion , it being intended that for both groups basic cover as it existed before DATE should continue to exist . There was in fact no disagreement on this point . However , for reasons of practicability , further arrangements had been necessary between the insurance companies and the persons concerned as to the remaining part of the insurance contract or any new complementary insurance contract . This had effectively compelled any persons concerned who wished to retain complementary cover of their medical expenses in addition to the statutory basic system after DATE to take out new complementary insurance . This , however , applied equally to residents and non - residents . In this respect , therefore , there was no difference in treatment between residents and non - residents .", "CARDINAL . It then found that private insurers were under no unconditional duty to offer insurance ( acceptatieplicht ) complementary to basic cover . Pursuant to the statutory unconditional duty to offer insurance , basic cover for health care was secured to residents based on ORG . Non - resident treaty beneficiaries were entitled ex lege to health care in their country of residence in accordance with the basic health care regime of that country ( woonlandpakket ) . To that extent it could not be said that residents were treated more favourably than non - residents . Given that there was no statutory duty to offer complementary insurance either as regards residents or as regards non - residents , there was no difference in treatment in that respect either . It was also relevant within the framework of transitional law that a statutory duty to offer insurance was in fact contained in section CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL of ORG ( Introduction and LAW ( Invoerings- en aanpassingswet PERSON ) , which applied to both residents and non - residents . Existing insurance contracts were only terminated ex lege in so far as they coincided with the GPE basic insurance regime and the basic health care regime of the country of residence , respectively . They continued to exist for the remainder . It followed that even if a further contract or new complementary contract was entered into , the insurer could not reject any person concerned who was insured on DATE for that part of the contract which was not terminated ex lege . In this , transitional law was actually more favourable than the new system per se .", "CARDINAL . Nor could it be found that an ( unjustified ) difference in treatment between residents and non - residents had been caused by ORG through means other than legislation . In addition to studying the drafting history of the new legislation and parliamentary discussions , ORG had held a hearing at which it had heard officials of ORG ( PERSON , ORG ) who had actually been involved in determining the ( legal ) position of resident and non - resident treaty beneficiaries and in the contacts and negotiations with GPE insurance companies . From the information given it had emerged that the Minister for ORG had in fact been concerned to secure for non - resident treaty beneficiaries insurance cover comparable to that which they enjoyed before DATE on reasonable conditions . To that end , the Minister for ORG had entered into administrative agreements , through the umbrella organisation ( koepelorganisatie ) ORG ( Zorgverzekeraars GPE ) , with the public health care funds and the private insurers to make all their insured clients an offer that was comprehensive and non - selective ( i.e. without risk selection ) for health care insurance plus complementary insurance . It was not possible for the Minister for ORG to compel the insurers to make an offer for complementary insurance on definite , fixed - tariff conditions . Such intrusive involvement with complementary insurance would have run counter to ORG directives on non - life insurance ( schadeverzekeringen ) ( Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC , Official Journal DATE , LCARDINAL.CARDINAL ; Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC , Official Journal DATE , LCARDINAL/CARDINAL ; and Directive CARDINAL , Official Journal DATE , ORG ; as since amended ) , which did not admit of a legislative system in which provision was made for the approval of tariffs for health care insurance other than basic health care insurance .", "CARDINAL . The legislature had thus designed a transitional arrangement aiming to preserve as far as possible the global cover which residents and non - resident treaty beneficiaries alike enjoyed before the entry into force of ORG under their GPE private insurance . Despite the statutory arrangement , under which only part of the contract was terminated , it had in actual fact often been necessary , for practical reasons , to conclude new contracts . For residents these contracts related to the statutory basic insurance and CARDINAL or more complementary insurance contracts in addition to that basic insurance , and for treaty beneficiaries , to CARDINAL or more complementary insurance contracts in addition to the basic health care regime of the country of residence . It had been necessary in order to facilitate this process to reach administrative agreements with health care insurers . These had indicated that they could hardly be expected to design cost - effective insurance for ORG or treaty country to meet the wishes of an often relatively small number of insured GPE nationals per country concerned . Although many insurers had in fact made reasonable offers , the fact remained that the numbers of persons requiring complementary insurance as treaty beneficiaries had decreased , and with them the financial base for the insurance . In addition , it could not be ruled out that insurance cover in the respective countries of residence was not up to GPE standards . That , however , was inherent in the new system , which ORG of ORG had found was not in itself contrary to ORG law .", "CARDINAL . It could not be ruled out that the insurers might in some cases not have complied , as regards non - resident treaty beneficiaries , with the unconditional duty , set forth in section CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL of ORG ( Introduction and LAW , to accept them as clients . Nor could it be ruled out that insurers might in some cases have applied a risk selection on grounds of age and health to treaty beneficiaries , in the sense that terms and conditions for renewal of complementary insurance might have turned out ( considerably ) less favourable than those of the original contract . That said , ORG had not been made aware of a demonstrable difference in treatment between residents and non - residents caused by ORG and implemented with their connivance by insurance companies based in the GPE . Besides the fact that such a difference had not been laid down in the statutory arrangement , there was no appearance either of a \u2018 political\u2019 agreement that had formed the basis for the practice of insurance companies in offering insurance or setting tariffs as regards complementary contracts with non - residents . Rather , the procedure followed suggested the opposite . It did not follow from the possibility that in retrospect there might have been a certain measure of administrative naivet\u00e9 ( bestuurlijke na\u00efviteit ) that any premeditated intention of ORG unjustifiably to treat residents and non - resident treaty beneficiaries differently could be found established .", "CARDINAL . ORG was not unaware that , in those cases where the basic insurance regime in the country of residence offered lesser cover than the GPE basic package , a reduction of the base of persons insured and thus the financial base of the insurance coupled with the disappearance of the solidarity levy ( solidariteitstoeslag ) provided for in ORG for basic insurance might to that extent have had the effect of raising premiums for complementary insurance . This was , however , inherent in the system introduced with effect from DATE , which ORG of ORG had not considered in itself contrary to Community law , in which the position of residents and non - residents was not the same , and for that reason alone did not constitute an unjustified difference in treatment of residence in relation to non - residents by which freedom of movement of ORG citizens is restricted .", "CARDINAL . The LAW establishing ORG , as in force until DATE , included the following provisions :", "CARDINAL . Every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member GPE , subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in this LAW and by the measures adopted to give it effect .", "CARDINAL . NORP If action by the ORG should prove necessary to attain this objective and LAW has not provided the necessary powers , the ORG may adopt provisions with a view to facilitating the exercise of the rights referred to in paragraph CARDINAL . ...", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL ) :", "\" I Introduction and summary", "The aims of the Bill : Greater efficiency , less central direction , good accessibility", "By means of the bill for ORG wish to put an end , starting from DATE , to the present incoherent situation ( verbrokkelde situatie ) by realising CARDINAL statutory insurance regime for all GPE residents . This net insurance regime should contribute as much as possible to effective and high - quality health care . The change in the system of health care insurance to be enacted by ORG is not isolated , but is part of a wider oriented revision of the direction ( sturing ) and division of responsibilities in the health care field .", "...", "Greater freedom of choice and responsibility for insured persons", "The new ORG will offer every resident the possibility to enter into a contract of insurance with the health care insurer of his choice . ORG within the system is expressed in obligatory insurance ( verzekeringsplicht ) for the citizens and an unconditional duty to offer insurance for the health care insurers . Health care insurers have the duty to offer health care insurance to everyone , regardless of personal characteristics , on the same terms . The law shall indicate what forms of health care are covered by health care insurance .", "...", "In conclusion", "Against the background of the reforms in the health care system in DATE ( such as the introduction of commercial competition in health care insurance and the introduction of solidarity levies in private insurance ) the Government consider the statutory regulation of the new health care insurance a logical and necessary follow - up rather than a breach with the past . In view of the private elements which continue to characterise both public and private health care insurance ( zowel de ziekenfondsverzekering als de particuliere verzekeringen ) the Government make a deliberate choice for a private - law structure of health care insurance . It is important in this respect that ORG takes it to be self - evident that the freedom of the member GPE of ORG to organise their social - security systems as they see fit also implies the freedom to leave cover of the insurance risk to private insurance enterprises . Demands can be made on these enterprises in the public interest . In this bill , space for private initiative and entrepreneurship goes hand in hand with strong public preconditions . In this way the social tradition of the public health care funds and the market tradition of private insurance can be brought together . Both public health care funds and private health care insurers can transform into insurance companies which carry out ORG . In this way continuity in the functioning of the health care system is sufficiently ensured . All insured persons will be brought under the umbrella of the NORP social insurance regulation . Insured persons who are resident or staying abroad can enjoy medical health care there paid for by GPE insurance .", "...", "ORG - border health care", "The entry into force of ORG will draw the entire population into a social health care insurance . This will put an end to the GPE position , which is unique in LOC , in which MONEY of the population is forced to take out private insurance on the free market . ORG will be reported to ORG as a social security scheme within the meaning of ORG ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . From this it may follow that persons resident outside the GPE may become subject to GPE social security legislation and therefore find themselves obliged to take out health care insurance . These persons will owe premium pursuant to the GPE legislation .", "There is also a category of persons who do not reside in the GPE , but who , being entitled to a GPE pension , are entitled to health care at the expense of the GPE as the consequence of the application of the NORP social security regulation [ i.e. Council Regulation ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] or a social insurance treaty in the country of residence . As against this treaty - based right to care , the international arrangements concerned provide that the ORG which bears the expense of medical care may charge premium therefor . The statutory base for thus charging premium is set out in the bill . It is intended to set a nominal premium for this category , based on the average premium charged in the GPE . The income - dependent contribution will be levied the same way as is done in the case of persons resident in the GPE .", "ORG ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and the social security treaties entered into by the GPE provide that the medical care to which a person is entitled pursuant to the ORG or a treaty shall be provided in accordance with the rules in force under the social health care legislation of the country where the care is provided . Accordingly , a GPE insured person resident or staying in , for example , GPE will receive medical care from the NORP social health care insurance in accordance with NORP legislation . The cost of such care will be borne by the GPE health care insurance . For those formerly insured by public health care funds this is a familiar phenomenon , for those formerly insured privately this is a new situation .", "It will be provided for persons resident abroad and entitled to health care at the expense of the GPE based on a social insurance treaty entered into by the GPE with another country or on ORG ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL that they must register with ORG . ORG will then see to the reimbursement of the expenses which that other country incurs in providing medical care to the person concerned . This situation differs from the present situation in public health care insurance , in which the persons concerned are obliged to register with a specific public health care fund . Because such an indication in the new situation of ORG can be seen as a disturbance of market relations and a health care insurer can not influence health care use and the expenses involved in the other country , a choice has been made for registration with ORG . In this way , a \u2018 market neutral\u2019 solution has been found , in which , as regards the premium which the persons concerned must pay , the profit component need not be taken into account .
