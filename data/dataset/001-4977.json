{"ITEMID": "001-4977", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "POL", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "TROJANOWSKI AND ROGOSZ v. POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are NORP citizens , born in DATE and DATE respectively and living in GPE , GPE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , on the basis of a licence issued by ORG , the applicants founded a company specialising in the protection of property .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicants of CARDINAL count of misappropriation and sentenced them to DATE imprisonment and a fine of QUANTITY ( old ) NORP zlotys , with DATE of imprisonment in default , and conditionally stayed enforcement of this sentence for DATE . The court further discontinued criminal proceedings concerning a charge of attempted misappropriation . Finally , the court imposed on the applicants an order prohibiting them from running , for DATE , the property protection business .", "The court found that the applicants had first assisted the PERSON brothers in assigning to a certain GPE the ORG claim against ORG , which allegedly arose out of a civil law contract but CARDINAL which had not been certified by any judicial decision . Subsequently , they had obtained from ORG an authorisation to secure realisation of this claim against GPE On DATE they went to a warehouse located in S. , owned by ORG , and stated that they wished to purchase a substantial amount of merchandise . After they had chosen the merchandise , the seller asked them what form of payment they propose . When she was informed that they did not propose to pay because their intention was to set off the claim which ORG had acquired against GPE against the price due for the merchandise , the seller called the police . After the police arrived and told the applicants that they should have recourse to civil proceedings , they left the warehouse . They subsequently went to CARDINAL other shops owned by GPE , located in GPE , where they declared their intention to buy certain merchandise and , after it had been loaded on their van , they again refused to pay for it , stating that the payment due would be set off against the claim ORG had against GPE", "The court noted that there had been no dispute as to the facts . The accused had not called in question the facts as established on the basis of testimony given by the witnesses , but they had disagreed with the legal assessment of the facts by the prosecuting authorities . They had stressed that their actions fell within the scope of a civil law contract of assignment of claims and the setting off of claims . The court considered that the accused had failed to take note of LAW which provided for a legal act to be null and void if effected in order to circumvent the law , or if it was contrary to the law , or contrary to good faith . The court considered that , although the applicants were conversant with civil law , their actions could not be construed as the mutual setting off of contractual claims . Their intention had been to conclude a contract of purchase and to refuse payment , invoking the assignment of claims to J.C .. The court considered that their acts amounted to an offence of misappropriation punishable under LAW .", "The court further held that the applicants had abandoned , of their own will , their intention to proceed with the purchase of merchandise in LOC and thus considered that the part of the criminal proceeding relating to this incident should be discontinued .", "The applicants appealed . They alleged that their defence rights had been breached in that the legal qualification of the charges against them had been changed after the court had closed the trial . They complained that after the trial had been closed , PERSON had not been given a possibility to address the court , that the court had made it impossible for them to lodge an appeal and that the proceedings had lasted too long . They also complained that GPE , the wife of GPE , had been questioned only on DATE of the trial and that the court had wrongly applied substantive law by considering that their acts could have amounted to offences punishable under criminal law , whereas they had only resorted to a well - established civil law contract of assignment of claims which could be effected regardless of the creditor \u2019s lack of knowledge and of his approval thereof .", "The Prosecutor likewise lodged an appeal , claiming that ORG had wrongly applied substantive criminal law in that it had assessed the applicant \u2019s offence as misappropriation , whereas it should have been qualified as fraud . He further argued that the part of the proceedings relating to the ORG acts committed in LOC should not have been discontinued because , in fact , the applicants had not abandoned their intention of their own will , but only after the seller had called the police .", "On DATE ORG quashed the judgment under appeal and ordered that the case be reconsidered by the lower court .", "The court first examined the complaints submitted by the applicants to the effect that the procedural law had been breached in the proceedings . The court considered that the lower court had in fact informed the applicants about the possibility of reassessing the offences with which they had been charged before the trial had been closed . The court further found that after the trial had been closed , the accused , including ORG , had had an opportunity to address the court orally . The court considered the complaint about the impossibility of appeal to be incomprehensible because they had in fact lodged an appeal . The fact that ORG had been questioned on DATE of the trial did not amount to an irregularity , as the lower court had been under no obligation to question witnesses in any given order . As to the legal argument on mutual setting off allowed under civil law , the court noted that the only document purporting to be evidence of the existence of the claims of the PERSON brothers against GPE merely showed that the latter had had certain obligations towards the A. company , of which the brothers had been shareholders , whereas the assignment of claims had purportedly been concluded between the PERSON brothers and GPE The court concluded that there had been no credible evidence to prove the existence of ORG original contractual obligation towards the PERSON brothers .", "The court observed that the applicants had requested ORG to allow their company to secure the payment of claims arising out of various contractual obligations for a commission of MONEY . Subsequently J.C. had signed a blank claim assignment form which was subsequently to be used by the applicants\u2019 company . The court considered that such an assignment , in the absence of any details establishing the claims on which the applicants could seek payment , could not be regarded as valid under the applicable provisions of civil law .", "The court noted that the civil law allowing for the setting off of claims is only applicable when the persons concerned were mutual debtors and creditors in relation to each other .", "The court considered that the legal assessment of the offences at issue by the first instance court had been wrong in that they had been qualified as misappropriation . However , this offence requires that the perpetrator had the objects concerned in his or her possession and then refused to return them to their rightful owner . As this had not been the case , the legal assessment of the offences had to be amended . Accordingly the court quashed the judgment of the lower court .", "On DATE the ORG convicted the applicants of CARDINAL charges qualified as a continuous offence of fraud , sentenced them to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine with imprisonment in default , and conditionally stayed enforcement of the sentence for DATE .", "The court reiterated that , as the applicants had not called into question the facts of the case , the essence of the matter lay in the legal assessment of their acts . The court considered that during the material events the applicants had pretended that they wanted to purchase merchandise and that by doing so they had misled the sellers . However , their genuine intention was , first , to enter into possession of the merchandise and , after this had been attained , to refuse payment and to declare that they intended to set off the price due against the claims against ORG which had purportedly been assigned to ORG The court considered that in the light of the evidence given by the sellers , they would not have concluded such a contract with the applicants had they been informed of their real intentions . Thus the court considered that the setting off of the claims had been null and void and that the applicants\u2019 acts met the statutory requirements of the offence of fraud , as set out in LAW applicable at the material time .", "The applicants lodged an appeal , complaining that the judgment was in breach of substantive law , in that the court had accepted that their acts amounted to a criminal offence punishable under LAW , whereas in fact they had acted in conformity with the law . The applicants did not reiterate the complaint they had raised in their appeal against the judgment of DATE that the legal qualification of the charges against them had been changed after the first - instance court had closed the trial .", "On DATE ORG amended the first instance judgment of DATE , reducing the sentence to a fine of CARDINAL new ORG , with CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in default , whilst upholding the remainder .", "The court first noted that the applicants did not call into question the findings of fact made by the lower court . The court noted that ORG had never been asked by the A. company to pay his alleged debt . Thus , the claim could not be considered as due . The court considered that , for contractual claims to be validly set off against each other , the law required that the claims should not only be undisputed but also due , which conditions did not obtain in the present case . Moreover , the applicants , when purchasing merchandise owned by GPE , had acted with a fraudulent intent , because their real intention was to take possession of the merchandise and then to refuse payment . Thus , the ORG argument that they had validly concluded a purchase contract with ORG and subsequently set off ORG assigned claim could not be accepted . Given the invalid purchase contract , there were no legal grounds on which the claims could be lawfully set off against each other ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
