The second applicant company is the registered owner of a plot of CARDINAL ha of agricultural land in GPE . The first applicant company acquired the land by a series of transactions DATE and owned it until DATE , when it transferred the land to the second applicant company subject to an option to repurchase . The owners of a property adjacent to the land , PERSON and PERSON ( \u201c the PERSON \u201d ) occupied the land under a grazing agreement until DATE . On DATE a chartered surveyor acting for the applicant companies wrote to the ORG noting that the grazing agreement was about to expire and requiring them to vacate the land . In DATE the applicant companies refused a request for a further grazing agreement for DATE because they anticipated seeking planning permission for the development of all or part of the land and considered that continued grazing might damage the prospects of obtaining such permission .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding the requirement to vacate the land at the expiry of the DATE agreement , the ORG remained in occupation at all times , continuing to use it for grazing . No request to vacate the land or to pay for the grazing which was taking place was made . If it had been , the evidence was that the PERSON would happily have paid .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE an agreement was reached whereby the applicant companies agreed to sell to the PERSON the standing crop of grass on the land for MONEY ( GBP ) . The cut was completed by DATE . In DATE an inquiry was made of the applicant companies as to whether the PERSON could take another cut of hay or be granted a further grazing agreement . No reply to this letter or to subsequent letters sent in DATE was received from the applicant companies and thereafter the PERSON made no further attempt to contact the applicant companies . From DATE until DATE the PERSON continued to use the whole of the disputed land for farming without the permission of the applicant companies .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr PERSON registered cautions at ORG against the applicant ORG title on the ground that he had obtained title by adverse possession .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant companies issued an originating summons in the High Court seeking cancellation of the cautions . On DATE the applicant companies issued further proceedings seeking possession of the disputed land .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON challenged the applicant ORG claims under LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , which provides that a person can not bring an action to recover any land after the expiration of DATE of adverse possession by another . They also relied on LAW , which applied at the relevant time and which provided that , after the expiry of the DATE period , the registered proprietor was deemed to hold the land in trust for the squatter .", "CARDINAL . Judgment was given in favour of the PERSON on DATE ( [ DATE ] PERSON ) . Mr Justice PERSON held that since the PERSON had enjoyed factual possession of the land from DATE , and adverse possession took effect from DATE , the applicant ORG title was extinguished pursuant to LAW , and the PERSON were entitled to be registered as proprietors of the land . At the conclusion of his CARDINAL - page judgment , PERSON remarked that the result he had reached did not accord with justice and could not be justified by practical considerations : the justification advanced for the right to acquire title to land by adverse possession \u2013 namely the avoidance of uncertainty \u2013 had in his view little relevance to the use of registered land where the owner was readily identifiable by inspecting the register of the relevant title at ORG . The fact that an owner who had sat on his rights for DATE should be deprived of the land was in his view \u201c illogical and disproportionate \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant companies appealed and on DATE ORG reversed the ORG decision on the ground that the PERSON did not have the necessary intention to possess the land , and the applicant companies were therefore not \u201c dispossessed \u201d of it within the meaning of LAW ( [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL , [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) . Although this conclusion was sufficient to dispose of the appeal , CARDINAL members of ORG went on to address the question whether the applicant ORG loss of title to the land could also have given rise to a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL as applied in domestic law by LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice Mummery , giving the judgment of the court , held that LAW No . CARDINAL did not impinge on the relevant provisions of LAW , which did not deprive a person of his possessions or interfere with his peaceful enjoyment of them but only deprived a person of his right of access to the courts for the purpose of recovering property if he had delayed the institution of his legal proceedings for DATE or more after being dispossessed by another . The extinction of the applicant ORG title was not , in his view , a deprivation of possessions nor a confiscatory measure for which payment of compensation would be appropriate , but simply a logical and pragmatic consequence of the barring of the right to bring an action after the expiration of the limitation period . In the alternative , ORG found that any deprivation was justified in the public interest , the conditions laid down in LAW being reasonably required to avoid the risk of injustice in the adjudication of stale claims and as ensuring certainty of title : those conditions were not disproportionate , the period of DATE being reasonable and not imposing an excessively difficult burden on the landowner .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON took as his starting - point that limitation periods were in principle not incompatible with the PERSON and that the process whereby a person would be barred from enforcing rights by the passage of time was clearly acknowledged by the LAW . This position obtained , in his view , even though limitation periods both limited the right of access to the courts and in some circumstances had the effect of depriving persons of property rights , whether real or personal , or of damages : there was thus nothing inherently incompatible as between LAW and LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON appealed to ORG , which , on DATE , allowed their appeal and restored the order of ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL ) . Lord PERSON , with whom Lord PERSON of ORG and Lord PERSON agreed , held that the PERSON did have \u201c possession \u201d of the land in the ordinary sense of the word , and therefore the applicant companies had been \u201c dispossessed \u201d of it within the meaning of LAW . There was no inconsistency between a squatter being willing to pay the paper owner if asked and his being in possession in the meantime . Concluding , Lord PERSON held as follows :", "\u201c ... Despite ORG \u2019s notification to quit the land in DATE , its peremptory refusal of a further grazing licence in DATE and the totally ignored later requests for a grazing licence , after DATE the ORG stayed in occupation of the disputed land using it for what purposes they thought fit . Some of those purposes ( i.e. , the grazing ) would have fallen within a hypothetical grazing agreement . But the rest are only consistent with an intention , verified by Mr PERSON , to use the land as they thought best . That approach was adopted from the outset . In my judgment , when the PERSON remained in factual possession of the fully enclosed land after the expiry of the mowing licence they manifestly intended to assert their possession against ORG .", "... Before your Lordships\u2019 ORG , it was conceded that LAW [ incorporating LAW ] did not have a retrospective effect . But ORG submitted that , even under the common - law principles of construction applicable before LAW came into effect , the court should seek to apply the law so as to make it consistent with LAW ] . Any such old principle of construction only applied where there was an ambiguity in the language of a statute . No such ambiguity in LAW of DATE was demonstrated to your Lordships . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord GPE of GPE , agreeing with Lord PERSON , made the following statement in the course of his judgment :", "\u201c The PERSON have acted honourably throughout . They sought rights to graze or cut grass on the land after DATE , and were quite prepared to pay . When ORG failed to respond they did what any other farmer in their position would have done : they continued to farm the land . They were not at fault . But the result of ORG \u2019s inaction was that they enjoyed the full use of the land without payment for DATE . As if that were not gain enough , they are then rewarded by obtaining title to this considerable area of valuable land without any obligation to compensate the former owner in any way at all . In the case of unregistered land , and in DATE before registration became the norm , such a result could no doubt be justified as avoiding protracted uncertainty where the title to land lay . But where land is registered it is difficult to see any justification for a legal rule which compels such an apparently unjust result , and even harder to see why the party gaining title should not be required to pay some compensation at least to the party losing it . It is reassuring to learn that LAW CARDINAL has addressed the risk that a registered owner may lose his title through inadvertence . But the main provisions of that Act have not yet been brought into effect , and even if they had it would not assist GPE , whose title had been lost before the passing of the LAW . While I am satisfied that the appeal must be allowed for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend , this is a conclusion which I ( like the judge [ PERSON ] ... ) \u2018 arrive at with no LAW . \u201d ( PERSON ( ORG and Others v. PERSON and Another [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL , at CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . As noted above , the question whether the result was incompatible with the applicant ORG rights under LAW No . CARDINAL was not pursued before ORG . However , in his judgment Lord Hope of PERSON , who also agreed with Lord PERSON on the reasons for dismissing the appeal , observed that the question under the Convention", "\u201c ... is not an easy one , as one might have expected DATE in the context of a statutory regime where compensation is not available DATE to lean in favour of the protection of a registered proprietor against the actions of persons who can not show a competing title on the register . Fortunately ... a much more rigorous regime has now been enacted in Schedule CARDINAL to LAW CARDINAL . Its effect will be to make it much harder for a squatter who is in possession of registered land to obtain a title to it against the wishes of the proprietor . The unfairness in the old regime which this case has demonstrated lies not in the absence of compensation , although that is an important factor , but in the lack of safeguards against oversight or inadvertence on the part of the registered proprietor . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The value of the land in issue is disputed between the parties . The applicant companies put their pecuniary loss at MONEY . The Government put the value of the land in DATE ( when the DATE limitation period expired ) at GBP MONEY , and in DATE ( when ORG judgment was delivered ) at MONEY .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , section CARDINAL of LAW , a consolidating Act , provided :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) No action shall be brought by any person to recover any land after the expiration of DATE from the date on which the right of action accrued to him or , if it first accrued to some person through whom he claims , to that person .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) Part I of Schedule CARDINAL to this Act contains provisions for determining the date of accrual of rights of action to recover land in the cases there mentioned . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL provided :", "\u201c Where the person bringing an action to recover land , or some person through whom he claims , has been in possession of the land , and has while entitled to the land been dispossessed or discontinued his possession , the right of action shall be treated as having accrued on DATE of the dispossession or discontinuance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The same limitation provisions therefore applied to both registered and unregistered land . In the case of unregistered land , section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provided that , on the expiration of the limitation period regulating the recovery of land , the title of the paper owner was extinguished . In the case of registered land , section GPE ) of LAW DATE provided that on the expiry of the limitation period the title was not extinguished but the registered proprietor was deemed to hold the land thereafter in trust for the squatter .", "CARDINAL . GPE \u2019s ORG ( Fourth Edition , Reissue CARDINAL ) sets out the law in the following terms :", "\u201c CARDINAL . When the owner of land has been out of possession , and a stranger has been in possession , for a period sufficient to bar the owner \u2019s right to re - enter or to recover possession by action , the owner \u2019s title is extinguished , and the stranger acquires a title which is good against all the world , including the former owner .", "LAW operates negatively to bar the right and extinguish the title of the true owner , and does not effect a transfer of his estate to the stranger ; the new title depends on the principle that possession gives title , coupled with the extinction of the rights of the former owner , and is subject to any easements [ etc . ] which remain unextinguished . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the law on limitation periods in its report of DATE ( Cmnd CARDINAL ) . It commented negatively on the ORG practice of granting an implied licence to the would - be adverse possessor , which had the effect of stopping time running against the owner , and proposed no change to the existing limitation periods , and agreed that the expiration of the limitation period should serve to extinguish the claimant \u2019s title .", "CARDINAL . A Law Commission Consultation Paper on Limitation of Actions of DATE ( Consultation Paper No . CARDINAL ) gave a number of general policy aims of the law on limitations . The Consultation Paper noted that defendants have a legitimate interest in having cases brought to court reasonably promptly as evidence may not be available indefinitely and because defendants should be able to rely on their assumed entitlement to enjoy an unchallenged right . The ORG , too , has an interest in ensuring that claims are made and determined within a reasonable time in order to deliver a fair trial , and as guarantor of legal certainty . Finally , limitation periods were seen to have a salutary effect on plaintiffs in encouraging them to bring claims reasonably promptly .", "CARDINAL . A separate Law Commission Consultative Document on land registration in DATE ( prepared with ORG ; PERSON No . CARDINAL ) noted that , although the original intention of the system of land registration was to apply the principles of unregistered land to a registered format , there were certain areas where this was not wholly true . CARDINAL example given was the position of the rights of adverse possessors ( section GPE ) of LAW DATE was referred to ) . The Consultative Document set out and commented on CARDINAL particularly cogent reasons often given for the law on adverse possession :", "( i ) Because it is part of the law on limitation of actions . It noted :", "\u201c ... because adverse possession is an aspect of the law of limitation , it is of course customary to account for it , in part at least , in terms of the policy of limitation statutes generally , namely to protect defendants from stale claims and to encourage plaintiffs not to sleep on their rights . However , adverse possession does not merely bar claims . Its effect is positive : \u2018 a squatter does in the end get a title by his possession and the indirect operation of LAW ] ... \u2019 This can only be justified by factors over and above those which explain the law on limitation . In this context it should be noted that a landowner may be barred even where he or she is quite blameless . As we have explained above , adverse possession can take place without it being readily detectable . In any event , this particular justification has much greater force in relation to unregistered land than it does for land with registered title . Unregistered title ultimately depends upon possession . It therefore behoves a landowner to be vigilant to protect that possession and not to sleep on his or her rights . ... [ w]here title is registered , ... the basis of title is primarily the fact of registration rather than possession . Registration confers title because the registration of a person as proprietor of land of itself vests in him or her the relevant legal estate ... \u201d", "( ii ) Because if land and its ownership are out of kilter , the land may become unmarketable . Where the registered owner has disappeared , and can not be traced , and a squatter takes possession , the doctrine of adverse possession \u201c does at least ensure that in such cases land remains in commerce and is not rendered sterile \u201d . Where there have been dealings \u201c off the register \u201d , such as where a farmer agrees to a land swap with a neighbour under a \u201c gentleman \u2019s agreement \u201d but does not register the change , \u201c adverse possession fulfils a useful function \u201d .", "( iii ) Because in case of mistake the innocent but mistaken squatter of land may have incurred expenditure . In such circumstances adverse possession can be justified on grounds of hardship , and there are parallels with the principles of proprietary estoppel .", "( iv ) Because it facilitates and cheapens investigation of title to land . ORG accepted this last reason as being very strong for unregistered land , but considered that for registered land , where title depends on the contents of the register rather than possession , it was not applicable .", "CARDINAL . ORG proposed , provisionally , that the system of adverse possession as it applied to registered land should be recast to reflect the principles of title registration , and that it should be limited to very few , exceptional cases .", "CARDINAL . A Report on Limitation of Actions ( Law Com No . CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL on registered land ( Law Com No . CARDINAL ) followed the Consultation Papers , and were published in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG on LAW recommended that the general limitation period for actions in respect of land should be DATE . It added that if the proposals made on registered land in PERSON No . CARDINAL were accepted , the proposal would relate only to interests in unregistered land ( and unregistrable interests in registered land ) .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the various criticisms , including those made by a number of the judges in the present case and the ORG on registered land ( Law Com No . CARDINAL ) , LAW CARDINAL made a number of changes to the law as it related to registered land . It provided that adverse possession , for however long , would not of itself bar the owner \u2019s title to a registered estate . A squatter was entitled to apply to be registered as proprietor after DATE , and would be so registered if application was not opposed . If the application was opposed , it would be refused . If the application was refused but no steps were taken to evict the squatter or otherwise regulate the position , he was entitled to apply again to be registered as proprietor , and would be so registered whether or not the application was opposed . LAW came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Deputy Judge PERSON in ORG gave judgment in the case of ORG v. ORG , DATE ) . The case concerned a licensee who had remained in possession of registered land for DATE after the expiry of his licence . Applying the judgment of ORG in the present case , the judge found that under LANGUAGE law as it stood up to the entry into force of LAW DATE the registered owner of the land lost all claim to it . However , on analysing the facts on a Convention basis , he found that there was no real public or general interest in the law on adverse possession in the case of registered land , and that the adverse consequences for the landowner were disproportionate . By reinterpreting the relevant legislation in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW , the judge found that the claim by the former licensee to have acquired the disputed land failed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
