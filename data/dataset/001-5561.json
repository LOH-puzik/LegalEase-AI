AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , born in DATE , residing in GPE . She is represented before the ORG by Mr Graff , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant suffers from cancer . Since an operation in DATE she has been treated with \u201c NORP \u201d , a medicine which is not registered in the NORP pharmacopeia ( NORP ) . The applicant asked ORG ( Gebietskrankenkassa ) to reimburse the various costs of her treatment . On CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to meet the costs .", "On DATE the applicant filed an action with ORG ( Arbeits- und ORG ) against ORG , requesting the reimbursement of the treatment costs . On CARDINAL DATE ORG appointed an expert who delivered his opinion in DATE .", "On DATE a witness was heard and the expert opinion was discussed . On DATE the proceedings were adjourned because ORG was expected to deliver a judgment concerning \u201c LOC .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the adjournment , which was quashed by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) . On DATE a witness was heard . In DATE another expert delivered his opinion . On DATE the expert delivered a supplementary opinion . A further hearing appears to have been held on DATE . On DATE the applicant gave notice that CARDINAL witnesses were going to be absent for some time and asked the court to schedule the following hearing no sooner than DATE . On DATE ORG appointed another expert who DATE after having been admonished by the judge CARDINAL times \u2013 finally delivered his opinion in DATE . On DATE a hearing was held to discuss the expert opinion .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel submitted documents in NORP which were translated into NORP by DATE .", "On DATE the expert delivered a supplementary opinion on the basis of the submitted documents .", "On DATE the court fixed the date for a hearing on DATE , but at the request of the applicant counsel \u2019s postponed the hearing until DATE .", "On DATE the hearing was postponed until DATE due to the judge \u2019s illness . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel requested a further postponement .", "On DATE , after the hearing , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action , referring to section CARDINAL of LAW ( Allgemeines Sozialversicherungsgesetz ) which states that the treatment provided has to be sufficient and appropriate but must not exceed what is actually necessary . The court found that the mere fact that \u201c NORP \u201d was not registered in the NORP pharmacopoeia did not in itself prevent the reimbursement of treatment costs . However , in the applicant \u2019s case , registered medicines would have had the same curative effects and , given the evidence produced during the proceedings ( submissions of the parties and witnesses , expert opinions ) , their prescription could not be considered unreasonable or unacceptable . In addition , the \u201c NORP \u201d treatment cost CARDINAL times as much . Besides , the court noted that no curative effect had been proved . Therefore the \u201c LOC treatment was neither a necessary nor an appropriate treatment within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . The decision was served on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
