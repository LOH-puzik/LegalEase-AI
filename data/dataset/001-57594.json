ORG The applicant , Mr. PERSON , is a NORP citizen born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , then aged DATE , he pleaded guilty at GPE PERSON to armed robbery , assaulting a police officer and being in the unlawful possession of a firearm . In respect of the first offence , he was sentenced to life imprisonment ; for the second and third offences he received CARDINAL and CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment respectively , all sentences to run concurrently .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant had committed the robbery on DATE when he entered a pet shop in GPE , GPE , with a starting pistol loaded with blank cartridges , pointed it at the owner and told her to hand over the till . He stole a sum of MONEY which was later found on the shop floor .", "DATE , he telephoned NORP police station to say that he would give himself up . He was apprehended in FAC by CARDINAL police officers . He took the starting pistol from his pocket and it went off . In the ensuing struggle , CARDINAL more blanks were fired , CARDINAL of which caused a powder burn to the wrist of CARDINAL of the police officers . It emerged that the applicant had committed the robbery because he wanted to pay back \u00a3 MONEY which he owed his mother , who had told him that morning to find lodgings elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the trial , a prison medical officer testified that he could find no evidence of mental instability which would justify sending the applicant to a mental institution . However , a probation report , which had been prepared by a probation officer who had supervised the applicant for a period of DATE , characterised him as being susceptible to fluctuation of mood and emotionally immature , and as having a morbid interest in the literature of violence and a fascination for guns . The report also stated that he had taken to drinking heavily from time to time and that he had a high potential for aggression . No psychiatric report was available to the court .", "CARDINAL . ORG In passing sentence , Mr. PERSON said :", "\" ... [ T]he facts of the offence and the evidence of the character and disposition of the accused ... satisfy me that ... he is a very dangerous young man . ... I think an indeterminate sentence is the right sentence for somebody of this age , of this character and disposition , who is attracted to this form of conduct . That leaves the matter with the Secretary of ORG who can release him if and when those who have been watching him and examining him believe that with the passage of years he has become responsible . It may not take long . Or the change may not occur for a long time - I do not know how it will work out . ... So far as the first count of the indictment is concerned , I think the right conclusion , terrible though it may seem , is that I pass the sentence that the law authorises me to pass for robbery and for assault with intent to rob with arms , that is life imprisonment . The Secretary of ORG can act if and when he thinks it is safe to act . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. DATE applied for leave to appeal against the sentence to ORG ) which , on DATE , dismissed the application . Lord ORG upheld the view of the sentencing judge in the following terms :", "\" Now at the trial it appears that the prison doctor said that there was no evidence of any mental disorder then apparent which would have justified his detention in a mental institution . The Learned Judge , quite rightly in the view of this ORG , took the view that this was not a case for borstal because borstal for CARDINAL reason would not be a sufficiently secure place to send such a dangerous young man . The Judge was therefore - since he could not send him to a mental institution for lack of evidence - faced with a difficult decision on whether he should give him what he did , namely life imprisonment , or sentence him to some long term , some definite term of imprisonment for DATE . As he was at pains to point out , he in mercy really to the boy took the former course . Now life imprisonment in this case at any rate means an indeterminate sentence . If when he gets to prison it then appears after he has been there some time that there are grounds for transferring him to a mental institution for treatment , there are ample powers under LAW which will enable the Home Secretary to do so . Moreover , as soon as it becomes apparent , and it is to be hoped that it may not be long , but one can not tell , that it is safe from the public point of view and from his own point of view to do so , this boy will be released . At first sight a sentence of life imprisonment , particularly having regard to his age , sounds terrible , but when the factors to which reference has been made are considered it will be seen that this is really in mercy to the boy and will perhaps enable him to be released much sooner than if a long term of imprisonment had been imposed , which was the only other alternative . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , the applicant was transferred to PERSON , a psychiatric prison . However , it was found that he did not respond to the regime and after CARDINAL months\u2019 treatment , he was transferred back to FAC until his release on licence in DATE . He had originally been given a release date for DATE but had absconded from a prison hostel during DATE . He later surrendered to the police , but on his return to prison was violent and refused food for a time . On the recommendation of ORG , a further release date was set for DATE . However , this date was again rescinded when the applicant returned to a prison hostel drunk , tried to escape while being escorted to the main prison and was recaptured only after a chase and a violent struggle . His case was once more referred to ORG and , on its recommendation , he was released on licence by decision of the Secretary of ORG for ORG ( \" the ORG Secretary \" ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant pleaded guilty at ORG to burglary and driving while uninsured and without a licence . It appears he had broken into a beach hut and stolen a pullover . He was given a conditional discharge for DATE and fined . The probation report described the applicant as having frequent disagreements with members of his family , with whom he lived in turn , and drinking to excess in times of stress . Following this incident , a letter warning that his licence could be revoked was issued by ORG and served on him on DATE .", "At DATE , the applicant was given accommodation and employment as a labourer at FAC .

Following his arrest , he was remanded in custody by NORP ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , whilst Mr. PERSON was still in custody on remand , the Home Secretary ordered that his licence be revoked ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , hereafter referred to as \" LAW \" - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

He was given a conditional discharge for DATE by a judge ( Judge PERSON ) assisted by CARDINAL lay magistrates . Judge PERSON indicated that he did not consider that the applicant \u2019s case was \" a typical case of someone given a sentence such as a life sentence , released on parole and then reverting straight into crime , reverting back to usual or true colours \" . He then left it to ORG to consider whether to release the applicant once more on parole , with the suggestion that he be allowed his liberty again . Judge PERSON himself had no competence to restore the applicant \u2019s licence or to order release , although he could have revoked the licence had it still been in force ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant \u2019s case was considered by ORG in DATE . ORG took the view that the applicant was still a danger to himself and to the public and confirmed his recall to prison . It recommended that the case be referred to ORG , the first stage of a formal review by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , in DATE .", "ORG reviewed the case again in DATE , when it recommended that he be released on licence once more . The Home Secretary , after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge , did not accept ORG recommendation and decided that the applicant should be transferred to an open prison . In DATE , he absconded from the open prison to GPE , but surrendered himself to the police in DATE . In DATE , ORG recommended that he be released on licence as soon as resettlement arrangements could be made . The ORG Secretary accepted this recommendation and decided upon a provisional release date of DATE , subject to pre - release employment at FAC .

On DATE , he was found guilty at ORG of the offence of malicious wounding and sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "In DATE , the case was again referred to ORG , which recommended that preparation should be made for the applicant to be released directly from prison to a hostel . He was released on licence on DATE . As in the case of every life licensee , his licence included conditions requiring him , inter alia , to place himself under the supervision of a nominated probation officer ; to keep in touch with his supervising officer in accordance with that officer \u2019s instructions ; to reside only where approved by his supervising officer ; and not to travel outside GPE without the prior permission of his supervising officer .", "CARDINAL .

ORG Where the remedy of judicial review of administrative action lies , ORG of ORG will quash decisions of an administrative authority if those decisions are taken in breach of the relevant statutory requirements or if the decisions are otherwise tainted by illegality , irrationality or procedural impropriety . The scope of judicial review was explained as follows by Lord PERSON in his speech in the case of ORG Unions v. Minister for ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL at CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) :", "\" ... Judicial review has I think developed to a stage DATE when , without reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come about , one can conveniently classify under CARDINAL heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review . The first ground I would call \u2018 ORG , the second \u2018 ORG and the third \u2018 procedural impropriety\u2019 . That is not to say that further development on a case - by - case basis may not in course of time add further grounds . I have in mind particularly the possible adoption in the future of the principle of \u2018 proportionality\u2019 which is recognised in the administrative law of several of our fellow members of ORG ; but to dispose of the instant case the CARDINAL already well - established heads that I have mentioned will suffice .", "By \u2018 ORG as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision - maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision - making power and must give effect to it . Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question to be decided , in the event of dispute , by those persons , the judges , by whom the judicial power of the ORG is exercisable .", "By \u2018 irrationality\u2019 I mean what can by now be succinctly referred to as \u2018 Wednesbury unreasonableness\u2019 ( see ORG v. ORG All England Law Reports CARDINAL , CARDINAL CARDINAL King \u2019s Bench Reports CARDINAL ) . It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it .", "...", "I have described the third head as \u2018 procedural impropriety\u2019 rather than failure to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness towards the person who will be affected by the decision . This is because susceptibility to judicial review under this head covers also failure by an administrative tribunal to observe procedural rules that are expressly laid down in the legislative instrument by which its jurisdiction is conferred , even where such failure does not involve any denial of natural justice .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG According to the Government , a decision of ORG or of the ORG Secretary which violates any of those requirements may be quashed by the courts . Thus , in CARDINAL recent cases , the courts have examined , under the head of procedural impropriety , whether adequate reasons for recall were given for the purposes of section CARDINAL ) of LAW and have , in CARDINAL case , quashed on that ground a decision of ORG refusing to recommend release from prison on licence pursuant to its powers under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see respectively the PERSON and PERSON cases - paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . In the PERSON case , ORG also considered the extent to which the rules of natural justice apply to proceedings before ORG . Lord Justice Eveleigh stated :", "\" ... I agree with what was said by Lord Justice PERSON in his judgment in ORG . He quoted the words of Lord Justice PERSON in the case of ORG v. Lord ORG , DATE , CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL , at page CARDINAL , where he said : \u2018 The scope and extent of the principles of natural justice depend on the subject matter to which they are sought to be applied : see Reg . v. ORG for GPE , ex parte GPE and GPE DATE CARDINAL Queen \u2019s Bench Reports CARDINAL , CARDINAL . They apply to the present case , as conceded , to the extent that they impose on ORG , and each member of it , a duty to act fairly . That duty does not , in my judgment , require that any disclosure is made to the prisoner of adverse material which ORG have in their possession to assist them in their advisory and reporting functions.\u2019", "[ Counsel for the applicant for judicial review ] submitted that there is a difference in this case and that case , because that case was dealing with an initial release on parole and not with a consideration of the matter by ORG after recall . It is true factually that there is that distinction , but in my judgment that distinction results in CARDINAL difference and CARDINAL difference only from the point of view of the consideration of the matter by ORG ; that is that the prisoner himself , in the case of recall , is entitled to have been told the reasons for his recall . So there is some information to which he is entitled , but to my mind that is the only distinction between the CARDINAL cases . The principle of natural justice upon which reliance has been placed in this case , i.e. an alleged principle of full disclosure , does not in my judgment apply . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
