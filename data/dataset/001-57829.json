He was subsequently detained in the LOC special institution for mentally deranged offenders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor filed an indictment charging the applicant with murder under section CARDINAL of LAW ) and with illegal possession of a firearm under LAW of LAW ( GPE ) as well as with a number of fraud offences . It was alleged that financial difficulties had led the applicant to defraud PERSON and that the motive for the murder was his fear that these offences would be discovered . The prosecution requested that the applicant be committed to an institution for mentally ill criminals under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s trial commenced before a Court of Assizes of ORG sitting with a jury . He was represented by an official defence counsel , the court having refused his request to defend himself in person .", "At the hearing the applicant retracted his confession which he claimed was the product of a psychotic aberration , alleging that PERSON had committed suicide in his presence . The trial was discontinued and the case was referred back to the investigating judge with a view to clarifying this new allegation .", "CARDINAL . A new trial began on DATE before ORG . On DATE the jury found him guilty of murder and unlawful possession of a firearm . The charges of fraud had earlier been dropped by the prosecution for want of evidence . The jury found that the applicant was criminally responsible and expressed the opinion that \" the motive remains unknown , too many possibilities \" .", "The court , sitting with the jury , sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , the maximum determinate sentence possible under NORP law in a case of murder , and ordered him to be committed to an institution for mentally deranged criminals .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a plea of nullity ( PERSON ) with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) complaining , inter alia , that he had been denied the right to defend himself and that the trial had not been fair . His wife and mother filed a further plea of nullity as well as an appeal ( GPE ) challenging the length of the sentence and the commitment of the applicant to a special institution .", "CARDINAL . The public prosecutor also appealed against the sentence requesting that a life sentence be imposed because of the planning involved in the offence and the malicious way it was carried out . A further appeal against the decision to refer his claim for damages to the civil court was lodged by PERSON , the son of PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the Attorney General \u2019s office ( PERSON ) of the various remedies sought in the applicant \u2019s case and transmitted the file which included documents concerning these remedies introduced by the applicant , his relatives , the public prosecutor and the private party . The note mentioned the judge rapporteur \u2019s name and was signed by him .", "The Attorney General \u2019s position paper on the nullity pleas ( croquis ) dated DATE was received by ORG on DATE . It ran to CARDINAL pages and considered in detail the various grounds of nullity invoked by the applicant and his mother and wife . The Attorney General expressed the view that ORG should hold a public hearing and reject these pleas . He did not make any submissions regarding the various appeals against the sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG on DATE for communication of the Attorney General \u2019s position paper , as did his defence counsel on DATE . However , these requests were not acted upon . There is no record in ORG that the applicant \u2019s counsel sought to inspect the file . The position paper was eventually served on counsel only on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE ( the victim \u2019s son ) submitted a number of missing diary - sheets to ORG . During the trial the applicant had repeatedly requested the production of missing parts of PERSON diary as evidence that PERSON had intended to commit suicide . A motion to search Mr PERSON \u2019s home in this connection had been rejected by the trial court . Subsequently he had also introduced a civil action against Mr GPE to produce those documents .", "On learning in the course of the civil action that parts of the diary had been submitted to ORG , the applicant unsuccessfully requested ORG on DATE to order a search of the home of PERSON whom he suspected of withholding further relevant documents . Copies of the diary - sheets submitted to ORG were later served on the applicant through ORG .", "The applicant maintains that ORG carried out additional investigations concerning certain forged cheques . This , however , is denied by the Government .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the fixing of the date of ORG hearing , the judge rapporteur , as is customary in the procedure of the court , prepared a draft judgment which was included in the official file . The draft appeared to have been revised . The rapporteur generally followed the line developed in the Attorney General \u2019s position paper and proposed to reject the various pleas of nullity . The draft also dealt with the question of the diary - sheets .", "It appears that members of ORG dealing with the case took part in preliminary deliberations ( Vorberatungen ) prior to the hearing and that statements by other members concerning the draft decision were placed on the file at some point before the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG fixed the hearing date for the pleas of nullity and the appeals for DATE .", "The applicant received the summons to the hearing on DATE . The notification stated that at the hearing of the pleas of nullity the applicant , being incarcerated , could only appear through his official defence counsel in accordance with sections CARDINAL para . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafprozessordnung , \" the Code \"- see paragraphs QUANTITY below ) . At the hearing of the appeals he would not be brought to the court as the conditions of section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code were not satisfied ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It was also ordered that the Attorney General \u2019s position paper should be sent to the applicant \u2019s official defence counsel and to the lawyer acting on behalf of his wife and mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , invoking Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article DATE ) of the LAW , petitioned ORG to be allowed to attend the hearing of the pleas of nullity in person , a right accorded to defendants who are not incarcerated . He relied on the right to defend himself in person , as guaranteed in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) ( article DATE ) , and observed that he had consistently objected to his being represented by official defence counsel and that under section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code detained defendants were entitled to be brought to a hearing on an appeal against sentence . At the same time the applicant pointed out , inter alia , that no decision had so far been taken on his request for a copy of the Attorney General \u2019s croquis .", "CARDINAL . The petition was rejected by ORG on DATE and the decision notified to the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE of the hearing ( DATE ) . The court noted that the applicant had not applied to be brought to the hearing of the appeals as provided for by section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It had no doubts concerning the constitutionality and conformity with LAW CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It further stated that the applicant was not entitled to receive a copy of the Attorney General \u2019s croquis personally and that LAW had been observed since a copy of this document had been made available to his official defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . The hearing before ORG of the pleas of nullity and appeals was held on DATE in the absence of the applicant . He was represented by his official defence counsel . It began at TIME and closed at TIME The court heard submissions from the legal representatives of the parties and a representative of the Attorney General \u2019s office . Its deliberations following the hearing lasted TIME . A brief summary of the judgment was read out .", "CARDINAL . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s and his relatives\u2019 pleas of nullity as well as the appeal brought by PERSON It allowed both the public prosecutor \u2019s appeal and , in part , the appeal brought by the relatives and sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment . It also annulled the order committing the applicant to a mental institution , thereby requiring him to serve his sentence in an ordinary prison .", "\" The court of first instance failed , ... , in assessing the sentence , to make adequate allowance for the special gravity of the accused \u2019s personal guilt taken together with the objective weight of the offence involved in ( intentionally ) killing a person in the particular circumstances of this case . After all , this treacherous crime - amounting practically to \u2018 liquidation\u2019 of the unsuspecting victim , who trusted the accused - and committed with the reprehensible intention of forestalling revelation of his own financial misdeeds , reflects such a negative attitude ( i.e. such baseness ) on the ORG The fact that the accused committed the crime when in an abnormal mental state and under its influence is not so important , and thus can not counterbalance the factors which tell against him in determining the sentence . The only response to the accused \u2019s criminal behaviour which is commensurate with his guilt is accordingly a sentence of life imprisonment . \"", "CARDINAL . In the course of its judgment the court found that the rejection by the trial court of the evidentiary motion in connection with the diary - sheets did not impair the rights of the defence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It went on to find that the missing diary - sheets which had been submitted to the court would not have \" been likely to be of any significance to the jury \u2019s verdict \" .", "CARDINAL . The original ( GPE ) of ORG judgment shows that the rejection of the pleas of nullity was almost literally based on the judge rapporteur \u2019s draft decision prepared before ORG hearing ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant is still detained in the LOC special institution for mentally deranged offenders .", "CARDINAL . First - instance judgments given by ORG of ORG can be challenged by a plea of nullity to ORG on specific grounds enumerated in LAW ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL and , as regards assize court judgments , section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) . The grounds in question include procedural defects and misapplication of the substantive criminal law in the finding of guilt and the determination of the sentence . In principle they do not relate to the evaluation of the evidence by the first - instance court and new facts and evidence can not be taken into account . ORG is bound by the facts and evidence established in the first - instance judgment unless it finds that no reasons have been given or that the reasons are insufficient , contradictory , or clearly incompatible with the contents of the file .", "However the latter principles concerning the reasons for the court \u2019s findings do not apply to nullity proceedings in respect of jury verdicts in the assize courts . ORG task in such cases is mainly to control the acts of the bench and the presiding judge of the assize court examining , in particular , whether the trial has been conducted in a manner which complies with fundamental procedural principles , whether the right questions have been put and the right directions given to the jury . ORG may only verify whether the jury has provided unclear , incomplete or contradictory answers to the questions put to it . As in other cases it also supervises the correct application of the criminal law , but in so doing is bound by the jury \u2019s findings as to the facts .", "CARDINAL . In certain cases ORG may reject a plea of nullity without a public hearing ( section CARDINAL ( c ) of the Code ) . In all other cases - such as the present - there will be a public hearing which may also be combined with a public hearing on appeals against sentence .", "CARDINAL . As regards the hearing on a plea of nullity section CARDINAL of the PERSON provides :", "\" CARDINAL . When the date of the public hearing is being fixed , the accused ... shall be summoned ...", "CARDINAL . If the accused is under arrest , the notice of the hearing given to him shall mention that he may only appear through counsel .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Code applies , in principle , the above rules to nullity pleas arising out of trials by jury .", "However , if the hearing is a combined one on a plea of nullity and an appeal against sentence , an accused who is present for the latter purpose may also exercise his rights concerning the nullity plea .", "CARDINAL . While legal defects in the sentencing procedure may also form the subject of a plea of nullity , the sentence as such can only be challenged by way of an appeal against sentence . It may concern both points of law ( in particular whether mitigating or aggravating circumstances have been correctly taken into account ) and factors relating to the assessment of the sentence . Where the substance of an appeal is examined a public hearing must normally be held .", "CARDINAL . As regards the personal appearance of the accused at appeal hearings , section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , second sentence , of the Code provided at the relevant time :", "\" The provisions of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL are applicable , mutatis mutandis , to the fixing of the date and the holding of the public hearing subject to the proviso that an accused who is not detained shall always be summoned and that an accused who is detained shall also be brought before the court if he has made a request to this effect in his appeal or counter - statement or otherwise if his personal presence appears necessary in the interest of justice . \"", "CARDINAL .
