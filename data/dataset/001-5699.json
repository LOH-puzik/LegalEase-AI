{"ITEMID": "001-5699", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "EATSON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . She is represented before the Court by PERSON , a solicitor practising in PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was born into a gypsy family and travelled in a caravan in a nomadic way of life throughout her childhood . This continued after her marriage at DATE to her husband who is also a gypsy . They travelled mainly in GPE and GPE , working on farms . They often stopped at a site in PERSON , where their CARDINAL children were born .", "DATE , the applicant and her family were continually harassed by the police or local authority officials , being required to move on . They were able to obtain a place on a local authority site where they stayed until DATE . They were given notice to quit apparently due to her husband \u2019s use of a lorry on the site .", "After DATE of travelling , the applicant and her family moved on to a site in GPE which they had bought . They intended to develop the land as a commercial nursery garden . In DATE , their caravan was stolen and they moved into the workshop building on the land .", "The applicant \u2019s application for planning permission for a mobile home was refused but on appeal , in DATE , they were given CARDINAL years\u2019 temporary permission while they established their nursery business . In his decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG said , inter alia :", "\u201c the appeal site is in LOC and it is located in open countryside beyond the confines of any village . The site is not in a location where residential accommodation would normally be allowed \u2026", "At my site visit , I saw little to demonstrate a productive nursery \u2026 Without clear evidence of a firm intention and ability to develop the business I do not consider that a permanent dwelling can be justified by such an enterprise \u2026 on agricultural grounds \u2026 .", "I now turn to the question of gypsy status and the matters which flow from that . There is no doubt that the ORG have impeccable gypsy antecedents \u2026 I have no hesitation in concluding that the < applicant > and her husband are gypsies in statutory terms and entitled to the considerations which flow from that . \u2026", "GPE is a designated area under LAW which means that the Secretary of ORG was satisfied that adequate accommodation had been provided for gypsies residing in or resorting to the area . There is no evidence that a major problem of provision has developed in the area since designation . Within the district there are CARDINAL council sites and CARDINAL private site . There are CARDINAL plots at ORG , CARDINAL at Pepperstock and CARDINAL mobile homes at Jockey farm . DATE , the twice yearly counts showed no unauthorised sites in the district ; this rose to CARDINAL families in DATE and fell to DATE . The ORG consider that they can accommodate any genuine need within the existing sites , however there is a waiting list of CARDINAL for Pepperstock and CARDINAL at ORG . I appreciate that pitches do become available from time to time but there is no immediate prospect of CARDINAL becoming available particularly in light of the waiting lists . I understand that there is a transit site at GPE QUANTITY away , which the ORG use as a temporary expedient until a pitch on a permanent site becomes available . I understand that a move to the PERSON site would mean that < the applicant > would not have the continuity of medical care which is advantageous to her . Moreover , it would put both of them at some considerable distance from what appears to be their source of income , the appeal site . I am therefore not satisfied that suitable alternative accommodation would be available to them were I to uphold < the enforcement notice > even within an extended compliance period .", "While I recognise that it might sometimes be necessary to allow gypsy sites in LOC and that private site provision can be advantageous , I do not find the need for further permanent provision in this case to be such as to outweigh the strong planning policy objection to additional residential development in the countryside . I appreciate that the buildings on the land are likely to remain and the visual impact of a caravan would therefore be limited but , by itself , that is not a compelling argument for allowing a permanent residential use in LOC . However , in the light of the lack of suitable alternative provision for the PERSON on an official gypsy site in the near future I consider I would be justified in granting them a personal permission limited to DATE to enable them to make proper alternative arrangements \u2026 \u201d", "In DATE , a fire broke out destroying much of the applicant \u2019s office workshop and her stock in trade .", "Before the expiry of the temporary permission , the applicant applied in DATE for planning permission to live on her land as a gypsy invoking the relevant government circulars .", "In DATE , planning permission was refused by the local authority . On appeal , ORG held a public inquiry on DATE . On DATE , he upheld the refusal of planning permission , stating inter alia :", "\u201c The site is within confirmed PERSON , and at the inquiry it was accepted on behalf of < the applicant > that the development now under consideration is not \u201c appropriate \u201d in terms of LOC policy . Therefore having regard to the development plan and national planning guidance , I consider that the main issue in these appeals is whether there are very special circumstances which could justify making an exception to the normal , firm presumption against inappropriate development within FAC . \u2026", "For the < applicant > heavy reliance was placed on Circular DATE \u2026 It was pointed out that the current development plan \u2026 does not \u2026 \u2019identify locations suitable for gypsy sites\u2019 or set out \u2018 \u2026 clear , realistic criteria for suitable locations , as a basis for site provision policies.\u2019", "That is so . However , even if the development plan were fully in accord with the Circular , it is highly unlikely that the appeal site would be among the pieces of land identified for a gypsy caravan site , either on a site specific basis or \u2018 criteria\u2019 basis \u2026", "In GPE , there are CARDINAL local authority sites , on which from time to time vacancies do arise . \u2026 it appears to me , on the basis of the regular CARDINAL DATE official counts , that the level of need for additional authorised sites in the district is low . \u2026", "A linked issue is the extent of the difficulty the < applicant and her husband > would personally have in finding another private gypsy site , if they had to leave their present one . I accept I would be difficult to find a site in GPE . .. The < applicants are local people , but it would not be unreasonable , in my view , to expect them at least to search for sites elsewhere in GPE , or in the districts bordering on GPE .", "It was claimed that since the temporary planning permission was granted in DATE the < applicant and her husband > have made \u2018 strenuous efforts\u2019 to find alternative accommodation . I do not agree that this is the case . From the evidence I was given , the main efforts appear to have been CARDINAL telephone calls to the council and a number of letters to local estate agents since the appeals were lodged . \u2026 I do not regard these efforts as anything like sufficient to establish that there is no prospect of finding some alternative accommodation which it would be reasonable to expect the < applicant and her husband > to accept . \u201d", "The inspector noted that the applicant received injections twice a day for diabetes and that her husband suffered from chronic bronchitis and asthma . This indicated that they would benefit from a more settled lifestyle within a reasonable distance of medical services . He observed that these conditions could also be fulfilled in a mobile home park , of which there were several located within the district . Nor did he find that the agricultural use of their land was such as to require that they live on the site . He did however extend the period of compliance by DATE with reference to their organising what they would do with regard to accommodation , etc .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s appeal against that decision under section CARDINAL of ORG DATE was dismissed by ORG .", "Counsel advised against appeal to ORG on grounds of lack of prospects of success .", "ORG as amended by ORG DATE ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) consolidated pre - existing planning law . It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development ( ORG v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and GPE [ DATE ] ORG Law CARDINAL ; PERSON v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority , which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise ( section CARDINALA of LAW ) .", "The DATE Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of ORG in the event of a refusal of permission ( section CARDINAL ) . With immaterial exceptions , the Secretary of ORG must , if either the appellant or the authority so desire , give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of ORG . It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence ( see the PERSON the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . There is a further appeal to ORG on the ground that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision was not within the powers conferred by LAW , or that the relevant requirements of LAW were not complied with ( section FAC ) .", "If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission , the local authority may issue an \u201c enforcement notice \u201d if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of ORG on the grounds , inter alia , that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question ( section CARDINAL ) . As with the appeal against refusal of permission , the Secretary of ORG must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector .", "Again there is a further right of appeal on a point of law to ORG against a decision of the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review . It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . ORG will also grant a remedy if the inspector \u2019s decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact ; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors ; or made for an improper purpose , in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument . However , the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision - making authority .", "Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice , the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "The purpose of ORG and the operation of the policy to protect them is set out in the national policy document FAC ( DATE ) .", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Government attaches great importance to GPE , which have been an essential element of planning policy for DATE . \u2026", "CARDINAL . The fundamental aim of LOC policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open ; the most important attribute of ORG is their openness . Green Belts can shape patterns of urban development at sub - regional and regional scale , and help to ensure that development occurs in locations allocated in development plans . They help to protect the countryside , be it in agricultural , forestry or other use . They can assist in moving towards more sustainable patterns of urban development .", "CARDINAL . There are CARDINAL purposes in GPE :", "- to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built - up areas ;", "- to prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another ;", "- to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment ;", "- to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns ; and", "- to assist in urban regeneration by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land . \u2026", "CARDINAL . NORP The essential characteristic of GPE is their permanence . Their protection must be maintained as far as can be seen ahead . \u2026", "CARDINAL . The general policies controlling development in the countryside apply with equal force in Green Belts but there is , in addition , a general presumption against inappropriate development within them . Such development should not be approved , except in very special circumstances . \u2026", "CARDINAL . Inappropriate development is , by definition , harmful to LOC . It is for the applicant to show why permission should be granted . Very special circumstances to justify inappropriate development will not exist unless the harm by reason of inappropriateness , and any other harm , is clearly outweighed by other considerations . In view of the presumption against inappropriate development , the Secretary of ORG will attach substantial weight to the harm to the Green Belt when considering any planning application or appeal concerning such development . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
