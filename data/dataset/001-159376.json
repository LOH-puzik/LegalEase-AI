Following ORG intervention in GPE , on DATE the NORP and ORG agreed to a phased withdrawal of their military and police forces from the territory and a transfer of all effective control to an international security force ( \u201c ORG ) .

It was further envisaged that it would be up to ORG to \u201c maintain a secure environment for all citizens of GPE \u201d .

On DATE the said court ruled against the plaintiffs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance judgment was upheld by ORG on appeal . The first applicant was served with the ORG judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In their reasoning ORG and ORG opined , inter alia , that while the first applicant \u2019s husband had indeed been kidnapped on DATE GPE could not be held liable , within the meaning of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , since it was up to ORG to provide for the safety of all citizens of GPE from DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

Given the case - law provided by the parties , in their reasoning in those judgments where the said courts / different benches of the same court had indeed ruled in favour of the plaintiffs , the NORP authorities were deemed responsible for the lives and safety of all persons residing in GPE up until the actual transfer of effective control to ORG in respect of each of the municipalities considered separately ( see , for example , the judgment of ORG in GPE P.
