The applicant is a former teacher and former head of the ORG branch of ORG , PERSON . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant made a statement to the ORG S\u00f6z newspaper , giving an account of a meeting which had taken place on CARDINAL DATE between the applicant and a delegation of PERSON and the ORG Director . The applicant stated that the teachers were verbally abused , harassed and in some cases assaulted by the police . This account was published in an article titled \u201c CARDINAL teachers detained in GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided , as a penalty for the statement made to the newspaper without permission , to suspend the promotion of the applicant to a higher grade of teacher for DATE , pursuant to section CARDINAL/D - g of Law no . CARDINAL , which prohibited civil servants from giving information or giving statements to the press , news agencies , radio or television without authorisation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision was confirmed by ORG on DATE . The court noted that LAW no . CARDINAL prohibited public officials from making announcements or statements relating to their public - sector work to the press and that only the officials authorised by the minister could do so . While all citizens had the right to express their thoughts and opinions within the framework of the rights under the LAW , not all citizens had the same opportunity to exercise this right to the same degree . As stated in a decision of DATE ( DATE ) of ORG , ORG officials were required to exercise their freedom of expression in a more measured manner and with more care in their statements relating to their superiors and public officials . In this case , when the applicant expressed her thoughts and the negative aspects observed by her in the continuing arguments between teachers and police officers , she was criticising and accusing the administration . Accordingly , there was no contravention of the legislation in the decision to impose a disciplinary sanction on the applicant for the actions which were contrary to the special requirements of her service . Her application to annul the decision was unanimously rejected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , which on DATE sent the case back to ORG to revise only the severity of the penalty . It agreed that civil servants had to exercise their freedom of expression with greater care and sensitivity when making announcements about their superiors and public duties . Since the applicant had criticised the administration , which was in breach of LAW , it was appropriate to impose a disciplinary sanction but , in order to achieve a fair balance between the offence and the sentence , a lighter sentence should have been imposed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG maintained its decision and the penalty . The applicant appealed again to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG observed that the prohibition in section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL related to ORG officials not being allowed to give statements to the press relating to their own powers , duties and responsibilities . The applicant had expounded her personal opinion on current issues not relating to her duty , exercising her right of expression and communication to others , within the framework of the freedom of thought and opinion guaranteed by LAW . Since this did not fall within the scope of the aforementioned section , there was no question of any disciplinary sanction being imposed . Accordingly , the procedure by which the applicant had been punished by the suspension of DATE promotion in application of section QUANTITY was unlawful and the decision of ORG was not correct . ORG decision was consequently annulled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted the reasoning of ORG and annulled the disciplinary sanction imposed on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's husband , PERSON , was of NORP origin and also a teacher involved in FAC trade union . On DATE , at TIME , PERSON was shot dead on his way to work at a primary school . PERSON , who was accompanying him , was also killed . No classic autopsy was carried out . CARDINAL gendarmes arrived at the scene of the incident , allegedly having been notified by radio . They made no attempt to discover in which direction the perpetrators had fled . They took CARDINAL statement , from ORG , who had helped place PERSON body in a taxi to be taken to hospital . This was notwithstanding the crowd that had gathered at the scene according to ORG statement .", "CARDINAL . Prior to her husband 's killing , and following the incident at ORG , the applicant had received several threats over the telephone and had been harassed by the security forces . In the telephone calls , she was told : \u201c It is your turn , we are going to kill you too . \u201d She reported the threats to the public prosecutor but her complaints were ignored . Her husband had been detained by the police on several occasions prior to his death . When she was detained in DATE , the applicant claimed that members of the security forces told her that they had killed her husband .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor opened a file ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) into the killing , classifying it as an \u201c unknown perpetrator \u201d killing . On DATE the prosecutor issued an indictment against PERSON , a student , for involvement in CARDINAL murders and a number of assaults . These included the killing of PERSON , but not that of PERSON . PERSON was alleged to have carried out activities for ORG . In his statement of DATE , PERSON told the public prosecutor that he was not a member of ORG and that the CARDINAL-page statement signed by him at the headquarters of the anti - terrorism branch of ORG had been obtained through torture and that he refuted its contents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON maintained his denials before ORG no . CARDINAL . On DATE evidence was received from CARDINAL of the victims of the assaults listed in the indictment that they did not recognise any of the defendants .

During DATE in custody , the applicant was subjected to various forms of ill - treatment , including sexual abuse and psychological pressure . She was interrogated by police officers , who accused her of being involved with the ORG ( ORG of Kurdistan ) and questioned her about imminent elections and whether she was a candidate . She was also asked about her application to the Commission and told that this was the same as joining the ORG in the mountains . She thought she saw a piece of paper , which was her letter of authority sent to PERSON \u2013 a lawyer practising in GPE , who has been involved in many cases brought against GPE \u2013 with her application .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over the period of her detention , the applicant was exposed to the following treatment . She was generally blindfolded when taken out of her cell ; she was stripped naked on numerous occasions and , on one occasion , forced to walk a gauntlet , naked , between officers who touched her and abused her verbally ; photographs were taken of her naked ; on many occasions she was taken to a room where she was doused in hot and cold water , the cold water being hosed on her with such force that she could hardly stand ; she was subjected to electric shocks on several occasions , a wire being attached to her toe and once to a nipple ; there was an attempt to suspend her by her arms from the ceiling , which ended when a scar on her stomach was noticed ; she was struck on the chin by a blow which knocked her to the ground ; her cell was floodlit and loud music was played ; she was handcuffed to a door for a period of DATE and DATE and forced to listen to the sounds of other persons being ill - treated ; her hair was pulled and she was hit , including a blow to her foot with a stick . She was told that her children had been brought into detention and were being tortured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant signed a statement drawn up by the police , stating that she was a member of the ORG and implicating her in various propaganda activities conducted by the ORG . The statement included the information that she had made an application to the ORG about her husband 's murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and CARDINAL other detainees were taken by police officers to the emergency ward of ORG , where PERSON signed a report stating that they had not suffered any physical blows . She described the examination as involving the doctor asking them collectively in the presence of the police if anyone had any complaints or wanted a medical examination . She stated that she requested a medical examination and showed him the injuries on her head and toe . The applicant was then taken before a public prosecutor . She told him that she had been ill - treated , showing him some of her injuries , and that she had signed a statement under pressure . He ordered her release .", "CARDINAL . DATE after her release , the applicant sought treatment . She had a terrible pain in her jaw . An ear - nose - throat specialist arranged for an X - ray but refused to sign a report when the applicant told him that she had been in custody . Another X - ray was taken and treatment given at the university clinic . The applicant believed that her jaw had been broken and submitted PERSON to ORG during her trial on charges relating to the ORG . These X - rays were later made available to ORG . It was agreed by the parties that they did not disclose any fracture .", "CARDINAL . Following this period of detention , the applicant had a number of problems with her health . She provided the Commission with information and prescriptions relating , inter alia , to eczema on her ear , a respiratory infection and pains in her leg . On DATE she went to ORG , in connection with the psychological problems she had been experiencing since this time . Her symptoms included loss of memory , trembling of the hands , indecision , pain and numbness in parts of her body and insomnia . A psychological examination had disclosed manifest anxiety , pessimism , inability to stand , slight impairment of attention and concentration and lack of self - confidence . Chronic post - traumatic stress disorder was diagnosed and medication ( an antidepressant ( fluoxetin ) and an anxiolitic ) was prescribed . The applicant returned for further consultations on DATE , and DATE and DATE . On the last occasion , her complaints had diminished considerably and she was advised to continue the medication for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In reaching its findings , the ORG accepted the evidence of the applicant , assessing her as a lucid and convincing witness who gave the impression of being honest and credible . Her evidence was supported by that of her mother who gave evidence as to the terrible state the applicant was in on her release from custody and by the report from ORG of ORG concerning her psychological symptoms . It found the evidence of the police officers to be evasive , inconsistent and unreliable . It also found that the evidence of PERSON was unreliable , observing that the examinations of detainees in the busy emergency ward appeared to be undertaken with reluctance and were carried out cursorily , without any concern for complaints about ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was apprehended by the police along with a friend and colleague , Enver Atl\u0131 . They were taken to a doctor and then to ORG , where she was stripped and searched . She was blindfolded and questioned about the ill - treatment she had been subjected to in DATE . It was mentioned that she had complained at the NORP level . She was left in a cell where it was extremely cold . Enver Atl\u0131 was also blindfolded during questioning by officers when he was asked about his relations with the applicant and whether she was a member of the ORG . They were released at TIME on DATE . The release record of that date indicated that they had both been detained for investigation about membership of and activities for the ORG but that the examination established that they were not involved .", "CARDINAL . The Government alleged that the applicant had been detained because of the forgery of a document . However , the ORG found that there was no evidence to support this assertion . There was insufficient material to support a conclusion that she was taken into custody because of her application to the ORG . It noted , however , the lack of any concrete elements to justify her detention in respect of allegations of ORG involvement , which gave the incident the appearance of a \u201c fishing expedition \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was summoned to give a statement to the public prosecutor . Although he did not wish to see her until DATE , police took her to ORG early in the morning on DATE . She remained sleeping on a sofa until a senior officer allowed her to go home in the afternoon . She returned at TIME with her mother on DATE . They were kept waiting in a locked room until the afternoon , when she was questioned by the prosecutor about a publication of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG public prosecutor issued a decision of non - prosecution against CARDINAL officers , PERSON and PERSON , in respect of an allegation that the applicant had been tortured in custody and that her jaw had been broken . The decision referred to the defendants ' denial of the charges and to the doctor 's report that the applicant bore no signs of blows on her release . Due to the absence of evidence , it was decided not to pursue the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The Government have since provided further information . On CARDINAL DATE , in a decision of non - jurisdiction , the ORG public prosecutor referred to the allegations made by the applicant that she had been tortured during interrogation . As he had no jurisdiction , he transferred the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The contents of the investigation file concerning the death of the applicant 's husband were provided to the ORG . Further documents concerning the proceedings against PERSON were provided to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged with the ORG a copy of the so - called GPE report , produced at the request of the Prime Minister by Mr Kutlu Sava\u015f , Vice - President of ORG within ORG . After receiving the report in DATE , the Prime Minister made it available to the public , although CARDINAL pages and certain annexes were withheld .", "CARDINAL . The introduction states that the report was not based on a judicial investigation and did not constitute a formal investigative report . It was intended for information purposes and purported to do no more than describe certain events which had occurred mainly in south - east GPE and which tended to confirm the existence of unlawful dealings between political figures , government institutions and clandestine groups .", "CARDINAL . The report analyses a series of events , such as murders carried out under orders , the killings of well - known figures or supporters of the NORP and deliberate acts by a group of \u201c informants \u201d supposedly serving the ORG , and concludes that there is a connection between the fight to eradicate terrorism in the region and the underground relations that have been formed as a result , particularly in the drug - trafficking sphere . The report made reference to a certain PERSON , also known as PERSON or \u201c LOC \u201d , detailing his involvement in unlawful acts in the south - east and his links with M\u0130T ( the NORP intelligence service ) :", "\u201c ... Whilst the character of PERSON , and the fact that he along with the group of confessors [ ] he gathered around himself , is the perpetrator of offences such as extortion , seizure by force , assault on homes , rape , robbery , murder , torture , kidnapping , etc . , were known , it is more difficult to explain the collaboration of the public authorities with this individual . It is possible that a respected organisation such as ORG may use a lowly individual ... it is not an acceptable practice that ORG should have used LOC several times ... LOC , who carried out activities in GPE under the name of ORG , in GPE under the name of ORG and used the name PERSON , is an individual whose activities and presence were known both by the police and M\u0130T ... As a result of the ORG 's silence the field is left open to the gangs ... [ p. CARDINAL ] .", "... PERSON was also associated with GPE , an organisation within the gendarmerie , which used large numbers of protectors and confessors [ p. CARDINAL ] .", "In his confession to ORG , ... PERSON ... had stated that PERSON [ ] [ p. CARDINAL ] would say from time to time that he had planned and procured the murder of PERSON [ ] and other partisans from the mafia and the ORG who had been killed in the same way ... The murder of ... PERSON [ ] had also been planned and carried out by PERSON [ p. CARDINAL ] .", "All the relevant ORG bodies were aware of these activities and operations . ... When the characteristics of the individuals killed in the operations in question are examined , the difference between those NORP supporters who were killed in the region in which a state of emergency had been declared and those who were not lay in the financial strength the latter presented in economic terms . These factors also operated in the murder of PERSON , a smuggler and pro - ORG activist . They equally applied to PERSON , ORG and ORG . The sole disagreement we have with what was done relates to the form of the procedure and its results . It has been established that there was regret at the murder of PERSON , even among those who approved of all the incidents . It is said that PERSON was not involved in any armed action , that he was more concerned with the philosophy of the matter and that the effect created by his murder exceeded his own real influence and that the decision to murder him was a mistake . ( Information about these people is to be found in DATE [ ] ) . Other journalists have also been murdered [ p. CARDINAL ] [ ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The report concludes with numerous recommendations , such as improving coordination and communication between the different branches of the security , police and intelligence departments ; identifying and dismissing security - force personnel implicated in illegal activities ; limiting the use of confessors ; reducing the number of village guards ; terminating the use of ORG outside the south - east region and incorporating it into the police outside that area ; opening investigations into various incidents ; taking steps to suppress gang and drug - smuggling activities ; and recommending that the results of ORG inquiry be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for the relevant proceedings to be undertaken .", "CARDINAL . The applicant provided this DATE report into extra - judicial or \u201c unknown perpetrator \u201d killings by a parliamentary investigation commission of ORG . The report referred to CARDINAL unsolved killings , of which CARDINAL involved journalists . It commented on the public lack of confidence in the authorities in the south - east region and referred to information that ORG had a camp in the Batman region where they received political and military training and assistance from the security forces . It concluded that there was a lack of accountability in the region and that some groups with official roles might be implicated in the killings .", "CARDINAL . The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW all forms of homicide ( Articles DATE ) and attempted homicide ( Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) constitute criminal offences .

By Article CARDINAL of LAW , any public official who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor 's office an offence of which he has become aware in the exercise of his duties is liable to imprisonment .", "A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the case of alleged terrorist offences , the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of national security prosecutors and courts established throughout GPE .", "CARDINAL . If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties , the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by the Law of DATE on the prosecution of civil servants , which restricts the public prosecutor 's jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings . In such cases it is for the relevant local administrative council ( for the district or province , depending on the suspect 's status ) to conduct the preliminary investigation and , consequently , to decide whether to prosecute . Once a decision to prosecute has been taken , it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case .", "An appeal to ORG lies against a decision of the council . If a decision not to prosecute is taken , the case is automatically referred to that court .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of DATE , paragraph ( i ) , of Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE on the authority of the governor of a state of emergency region , the DATE PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) also applies to members of the security forces who come under the governor 's authority .", "CARDINAL .

ORG for the Prevention of Torture ( CPT ) has carried out seven visits to GPE . The first CARDINAL visits , in DATE and DATE , were ad hoc visits considered necessary in light of the considerable number of reports received from a variety of sources , containing allegations of torture or other forms of ill - treatment of persons deprived of their liberty , in particular , those held in police custody . A third periodic visit took place at DATE . Further visits took place in DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE . The ORG 's reports on these visits , save that of DATE , have not been made public , such publication requiring the consent of the ORG concerned , which has not been forthcoming . The ORG has issued CARDINAL public statements concerning its visits to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its public statement adopted on DATE , the ORG concluded that torture and other forms of severe ill - treatment were important characteristics of police custody . On its first visit in DATE , the following types of ill - treatment were constantly alleged , namely , \u201c NORP hanging \u201d , electric shocks , beating of the soles of the feet ( falaka ) , hosing with pressurised cold water and incarceration in very small , dark , unventilated cells . Its medical examinations disclosed clear medical signs consistent with very recent torture and other severe ill - treatment of both a physical and psychological nature . Specifically , it found that officers of the anti - terrorism branch of the GPE police frequently resorted to torture and/or other forms of severe ill - treatment , both physical and psychological .", "On its second visit in DATE , it found no progress had been made in eliminating torture and ill - treatment by the police . Many persons complained of similar types of ill - treatment DATE an increasing number of allegations were heard of forcible penetration of bodily orifices with a stick or truncheon . Once again , a number of the persons making such claims were found on examination to display marks or conditions consistent with their allegations . Torture and other forms of severe ill - treatment continued unabated at the headquarters of the anti - terrorism branch of the LOC police . On its third visit , from DATE to DATE , the ORG delegation was inundated with allegations of torture and ill - treatment . Numerous persons examined by its doctors displayed marks or conditions consistent with their allegations . It listed a number of these cases . On this visit , the ORG had visited ORG , where a prisoner at FAC displayed haematomas on the soles of his feet and a series of vertical purple stripes ( QUANTITY long by QUANTITY wide ) across the upper part of his back , consistent with his allegation that he had recently been subjected to falaka and beaten on the back with a truncheon while in police custody . At the headquarters of GPE and ORG , it found equipment that could be used for torture and the presence of which had no other credible explanation . The ORG concluded in its statement that \u201c the practice of torture and other forms of severe ill - treatment of persons in police custody remains widespread in GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In its second public statement , issued on DATE , the ORG noted that some progress had been made over DATE . However , its findings after its visit in DATE demonstrated that torture and other forms of ill - treatment were still important characteristics of police custody . In the course of visits in DATE , ORG delegations once again found clear evidence of the practice of torture and other forms of severe ill - treatment by the police . It referred to its most recent visit in DATE to police establishments in GPE , ORG and GPE , when it also went to CARDINAL prisons in order to interview certain persons who had very recently been in police custody in GPE and GPE . A considerable number of persons examined by the delegation 's forensic doctors displayed marks or conditions consistent with their allegations of recent ill - treatment by the police and , in particular , of beating of the soles of the feet , blows to the palms of the hands and suspension by the arms . It noted the cases of QUANTITY persons who had been very recently detained at the headquarters of the anti - terrorism branch of ORG and which ranked among the most flagrant examples of torture encountered by ORG delegations in GPE . They showed signs of prolonged suspension by the arms , with impairments in motor function and sensation which , in QUANTITY persons , who had lost the use of both arms , threatened to be irreversible . It concluded that resort to torture and other forms of severe ill - treatment remained a common occurrence in police establishments in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG underlined the importance of the preventive role of doctors :", "\u201c Particular reference should be made to the work of doctors appointed by the ORG to carry out forensic tasks , a matter to which the ORG has given considerable attention in the course of its dialogue with the NORP authorities . The present system of detained persons being routinely examined by a forensic doctor at the end of their period of police custody is , in principle , a significant safeguard against ill - treatment . However , certain conditions must be met : the forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence , have been provided with specialised training and been allocated a mandate which is sufficiently broad in scope . If these conditions are not met DATE as is frequently the case \u2013 the present system can have the perverse effect of rendering it all the more difficult to combat torture and ill - treatment .", "A series of circulars have been issued by ORG on this subject ; in particular , a ORG of DATE subsequently endorsed in the Minister of the ORG 's instructions of DATE sets out the required contents of forensic certificates drawn up following the detention of persons detained by law enforcement agencies . Despite this , the great majority of forensic certificates seen by the ORG over DATE have not met the requirements of that circular .", "Measures need to be taken to ensure that there is full compliance with all the above - mentioned circulars and , more generally , that doctors called upon to perform forensic tasks can carry out their work free from any interference . Further the necessary resources should be made available in order to allow the training programme for doctors called upon to perform forensic tasks \u2013 recently devised by ORG \u2013 to be implemented throughout GPE without delay . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG again stressed the need for public prosecutors to react expeditiously and effectively when confronted by complaints of torture and ill - treatment and the need for the reduction of maximum periods of police custody .", "CARDINAL . The ORG repeated in this report , inter alia , its concerns about the forensic examination of persons in police custody , emphasising that examination of persons in custody by a doctor can be a significant safeguard against ill - treatment , provided the doctors concerned enjoy formal and de facto independence , have a mandate which is sufficiently broad in scope and have been provided with specialised training . It had found , however , that the standard forensic medical form set out in ORG circular of DATE was not used in many forensic services , the doctors recording their findings on a piece of paper devoid of headings , omitting to record the allegations of the detained person and failing to draw conclusions . It recalled that it had previously stressed that it was essential for forensic certificates drawn up after examination of a detained person to contain an account of the relevant statements of the detainee , an account of the objective medical findings based on a thorough medical examination and the doctor 's conclusions in light of those CARDINAL elements , which should include an assessment of the degree of consistency between any allegations made and the objective medical findings .", "CARDINAL . It expressed the hope that generalised use of the standard forensic medical form would put an end to the collective forensic examination of groups of detained persons , an undesirable practice of which it had found some evidence during its visit . It had also noted that certain forensic examinations were conducted in the presence of the police officers who had brought the detained person and that the doctor handed an open copy of the report to these police officers . It stressed that examinations should always be conducted out of the hearing range and out of sight of the police officers , unless the doctor requested otherwise in a particular case . It welcomed the steps taken to ensure that the forensic reports be forwarded in sealed envelopes to the public prosecutor and the head of the police department concerned ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
