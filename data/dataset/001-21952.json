SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Denho Ay and PERSON , a married couple born in DATE and DATE , respectively , are NORP citizens residing in GPE in GPE . Before the ORG they are represented by Mr PERSON , a legal advisor practising in GPE .", "The applicants entered GPE in DATE together with their CARDINAL children and applied for asylum .", "The first applicant and CARDINAL of the applicants\u2019 children commenced work , whereupon , based on LAW ) in force at the time , they were each obliged to pay , as a surety ( Sicherheit ) for welfare benefits obtained , PERCENT of their salary to a special closed account of ORG ; henceforth ORG ) .", "On DATE ORG refused the ORG request for asylum , though they were permitted provisionally to remain in GPE . Upon the applicants\u2019 appeal , ORG ( Asylrekurskommission ) ordered ORG on DATE to accept the applicants as refugees and to grant them asylum . This , ORG did on DATE .", "On DATE ORG prepared a final balance ( Abrechnung ) of the CARDINAL closed accounts of the applicants and their CARDINAL children . ORG considered that the amounts of the CARDINAL accounts totalled MONEY ( CHF ) , whereas the applicants had obtained welfare benefits in the amount of CHF CARDINAL . As a result , it informed the applicants that no money could be paid back from the account , though they would only be requested to compensate the outstanding amount of CHF MONEY within the limits of the former LAW of LAW in force at the time .", "On DATE the applicants filed an appeal with ORG and Police ( Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Justiz- und NORP , henceforth ORG ) . Therein , and in subsequent submissions , the applicants requested ORG to pay them back the entire amount of the closed surety account . They claimed that their recognition as refugees was declaratory and hence had retroactive character . Thus , their status as refugees extended back to the moment when they entered GPE . The law only required a surety from asylum seekers , i.e. persons applying for the status of refugee , but not from refugees themselves . As the applicants had had refugee status from the outset , the amounts on the surety account should be paid out to them . The applicants also complained , inter alia , of procedural errors and that they had been discriminated against as foreigners .", "On DATE ORG prepared a new , amended balance of the CARDINAL closed accounts of the applicants . It considered that the applicants\u2019 children had , at the relevant time , not yet been of age for which reason they were not obliged to pay back the welfare benefits obtained , and they would receive the amounts paid into their closed accounts . In respect of the first applicant , ORG considered that his account contained CHF MONEY and that , after deduction of welfare benefits amounting to CHF CARDINAL , there remained a negative balance of CHF MONEY . The applicants would not , however , be obliged to pay back this amount according to LAW of LAW .", "On DATE ORG confirmed that the remaining debt ( ORG ) for the applicants arising from the welfare benefits amounted to CHF MONEY , though this amount would not be collected as long as the applicants had no means and the payment appeared unreasonable .", "The applicants\u2019 appeal of CARDINAL DATE was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The decision noted that the applicants were contesting , not a particular amount , but the obligation in principle to pay back the welfare benefits out of the closed account , alleging that their recognition as refugees had retroactive effect . However , the rights under LAW only applied upon recognition of a person as a refugee . The specific obligation for persons applying for asylum to provide for a surety was not affected by the subsequent decision to award refugee status to a person . The decision continued :", "\u201c ( I)t must be emphasised that the lower authority was entitled , regardless of whether the status of asylum was granted , to deduct from the [ first ] applicant \u2019s surety account a global sum in respect of the welfare benefits obtained both by him and his wife during the asylum proceedings . It will not depend on the applicants\u2019 economic situation whether or not it is admissible to deduct this amount . For this reason , the lower authority did not have to undertake any investigations in this respect . The applicants have not proved lower welfare expenses and indeed do not contest the amounts to be deducted . As a result , the contested decision is lawful and the complaint must be dismissed ... \u201d", "LAW in force at the relevant time provided in Sections CARDINALa \u00a7 DATE that both refugees and persons applying for such a status , were entitled to welfare benefits if they could not afford to pay for their own subsistence . According to LAW :", "\u201c if the recipient of welfare benefits subsequently obtains means which secure to him and his family an adequate subsistence , he will have to pay back the benefits to the extent that this is reasonable . \u201d", "Section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL specifically concerned persons applying for the status of refugee . These persons were obliged , in addition , to provide a surety for future welfare costs . The percentage of the person \u2019s salary to be paid would be decided by the competent cantonal authority .", "In practice , a surety bank account was opened , and the employer of the person concerned would directly transfer the contributions to this account .", "In respect of the closing of the account , LAW of LAW no . CARDINAL , GPE , in force at the time ) provided as follows :", "CARDINAL . Once the asylum proceedings have been concluded and the applicant \u2019s residence situation in GPE has been settled by means of a residence permit or a provisional stay , ... ORG [ for Refugees ] shall order the transfer to ORG amounts to be paid back for social security and implementation .", "CARDINAL . The ORG shall furthermore order the final balance ( GPE ) and the transfer of any credit to an account mentioned by the applicant . The final balance shall be transmitted to the applicant subject to \u00a7 CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . If the residence situation of an applicant , who is not a refugee , has been settled by means of a provisional stay , the surety account will remain open . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
