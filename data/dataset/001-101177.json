GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Art. 5-1", "JUDGES": "Ganna Yudkivska;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG convicted the applicant on CARDINAL counts of attempted burglary as a member of a gang . Including the sentence imposed for a previous conviction of attempted burglary , the court fixed a cumulative sentence of DATE imprisonment and ordered the applicant 's preventive detention pursuant to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that , having regard to his personality and to his numerous previous convictions of burglary , the applicant had a disposition to commit serious offences causing serious economic damage and was therefore dangerous to the public . The applicant had repeatedly declared that the burglaries he had committed , which had been aimed at obtaining CARDINAL NORP and of which he had made his living , were not immoral . As confirmed by a psychiatric expert , the applicant , who was of at least average intelligence , was therefore liable to reoffend . The judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his full prison sentence until DATE . Since DATE the applicant has been in preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , sitting as a chamber for the execution of sentences ( PERSON ) , decided that the applicant should be kept in preventive detention following the end of his prison term on DATE . Relying on Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the court considered that his preventive detention was still necessary in view of the objective of such detention .", "CARDINAL . ORG , agreeing with the views taken by the director of FAC and by ORG , found that the applicant was very liable to reoffend and to commit serious offences if released ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It noted that the applicant , who was represented in the proceedings by a courtappointed defence counsel but had refused to participate in an oral hearing , had numerous previous convictions of burglary for which he had spent already DATE in prison . He had always made his living outside prison from crime and had hardly worked in prison , arguing that the remuneration for his work was insufficient . The applicant insisted that the police had arrested him by having recourse to illegal methods of investigation and that he had wrongfully been convicted . He thus failed to accept that the court was bound by the findings in the final judgment of ORG . The applicant was free to deny having committed the offences he was convicted of by that final judgment in DATE , which as such did not mean that he risked being found to be a recidivist . However , he refused to reappraise his entire criminal past . The findings of the psychiatric expert consulted by ORG on the applicant 's personality were therefore still valid . The fact that the applicant could stay with his son or with a writer when released did not warrant the conclusion that he would not reoffend on release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He argued that his preventive detention violated the right to liberty and the prohibition on punishment without guilt under LAW . His preventive detention also breached the prohibition of torture in that it was aimed at extracting from him a confession to the offences for which he had been convicted in DATE . Moreover , the proceedings before ORG had been unfair because that court had refused to verify the police methods of investigation leading to his arrest and conviction .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ( which the applicant received on DATE ) ORG declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Aachen ORG , in review proceedings pursuant to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and LAW of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , allowed ORG request and refused to suspend the applicant 's placement in preventive detention on probation .", "CARDINAL . Having heard the applicant , represented by counsel , in person , ORG found that he was still liable to reoffend if released . It referred to the findings in its previous decision of DATE not to suspend the applicant 's placement in preventive detention on probation and argued that there had been no developments indicating that the applicant was now less likely to be recidivist . His numerous previous convictions showed that he had chosen at an early stage to make his living from crime . Having regard to the report submitted by the director of ORG , who had opposed to the suspension on probation of the applicant 's placement in preventive detention , ORG noted that since his dismissal from his job as editorial journalist of the prison journal for misuse of the computer made available for editing that journal , the applicant was out of work due to his own fault . As the applicant refused any therapy , there was no expert opinion on him and thus no visible positive development .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It took the view that his preventive detention was covered by LAW ( a ) of the LAW . It further confirmed that the applicant 's final convictions could not be reviewed in the proceedings at issue , but could only be subject of reopening proceedings . Even assuming that the applicant , as he had claimed , had been dismissed from his job as editing journalist of the prison journal without good cause , this did not alter the fact that owing to his disrespect for the property of others , he was liable to reoffend if released . Whilst the applicant did not sell the house he owned ( valued at some EUR CARDINAL ) , he did not have at his disposal the necessary funds to make his living so that there was a risk that he would reoffend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He claimed that his detention , being a preventive measure , violated his right to liberty . Moreover , it breached the prohibition of torture in that it was aimed at extracting from him a confession to the offences he had been convicted of . The low remuneration for his forced labour disregarded human dignity . The courts ' refusal to review the lawfulness of his criminal convictions also violated LAW as the court proceedings at issue were ineffective without doing so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . While in preventive detention , the applicant worked for a private company DATE and DATE and as editorial journalist for the prison journal DATE . He was paid an average of some ORG DATE by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE Office for the Execution of Sentences ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant 's objection to his wage slip . It noted that the applicant 's remuneration was in accordance with the rates fixed in LAW . It argued that his wage was not unreasonably low , given that the remuneration included other advantages and that the Land paid contributions to the unemployment insurance and did not deduct a contribution to the cost of keeping him in prison from his wages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed as illfounded the applicant 's request for judicial review of the low remuneration for his prison work , for which he claimed some ORG CARDINAL net per month , and of the failure of the prison authorities to disclose the financial agreement between them and the private company he worked for . It took the view that the remuneration for prison work , which had recently been raised by MONEY in order to comply with a judgment of ORG of DATE , was constitutional . Endorsing the reasons given by the GPE Office for ORG , the court argued that if prisoners received a higher remuneration , private companies might no longer place any orders in view of the considerably lower productivity of prisoners and prisoners would then not be able to work at all . As the applicant 's remuneration was lawful , he could not claim the disclosure of the terms of the contract concluded between the prison authorities and the private company .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on points of law as inadmissible . It found that a review of ORG decision was not necessary for the development of the law or in order to secure consistency in the case - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He argued that the unduly low remuneration for his prison work was degrading and disregarded human dignity . Moreover , the failure of the prison authorities to disclose the wage paid to them by the private company for his work breached his right to effective judicial review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG 's judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) . The provisions relevant in the present case can be summarised as follows :", "CARDINAL . The German Criminal Code distinguishes between penalties ( GPE ) and socalled measures of correction and prevention ( Ma\u00dfregeln der Besserung und GPE ) to deal with unlawful acts . Preventive detention ( LAW seq . of LAW ) is classified as a measure of correction and prevention . The purpose of such measures is to rehabilitate dangerous offenders or to protect the public from them . They may be ordered for offenders in addition to their punishment ( compare Articles CARDINAL et seq . ) . They must , however , be proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed by , or to be expected from , the defendants as well as to their dangerousness ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The sentencing court may , at the time of the offender 's conviction , order his preventive detention under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence if the offender has been shown to be dangerous to the public ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to DATE imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied . Firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public ( see LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALc of the Criminal Code governs orders for the preventive detention of convicted persons which are not executed immediately after the judgment ordering them becomes final . Paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW provides that if a term of imprisonment is executed prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention , the court responsible for the execution of sentences ( that is , a special ORG composed of CARDINAL professional judges , see sections ORG and CARDINAL ) of LAW ) must review , before completion of the prison term , whether the person 's preventive detention is still necessary in view of its objective . If that is not the case , it suspends on probation the execution of the preventive detention order ; supervision of the person 's conduct ( GPE ) commences with suspension .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , in its versions in force as of DATE , lays down rules on judicial review of the placement in preventive detention . If there is no provision for a maximum duration of the measure of correction and prevention or if the time - limit has not yet expired , the court ( i.e. the chamber responsible for the execution of sentences ) shall suspend on probation further execution of the detention order as soon as it is to be expected that the person concerned will not commit any further unlawful acts on his or her release . Suspension shall automatically entail supervision of the conduct of the offender ( paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW the court ( i.e. the chamber responsible for the execution of sentences ) may review at any time whether the further execution of the preventive detention order should be suspended on probation . It is obliged to do so within fixed time - limits ( paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) . For persons in preventive detention , this timelimit is DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
