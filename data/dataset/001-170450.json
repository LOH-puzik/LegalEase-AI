The article also mentioned that DATE previously another police officer had caused a traffic accident in LOC in which CARDINAL children had received fatal injuries , but that the criminal proceedings against the officer had been discontinued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the website of NORP rytas carried an article headlined \u201c After horrific accident in GPE [ the Minister of the Interior ] suggests [ the Police Commissioner General ] should resign \u201d . It quoted a statement made by the Minister :", "\u201c Apologies will not suffice . The chief of the police must assume personal responsibility for this terrible incident . Especially as this was not the first time that police officers , who are supposed to stop traffic violations , have themselves caused terrible accidents . If I do not receive any reaction from the police chief , I believe that further efforts to improve the work of the police will be impossible and I will be ready to step down myself . \u201d", "The Police Commissioner General told journalists that he \u201c accepted responsibility \u201d because \u201c the chief is responsible for what happens in the police organisation \u201d . However , he expressed doubts whether \u201c every such incident \u201d should lead to the resignation of senior police officers .", "The article also quoted the President \u2019s spokesperson as questioning \u201c how many more victims of the war on the roads will it take for politicians and ORG officials to finally notice and start solving the problems on the roads \u201d .

On DATE the Police Commissioner General and the Minister of the ORG resigned . In an official statement issued on DATE , the President of GPE stated :", "\u201c Over DATE the whole of GPE has shared the pain of [ the CARDINAL families ] who lost their children in an accident caused by a police officer . The seventh of DATE was not only the day of their tragedy but also reflected a serious crisis within the police force . The tragedy in LOC emphasised the problems ingrained in the system of interior affairs and further diminished public trust in the police . The loss of children \u2019s lives , the crime committed by an officer and its circumstances require clear answers why that happened , and determined solutions . It is intolerable that crimes committed by officers are justified or punished by relatively mild sentences .", "A police officer must feel a higher degree of responsibility than an ordinary citizen and he must by his actions set an example to society because he has been obliged by the ORG to protect public order and thus ensure the safety of society . A crime committed by an officer can not be a simple statistical fact . It must be thoroughly examined and especially strictly evaluated ( kruop\u0161\u010diai i\u0161tirtas ir itin grie\u017etai \u012fvertintas ) .", "... \u201d", "The rest of the statement discussed problems within the police force , such as a lack of qualified personnel , inadequate training and low pay .

Many more articles in the press reported on the accident , the suspicion that the applicant had driven while being drunk , the funerals of the CARDINAL children , reactions within the village , public protests in front of NORP police station , previous traffic accidents caused by police officers , and the resignations of the Minister of the Interior and the Police Commissioner General .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with a breach of road traffic safety regulations while being under the influence of alcohol which resulted in the death of other persons ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) and with a failure to provide assistance to persons in a life - threatening situation ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the rules of territorial jurisdiction , the case against the applicant should have been examined by ORG . However , it was transferred to ORG because CARDINAL of the ORG judges had participated in the pre - trial investigation and the chairperson of the court had previously worked with the applicant \u2019s father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG began its examination of the applicant \u2019s case . The court heard testimony from the applicant , his colleague PERSON , who had been in the car with the applicant at the time of the accident , and another colleague PERSON , who had been driving in a different car and had helped the applicant to leave the scene of the accident . It also heard other workmates who had seen the applicant before or soon after the accident , as well as the waitress from the restaurant where the applicant and PERSON had had lunch before the accident , the parents of the CARDINAL children who had died , residents of the village who had witnessed the accident , and several court - appointed experts .", "The applicant admitted that he had been driving the car and that the CARDINAL children had died as a result of the accident . However , he stated that he had not been drunk and had not exceeded the speed limit . He also argued that the accident had been caused by the weather and the reckless actions of some of the children .", "CARDINAL . All the hearings were held in public as none of the parties had asked for them to be closed , and several newspapers reported on the witness evidence . In a number of publications the applicant was called \u201c a killer of children \u201d ( vaik\u0173 \u017eudikas ) and mocked for \u201c suddenly losing his memory \u201d ( staiga sutriko atmintis ) when testifying in court . The colleagues who testified in favour of the applicant were collectively called \u201c defenders of the killer of children \u201d ( vaik\u0173 \u017eudiko u\u017etar\u0117jai ) who were \u201c trying to get him off \u201d ( bando i\u0161sukti ) . The newspapers also expressed sympathy to the children \u2019s families for having to \u201c relive those cruel events \u201d . Excerpts of the testimony of many of the witnesses , both in favour of and against the applicant , as well as the applicant \u2019s final statement , were reprinted word - for - word .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of both charges . The court established that the accident had occurred when the applicant had been under the influence of alcohol . It examined a video - recording from the restaurant where the applicant and PERSON had had lunch before the accident , showing that the CARDINAL men had each drunk CARDINAL a bottle of vodka . Another video - recording from the petrol station in which the applicant and PERSON had stopped after lunch showed the applicant buying CARDINAL more bottles of vodka . Several witnesses \u2013 the waitress from the restaurant , some of the applicant \u2019s colleagues , and people who had been present when the accident had happened \u2013 stated that the applicant had looked and sounded drunk . On the basis of that evidence , the court found that before the accident the applicant had consumed CARDINAL grams of alcohol . A court - appointed expert stated that after consuming so much alcohol the alcohol level in the applicant \u2019s blood must definitely have been above the legally permitted threshold of CARDINAL per mille ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court also noted that even though tests of the applicant \u2019s blood and urine had not detected any traces of alcohol , they had not been reliable because they had been taken TIME after the accident . The court held that since the applicant had deliberately hidden from the authorities during that period and had only given himself up TIME after the accident ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , he could not use the negative blood and urine tests to his advantage .", "CARDINAL . ORG also established that at the time of the accident the applicant \u2019s car must have been going at a speed of CARDINAL km / h . A court - appointed expert examined the tyre marks at the scene of the accident , the damage done to nearby objects and the positions in which the CARDINAL children had been found , and reconstructed the course of events of the accident . The applicant \u2019s colleague PERSON , who had been driving in the car behind the applicant , testified that he himself had been going at QUANTITY / h but had been unable to keep up with the applicant . Several people who had been present at the accident also stated that the noise made by the applicant \u2019s car had indicated a very high speed . The court noted that the speed limit in the village was QUANTITY / h and that this must have been known to the applicant , who had worked as a police officer in the area . The court concluded that the accident had been caused by the excessive speed of the applicant \u2019s car and not by the weather or the actions of the children .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found the applicant guilty of failing to provide assistance to persons in a life - threatening situation . The court noted that the applicant had not shown any interest in the condition of the CARDINAL children or called an ambulance but had immediately fled the scene of the accident . The court observed that the obligation to help people in lifethreatening situations was enshrined in the Law on Police Activity , with which the applicant had had to comply . By failing to do so , he had breached LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court found no mitigating circumstances in the applicant \u2019s favour . However , the fact that the victims had been minors was considered as an aggravating circumstance . The court also took the applicant \u2019s character and his behaviour during and after the accident into account : he had been under the influence of alcohol , CARDINAL people had died as a result of his actions , he had fled from the scene of the accident , had not expressed any remorse , had attempted to mislead the court by providing contradictory testimony , and his actions had discredited the authority of the police . As a result , ORG held that the applicant \u2019s punishment should be close to the maximum provided by law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He was given a consolidated sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , prohibited from driving a vehicle for DATE , and ordered to pay a total of CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) in non - pecuniary damages to the families of the CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . Reporting on the sentence , NORP rytas quoted excerpts from the judgment and published a brief statement by the mother of CARDINAL of the children , who expressed her overall satisfaction with the judgment but stated that criminal laws should be changed to provide for stricter punishments .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment . Among other things , he argued that he had not received a fair trial because of a media campaign against him . He argued that the media had ridiculed and discouraged the witnesses who had testified in his favour and that journalists and high - level ORG officials had urged the court to order the strictest sentence possible . The applicant stated that this had prevented the first - instance court from examining his case objectively . The applicant also argued that he had been given a stricter punishment because he was a police officer , which had constituted discrimination on the grounds of social status .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly amended the first - instance judgment . It upheld the lower court \u2019s findings concerning the applicant \u2019s drunkenness and the speed of his car , and dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning discrimination . However , ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s argument that the age of the victims should not have been considered as an aggravating circumstance because the criminal offence had not been premeditated . Accordingly , the court reduced the consolidated sentence to DATE imprisonment . It also considered that the amount of non - pecuniary damages awarded by the first - instance court had been excessive and not reasonably related to the applicant \u2019s means . Instead , the court awarded a total of LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) to the CARDINAL families . The prohibition on driving a vehicle for DATE was upheld .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the applicant \u2019s complaints concerning the lack of a fair trial , ORG stated that the media interest in the case had been understandable owing to its sensitive nature and that the media could not be prevented from reporting on public hearings . However , the court held that the first - instance judgment had been well - reasoned and based on reliable evidence , so there were no grounds to find that the judges had been influenced by the media or the statements of any of the officials .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed a cassation appeal by the applicant and upheld the judgment of ORG . It stated that the appellate court had provided an adequate examination of the applicant \u2019s complaints concerning the fairness of his trial and that there was no need to re - examine them .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was released on probation . According to the Government \u2019s observations submitted to ORG DATE , the applicant had up to that date paid a total of LTL MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in non - pecuniary damages to the GPE families ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
