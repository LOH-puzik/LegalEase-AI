From DATE until the pre - trial investigations were completed and the case was referred to ORG of GPE for trial on DATE , the courts at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction ordered the ORG continued detention . The courts based their decisions mainly on the grounds that the case was complex and the investigations were pending , that the applicants were accused of serious crimes , that they might evade investigation and trial and obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case , and that they might continue committing crimes . No further details were given by the courts . Some of the decisions also contained a statement that the applicants\u2019 state of health and family situation had been duly noted .

Because of the ill - treatment , the first applicant refused to be questioned on DATE . His refusal was recorded in the case file .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the prosecutors rejected the complaints as unsubstantiated , finding that there was no evidence that the first applicant \u2019s bruises had been inflicted by police officers . The ORG decision was principally based on the statements of the police officers who had taken part in the first applicant \u2019s arrest and those who had been in contact with him afterwards . Those police officers stated that the first applicant had not been subjected to \u201c physical or psychological coercion \u201d and that he had not raised any complaints in that regard on DATE .

At the police station , he had been detained alone in a cell and \u201c without constant supervision \u201d of the police .

During the search of that car the first applicant had insulted officer PERSON The incident had been witnessed by other people .", "CARDINAL . In their decision , the prosecutors also referred to the statements of the doctor who had examined the first applicant on DATE , obtained during the inquiry .

NORP The ORG decision was eventually upheld by the courts of first and appeal instances on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the ORG findings , ORG and ORG dealing with the applicants\u2019 criminal case also rejected identical complaints lodged by the first applicant , finding that the \u201c possible use of force in the course of his arrest had had no impact on [ his defence ] position in the case \u201d , as the first applicant had not confessed to having committed the crimes of which he had been suspected at the pre - trial stage ( see , in particular , paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .
