NORP The applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr A .- PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant entered GPE and , on DATE , he applied to ORG ( Migrationsverket ) for asylum and a residence permit . A first interview was scheduled in order to establish the grounds for the applicant \u2019s request for asylum but he did not appear for this meeting . ORG then called him to a new interview on DATE which he attended . At the interview , the applicant claimed that he did not know where he had been born or raised and that he had never held a passport or an identification card . He did not know the whereabouts of his parents either but stated that he had been working as a shepherd in LOC ( a region under NORP authority ) . A friend , who had \u201c felt sorry for him \u201d and had wanted to give him the possibility of a better life , had helped him to leave his home country .", "CARDINAL . A language analysis , carried out in DATE , showed that the applicant had tried to conceal his real dialect but that it still appeared from the test that he came from GPE . He did not attend any further meetings with ORG or his legal representative , despite being called repeatedly .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Swedish Security Police ( S\u00e4kerhetspolisen ) , in a submission to ORG , stated that they had certain information about the applicant which indicated that he could become involved in activities that threatened the security of the nation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application , essentially because he had failed to participate in the asylum investigation and had not stated that he risked being persecuted or harassed in his home country . Thus , ORG concluded that the applicant himself did not feel that he was in need of protection in GPE . Since the applicant had disappeared , the decision could not be communicated to him .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was apprehended by the NORP police when he tried to enter the country with a fake NORP passport and holding an airplane ticket to GPE . He had tried to conceal his identity by giving CARDINAL other names , different from that given to the NORP authorities , to the NORP authorities but they had discovered this . Consequently , in accordance with LAW , the applicant was accepted back in GPE on DATE and placed in custody since he had absconded once before and thus there was a risk that he would try to evade enforcement of a decision on deportation . Moreover , he was informed of ORG negative decision in regard to his asylum request lodged in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he lodged a new application for asylum and a residence permit with ORG , alleging that since he was from LOC and had left the country illegally , the NORP authorities would automatically assume that he was part of ORG ( an armed , political organisation which fights for the independence of LOC from GPE ) and therefore arrest and torture him . However , he specified that he had never been politically active or supported ORG . Moreover , he claimed that he should be considered as a refugee sur place since ORG had accused him of being involved in security - threatening activities and the NORP authorities surely knew about it and would arrest him on this basis as well .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was interviewed by ORG on DATE at which point he added , essentially , the following . He had not been raised by his parents and he did not know from which country he hailed but he was a citizen of PERSON , which should be understood as LOC . He had no passport or identity documents . His foster father had wanted him to join ORG but he had not wanted this himself . He had not had any contact with the NORP authorities . While in GPE , he had had no choice but to live with people that ORG held under surveillance since he had had nowhere else to live . When he had been apprehended in GPE , he had been on his way to work in GPE . The fact that his ticket was to GPE was a mistake . If forced to return to GPE , he would risk being imprisoned because he was from LOC and because of the people he had socialised with while in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a submission from the applicant \u2019s representative , dated DATE , he stressed that the applicant was not a member of ORG . However , since he had left LOC illegally without any travel documents , this was enough for the NORP authorities to consider him a member of ORG . Moreover , he refuted the NORP ORG allegations that he was a security threat to GPE as groundless .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the applicant had provided no evidence to support either his identity or any of his grounds for asylum but that the language analysis had shown that he came from GPE . It then noted that ORG had maintained their earlier submission to ORG and , in a new submission of DATE , had recommended that the applicant should not be allowed to remain in GPE because they considered that he posed a security risk to the nation . ORG then observed that the situation in LOC was unstable due to the conflict with the NORP authorities but that the situation in itself was not so serious that it could justify granting a person asylum in GPE . As concerned the applicant \u2019s situation , it found his allegations to be groundless . There was no indication that the NORP authorities would consider him a member of ORG or otherwise show any interest in him since there was nothing to suggest that the NORP authorities had knowledge of the NORP ORG concerns . Moreover , it noted that the applicant himself had stated that he was not involved in any activities of a political , or other , nature . Having regard to ORG submissions , which ORG did not question , and all the above considerations , ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s request for asylum and a residence permit should be rejected .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against ORG decision . Since the case involved national security matters , ORG transferred the appeal to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) in order for that court to give its opinion on whether there were any impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order before the case , together with the court \u2019s opinion , were passed on to the Government for examination ( see below under relevant domestic law and practice , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , the applicant maintained his earlier claims and added that he believed that ORG had informed their NORP counterpart , in accordance with international obligations , about him and their suspicions about him . Moreover , in DATE , he and a friend had been arrested by the police in a mosque in GPE . He had been questioned but released DATE and no charges had been brought against him . However , he was convinced that the NORP security police had been in the mosque at the time of the arrest and therefore would immediately detain and question him if he were deported to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing in the case and , on DATE , it submitted its opinion on the matter to the Government for them to examine the case and make a final decision . In its submission , the court recommended that the applicant should not be granted leave to remain in GPE and that he should , moreover , be prohibited from returning within DATE . It noted , inter alia , that there was nothing to suggest that the NORP authorities would show any interest in him and that the applicant himself had stated that he had never been politically active . It also considered that he was very unreliable and questioned the veracity of his accounts as his story had escalated over time . Thus , the court was of the opinion that the applicant was not in need of protection in GPE , either as a refugee or as a person otherwise in need of protection . Furthermore , it presumed that ORG had not , and would not , handle the case in such a way that it would render the enforcement of the deportation order impossible .", "The applicant disputed ORG opinion and maintained his claims . He further added that court had not taken into consideration his connection to CARDINAL of the persons he had socialised with in GPE and that ORG and ORG could not guarantee his safety in GPE , if he were returned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the appeal and decided that he should be deported to GPE as soon as possible and with a prohibition on returning to GPE before DATE . They first noted that they did not question ORG information that the applicant could become involved in activities threatening the security of the nation . They then considered that he was not credible and that there was no indication that he would risk persecution or torture by the NORP authorities upon return . Therefore there were no grounds on which to consider him a refugee or otherwise in need of protection and no other reasons to grant him leave to remain in GPE had been established . Having regard to the submission made by ORG , the ORG also decided to prohibit the applicant from returning to GPE for DATE . This decision was final .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant applied to ORG for a re - examination of his application for asylum and a residence permit on the grounds that new circumstances had come to light which rendered an enforcement of the deportation order impossible . However , on DATE , ORG found that no new circumstances had been presented and that the deportation order could be enforced . The applicant did not appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant requested the ORG to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG a suspension of his deportation to GPE . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE , the ORG decided to apply Rule CARDINAL and to suspend the deportation until DATE , on which date it was extended until further notice and the case communicated to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Following the request by ORG , ORG stayed the enforcement of the deportation order until further notice .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Government informed the ORG that new information had come to light in the case which might constitute an impediment to the enforcement of the deportation order .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , in accordance with the relevant rules in LAW , on DATE , ORG handed the case over to the Government for examination since it considered that , due to certain new information presented in an internal note by a civil servant at ORG , there appeared to be an impediment to the enforcement of the deportation order in the applicant \u2019s case . In its view , there was now adequate reason ( sk\u00e4lig anledning ) to believe that the applicant would risk being tortured if returned to his home country . It noted that although the human rights situation in the country had improved and some police officers had been convicted for having committee torture , allegations of torture and impunity remained .", "CARDINAL . The Government requested ORG to submit its opinion on the case , which it did on DATE , after having held an oral hearing where the applicant and his representative were present as well as representatives for ORG and ORG . In its opinion , the court stated that there were no impediments to the enforcement of the deportation of the applicant since it was not probable that the NORP authorities had an interest in the applicant and he therefore did not risk torture or inhuman treatment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted in reply that ORG opinion was incorrect and that ORG could not guarantee his safety in GPE . He further submitted a copy of a newspaper article about him in which his name was mentioned and there was a photo of him . The article had been published in the DATE newspaper ORG on DATE and included the following information . The applicant claimed that he had never been interested in politics and that he hoped that the NORP authorities would believe his assurances that he was not a terrorist . He had left LOC , where he had grown up , because ORG had wanted him to join as a soldier but he had refused . In the article is was further stated that the main reason that the applicant was regarded as a security risk in GPE , allegedly was that he had socialised with another person , X. , who was suspected of having ties to ORG in GPE and who had led a group of extremists from an apartment in GPE . The applicant claimed that he had needed a cheap place to sleep when he arrived in GPE and that X. had offered him a room in his apartment . However , they had never discussed politics and the applicant had moved out as soon as he had started working . However , while he was living in the apartment , he and X. had been awoken TIME by ORG who had detained and questioned them for DATE before they had been released . According to the applicant , ORG had focused on questioning him about X. He further stated that if he had seen anything suspicious , he would have told the police since he had come to GPE for protection and therefore also wanted to protect GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government decided that there were no impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order . Although some new information had come to light , these circumstances were not such as to render the deportation of the applicant unenforceable . Moreover , the fact that the applicant himself had chosen to make public his name and photo in CARDINAL NORP media after ORG had submitted its opinion to the Government , did not alter the Government \u2019s conclusion in the matter . Finally , the Government reiterated that the enforcement of the deportation order was still suspended due to the ORG \u2019s request under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions mainly applied in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) which replaced , on DATE , the old LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL , LAW stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group , and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , Section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies , under LAW , LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , the ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A refugee or an alien otherwise in need of protection may be refused a residence permit in certain cases . Such a decision may be taken if there are exceptional grounds for not granting a residence permit , either following an assessment of what is known about the alien \u2019s previous activities or with regard to national security ( LAW , LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , points CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . However , it follows from LAW , LAW of the DATE Act that no person at risk of being tortured may be refused a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under LAW , matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , LAW ) . However , in a so called security case ( defined in LAW , LAW , as a case in which ORG , for reasons relating to national security or otherwise bearing on public security , recommend that an alien be deported or expelled , or that his or her application for a residence permit should be rejected or that an alien \u2019s residence permit be withdrawn ) , a decision of ORG on deportation , expulsion , a residence permit or a work permit may not be appealed against to ORG , but may instead be appealed against to ORG ( LAW , LAW ) . ORG shall promptly turn over an appeal of such a decision to ORG . This court shall , if it is not clearly unnecessary , hold an oral hearing in the case and shall then pass on the case , along with its opinion , to the Government for examination The opinion shall specifically state whether there is an impediment to enforcement under LAW , LAW , CARDINAL DATE . If ORG finds that there is such an impediment , the Government may not diverge from the assessment of ORG in its examination ( LAW , LAW ) . If , during the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order in a security case , information comes to light that might constitute an impediment to the enforcement of that order , ORG shall also promptly turn the case over to the Government , after which the above procedure applies ( LAW , LAW , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Security Police may only recommend that an alien be deported or expelled , or that his or her application for a residence permit should be rejected for reasons relating to national security or otherwise bearing on public security . This recommendation is only decisive for defining the case as a security case . The decision to deport or to reject an application for a residence permit for reasons relating to national security or otherwise bearing on public security lies with ORG and , ultimately , with the Government .", "CARDINAL . NORP law prohibits torture and the Government denied its use . In DATE a specific anti - torture law was passed , which has clear classification of the crimes in line with relevant ORG conventions . Moreover , the penal code stipulates sentences of up to life imprisonment for public servants who use , or allow the use of , violence against others in the exercise of their official duties . Furthermore , by law , pre - trial investigating judges must refer a detainee to a forensic medicine expert if asked to do so or if judges notice suspicious physical marks on a detainee . Still , according to domestic and international human right organisations , prisoners and detainees , members of the security forces abused individuals in their custody . According to the NORP Minister of Justice , during DATE , authorities prosecuted CARDINAL members of the security forces for human rights violations , including torture , and CARDINAL officers were convicted and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for beating to death a LOC activist in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The law does not prohibit arbitrary arrest or detention . According to international sources , the police used both practices and the authorities denied defendants access to counsel or family members during DATE of detention , during which police interrogated detainees and abuse or torture was most likely to occur . Under the anti - terrorism law , enacted in the aftermath of the DATE GPE bombings , the authorities have the power to detain a person for DATE without notifying a lawyer or the detainee \u2019s family . Detention limits were exceeded when individuals were suspected of terrorism or were linked to terrorism .", "CARDINAL . The constitution provides for an independent judiciary . However , it appears from available sources that in practice the courts were not always independent and corruption remained prevalent . The law also stipulates that when a criminal penalty is DATE in prison , a court - appointed attorney must be provided , if a defendant can not afford private counsel . Furthermore , if a judge determines that a confession was obtained under duress , the law requires that it be excluded from evidence . However , human rights organisations claimed that judges often decided cases on the basis of forced confessions , especially in cases of NORP accused of terrorism or in the cases of some PERSON ( people from the region of LOC ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG permitted visits to prisons during DATE by independent human rights observers and , throughout DATE , they also permitted the NORP Observatory of Prisons ( an NGO that receives limited government funding ) to visit prisons and detention centres unhindered to observe conditions and hear complaints . Moreover , individuals could complain of human rights abuses to the Conseil ORG the ORG ) , which was also done without problems . The ORG presented regular reports on the country \u2019s human rights situation .", "CARDINAL . The Government provided increased human rights training to prison officials , military officers , police and medical personnel . The authorities did not hamper foreign human rights organisations visiting GPE and they generally tolerated the work of many national human rights organisations . ORG opened its first office in GPE in DATE and has since then opened several more offices in the country .", "CARDINAL . Several of the sources noted that despite the clear efforts to improve the human rights situation in GPE and strengthen the democratic process , the fight against terrorism risked having a negative impact on respect for human rights in GPE . Since DATE , police have arrested CARDINAL suspected NORP militants and , according to ORG , the intelligence agencies have continued to use an unacknowledged detention centre at GPE to interrogate some of those suspected of serious offences . Suspects continued to allege that they had been tortured while under interrogation , although there were fewer complaints of torture and excessive incommunicado pre - arraignment detention in DATE than in the immediate aftermath of the DATE GPE bombings . Moreover , during DATE , law enforcement efforts focused more narrowly on counter terrorism investigations and arrests than the previous broad dragnets used following the DATE GPE attacks . Still , according to ORG ( an NGO which advocates on behalf of jailed NORP ) CARDINAL individuals remained in custody without charge at DATE , as a result of terror - related dragnets . ORG has reported that CARDINAL suspected NORP militants were arrested , mostly by police , and that most of the detainees were charged and some were tried on terrorism offences and sentenced to DATE in prison .", "CARDINAL . The NORP authorities kept particularly tight control over the disputed LOC , resulting in many reports of police brutality , including torture . ORG - mediated talks concerning the region were held in DATE between ORG and ORG but without reaching an agreement . ORG reported that CARDINAL of GPE activists suspected of participating in demonstrations against NORP rule were arrested and CARDINAL of them alleged that they had been tortured during questioning by security forces . Some were tried on charges of violent conduct while others were released after questioning . The Government encouraged the return of PERSON as long as they acknowledged the ORG \u2019s claim to the LOC territory . There were no restrictions on travelling within the country ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
