According to a document issued by ORG ( a subdivision of GPE ) on DATE , there is CARDINAL common entrance into the courtyard and a single access serving houses CARDINAL and DATE ( the latter being the applicant \u2019s house ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s neighbours ( NORP ) built a fence around her own house which , according to the applicant , included a part of the area left for common use by the owners of the QUANTITY houses in the courtyard . The fence blocked the applicant \u2019s access to the only entry into the courtyard , and she was only able to reach her house through a gate left in the fence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE NORP replaced the fence with a bigger one and did not leave any opening for the applicant to go through . On DATE the applicant \u2019s son - in - law ( S. ) came to visit her and discovered the new fence . At the request of his mother - in - law he demolished part of the fence in order to create an unobstructed passage to the applicant \u2019s house .", "CARDINAL . At NORP \u2019s request , criminal proceedings were initiated against GPE DATE ORG acquitted him . The court noted statements made by several neighbours and an expert from ORG , as well as the certificate issued on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , according to which the courtyard had been reserved for common use by the owners of all QUANTITY houses and that there was CARDINAL access to the applicant \u2019s house , now blocked by the newly built fence . The court found that NORP had built the fence unlawfully and blocked the applicant \u2019s access to her own house , and that the actions of S. to free the passage to the house had been dictated by strict necessity . No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . In reply to a complaint by the applicant , on DATE the Chief PERSON of PERSON informed her that , following an on - site visit , he had established that the territory on which the applicant \u2019s and NORP \u2019s houses were situated had been in common use and that , accordingly , the access to the applicant \u2019s house was also in common use . This was confirmed by a map annexed to the letter . ORG added that no decisions had been adopted which could have provoked disputes between the applicant and NORP", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to sell NORP a plot of land around her house , which included the common access road . On DATE the council and NORP concluded a contract for the sale of land .", "CARDINAL . Following a complaint by the applicant , on DATE the same authority amended its decision of CARDINAL DATE by reducing the surface of the plot of land sold to NORP , in order to resolve the dispute between NORP and the applicant and to secure access to the applicant \u2019s house .", "CARDINAL . D. challenged the municipality \u2019s decision of DATE in court . On DATE the ORG annulled the decision of CARDINAL DATE as unlawful . The court found that , according to a letter from the municipality \u2019s finance department dated DATE , the access road to the applicant \u2019s house had not been included in the plot of land sold to NORP", "CARDINAL . In a separate court action , on DATE the municipality initiated court proceedings , asking for modification of the contract of sale of land to NORP It claimed that the plot of land had mistakenly included the common access road used to access the applicant \u2019s house .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant initiated court proceedings against NORP and the municipality , asking for the annulment of all decisions taken in favour of NORP since DATE , including the decision of CARDINAL DATE , and of all contracts between the CARDINAL parties . She also noted that the fence built by NORP had blocked all access to her house and had even left her without a water supply , which had previously been secured via a water pipe ending in the common courtyard , now situated on NORP \u2019s land . The applicant asked for an order to remove all obstacles to her use of the house and to determine the manner of common use of the access by all the owners of the houses in the courtyard .", "The CARDINAL court actions were joined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the requests of the applicant and the municipality . The court found that the applicant had sufficient space to use her house and that , since the water pipe ran through the land owned by NORP , the applicant could only ensure access to water with NORP \u2019s agreement . It decided to discontinue the applicant \u2019s request to annul the decision of CARDINAL DATE , since its lawfulness had already been confirmed by the final judgment of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and ordered a full re - hearing of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG struck the applicant \u2019s action out of its list due to her failure to appear in court when summoned . That decision was quashed by ORG on DATE because there was no evidence in the file that the applicant had been summoned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s and the municipality \u2019s requests . It stated , inter alia , that the applicant had unobstructed access to her house , without giving any details . It also repeated the reasons it had given in its judgment of DATE regarding the applicant \u2019s access to water . The court refused to annul the contract for the sale of land concluded between NORP and the municipality on DATE , given that it was based on the municipality \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE , a decision previously confirmed as lawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld that judgment . It essentially repeated the lower court \u2019s reasons regarding the lawfulness of the contract for the sale of land .", "CARDINAL . In her appeal on points of law the applicant referred , inter alia , to her inability to fully enjoy her property right over the house , the access to which was blocked by the fence built by NORP She claimed that the contract of DATE had been concluded in breach of the law . The applicant asked for the annulment of the contract and the demolition of the fence in order to secure unobstructed access to her house .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , in her absence . The court acknowledged the confirmation by the Chief PERSON of PERSON of DATE , after he had visited the relevant courtyard , that the land and access road in question were in fact in common use . However , in the absence of any decision by GPE expressly reserving that land for common use , ORG opinion could not serve as a ground for annulling the lower court \u2019s judgments . Therefore the lower courts had correctly decided that the land sold to NORP had not been land in common use .", "CARDINAL . The court also found that the applicant had been summoned to the hearing but had failed to appear without giving plausible reasons . The applicant claims that she was not summoned . The judgment of DATE was final .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant provisions of domestic law and the relevant domestic practice have been set out in PERSON v. GPE , no .
