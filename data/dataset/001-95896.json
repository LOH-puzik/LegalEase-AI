The report of the search of the [ defendant 's ] flat and other premises of DATE shows that the search was carried out in the presence of the defendant and CARDINAL witnesses . On that occasion objects , which were enumerated in the certificates on temporarily seized items , were found and temporarily seized from the defendant . The defendant 's assertion that the witnesses were not simultaneously and continually present during the search is unfounded and uncorroborated , since neither the defendant nor the present witnesses put forward any objections .

It follows that this provision does not oblige the court or the police authorities to present the persons identifying [ objects as potential evidence ] with similar objects at each instance but [ this requirement applies ] only where possible . In the present case , where a large number of different objects were [ to be identified ] , the police officers were not obliged to act in the manner the defendant argued they were in his appeal and therefore , in the view of this court , the identification of objects [ as potential evidence ] was carried out in accordance with the law . Therefore , the reports on identification in the present case constitute valid evidence , especially since some of the injured parties emphatically stated at the main hearing that the objects they had been presented with were theirs , which in any event \u2013 save for a few of [ these objects ] \u2013 the defendant did not deny in his initial defence .", "As regards the [ alleged ] inability of the defendant to consult the case file , it is to be noted that the [ documents ] from the case file show that the first - instance court allowed the defendant to consult the case file on DATE ( page CARDINAL ) and that the requested copies of material evidence were served on the defendant in detention on DATE ( page CARDINAL ) .", "The defendant complains that his written request of DATE to consult the case file while he was in detention was not granted .", "On the basis of the above [ considerations ] , this court considers that in the present case there was no breach of LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , since the defendant regularly attended the hearings , where he was able to consult the case file , copy the documents thereof and [ examine ] the objects aimed at establishing the facts of the case .
