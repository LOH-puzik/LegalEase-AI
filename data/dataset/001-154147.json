The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a military pilot .", "CARDINAL . On DATE his child was born of his marriage with ORG who holds both NORP and NORP nationality . At the date of the facts , the family \u2019s permanent residence was in GPE , but they travelled due to the applicant \u2019s various work assignments .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was sent to a ORG mission in GPE where his family joined him shortly after . While in GPE , the family travelled to GPE to visit the applicant \u2019s sister . In order to facilitate the travelling , the applicant and his wife signed an authorisation form allowing each CARDINAL of them to travel abroad with the child .", "CARDINAL . After having lived together for DATE in GPE , the applicant and ORG decided together that ORG would take their child to GPE for DATE , and would join the applicant in GPE in DATE , at the end of his contract in GPE . The parents agreed that ORG and the child would return to GPE before DATE , the date at which the child \u2019s passport would expire .", "CARDINAL . NORP M.T.R. was unable to make travel arrangements on time , as the applicant had been late in sending money for the tickets , and eventually the child \u2019s passport expired . ORG sought the applicant \u2019s consent to request a NORP passport for the child , but the applicant refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that she would not return with the child to GPE . Later on , on DATE she filed for divorce and custody of the child before the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant withdrew the authorisation that he had given to the wife to travel with the child . On DATE he also lodged a request for the return of the child under LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction ( \u201c LAW ) , with ORG , ORG for the purpose of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the notification made by the applicant was received by ORG , ORG for the purpose of LAW ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) . At the ORG \u2019s request , the police visited ORG \u2019s home and inquired about their situation . She provided copies of their identity papers and of the authorisation form allowing her to travel with the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG tried unsuccessfully to engage the mother in negotiations concerning the return of the child to GPE . On DATE they lodged before ORG an application under LAW for the return of the child .", "CARDINAL . Five hearings took place in the case . At the first hearing ORG filed a response to the applicant \u2019s motion ; a postponement was granted at the ORG \u2019s request . At the second hearing ORG learned , allegedly for the first time , that the authorisation to travel had been withdrawn by her husband . This hearing as well as the next one were postponed at ORG \u2019s request . At the next hearing ORG asked that the applicant \u2019s request be dismissed ; she claimed that he was sexually deviant and stated that she feared for her child \u2019s safety should he be returned to his father . The applicant did not appear in court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request and ordered ORG to return the child to the habitual residence in GPE within DATE from the date of its decision . It noted that while the applicant had given his consent to the travel to GPE , his wife retained the child in GPE against the applicant \u2019s will contrary to what had been initially agreed upon . It also observed that the parents maintained joint custody of the child , as they had been legally married at the date of the wrongful retention . It further noted that on DATE ORG had granted the couple \u2019s divorce but had not decided on the custody of the child ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It dismissed as unfounded the mother \u2019s allegations that the applicant was not taking active part in the child \u2019s upbringing and that his presence constituted a major risk for \u201c the child \u2019s physical , psychical , emotional and affective development \u201d . The decision was final and enforceable within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE M.T.R. appealed in cassation . The case was heard on DATE by ORG . In a final decision of DATE the court upheld ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG requested the assistance of a bailiff for the enforcement of the final decision . On DATE the bailiff informed ORG of the obligation to comply with the court order . DATE ORG lodged an application for a stay of execution which was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "A new enforcement attempt took place on DATE when ORG informed the bailiff that she refused to comply with the return order . She explained that the applicant could keep contact with the child through internet and webcam , that she kept him updated with the developments of the child and that he did not support the child financially . On DATE the bailiff decided to postpone the enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , ORG requested the annulment of the final decision of DATE ( contesta\u0163ie \u00een anulare ) which she considered to be \u201c unfounded and unlawful \u201d ( netemeinic\u0103 \u015fi nelegal\u0103 ) . On DATE ORG granted her request , quashed the return order and sent the case back for re - examination of the appeal on points of law . ORG retried the appeal and in a final decision of CARDINAL DATE dismissed the initial request for the return of the child . The court considered that the child \u2019s arrival to GPE was not unlawful as both parents had consented to the trip . It also found that the child was already integrated in his new environment . It considered that it would not be in the child \u2019s best interest to return to GPE , because the applicant travelled often due to his job as a military pilot and consequently could not take proper care of the child :", "\u201c The social workers\u2019 reports in the case and the child \u2019s psychological evaluation show that the child is harmoniously developed DATE affectively , emotionally and intellectually - , is affectively attached to his mother and maternal grandmother , and is integrated in the environment in which he lives since his arrival in GPE . His return to GPE is perceived by the court as not corresponding to his superior interest in so far as , notably , his father being a military pilot , is selected for missions within ORG , which makes it impossible for him to be preoccupied with raising , caring for and educating the child ; in addition frequent travel by the child with his father in these missions is unfavourable to the child \u2019s harmonious development . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG informed ORG of the outcome of the proceedings and advised the applicant to request a right of access under LAW . ORG sent the decision to the applicant and expressed their disagreement with the court \u2019s reasoning . They argued mainly that the protractions leading to the child becoming integrated in his new environment , in GPE , were not imputable to the applicant , but to the NORP authorities themselves . Moreover , they claimed that the NORP courts were wrong in considering that because of his profession the applicant could not take care of the child ; in any event , such consideration should have been examined and decided by the courts ruling on the custody of the child .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry kept close contact with ORG throughout the proceedings , informing them of the progress of the case and seeking information requested by the courts about the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG filed for divorce and custody of the child . On DATE the Ministry informed the applicant of those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the divorce but decided not to rule on the custody matters before the end of the GPE proceedings which were pending at that time .", "The applicant did not appeal and the decision became thus final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG granted GPE custody of the child and awarded the applicant visiting rights . The parties appealed ; the applicant contested the alimony set by the court . The decision became final with certain amendments on DATE when ORG dismissed the appeals on points of law lodged by the CARDINAL parents .", "CARDINAL . In the latter part of DATE the applicant travelled for the first time to GPE since the beginning of the conflictual situation . He stayed with ORG and his child in ORG \u2019s apartment in Husi for a month .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant travelled to GPE on QUANTITY occasions , once accompanied by the child \u2019s paternal grandmother . The child was able to spend time with his father and shared his hotel room for TIME ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
