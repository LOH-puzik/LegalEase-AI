GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant , who had previously served a prison sentence for , inter alia , sexual assault , rape and theft , of triple murder in coincidence with CARDINAL offences of aggravated robbery , falsification of documents and fraud , and sentenced him to life imprisonment . The court held that the applicant , who had committed the offences while on probation , acted intentionally , in CARDINAL cases motivated by greed ( PERSON ) and to make another offence possible ( PERSON ) , and in CARDINAL case to conceal an offence ( PERSON ) . Based on an expert opinion it further held that the applicant tended to be brutal , had sadistic tendencies and was antisocial .", "On DATE , having first served the remainder of the previous sentence after probation had been revoked , DATE of the sentence had been served and the applicant became eligible for parole .", "On DATE the prison authorities imposed certain restrictions on the applicant , inter alia solitary confinement . All restrictions were suspended again until , at the latest , DATE . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG found the restrictions unlawful as far as they were still in place after DATE .", "In DATE and DATE the applicant asked for a relaxation of the conditions of his detention , inter alia , prison leave ( Hafturlaub ) and leave to meet with his lawyer . The prison authorities refused the request ; they found the risk that the applicant would use such leave to commit crimes or flee was too high .", "On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant . The court held that the prison authorities had not abused their discretion when refusing the prison leave . As to the request for leave to meet his lawyer , it argued that the lawyer could visit the applicant in prison .", "On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication without giving reasons .", "In view of his renewed request for a suspension of his sentence on probation in DATE ORG ordered an expert opinion on the question whether the applicant continued to present a danger ; the expert examined the applicant on CARDINAL and DATE .", "On DATE ORG , after having heard the applicant and having regard to a report by the prison authorities as well as the expert opinion , refused to suspend the applicant \u2019s life sentence on probation and decided that the \u201c particular seriousness \u201d of the applicant \u2019s guilt warranted the continuation of his imprisonment until he had served DATE . It primarily relied on the expert \u2019s opinion , explained by him in person during a hearing , who had diagnosed a dissocial and narcissistic personality disorder and concluded that the risk of the applicant again committing crimes when released had not substantially decreased . The ORG found that these findings alone warranted the refusal of a suspension of the sentence on probation in due consideration of the interests of the security of the public . It further noted that the applicant had been convicted of CARDINAL offences of murder , committed shortly after he had been released from prison and while still on probation . Although ORG observed that in view of his age it was unlikely that the applicant \u2019s personality would change , it pointed out that a suspension of his sentence on probation could still become possible once he no longer presented a danger because of old age and related health problems .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It confirmed ORG findings that the degree of guilt , the circumstances of the crimes and the applicant \u2019s personality , as well as his refusal of therapy , necessitated his further imprisonment , at least until he had served DATE .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit a constitutional complaint by the applicant for adjudication . It found no fault in the lower courts\u2019 detailed and reasoned decisions to refuse the suspension of the applicant \u2019s sentence on probation and to order that he should remain in prison pursuant to the life sentence until he had served DATE . Since the applicant had submitted neither a DATE expert opinion he had referred to nor the DATE expert opinion ORG could especially not find a violation of the lower courts\u2019 duty to clarify the relevant facts ( PERSON ) . Finally , it held that the lower courts had , as far as could be determined without having read the convicting judgment which the applicant had not submitted , correctly determined the \u201c particular seriousness \u201d of the applicant \u2019s guilt .", "Pursuant to these provisions the court shall suspend the execution of the remainder of a sentence of imprisonment for life and grant probation , if , inter alia , DATE of the sentence have been served , the degree of the convicted person \u2019s guilt does not require its continued execution and if this can be justified upon consideration of the security interests of the general public .", "When taking the decision , the following shall be taken into consideration ; the personality of the convicted person ; his previous history ; the circumstances of his act ; the extent to which the legal interest would be threatened in the event of recidivism ; the conduct of the convicted person while serving his sentence ; his living conditions ; and the effects suspension could be expected to have ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
