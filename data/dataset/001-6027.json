He is represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant has a long history of serious psychiatric illness . According to the applicant , he was treated as an in - patient at ORG in GPE in DATE where he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic . There would appear to be no records of the periods of the applicant \u2019s hospitalisation and the diagnosis .", "The applicant returned to GPE sometime in DATE . DATE he received psychiatric treatment at a large number of hospitals in the GPE area . He was detained and treated on a number of occasions under the provisions of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The applicant was first diagnosed in GPE as a paranoid schizophrenic on DATE during his detention in FAC .", "On TIME DATE the applicant attacked a fellow resident at ORG in GPE . He was remanded to ORG and then transferred to a secure unit at ORG under sections DATE of the DATE Act . Following assessment and treatment at FAC , he was transferred under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act to ORG ( \u201c PERSON \u2019s \u201d ) in DATE .", "On DATE the order under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act detaining the applicant was rescinded and he was discharged from ORG . PERSON , a psychiatrist at ORG , sought to make arrangements for the applicant to be seen as an out - patient by the general as well as the forensic psychiatric services at ORG ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) , a hospital now closed but then under the management and control of the GPE and ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) .", "PERSON telephoned PERSON , an ORG at Friern , and fixed an out - patient appointment . PERSON then telephoned PERSON , a forensic psychiatrist at PERSON , and told her that an appointment had been made for an out - patient appointment for the applicant with PERSON Sergeant and that he also wished to make a referral to the forensic psychiatric services . Following discussion with a senior colleague , PERSON DATE telephoned PERSON and said that the applicant should attend Dr Sergeant \u2019s out - patient appointment and that he would be referred to the forensic team if necessary . At the time of making the appointment PERSON Sergeant did not know that she had been or was to be appointed as the applicant \u2019s \u201c key worker \u201d .", "An appointment was made for the applicant to be seen by Dr Sergeant on DATE . He did not attend the appointment on DATE . He was sent another appointment for DATE , which was later changed to CARDINAL DATE . The applicant failed to attend the appointment on CARDINAL DATE .", "Sometime at the beginning of DATE , PERSON received CARDINAL section CARDINAL forms which stated that the applicant was supposed to have after - care arrangements made under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act and that Dr Sergeant was to be the \u201c key worker \u201d . No such arrangement had been agreed with Dr Sergeant or with Friern . The out - patient appointment for CARDINAL DATE had not been made by PERSON in pursuance of any responsibilities under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act .", "After the applicant failed to attend his out - patient appointment on CARDINAL DATE , PERSON telephoned the applicant \u2019s General Practitioner , PERSON , who told her that the applicant had been removed from his list of patients because of his aggressive and threatening behaviour . She then telephoned PERSON \u2019s and spoke to PERSON who advised her that the police should accompany her on any mental health assessment visit and added that the applicant had not been in touch with PERSON \u2019s since his discharge . After that conversation PERSON contacted ORG and requested that a mental health assessment visit be arranged on a planned non - urgent basis and that this should be attended by the police . It was arranged that this should take place at the applicant \u2019s address on DATE at TIME It appears that the applicant was not informed of this arrangement .", "On DATE ORG informed PERSON that the applicant had been off medication for DATE and that his behaviour was threatening . She was reminded that the applicant had stabbed someone in the past . The start of the mental health assessment visit on DATE was slightly delayed . The applicant left the premises without being recognised by anyone in the assessment team and without being approached to ascertain if he was PERSON . No arrangements were made for a further assessment and PERSON said that she would try to see the applicant informally in order to gain his goodwill .", "On DATE the applicant went to the offices of ORG and a member of their staff contacted PERSON who arranged an appointment to see the applicant on DATE . She asked that a duty social worker attend the meeting but said that there was no need for an approved social worker ( as defined in LAW ) to attend . The applicant did not attend his out - patient appointment on DATE . Although the applicant states that PERSON took no positive step in the face of this failure to attend , the Government observe , with reference to the findings contained in an official report ( \u201c the PERSON Report \u201d ) drawn up following a public inquiry into the handling of the applicant \u2019s treatment ( \u201c the Clunis Inquiry \u201d ) , that the social worker who had attended for the appointment with the applicant \u201c discussed the way forward with Dr Sergeant \u201d after the applicant failed to appear . PERSON appears to have said that the alternatives were ORG visit or an attempt to persuade the applicant to visit the social services department again and then to give him another outpatient appointment . The applicant was eventually invited by letter to attend an appointment on DATE . When told of the date , PERSON apparently expressed her dissatisfaction that it was so far in advance .", "According to ORG , it would seem that attempts were made to contact the applicant DATE , but without success . On DATE PERSON spoke to an official in ORG and expressed concern that the applicant had been discharged so quickly from ORG in view of his violent past . The official \u2019s colleague made enquiries as to the availability of space in a residential hostel for the applicant . The residential hostel indicated that it would get in touch with the applicant with a view to assessing his suitability for a place and then decide whether to offer him CARDINAL .", "On DATE ORG telephoned Dr Sergeant but was unable to speak to her . When she returned their call she was told that there had been a message from the local police that the applicant was \u201c waving screwdrivers and knives and talking about devils \u201d . PERSON advised that ORG should assess the applicant as soon as possible but that she first wished to check which social services authority was responsible for the applicant .", "DATE at TIME Dr Sergeant questioned PERSON , the duty approved social worker , as to which social services authority was responsible for the applicant and whether PERSON or ORG should be dealing with the applicant . By TIME she had persuaded ORG to accept responsibility for the applicant in place of Friern . However , following further discussions with PERSON , PERSON reversed that position and agreed that PERSON would continue with the applicant \u2019s care . PERSON visited the applicant \u2019s flat but there was no reply . At TIME she returned with a letter asking him to call her DATE .", "At TIME on DATE the applicant killed PERSON , who was a complete stranger to him , in an unprovoked attack at FAC in GPE . The applicant seems to have believed without any justification whatsoever that PERSON was about to attack him .", "On DATE PERSON waited at the applicant \u2019s address for the applicant to return . She was informed later that day that he had been arrested for murder .", "On DATE the applicant pleaded guilty to PERSON manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility . The plea was accepted by the ORG . The trial judge , Mr Justice PERSON , ordered that the applicant be detained pursuant to sections DATE ( hospital order ) and CARDINAL ( restriction order whereby discharge from hospital requires the consent of the Home Secretary ) of LAW . The restriction order was expressed to be without limit of time .", "On DATE the LOC and LOC Authorities instituted an inquiry into the treatment and care of the applicant which was chaired by Miss PERSON . The ORG received evidence from CARDINAL witnesses over a DATE period and extended its investigation back to DATE . ORG reported in DATE and in its report concluded , inter alia :", "( a ) There were significant deficiencies in the care given to the applicant . \u201c As will have been clear from our comments throughout the narrative we are of the view on the evidence we have heard , that PERSON Clunis\u2019 care and treatment was a catalogue of failure and missed opportunity ... In our view the problem was cumulative ; it was CARDINAL failure or missed opportunity on top of another \u201d ( pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "( b ) The Mental Health Assessment Team should have been arranged more quickly , and PERSON should have ensured that an earlier date was fixed ( p. CARDINAL ) .", "( c ) The gap between the first request for ORG on DATE and the visit that was arranged for DATE was far too long . There was plenty of time to prepare preliminary information about PERSON so that alternative responses following his assessment could be planned ( p. CARDINAL ) .", "( d ) \u201c Indecision and procrastination is the hall mark of the failure of ORG to have any responsible person making decisions and monitoring decisions that had been made . \u201d Equally Dr Sergeant left too much to the ORG department when she should have been taking an active role . She did not involve her consultant , PERSON , in managing this difficult case . As the person named as key worker under the section CARDINAL Mental Health Act DATE aftercare plan , PERSON knew that if she did not do so , no one else would ( p. CARDINAL ) .", "The Inquiry made a total of CARDINAL recommendations designed to ensure that the duties under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act were properly fulfilled ( Section V of the Report ) . Further recommendations were made in respect of matters such as key workers , monitoring , the assessment of dangerous and mental illness and offending .", "On DATE the applicant issued a writ claiming damages for injury , loss and damage sustained by him as a consequence of GPE \u2019s negligence . On DATE GPE issued a summons in ORG seeking to strike out the applicant \u2019s Statement of Claim on the sole ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action in that the principle of ex turpi causa non oritur actio or an analogous principle of public policy prevented the applicant from recovering damages . Although GPE expressly conceded for the purposes of the summons that it owed the applicant a common law duty of care at the material time and that the Statement of Claim disclosed breaches of that duty , it argued that to establish the injury and loss asserted the applicant had to rely on his own criminal act and public policy prevented this .", "On DATE Mr PERSON , sitting as a deputy ORG judge , dismissed GPE \u2019s summons on the basis that :", "( a ) the absolute rule of ex turpi causa non oritur actio set out in GPE v. PERSON [ DATE ] I AC CARDINAL had no application in tort cases but that there was a rule of public policy analogous to the ex turpi causa rule in contract law that a court can exclude a tortuous claim by a person who , in order to assert it , has to rely on a crime committed by him ;", "( b ) in applying the public policy rule the court had to make a judgment on a pragmatic basis as to whether it would be offensive to the public conscience for the claimant to base his claim on his own criminal activity or more offensive for him to be deprived of what would otherwise be his normal remedy ;", "( c ) where a claimant brings a negligence claim based on an allegation that the defendant either caused or failed properly to treat severe mental disorder , he can in principle recover as a head of claim damages for personal injury ( including mental deterioration ) resulting from self - inflicted harm . If this harm itself results from harming others in a criminal manner , public policy does not preclude him from recovering damages for the harm to him even though he is guilty of crime ;", "( d ) it would not offend the public conscience for the applicant \u2019s claim to proceed .", "On DATE GPE appealed on the grounds that the judge was wrong in law in holding that the applicant was not precluded from recovering damages consequent on his criminal act , and that the judge ought to have held that the applicant was precluded from recovering such damages on grounds of public policy . When the appeal was heard , the applicant and GPE were invited at the commencement of the hearing to address the ORG on the question of whether a duty of care was owed by GPE to the applicant . On DATE of the hearing GPE advanced an argument wholly inconsistent with its concession at first instance that whilst a duty of care was owed to the applicant , such a duty could only be owed pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Act and that breach of that duty was not actionable in private law .", "In delivering the judgment of ORG , Lord Justice PERSON stated with respect to the applicant \u2019s argument that GPE owed him a duty of care at common law that the public policy that the court will not lend its aid to a litigant who relies on his own criminal or immoral act is not confined to particular causes of action . Whether a claim is founded in contract or tort , public policy only required the court to deny its assistance to a plaintiff seeking to enforce a cause of action if he was implicated in the illegality and in putting forward his case he seeks to rely upon the illegal acts . Lord Justice PERSON did not accept the applicant \u2019s contention that the test to be applied should be aimed at ascertaining whether the result in a particular case would be acceptable to \u201c the public conscience \u201d . He cited with approval the decision of ORG in GPE v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] ) CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL ) as authority for the proposition that , in so far as the maxim ex turpi causa non oritur actio is directed at deterrence , the force of the deterrent effect was in the existence of the known rule and its stern application . He continued :", "\u201c In the present case we consider that [ GPE ] has made out its plea that the [ applicant \u2019s ] claim is essentially based on his illegal act of manslaughter ; he must be taken to have known what he was doing and that it was wrong , notwithstanding that the degree of his culpability was reduced by reason of mental disorder . The court ought not to allow itself to be made an instrument to enforce obligations alleged to arise out of the [ applicant \u2019s ] own criminal act and we would therefore allow the appeal on that ground . \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON subsequently considered whether GPE owed a duty to the applicant under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act and , in the affirmative , whether a breach of that duty could give rise to a claim for damages . With reference to the wording of that provision and to the terms of section CARDINAL of the same Act , Lord Justice Beldam found that the primary method of enforcement of the after - care obligations under section CARDINAL was by complaint to the Secretary of ORG . He continued :", "\u201c The character of the duties created seem to us closely analogous to those described by Lord PERSON in X ( Minors ) v. ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) as requiring :", "\u2018 exceptionally clear statutory language to show a parliamentary intention that those responsible for carrying out these difficult functions should be liable in damages if , on subsequent investigation with the benefit of hindsight , it was shown that they had reached an erroneous conclusion and therefore failed to discharge their statutory duties.\u2019", "In our view the wording of the section is not apposite to create a private law cause of action for failure to carry out the duties under the statute . \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON then addressed the applicant \u2019s argument that the relationship of doctor and patient which existed between the district health authority and the applicant while he was in hospital continued after discharge , so that a common law duty of care was owed by the defendant to continue the applicant \u2019s treatment . In the opinion of Lord Justice PERSON , it was difficult to conclude that it was in the circumstances just and reasonable to superimpose such a common law duty in relation to the performance of its statutory duties to provide after - care . He considered , bearing in mind the ambit of the obligations under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act and their repercussions on a wide spectrum of health and social services , including voluntary services , that ORG could not have intended so wide - spread a liability as that canvassed by the applicant . Lord Justice PERSON found that GPE \u2019s actions through Dr Sergeant were essentially in the sphere of administrative activities in pursuance of a scheme of social welfare in the community . He concluded :", "\u201c ... the statutory framework must be a major consideration in deciding whether it is fair and reasonable for the local health authority to be held responsible for errors and omissions of the kind alleged . The duties of care are , it seems to us , different in nature from those owed by a doctor to a patient whom he is treating and for whose lack of care in the course of treatment the local health authority may be liable . .... We have no doubt that it would not be right to hold PERSON or [ GPE ] liable to the [ applicant ] for failure to arrange the [ applicant \u2019s ] assessment for the purposes of section CARDINAL more speedily than she did . ... For these reasons we do not think that the [ applicant ] can establish a cause of action from a failure by [ GPE ] or PERSON to carry out their functions under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE . Nor do we think that it would be fair or reasonable to hold [ GPE ] responsible for the consequences of the [ applicant \u2019s ] criminal act . \u201d", "The applicant was refused leave to appeal to ORG by ORG .", "The applicant \u2019s petition for leave to appeal to ORG was refused by ORG on DATE .", "A statutory duty on public authorities to provide for the care of the mentally ill after discharge from hospital was first provided for in section CARDINAL of ORG . LAW DATE expanded the after - care function to include the provision of residential accommodation and the appointment of mental welfare officers . Following further enactments , ORG DATE was eventually passed . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A patient may be admitted to a hospital and detained there for the period allowed by the following provisions of this LAW in pursuance of an application ( in this LAW referred to as \u201c an application for admission for treatment \u201d ) made in accordance with this section .", "CARDINAL . An application for admission for treatment may be made in respect of a patient on the grounds that -", "( a ) he is suffering from mental illness , severe mental impairment , psychopathic disorder or mental impairment and his mental disorder is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to receive medical treatment in a hospital ; and", "( b ) in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment , such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of his condition ; and", "( c ) it is necessary for the health or safety of the patient or for the protection of other persons that he should receive such treatment and it can not be provided unless he is detained under this section . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . This section applies to persons who are detained under section CARDINAL above , or admitted to a hospital in pursuance of a hospital order made under LAW above , or transferred to a hospital in pursuance of a transfer direction made under LAW or DATE above , and then cease to be detained and leave hospital .", "CARDINAL . It shall be the duty of the district health authority and of the local social services authority to provide , in co - operation with relevant voluntary agencies after - care services for any person to whom this section applies until such time as the district health authority and the local social services authority are satisfied that the person concerned is no longer in need of such services . \u201d", "The section places a duty to consider the after - care needs of each individual to whom the section applies and is therefore quite distinct from other statutory duties to provide for the after - care of the generality of mentally disordered persons . LAW DATE , issued by the Secretary of ORG under the provisions of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , explains that the purpose of after - care is \u201c to enable a patient to return to his home or accommodation other than a hospital or nursing home , and to minimise the chances of him needing any further in - patient hospital care . \u201d", "The Code of Practice requires that a key worker be appointed from either the district health authority or social services authorities to be responsible for the discharged patient . The key worker is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the patient \u2019s care plan and liasing and co - ordinating where necessary between the individuals and agencies involved in the care plan . After - care services are not defined in the LAW but could include social work support , the provision of domicilary services , the use of residential or day centre facilities . An essential component is continuing psychiatric treatment and care if the declared objective of minimising the chances of the patient returning to hospital is to be achieved .", "The Government in the instant case have highlighted the various measures that have been adopted to ensure improvements in the care of the mentally ill following the recommendations made in the Ritchie Report .", "There are several means by which individuals or their representatives can have complaints regarding their discharge by a local authority of its duties under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act investigated : a complaint to ORG Commissioner , a complaint to ORG or a complaint to the Commissioner for ORG .", "According to the applicant , his relationship with GPE was one governed by both common law principles and by statute . A common law duty of care was owed to him inasmuch as a doctor - patient relationship existed between Dr Sergeant ( for whose acts or omissions GPE are vicariously liable ) and the applicant . Once Dr Sergeant had accepted that she and/or PERSON would provide him with out - patient treatment , a duty of care arose ( see PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All GPE CARDINAL per ORG ) .", "The applicant states that a duty of care was also owed to him pursuant to the duties owed under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . ORG in his case characterised these duties as being closely analogous to those described by Lord PERSON in X ( Minors ) v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL at CARDINAL ) as requiring \u201c exceptionally clear statutory language \u201d to indicate a parliamentary intention that the breach of such duties would give rise to an actionable claim for damages . It determined that the wording of section CARDINAL of the DATE Act was not apposite to create a private law cause of action for failure to carry out the duties under LAW . It also rejected the argument that a common law duty of care should be superimposed in relation to the performance of its statutory duties to provide after - care , on the basis that the duty of providing after - care services was different in nature from that owed by a doctor to a patient whom he is treating . The court held that it would not be just and reasonable to superimpose a common law duty of care on GPE in relation to the performance of its statutory duties to provide after - care .", "Prior to ORG determination , the rule of public policy that the court will not lend its aid to a litigant who relies on his own criminal or immoral act was confined to particular causes of action . It has its origins in contractual claims . The principle was modified in relation to tortuous claims by the application of \u201c the public conscience test \u201d . This was applied in a line of cases in ORG DATE where it was held to be right \u201c to adopt a pragmatic approach to these problems seeking where possible to see that genuine wrongs are righted so long as the ORG does not thereby promote or countenance a nefarious object or bargain which it is bound to condemn . \u201d ( PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL per ORG ) .", "In PERSON v. Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) , ORG applied the \u201c public conscience test \u201d to determine whether ex turpi causa , or an analogous rule of public policy , would prevent the estate of a detainee who had committed suicide whilst in custody from recovering damages . In doing so the court was aware that the test had been disapproved by ORG in GPE v. PERSON which was , however , a contractual claim , being the locus classicus for the application of the maxim .", "In PERSON v. PERSON ( No . CARDINAL ) ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL ) substantial damages were awarded to a plaintiff who had suffered head injuries in a road accident and who claimed that , but for the consequent personality change , he would not have committed the offences of sexually assaulting and maliciously wounding CARDINAL women and raping and maliciously wounding a third woman for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment . In PERSON ( No . CARDINAL ) ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL ) the plaintiff \u2019s action to recover damages , which had been awarded against him to CARDINAL of the victims of his crimes , was dismissed on the grounds that the damages awarded to the victims were too remote to be recoverable and that such an award would be contrary to public policy . PERSON rejected the contention that such an argument would have affected the award of damages he had made in PERSON ( No . CARDINAL ) .", "The offence of manslaughter is a crime which varies infinitely in its seriousness and the underlying intentionality of the act . Public policy must reflect the variety in degree of culpability . Such a principle was endorsed by ORG in Gray v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL QB CARDINAL ) when it considered the application of the forfeiture rule in relation to the rights of inheritance , and by ORG in NORP v. Chief ORG Commissioner ex parte PERSON ( [ DATE ] LAW ) . In the case of forfeiture ORG intervened by passing the LAW DATE to prohibit the inflexible application of public policy . In GPE v. Plant , ORG observed that :", "\u201c the harshness of applying the forfeiture rule inflexibly to all classes of manslaughter in all circumstances is such that I do not consider that , absent the statutory intervention which occurred , the rule could have survived unvaried to the present day ... Furthermore , it seems to me that the only way of modifying the rule would have been to have declined to apply it where the facts of the crime involved such a low degree of culpability , or such a high degree of mitigation , that the sanction of forfeiture , far from giving effect to the public interest , would have been contrary to it . Alternative suggestions that the rule should be restricted to cases of deliberate killing , or deliberate violence leading to death , do not cater for cases of diminished responsibility or provocation , where the mitigating features may be such as to render it particularly harsh to apply the forfeiture rule . \u201d", "Under the rules set out in M\u2019Naghten \u2019s Case ( [ CARDINAL]CARDINAL ORG . & F. CARDINAL ) . ( \u201c the M\u2019Naghten \u201d rules ) , the accused must prove on the balance of probabilities ( or to counter his claim of diminished responsibility the prosecution may prove , but beyond reasonable doubt ) that at the time of the act he was \u201c labouring under such defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing , or , if he did know it , that he did not know it was wrong \u201d .", "The sentence for manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility is at large unlike murder where the penalty is fixed by statute as being a life sentence . LAW DATE provides that the accused must be suffering from such abnormality of mind ( whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind , or any inherent cause , or induced by disease or injury ) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts or omissions in doing or being a party to the killing .", "According to the applicant , the distinction between conviction of guilty of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility and acquittal of murder by reason of insanity can , in practice , be artificial . The applicant observes that , until recently , the consequences of a verdict of insanity were so unattractive that an accused would very rarely accede to such a verdict or enter such a plea . In the applicant \u2019s view , this was because , until the Criminal Procedure ( Insanity and Unfitness to Plead ) Act DATE , a court would be required to admit such an individual to a hospital subject to a restriction order without limit of time and with no flexibility or discretion given to the sentencing judge ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
