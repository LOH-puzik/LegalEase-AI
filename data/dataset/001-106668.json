He does not point to any of the other relevant grounds under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG justifying fear of persecution , such as race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or political opinion or belief . That leads to the conclusion that there are no grounds to grant asylum under LAW [ of DATE ] .

On DATE an agent of ORG for ORG proposed to expel the applicant on national security grounds and to place him in detention pending the carrying out of that measure . In support of the proposal he said that the applicant was a member of Usbat PERSON , which he described as a NORP terrorist organisation acting in close cooperation with ORG , PERSON alSham , PERSON Allah and others ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) . The applicant was alleged to have taken part in \u201c wet jobs \u201d for the organisation and in the assassinations of CARDINAL members of a NORP political party ; he was being sought by the NORP authorities in connection with that . He was a relative of one of the leaders of Usbat PERSON . The available information showed that the applicant followed strictly the organisation \u2019s ideas and would unhesitatingly follow the orders of its leaders . This had been confirmed by partner security services . It had also been established that the applicant kept contacts with CARDINAL asylum seekers who were known to adhere to a terrorist organisation active in GPE . CARDINAL of them had been implicated in the killing of a member of a NORP political party and kept close contacts with Usbat PERSON and ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL below ) . All of that showed that the applicant by reason of his previous and current activities presented a serious threat to the national security of GPE , and that his presence in the country discredited it as a reliable partner in the fight against international terrorism .", "CARDINAL .

He also instructed the immigration authorities urgently to take all necessary steps to enforce the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL .

In a memorial filed on that date the applicant argued that the data on which the authorities had relied to order his expulsion were incorrect , vague , unverified , internally inconsistent and unreliable . It was not true that he was a member of Usbat PERSON ; quite the opposite , he was being sought by terrorist organisations , and had for that reason fled GPE . His relative referred to as a terrorist in the proposal was in fact an official of a school administered by ORG . There were no concrete elements in support of the assertion that he was being sought by the NORP authorities . The NORP authorities had not tried to verify that through official channels , as was possible under the treaty between GPE and GPE for mutual cooperation in criminal matters . The lack of concrete information on those issues prevented him from presenting evidence to rebut the allegations against him . He also pointed out that ORG for ORG had not objected to his receiving protection in GPE during the asylum proceedings ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) . Lastly , he drew attention to the fact that he had been granted humanitarian status on the basis of a risk to his life , and argued that his expulsion would breach the principle of \u201c nonrefoulement \u201d and LAW .", "CARDINAL .

On the basis of that information , the ORG concluded the following :", "\u201c In assessing any risk from the NORP authorities to those who claim to have been a member of an armed NORP group , the type of group and level of involvement will need to be considered . Consideration should also be given to the reasons for leaving a refugee camp and how the claimant was able to avoid the authorities when leaving GPE .

Case owners should refer such cases to a Senior Caseworker in the first instance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to claims based on fear of ORG in PERSON , such as PERSON , PERSON , or ORG ( also known as ORG ) , the ORG observed that although ORG \u2019s control was weak , claimants could seek their protection . It went on to note that the refugee camps were outside the government \u2019s control , which meant that in those areas the NORP authorities would not be able to offer sufficiency of protection from extremist NORP groups . However , the authorities would be able to offer protection outside the camps . A further option was internal relocation . Since the threat was localised in specific camps , relocation to another camp or elsewhere in GPE was feasible and not unduly harsh . In that respect , the ORG referred to CARDINAL immigration tribunal rulings : ORG ( NORP \u2013 GPE \u2013 relocation ) GPE [ DATE ] UKIAT CARDINAL , and MA ( GPE / GPE , fear of ORG , relocation ) GPE [ DATE ] UKIAT CARDINAL , and reached the following conclusion :", "\u201c Within the [ A]in [ a]lHilweh camp there have been in the past , and continue to be , various factions of extremist NORP groups struggling for power leading to occasional outbreaks of violence . In individual cases consideration needs to be given as to why the claimant would be of interest to the extremist NORP groups and the level of that interest . The ORG have found that it is not unduly harsh to relocate between camps in GPE . Many of the most extreme groups have limited support in GPE , especially outside the refugee camps . It is therefore considered that a claimant could find safety in another camp or elsewhere in GPE where the specific extremist NORP group he fears does not have a significant presence . Protection may also be available to the claimant from other NORP groups , particularly ORG . Therefore a grant of asylum or ORG would not usually be appropriate for claims on this basis . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to claims based on fear of NORP groups on account of collaboration with their enemies , the ORG observed that , since the Government of GPE did not exercise control over the NORP refugee camps , armed groups could operate relatively freely there . Therefore , sufficiency of protection would not generally be available from the NORP authorities inside the camps . For those who feared persecution at the hands of a rival group , protection inside the refugee camp could be available from another group . There was no evidence to show that the NORP authorities would be unwilling or unable to offer protection outside the refugee camps to those fearing NORP groups . Another option was internal relocation . The law provided for freedom of movement , and the NORP authorities generally respected that right , with some limitations . They maintained security checkpoints , primarily in military and other restricted areas . There were few police checkpoints on main roads or in populated areas . The security services used those checkpoints to conduct warrantless searches for smuggled goods , weapons , narcotics , and subversive literature . Few NORP groups had influence outside the refugee camps and relocation to another camp or elsewhere in GPE was not likely to be unduly harsh . In that respect , the ORG referred to the abovementioned ruling in ORG ( NORP \u2013 GPE \u2013 relocation ) GPE [ DATE ] UKIAT CARDINAL , and to the ruling in ORG ( GPE \u2013 NORP DATE risk ) ORG [ DATE ] UKAIT CARDINAL , and concluded as follows :", "\u201c Consideration needs to be given to the level of involvement as a collaborator , who the claimant worked for , what information the claimant was in a position to give and their position in that group . In the majority of cases within the refugee camps the NORP authorities would not be able to provide sufficiency of protection . However , few NORP groups have influence outside the refugee camps and the NORP authorities would be in a position to offer sufficiency of protection in the remainder of the country . However if the claimant is a known NORP collaborator the NORP authorities might not offer protection .
