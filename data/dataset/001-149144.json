By decisions of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE the ORG ( a ) declared that CARDINAL plots of land in Split in the applicant \u2019s possession had been nationalised and become socially - owned already on CARDINAL DATE with the entry into force of the GPE \u2019s Act Designating the Construction Land in LOC and Urban Areas ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , and ( b ) dispossessed the applicant of the land at issue with a view to constructing a block of flats and an elementary school on them .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG expropriated the house owned by the applicant which was built on CARDINAL of the plots in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE offered the applicant as compensation permanent usage ( trajno kori\u0161tenje ) of another plot of land for the construction of a house . The applicant refused the offer and instituted non - contentious proceedings with ORG ( PERSON ORG ) with a view to obtaining compensation for his nationalised and expropriated property under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW ( hereafter \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) entered into force . Shortly afterwards , the case was transferred to the administrative authorities , in particular to the regional office of the state administration in GPE ( ORG dr\u017eavne uprave u ORG - dalmatinskoj \u017eupaniji , hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant amended his request , asking for HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL in total .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the tax authorities carried out another onsite inspection and assessed the value of the nationalised land at HRK CARDINAL . On DATE the tax authorities assessed the value of the expropriated house at HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE the applicant contested the findings of the tax authorities and undertook to submit proof of the current market value of the appropriated property .", "CARDINAL . The applicant engaged a court expert , PERSON , to carry out the property valuation . On DATE Mr NORP drew up a report establishing the market value of the nationalised land at HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The applicant submitted the report to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant increased his request for compensation , arguing that the value of the nationalised land had meanwhile risen to HRK CARDINAL . He relied on the rise of land prices in DATE and DATE caused by the construction of the Split ring - road .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG awarded the applicant compensation in the overall amount of HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . Specifically , it relied on PERSON expert opinion of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and awarded HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL for the nationalised land . It further awarded HRK CARDINAL for the expropriated house , relying on valuation by the tax authorities of DATE . Lastly , it awarded HRK CARDINAL for the construction improvements and agricultural crops , relying on an older valuation by the tax authorities . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c The market value is the price which an immovable property can obtain on the market , dependent on supply and demand at the time of its determination .", "According to the ... valuation by the tax authorities of DATE , the immovable property \u2019s value is HRK CARDINAL per square metre ... according to the DATE valuation , it is HRK CARDINAL per square metre .", "According to the valuation submitted by [ the applicant ] , carried out by the court expert for civil engineering and property valuation , Mr. PERSON , in DATE , the immovable property \u2019s value is ORG QUANTITY ( HRK CARDINAL ) .", "As the valuation of the court expert Mr. PERSON is newer and does not significantly differ from the valuation [ by the tax authorities ] ... there were no reasons for dismissing the [ Mr NORP \u2019s ] valuation as it represents the price of construction land in that location . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against the above decision before ORG ( ORG pravosu\u0111a PERSON , hereinafter \u201c the NORP \u201d ) , arguing , inter alia , that under section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) the compensation should have been calculated on the basis of the market value at the time when the decision on compensation was adopted . He submitted a number of items of evidence , such as newspaper articles and decisions on compensation in other cases , pointing out that the market value had risen during DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal in the part concerning the compensation for the nationalised land . At the same time it quashed the first - instance decision in the remaining part ( including the compensation for the expropriated house ) and remitted the case . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c The level of compensation for the undeveloped construction land [ the applicant ] was dispossessed of was correctly determined . The first - instance authority accepted the expert opinion of PERSON of DATE , and not the earlier valuations by the tax authorities ...", "The argument raised in the appeal ... that the compensation was set ... too low is unfounded .", "Namely , in proceedings involving dispossession compensation is fixed by applying provisions of LAW on market value compensation . However , [ in such cases ] the market value compensation must be determined with regard to the state of the immovable property and the modes of its usage at the time of deprivation . [ The applicant \u2019s data on the higher price of construction land ] concern construction land with the entire necessary infrastructure , whereas the land in question did not have the entire infrastructure at the time of deprivation [ i.e. dispossession in DATE ] . Therefore , the current market value of the land in the same [ location ] in Split ( PERSON ) can not be used for comparison , as the state of immovable property in question in DATE and DATE differs significantly in terms of infrastructure . In addition , the construction of roads and the ring - road in DATE and DATE contributed significantly to the rise of the price of construction land , but has no significance for the level of compensation correctly established in DATE . Therefore , the expert opinion can not be deemed too old with regard to the date of the adoption of the first - instance decision ... as it sets the price in CARDINAL as well ...", "However , [ the applicant \u2019s ] appeal is well - founded in part concerning the compensation for the house , the construction improvements and the agricultural crops . ... [ Valuations ] by the tax authorities [ in respect of that property ] do not include any reasoning and it is unclear on the basis of which criteria this part of the compensation has been determined .", "Therefore , such findings can not serve as a starting point for fixing the compensation for that property ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant then brought an action for judicial review in ORG PERSON ) against the ORG \u2019s decision , maintaining that the amount of compensation for the nationalised land had not been established in accordance with the relevant legislation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He requested HRK CARDINAL for the land in question .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action , endorsing the reasoning given by ORG . The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c It is undisputed that in the present case the compensation for the immovable property ... the plaintiff was dispossessed of must be determined in accordance with [ section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ] given that he was dispossessed of [ that ] property by the final decisions ... of GPE of DATE and DATE and because ... a final decision on compensation has not been rendered [ before the entry into force of the DATE LAW ] .", "When compensation ... is being determined by applying section CARDINAL of the [ DATE ] LAW it must be fixed with regard to the state of the immovable property and the modes of its usage at the time of deprivation and the market value [ of such property ] ... at the time the compensation was being determined ( section CARDINAL of the [ DATE ] LAW ) .", "...", "In determining level of compensation the administrative authorities assessed all the relevant circumstances , in particular the state of the immovable property at the time of deprivation ( construction land without any infrastructure ) [ and ] market supply and demand of the land of the same or similar characteristics ... at the time of assessing its value . ...", "[ Therefore , ] by fixing the compensation for the immovable property the plaintiff had been dispossessed of at HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL the first- and the second - instance administrative authority correctly applied section CARDINAL of the [ DATE ] LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged an appeal on points of law ( revizija ) with ORG ( PERSON ) against that judgment , reiterating his previous arguments .", "CARDINAL .

The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c As regards the plaintiff \u2019s arguments that the compensation was not determined in accordance with the market value [ of the land ] at the time of adoption of the first - instance decision ... ORG was correct to agree with the findings of the first- and the second - instance [ administrative authority ] whereby those arguments had been dismissed as unfounded .", "In so doing sufficient reasons were given , the evidence submitted by the plaintiff was examined and it was established that the data submitted [ by the plaintiff ] concern the immovable property which significantly differ ( in terms of infrastructure ) from that he had been dispossessed of . For that reason it was not possible to compare the state and the current market value of that immovable property with the state of the immovable property the plaintiff had been dispossessed of in DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
