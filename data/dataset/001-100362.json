The first applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently detained at FAC Full Sutton . He is represented before ORG , a firm of lawyers practising in GPE . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently detained at FAC . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON and PERSON , a firm of lawyers practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . s , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , firemen attended a fire at a house in GPE and discovered the body of GPE , a heroin addict and dealer . He had been shot in the throat and stabbed with CARDINAL different knives a minimum of CARDINAL times . The fire had been started deliberately and burns to ORG body occurred after his death .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were acquaintances of ORG There was evidence that they had access to a shotgun on TIME in question and the second applicant was seen with a shotgun wound to his finger and a burn to his abdomen TIME after the murder . Both applicants lied to their acquaintances about how the second applicant had injured himself .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were subsequently arrested in connection with the murder .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was interviewed twice by the police under caution in connection with the murder of ORG and CARDINAL times , again under caution , on DATE . In the course of the interviews , he was asked to account for his movements in TIME of CARDINAL DATE , to explain the items found in his car and to account for gun damage to , and ORG \u2019s blood found in , the car . He made no reply to the questions asked , except to say that he did not know what the police officers were \u201c going on about \u201d and \u201c it \u2019s nowt [ nothing ] to do with me \u201d . His solicitor made it clear in the interview that he had advised the first applicant to exercise his right to silence . The second applicant was similarly interviewed , under caution , CARDINAL times in DATE and also made no comment , again on legal advice .", "CARDINAL . Both men were charged with murder . The prosecution case against the applicants was that ORG had been given heroin prior to his death in order to pacify him . Heroin was found in the car used by the applicants on TIME of the murder . The second applicant \u2019s blood was found in the same room as ORG \u2019s body and ORG \u2019s blood was found on a pair of glasses belonging to the first applicant which were recovered from the first applicant \u2019s car . A stain on the ceiling of the car was composed of a mixture of material including the first applicant \u2019s DNA and DNA allegedly from GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE , both applicants were interviewed again under caution . The purpose of the interviews was to give them the opportunity to comment on forensic evidence regarding the blood staining which had only recently become available and was therefore not put to them in the DATE interviews and to comment on the blood found on the glasses . Both applicants instructed different solicitors from those representing them in the DATE interviews . Both applicants answered questions in relation to the blood staining . They gave the same explanation for how ORG \u2019s blood came to be on his glasses and the ceiling of the car , namely that on the DATE preceding the murder PERSON had injected himself with amphetamines while in the car and had subsequently tried on the first applicant \u2019s glasses . The second applicant explained that he had visited ORG house DATE or CARDINAL before the murder with the first applicant and that he had , while there , injected himself with amphetamines . He assumed that any trace of his blood at the house came from that injection .", "CARDINAL . At trial , both applicants gave evidence in accordance with the account given to the police during the DATE interviews . They both explained that their silence in the DATE interview was based on legal advice . Both gave evidence that they had been together at the time of the murder on an aborted expedition to catch a badger and denied any knowledge of or involvement in the murder .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the evidence outlined above , the prosecution also relied on a witness , PERSON , who claimed that the first applicant had confessed to the murder when they had been in adjoining cells in DATE . The evidence of PERSON had not been put to the applicants during either of the interviews as he did not come forward until DATE , after the interviews had been conducted .", "CARDINAL . In his summing up , the judge began by emphasising to the jury that the burden lay on the prosecution to prove the charge against the applicants :", "\u201c ... It is a basic principle of any criminal trial that the Prosecution brings the charge and the Prosecution must prove it . It is for the Prosecution to establish each defendant \u2019s guilt . The Defence do not have to prove anything ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the silence of the applicants in the DATE interviews , the judge gave the following direction :", "\u201c ... [ W]hen the defendants were interviewed during DATE they refused to answer any questions put to them . Consequently , they did not mention any of the matters now relied upon in their Defence during those interviews . The defendants say that this refusal to answer questions was because of legal advice which they were receiving . It appears from the transcripts of the interviews that they were , indeed , receiving legal advice to that effect .", "In DATE , as I shall remind you when I come to review the factual evidence , the GPE stance changed . The defendants say that this was because their new solicitors were giving them different legal advice . It certainly appears from the transcripts in DATE the GPE legal advice became that they should answer questions . Indeed the answers which the defendants gave in and after DATE were consistent with their evidence in court . It is for you to decide whether the facts which the defendants failed to mention during the early interviews were facts which , in the circumstances , they could reasonably have been expected to mention . If they were then the law is that you may draw such inferences as appear proper from the GPE failure to mention these matters at the time . In considering whether the defendants could , reasonably , have been expected to mention during the early interviews the facts upon which they now rely in their defence you must consider all the circumstances . These circumstances include the legal advice which the defendants were receiving . If you are sure that the defendants could reasonably have been expected to mention those matters then what inferences can you draw ? Failure to mention a fact can not , on its own , prove guilt . But depending on the circumstances you may hold it against a defendant when deciding whether he is guilty . That is take it into account as some additional support for the Prosecution \u2019s case . You are not bound to do so . It is for you to decide whether it is fair to do so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in summarising the evidence against the applicants and their own explanations regarding the evidence , the judge reminded the jury of the applicants\u2019 answers to the questions put to them in the DATE interviews . He further reminded them that the first applicant had explained that he had refused to answer questions in the DATE interviews because his solicitors had advised him to remain silent . His explanation for his responses in the DATE interview was that he had changed solicitors and his new solicitors had advised him to answer questions . He had accordingly done so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants were convicted of murder and were sentenced to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG for leave to appeal against conviction . The grounds of appeal made no reference to any alleged deficiencies in the adverse inferences direction . Instead , the grounds complained of , inter alia , reliance by the prosecution on the confession of PERSON , alleged deficiencies in the conduct of the police and alleged inadequate prosecution disclosure . Leave to appeal was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant applied to ORG ( \u201c CCRC \u201d ) for a referral of his case back to ORG . It is not clear whether the second applicant also made an application to the ORG at this time . No complaint about the adverse inferences direction was raised in the ORG application . On DATE , the ORG decided not to refer the convictions back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant re - applied to the ORG alleging that the trial judge \u2019s adverse inferences direction was deficient . On DATE , his conviction was referred to ORG by the ORG . The second applicant applied to the ORG on DATE . On DATE , his conviction was also referred back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , the applicants argued that the directions to the jury were defective in that the jury was not directed that adverse inferences could only be drawn if the jury was satisfied that the real reason for the applicants\u2019 silence was that they had no answer at the time or none that would stand up to scrutiny . They further argued that the trial judge had erred in not identifying the precise facts to which the adverse inferences direction related and leaving it open to the jury to draw adverse inferences in relation to some facts relied upon in respect of which adverse inferences should not have been drawn . The ORG accepted that there had been a material misdirection on both grounds but argued that the convictions were safe and that any appeal should therefore be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG handed down its judgment . PERSON noted ( at DATE ) :", "\u201c It is even at this stage worth putting that direction into context . First , it was a direction discussed between the judge and counsel before the summing up commenced . Prosecuting counsel approved the same and leading counsel acting for each of the appellants also approved the same . Following the conviction there was an application for leave to appeal against conviction to ORG . In the grounds no reliance was placed on the inadequacy of the s.CARDINAL direction , and the application was refused on DATE . The appellant PERSON applied to the ORG for a review of his conviction on DATE . We assume the appellant ORG did likewise . It would seem that in those applications there was no suggestion that the s.CARDINAL direction was inadequate and on DATE the ORG decided not to refer either conviction to ORG .", "It was only on DATE that there was a re - application to the ORG , based on the direction under s.CARDINAL and an assertion that it was insufficient and called into question the safety of the convictions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the appropriate approach to its review of the convictions , he commented ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c We are troubled as to what should be the right approach of ORG in a case such as the present . We follow the argument based on the absolutist approach . But if an absolutist approach must be adopted in all cases where a misdirection is now identified in respect of cases where it has never previously been suggested that a trial was unfair , or a conviction unsafe , that would seem to leave it open to appellants on the advice of lawyers to bring before the ORG cases where permission to appeal out of time might not have been given . It is relevant , as it seems to us , in considering a s.CARDINAL case , and indeed this case , to recognise that all the points taken as to the inadequacy of the direction , are points taken in other cases . In other words it is important to recognise that it was open to the appellants in this case to take the points now taken , if anyone had thought of them at the trial or immediately after the trial , if it were thought that there was force in any argument that the trial had been unfair . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON concluded ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c We believe that an absolutist approach , particularly to a reference , is not called for . The essential question is whether any misdirection identified has caused an injustice and whether ORG is satisfied that the verdict was safe . In reaching a decision as to the safety of the verdict it may assist to analyse first how the case was left to the jury by virtue of the direction given and then second to analyse how it would have been left to the jury if a proper direction had been given . The court should then assess , whether having regard to the jury \u2019s verdict on the direction as given , the jury would have been bound to convict if a proper direction had been given . Only , of course , if the court is sure that the jury would have been bound to convict can the verdict be said to be safe . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the adverse inferences direction given by the trial judge , PERSON noted ( at paragraphs DATE ) :", "\u201c As we previously indicated that direction was discussed between counsel and the judge . A transcript of that discussion was placed before us , demonstrating that counsel for the appellants , Mr GPE QC for ORG and Mr PERSON for PERSON , were content with a direction on those lines and they had no submission to make .", "CARDINAL . He continued :", "The direction is on any view defective in certain significant respects . First it does not give the direction that:\u2014", "CARDINAL . An adverse direction could only be drawn if the jury were satisfied that the real reason for silence was that the appellants had no answer at the time , or none that would stand up to scrutiny .", "CARDINAL . It was deficient in that the judge did not identify the precise facts to which the direction related . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He commented ( at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c [ Counsel for the prosecution ] \u2019s submission was that so far as legal advice was concerned , the appellants received a favourable direction . He submits that the inference to be drawn from the judge \u2019s direction that the transcripts indicated that they did receive legal advice that they should not answer questions , and his drawing attention to the fact that that advice changed and that once they had advice to the contrary in DATE they gave evidence in accordance with that advice , are all directions which would have steered the jury to the view that reliance on the advice in DATE was reasonable .", "We accept that the [ trial judge \u2019s ] steer was in the appellants\u2019 favour , but the direction still left it open to the jury to draw adverse inferences , and the submission is not a complete answer to [ counsel for the appellants\u2019 ] submissions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the second criticism concerning the failure of the trial judge to specify the facts to which his adverse inferences direction referred , he noted ( at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL )", "\u201c So far as the second criticism is concerned , i.e. the failure to specify the facts to which the direction applied , [ counsel for the prosecution ] had to accept the criticism made . But would a direction setting out all the facts with which the appellants failed to deal in DATE have assisted the appellants ? In the respondent \u2019s skeleton first produced for ORG the argument was that if the judge had highlighted all the facts which the appellants might have referred to in their first interviews that would have been enormously damaging to the appellants ... There is , as we would see it , force in that submission and the fact that all facts which might have been referred to were not set out seems to us to have been of benefit to the appellants . However , in considering what direction to give and , on the basis that key facts in relation to which an adverse inference might be drawn should be specified , the judge would have been likely to concentrate on one , or possibly CARDINAL , of the facts . The key fact of which the appellants gave no explanation until they came to give evidence was that they were innocently going on a badger hunt TIME and that that accounted for the gun and other items they had in the car and accounted for their movements that morning .", "It was also put to the appellants that the deceased \u2019s blood had been found on the ceiling of the ORG and , again , no explanation was given as to how that had happened .", "Therefore the direction should have contained words to the following effect:-", "\u2018 As part of their defence the defendants have relied upon the fact that they were going on a badger hunt in TIME of DATE and on the fact that there was an explanation for the deceased \u2019s blood being in the ORG , i.e. that the deceased had injected himself in that motorcar . The prosecution say and indeed the appellants admit that they did not mention those facts when they were interviewed about the offences in DATE . This failure may count against them . This is because you may draw the conclusion from that failure that they have since invented those matters and had no answer to the case being put to them by the police , or no answer that would stand up to scrutiny . If you do draw that conclusion you must not convict them wholly or mainly on the strength of it , but you may take it into account as some additional support for the prosecution \u2019s case , when deciding whether the ORG evidence about these facts is true . However , you may draw that conclusion only if you think it is a fair and proper conclusion and you are satisfied CARDINAL things : first , that when they were interviewed they could have reasonably been expected to mention the facts on which they now rely ; second , that the only sensible explanation for their failure to do so is that they had no answer at the time or none that would stand up to scrutiny ; third , that apart from their failure to mention those facts the prosecution \u2019s case against them was so strong that it clearly called for an answer by NORP \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c It seems to us clear from the jury \u2019s finding that they must have been sure that the explanation given by the appellants for their whereabouts was a lie , and that the explanation given for the blood of the deceased in the [ car ] was a lie . The argument for the appellants has to be that the jury may have been \u2018 tipped\u2019 to forming that conclusion by their failure to answer questions in DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON concluded ( at paragraphs DATE ) :", "\u201c In our view the position is as follows . First , on the direction that the jury were given it is most unlikely that they held the silence in DATE against the appellants , the judge stressing their reliance on the advice of a solicitor at that time . If , however , because , as we must accept , the possibility of drawing an adverse inference was left open to the jury , then , in this case , there is absolutely no basis on which it can legitimately be said there was good reason , even relying on solicitors\u2019 advice , for not saying where they were on that TIME or giving the explanation for how the deceased \u2019s blood came to be in the [ car ] . Thus to have drawn an adverse inference from the failure in the DATE interviews to mention where they were and how blood got on the ceiling of the [ car ] could not , in the circumstances of this case , in any way be unfair . Furthermore , in our view , the jury would inevitably have been sure that the explanation given in the witness box was made up and not produced at the DATE interviews because it was an explanation that would not stand up to scrutiny .", "Our overall view is that the s.CARDINAL direction given was not in fact unfair to the appellants , indeed , if anything , it steered the jury away from drawing any adverse inference . If a fuller direction had been given it would have emphasised that which the appellants could have disclosed in the DATE interviews and it would have emphasised that reliance on the advice of the solicitor was not necessarily good enough . It would indeed have made it more likely that the jury would have drawn an adverse inference than the direction that was in fact given . Furthermore , it seems to us that one can be sure that in rejecting the evidence of the appellants , the jury were in fact sure that the appellants did not have an explanation which they could have given in DATE which would have stood up to scrutiny . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of ORG LAW DATE provides that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence , evidence is given that the accused\u2013", "( a ) at any time before he was charged with the offence , on being questioned under caution by a constable trying to discover whether or by whom the offence had been committed , failed to mention any fact relied on in his defence in those proceedings ;", "...", "being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time the accused could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned , charged or informed , as the case may be , subsection ( CARDINAL ) below applies .", "( CARDINAL ) Where this subsection applies", "...", "( d ) the court or jury , in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged ,", "may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper .", "( CARDINAL ) Subject to any directions by the court , evidence tending to establish the failure may be given before or after evidence tending to establish the fact which the accused is alleged to have failed to mention .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ) provides that :", "\u201c A person shall not ... be convicted of an offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure or refusal as is mentioned in section GPE ) ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . A number of domestic cases have considered the application of section CARDINAL in practice . In NORP v PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) , Lord PERSON set out CARDINAL \u201c essentials \u201d when making a direction on adverse inferences :", "\u201c We consider that the specimen direction is in general terms a sound guide . It may be necessary to adapt it to the particular circumstances of an individual case . But there are certain essentials which we would highlight :", "CARDINAL . The judge will have told the jury that the burden of proof remains upon the prosecution throughout and what the standard required is .", "CARDINAL . It is necessary for the judge to make clear to the jury that the defendant is entitled to remain silent . That is his right and his choice .", "CARDINAL . An inference from failure to give evidence can not on its own prove guilt . That is expressly stated in section CARDINAL ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , the jury must be satisfied that the prosecution have established a case to answer before drawing any inferences from silence . Of course , the judge must have thought so or the question whether the defendant was to give evidence would not have arisen . But the jury may not believe the witnesses whose evidence the judge considered sufficient to raise a prima facie case . It must therefore be made clear to them that they must find there to be a case to answer on the prosecution evidence before drawing an adverse inference from the defendant \u2019s silence .", "CARDINAL . NORP If despite any evidence relied upon to explain his silence or in the absence of any such evidence , the jury conclude the silence can only sensibly be attributed to the defendant \u2019s having no answer or none that would stand up to cross - examination , they may draw an adverse inference . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in NORP v. ORG ( [ DATE ] Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) , Lord PERSON added a sixth condition that had to be met before section CARDINAL of the DATE Act would allow inferences to be drawn :", "\u201c The sixth condition is that the appellant failed to mention a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time the accused could reasonably have been expected to mention when questioned . The time referred to is the time of questioning , and account must be taken of all the relevant circumstances existing at the time . The courts should not construe the expression \u2018 in the LOC restrictively : matters such as the time of day , the defendant \u2019s age , experience , mental capacity , state of health , sobriety , tiredness , knowledge , personality and legal advice are all part of the relevant circumstances ; and those are only examples of things which may be relevant ...", "Like so many other questions in criminal trials this is a question to be resolved by the jury in the exercise of their collective common - sense , experience and understanding of human nature . Sometimes they may conclude that it was reasonable for the defendant to have held his peace for a host of reasons , such as he was ... worried at committing himself without legal advice , acting on legal advice , or some other reason accepted by the jury . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has considered a number of cases in which the defendant \u2019s alleged that the adverse inferences direction was deficient on one the basis that it failed to include a direction to the effect that adverse inferences could only be drawn where the jury was satisfied that the real reason for the defendant \u2019s silence was that they he no answer to the questions asked , or no answer that would hold up to scrutiny , including R v. ORG and ORG ( [ DATE ] PERSON ) ; R v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] EWCA Crim CARDINAL ) ; R v. GPE ( DATE ] EWCA Crim CARDINAL ) ; and R v. PERSON and ORG [ DATE ] PERSON ) . In all these cases , with the exception of ORG , the court granted the appeals on the basis of this ORG \u2019s judgment in ORG , cited above .", "CARDINAL . Guidance as to the direction which the judge should give the jury in respect of section CARDINAL of ORG LAW DATE are provided by ORG , which provides specimen directions . At the time of the ORG trial , the relevant part of the specimen direction read as follows :", "\u201c If he failed to mention [ a fact ] ... when he was questioned , decide whether in the circumstances which existed at the time , it was a fact which he could reasonably have been expected then to mention .

It is for you to decide whether it is proper to do so .

It is for you to decide whether it is fair to do so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The specimen direction was updated and revised in DATE but it is not clear whether the amended direction was available to the judge at the time of the ORG trial . It included the following section :", "\u201c ...
