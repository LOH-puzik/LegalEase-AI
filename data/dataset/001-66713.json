He is represented before the Court by Mr ORG , a lawyer practising in PERSON . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "I.", "In DATE the applicant was carrying out his business through some private limited companies in GPE . He emigrated from GPE to GPE on DATE .", "As to the income DATE , the applicant failed to fulfil his obligation to file his tax return . Thus , in DATE ORG in ORG made a discretionary assessment , that the applicant for DATE had had MONEY ( SEK ) as income from employment , SEK CARDINAL as income from capital , and that his taxable property amounted to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . At the same time , pursuant to LAW ( Taxeringslagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) a tax surcharge of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL was imposed on the applicant , which he did not appeal against .", "In DATE , a search was carried out at the premises of the applicant \u2019s auditor . In this connection information was found , which indicated that the applicant \u2019s taxable income for DATE had been considerably larger than ORG has assessed in DATE . Accordingly , ORG carried out an additional assessment . By decision of DATE the applicant \u2019s income from employment , capital , and taxable property was increased by respectively SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL , SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL , and SEK CARDINAL , resulting in an additional tax calculated at SEK CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE an additional tax surcharge was imposed pursuant to chapter DATE , section CARDINAL of LAW , amounting to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL equal to MONEY of the additional income tax levied .", "The applicant appealed against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE to ORG in GPE ( GPE i GPE L\u00e4n ) , which rejected his appeal by judgment of CARDINAL October CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG in GPE ( ORG ) , confirmed this decision . Leave to appeal was refused by ORG on DATE .", "II .", "In the meantime , by indictment of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was charged inter alia pursuant to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( Skattebrottslagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) with aggravated tax fraud in that he had failed to file his tax return for DATE allegedly with the intent of evading tax .", "On DATE before ORG in GPE ( PERSON ) the prosecution applied for the detention of the applicant on remand in absentia . The applicant , being absent but represented by counsel , applied for the criminal trial against him to be dismissed by invoking LAW of LAW no . CARDINAL to the LAW . By decision of DATE the court found against the applicant .", "On DATE , on appeal , ORG ( NORP \u00f6ver GPE ock Blekinge ) upheld the decision and ORG ( H\u00f6gsta Domstolen ) refused the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal on DATE .", "The applicant reported himself voluntarily to the police in ORG in DATE , whereupon the criminal trial against him commenced before ORG in GPE .", "Having heard inter alia the applicant \u2019s auditor as a witness , by a judgment of DATE ORG in PERSON convicted the applicant of aggravated tax fraud as it found it established that he had failed to file his tax return for the income DATE with the intent of evading part of the tax due , amounting in total to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "On appeal , by judgment of DATE ORG upheld the conviction but increased the sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "Leave to appeal against the judgment to ORG was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Taxes and tax surcharges", "Income tax and property tax are determined by the county tax authorities , to which taxpayers are obliged to submit information relevant to the assessment of taxes . For the purpose of securing timely , sufficient and correct information , there are provisions stipulating that , under certain circumstances , the tax authorities may impose administrative sanctions in the form of special charges - tax surcharges and delay charges DATE on the taxpayer . The said charges were introduced into NORP tax legislation in DATE ( up till then a taxpayer \u2019s submission of incorrect information could only be sanctioned within the penal system ) . According to the preparatory notes ( Government PERSON ) the main purpose of the reform was to create a more effective and fairer system of penalties than the old one , which was based entirely on criminal penalties determined by the ordinary courts following police investigation and prosecution . Unlike sanctions for tax offences , the administrative charges are determined solely on objective grounds , without regard to any form of intent or negligence on the part of the taxpayer .", "A tax surcharge is imposed on a taxpayer in CARDINAL situations : if he or she , in a tax return or in any other written statement , has submitted information of relevance to the tax assessment which is found to be incorrect ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ) or if , following a discretionary assessment , the tax authority decides not to rely on the tax return ( chapter CARDINAL , LAW ) . It is not only statements expressly submitted that may lead to the imposition of a surcharge ; concealment , in whole or in part , of relevant facts may also be regarded as incorrect information . However , incorrect claims are not penalised ; if the taxpayer has given a clear account of the factual circumstances but has made an incorrect evaluation of the legal consequences thereof , no surcharge is imposed . The burden of proving that the information is incorrect lies with the tax authority . A discretionary tax assessment is made if the taxpayer has submitted information which is so inadequate that the tax authority can not base its tax assessment on it or if he or she has not filed a tax return despite having been reminded of the obligation to do so ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . In the latter case the decision to impose a tax surcharge will be revoked if the taxpayer files a tax return within a certain time - limit . The surcharge amounts to MONEY of either the income tax which ORG would have failed to levy if it had accepted the incorrect information or the income tax levied under the discretionary assessment ( the corresponding provisions on value - added tax and employer \u2019s contributions stipulate that the surcharge equals MONEY of the supplementary tax levied on the taxpayer . In certain circumstances , the rates applied are MONEY or MONEY respectively , for the various types of tax ) .", "Notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayer has furnished incorrect information , no tax surcharge will be imposed in certain situations , for example when the tax authority has corrected obvious miscalculations or written errors by the taxpayer , when the information has been corrected or could have been corrected with the aid of certain documents that should have been available to the tax authorities , such as a certificate of income from the employer , or when the taxpayer has corrected the information voluntarily ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) .", "Moreover , in certain circumstances , a tax surcharge will be remitted . Thus , taxpayers will not have to pay a surcharge if their failure to submit correct information or to file a tax return is considered excusable owing to their age , illness , lack of experience or comparable circumstances . The surcharge should also be remitted when the failure appears excusable by reason of the nature of the information in question or other special circumstances , or when it would be manifestly unreasonable to impose a surcharge ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . The phrase \u201c the nature of the information \u201d primarily covers situations where a taxpayer has had to assess an objectively complicated tax question . According to the preparatory documents ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , the expression \u201c manifestly unreasonable \u201d refers to situations in which the imposition of a tax surcharge would be disproportionate to the fault attributable to the taxpayer or would be unacceptable for other reasons . If the facts of the case so require , the tax authorities must have regard to the provisions on remission , even in the absence of a specific claim to that effect by the taxpayer ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . In principle , however , it is up to the taxpayer to show due cause for the remission of a surcharge .", "If dissatisfied with a decision concerning taxes and tax surcharges , the taxpayer may , before the end of DATE after DATE , request the tax authority to reconsider its decision ( chapter CARDINAL , sections TIME ) . A decision concerning surcharges may also be reviewed at the taxpayer \u2019s request after the expiry of this time - limit , if the decision on the underlying tax issue has not yet become final ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . The tax authority may also , on its own motion , decide to review its own earlier decision . A review to the taxpayer \u2019s disadvantage must be made before DATE following the assessment year unless the taxpayer , inter alia , has submitted incorrect information during the course of the tax proceedings or has failed to file a tax return or to furnish required information , in which case the time - limit normally expires at DATE after DATE ( chapter CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "The tax authority \u2019s decision may also be appealed against to a county administrative court . As with requests for reconsideration , an appeal has to be lodged before DATE after DATE ( chapter CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , unless it concerns a tax surcharge based on a tax decision that has not yet become final ( chapter DATE , section CARDINAL ) . Following the appeal , the tax authority must reconsider its decision as soon as possible and , if it decides to vary the decision in accordance with the taxpayer \u2019s request , the appeal will become void ( chapter DATE , section CARDINAL ) . If the decision is not thus amended , the appeal is referred to the county administrative court . If special reasons exist , an appeal may be forwarded by the tax authority to the county administrative court without reconsidering the assessment ( chapter DATE , section CARDINAL ) . Further appeals lie to an administrative court of appeal and , subject to compliance with the conditions for obtaining leave to appeal , ORG .", "A tax surcharge is connected to the tax in respect of which it has been imposed in that a successful objection to the underlying tax has an automatic effect on the tax surcharge , which is reduced correspondingly ( chapter CARDINAL , LAW ) . The tax surcharge may , however , be challenged separately , if grounds for reduction or remission exist ( see above ) .", "Decision concerning taxation can also be reconsidered on the tax authorities\u2019 own initiative . A review to the taxpayer \u2019s disadvantage must be made before DATE following DATE . However , in some situation such a review may be made until DATE following DATE , so - called additional assessment ( eftertaxering ) . This is the case , inter alia , if the taxpayer has provided incorrect information during the course of the tax proceedings or has failed to file a tax return despite the obligation to do so ( chapter CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL of LAW ) . An additional assessment shall only be made if an amount of some importance is at stake . When undertaking an additional assessment the tax authority has to decide about additional tax , i.e. tax that is imposed after the imposition of final tax has been concluded . It may also decide to impose a tax surcharge according to the principles above .", "CARDINAL . Criminal law provision", "A taxpayer who has not fulfilled his obligation to submit correct and relevant information to the tax authorities or who , with the object of evading tax , has failed to file a tax return or a similar document may be subjected to a criminal charge according to provisions laid down in LAW . For the taxpayer to be convicted on such a charge it has to be established that the failure to submit correct information or to file a tax return is the result of criminal intent or gross negligence on his part . A charge under the provisions of LAW is brought in accordance with the rules governing criminal proceedings in general , which means among others things that a taxpayer can only be convicted upon prosecution and trial by the general courts and that the burden of proof is on the prosecutor . It follows from sections DATE of LAW that a taxpayer who intentionally submits incorrect information in writing to the tax authorities or who fails to file a tax return , thereby causing risk of an erroneous taxation to his advantage , shall be sentenced to a penalty ranging from a fine for petty offences to imprisonment for a maximum of DATE for cases of aggravated tax crime ( grovtt skattebrott ) .", "The fact that a tax surcharge has already been imposed on the same grounds as those forming the basis of the criminal charge is no bar to criminal proceedings . Moreover , a decision to impose a tax surcharge has no binding force or any other effect that might prejudice the determination of the criminal charge . When considering the penal sanction , however , the general courts are supposed to pay attention to the fact that a surcharge has been imposed ( cf . Government PERSON , pp CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . A criminal charge should be brought against a taxpayer only if the evaded tax is of some significance . According to an agreement between ORG ( Riks\u00e5klagaren ) and ORG ( PERSON ) the tax authorities shall not normally inform the prosecutor unless the evaded tax amounts to CARDINAL per cent of the basic amount for national security purposes ( which in DATE amounted to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . In addition , section CARDINAL provides that an indictment shall not be brought for a petty tax offence , unless there are special reasons therefore .", "CARDINAL . Tax surcharges and the Convention in NORP case law", "In a judgment delivered on DATE ORG considered whether a person could be convicted of a tax offence in criminal proceedings following the imposition of a tax surcharge in tax proceedings ( case no . B CARDINAL - CARDINAL , published in Nytt juridiskt arkiv ( ORG ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . Having noted that , under NORP law , a surcharge is not considered a criminal penalty and thus does not prevent trial and conviction for a tax offence relating to the same act , ORG went on to examine the matter under LAW . It first considered , in the light of ORG case - law , that there were weighty arguments for regarding LAW as being applicable under its criminal head to proceedings involving a tax surcharge . Even assuming this to be the case , it held , however , that the principle of ne bis in idem , as set forth in LAW no . CARDINAL to the LAW , did not prevent criminal proceedings from being brought against someone for an act in respect of which a surcharge had already been levied as it was a matter of CARDINAL different offences . It underlined in this connection that the imposition of tax surcharges requires neither intent nor negligence , while in order to be convicted of tax fraud it must be established that the accused had a criminal intent .", "In a judgment delivered on DATE ORG considered whether the imposition of a tax surcharge in tax proceedings could be upheld following a person \u2019s conviction of a tax offence in criminal proceedings ( case no . DATE , published in PERSON ( R\u00c5 ) DATE , ref CARDINAL ) . ORG recalled inter alia :", "\u201c that taxation in GPE is largely based on information given by the individual and certification by him or her of information received from other sources . The purpose of the tax surcharge is to emphasise , inter alia , that the individual is required to be meticulous in fulfilling the duty of filing a tax return and the related obligation to submit information . In principle , carelessness is not acceptable . Furthermore , the taxpayer must normally have an understanding of what information is of relevance to the examination of a claim in order to avoid the risk of incorrect information being considered to have been given and a surcharge imposed . In other words , the taxpayer is required to have a certain knowledge of the tax rules \u201d .", "ORG concluded that the applicant had not been punished twice for the same offence as prohibited by LAW no . CARDINAL to the LAW , notably in that :", "\u201c a tax surcharge is a general and standardised sanction the purpose of which is , inter alia , to prevent inaccuracy when complying with the legal obligation to complete a tax return . Provided there is no ground for remission it is always set at CARDINAL of CARDINAL fixed percentages . It is imposed regardless of intent or negligence . If a person intentionally submits incorrect information or fails to file a tax return , an additional sanction may be imposed for tax fraud . The intent , which the prosecutor must prove , is CARDINAL of the essential elements of this offence . The offence leads either to imprisonment or , having regard to the personal circumstances of the accused , some of the other possible punishments . Thus , in comparison with the grounds required for imposing a tax surcharge , in order to convict an accused of tax fraud , another essential requirement must be fulfilled . Accordingly , in the sense of ORG , it is a question of CARDINAL different offences . \u201d", "Recently , ORG ) , which is composed of CARDINAL judges from the CARDINAL highest courts in GPE , scrutinised a Government PERSON proposing amendments to LAW and commented in this connection on the principle of ne bis in idem . The ORG considered , inter alia , in the light of the decision GPE and GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , decision of DATE , ORG CARDINAL-VI , that is was reasonable to assume that the fundamental conditions for tax surcharges and intentional tax offences differed in such a way that no conflict with LAW no .
