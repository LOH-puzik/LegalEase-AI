She was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "From DATE to DATE the applicant \u2019s late husband PERSON exercised the profession of a painter . In DATE he was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia . He died of the disease on DATE .", "On DATE the medical clinic where the applicant was treated gave notice of the disease to ORG ( Bau - Berufsgenossenschaft ) on the ground that PERSON \u2019s disease might have been work - related , which would entail pension benefits .", "On DATE ORG refused to establish that Z. \u2019s leukaemia was work - related for having been caused by his exposure to benzene during his work as a painter . Following enquiries on ORG former working conditions and relying on expert opinion , the Insurance considered that the dosage of benzene PERSON had been exposed to during his work had not been sufficiently high to cause a work - related disease .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an administrative appeal . She notably relied on CARDINAL expert opinions commissioned by PERSON \u2019s health insurance . On DATE ORG , having heard further expert opinion , rejected the applicant \u2019s administrative appeal .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a motion with ORG ( ORG ) , alleging that ORG \u2019s disease had been caused by over - exposure to benzene , notably during DATE of his professional life .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE a court appointed expert submitted his expert opinion . He considered that there was no conclusive evidence that the applicant \u2019s illness had been caused by exposure to benzene at his work - place .", "On DATE the ORG summoned PERSON \u2019s health insurance to join the proceedings as a third party .", "By judgment of DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s claim . Relying mainly on the expert opinions commissioned by ORG , ORG considered that it had been established with a sufficient amount of probability that PERSON \u2019s disease had been caused by his exposure to benzene at his workplace .", "This judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the defendant ORG lodged an appeal with the ORG ( ORG ) . In support of her allegation that PERSON \u2019s disease had not been caused by exposure to benzene the defendant submitted a further expert opinion .", "On request by ORG CARDINAL further expert submitted his expert opinion on DATE .", "Subsequently , the applicant asked for a fresh expert opinion to be prepared pursuant to section CARDINAL of FAC ( see relevant domestic law , below ) , and named Prof PERSON as an expert .", "On DATE Prof PERSON declined the request as he did not consider it possible to establish whether the disease had been caused by exposure to benzene .", "Following this , the applicant named another medical expert who submitted his expert opinion on DATE .", "In reply , the defendant party submitted a further opinion submitted by another expert on DATE .", "During the hearing held before ORG on CARDINAL DATE the applicant submitted a presentation held by the expert PERSON on a conference relating to the assessment of exposure to benzene at painter \u2019s workplaces . According to the applicant , this presentation established that PERSON had been exposed to dosages of benzene which exceeded the limits set down in the relevant safety guidelines . She requested ORG once again to hear the experts with regard to these submissions .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment , rejected the applicant \u2019s claim and refused to grant the applicant leave to appeal . Having regard to the expert opinions and statements submitted during the administrative and court proceedings , ORG considered that it could not be established with sufficient probability that PERSON \u2019s disease had been caused by overexposure to toxic substances at his workplace .", "By way of conclusion , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c Summing up , the ORG considers that the facts of the case have been sufficiently established by the medical expertises and opinions by PERSON , Prof GPE . , Prof T , and , in particular , by the expert Prof PERSON The differing assessment of the causation issue submitted by Prof PERSON , Prof We . and the expert Prof No . - who had been heard according to section CARDINAL of ORG Acts - has been reliably rebutted . The plaintiff \u2019s submissions do not induce the court to undertake further examinations . It was , in particular , not necessary to comply with the plaintiff \u2019s request to hear the experts with regard to the presentation submitted during the oral hearing . Even assuming that the dosage of benzene PERSON had been exposed to had exceeded the limits of the relevant safety guidelines , this does not prove that the disease had been work - related , as the safety guidelines are based on what is technically feasible and do not prove that an excess of the safety limits causes health damages . \u201d", "This judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundessozialgericht ) rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint against the refusal to grant her leave to appeal . That court considered that the applicant had failed sufficiently to establish which considerations should have induced ORG to raise further evidence , as requested by the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint .", "On DATE ORG ( file - no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint as being inadmissible .

The hearing in respect of this expert opinion may be made dependant on whether the applicant advances the costs and , unless the court decides otherwise , the applicant in the end bears the costs .", "( CARDINAL ) The court may reject an application where its admission would delay the settlement of the legal dispute and the court is convinced that the application was submitted in attempt to delay proceedings or the application was not submitted earlier due to gross negligence . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
