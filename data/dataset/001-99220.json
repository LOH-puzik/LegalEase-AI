The second applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The third applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The fourth applicant , ORG , was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The fifth to ninth applicants are the heirs of PERSON : PERSON ( born in DATE and living in NORP ) , PERSON ( born in DATE and living in GPE ) , PERSON ( born in DATE and living in GPE ) , PERSON ( born in DATE and living in NORP ) and PERSON ( born in DATE and living in GPE ) . All the applicants are GPE nationals . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "The applicants are joint owners of CARDINAL adjacent plots of land in GPE , registered under files nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LOC land register . In an area zoning plan , the PERSON municipality designated these plots of land as non - building land .", "On DATE the applicants in application no . CARDINAL ( that is , the first , second , third and fourth applicants in the present case and ORG , who died after the termination of the proceedings at issue in that application ) requested ORG to pay them compensation for damage allegedly incurred as a result of the designation of their land as non - building land .", "On DATE ORG dismissed that request .", "On DATE ORG , sitting in camera , dismissed the applicants ' appeal against the ORG 's decision . In these proceedings the NORP municipality , as the respondent party , had filed reasoned submissions on DATE requesting ORG to dismiss the applicants ' appeal , inter alia because the applicants ' property had not been opened up for development purposes . These comments were not served on the applicants .", "In its decision , ORG included a detailed summary of the comments submitted by the PERSON municipality . It noted that the conditions for compensation had not been met , inter alia because , contrary to the applicants ' submissions , the applicants ' property had not been opened up for development purposes . When the zoning plan was issued , the applicants could not have legitimately expected their property to be designated as building land . As to the applicants ' request that the parties be heard on that issue , ORG considered that the applicants had filed very detailed written submissions and had therefore been given sufficient opportunity to submit their arguments and evidence .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' complaint ( file no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It found , in particular , that the failure to afford the applicants an opportunity to comment on the PERSON municipality 's submissions before ORG had not breached their right to a fair trial . Even though the said submissions had contained some new information , the applicants had not suffered any prejudice as the new information had not had any bearing on ORG decision .", "On DATE the applicants in application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL lodged their application with the ORG .", "In its judgment of DATE in the case of ORG and Others v. GPE the ORG found that there had been a violation of LAW in that the principle of equality of arms had been disregarded . The ORG found as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the present case , the Schellenberg municipality , being the opposing party in the compensation proceedings at issue , filed comments on the applicants ' appeal to ORG , requesting it to dismiss that appeal . It is not contested that these comments were not served on the applicants and that they had no opportunity to reply to them . This deficiency it not remedied by the fact that the applicants could complain to ORG , as the latter does not carry out a full review of the case .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is not convinced by the ORG 's argument that , in contrast to the PERSON case ( cited above ) , ORG did not rely on these comments . It is true that that ORG did not rely on the municipality 's assertion that the applicants ' father had not filed an objection against the area zoning plan . However , it did have regard to its submissions on the question of whether the applicants ' land was opened up for building . In any case , the municipality 's observations contained a reasoned opinion on the merits of the applicants ' appeal . The ORG has repeatedly held that in such a situation the effect which the observations actually had on the judgment is of little consequence . What is particularly at stake here is the litigants ' confidence in the workings of justice , which is based on , inter alia , the knowledge that they have had the opportunity to express their views on every document in the file ( ORG , cited above , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL ; PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , respect for the right to a fair trial , guaranteed by LAW , required that the applicants be given an opportunity to have knowledge of and to comment on the observations submitted by the opposing party , namely the NORP municipality . However , the applicants were not afforded this possibility . \u201d", "As regards the application of LAW , the ORG noted the applicants ' argument that they had suffered pecuniary damage as their land would be worth more had it been designated as building land , which , in the applicants ' contention , would have been the case had the violations of the ORG not occurred . It found , however , that there was no causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage claimed and that it was not called upon to speculate what the outcome of the proceedings would have been if they had been in conformity with the requirements of LAW . Therefore , it made no award in respect of pecuniary damage .", "As to the applicants ' request that the ORG order a reopening of the domestic proceedings , the ORG reiterated that it was primarily for the ORG concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under LAW , provided that such means were compatible with the conclusions set out in the ORG 's judgment . This discretion as to the manner of execution of a judgment reflected the freedom of choice attaching to the primary obligation of GPE under the LAW to secure the rights and freedoms guaranteed ( the ORG referred to ORG v. GPE , no . MONEY , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-II ) . Only in very exceptional circumstances had the ORG ordered individual measures of redress ( ibid , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The ORG considered that no such circumstances pertained in the case before it .", "The ORG 's judgment in application no . CARDINAL having become final on DATE , the applicants in that application lodged a request with ORG on DATE to reopen the compensation proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' request .", "ORG found that the applicants had not substantiated that the conditions for reopening the proceedings under LAW ( Landesverwaltungspflegegesetz ; see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law and practice \u201d below ) had been met . It further decided not to reopen the proceedings ex officio under LAW CARDINAL of GPE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law and practice \u201d below ) . ORG referred to the findings of ORG in its decision of CARDINAL DATE . It noted that the latter had considered that the submissions by the municipality of PERSON had contained new facts which had not , however , had any bearing on the reasoning of ORG dismissing the applicants ' appeal in its decision of DATE .", "ORG considered that the ORG 's finding of a violation of the ORG was not a reason to reopen the proceedings under GPE law . LAW did not contain an obligation to reopen proceedings . Accordingly , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG had rejected the applicants ' request to order a reopening of the proceedings before the domestic courts . There were no new aspects which ORG had been unable to take into consideration in its first judgment .", "On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint with ORG against ORG decision . They claimed , inter alia , that the refusal to reopen the proceedings had violated their right to a fair trial . In particular , ORG reference to ORG finding , in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , that the comments made by the municipality of PERSON had been irrelevant to the reasoning of ORG first decision had been arbitrary .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' constitutional complaint ( file no . PERSON ) .", "ORG took note of the ORG 's finding that LAW had been breached in the proceedings before ORG . However , under the provisions of the LAW that finding did not mean that the final judgment of the GPE court had to be quashed , as the Contracting Parties to the Convention were not obliged to accord such an effect to the ORG 's judgments .", "ORG considered not to be arbitrary , but in fact convincing , ORG finding that GPE law ( in particular section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Act on Administrative Procedures read in conjunction with LAW , LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and section CARDINAL of GPE ; see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law and practice \u201d below ) did not provide for a reopening of the proceedings in respect of a decision taken by ORG itself or by ORG following a finding by this ORG that that decision had violated the LAW . Such a finding had to be classified as a new legal assessment , but not as a new fact or new evidence which would alone justify a reopening under the applicable legal provisions .", "ORG further noted that the ORG , in its judgment of DATE , had found that there was no causal connection between the violation of LAW found and the pecuniary damage claimed by the applicants . The ORG further awarded the applicants costs under LAW without examining and irrespective of the question whether restitution , including a reopening of the proceedings , could be granted under GPE law .", "ORG considered that , in the present case , the ORG 's finding of a violation of LAW was sufficient restitution . The Contracting Parties to the LAW were not obliged to provide for a reopening of proceedings which had been terminated by a final decision in cases in which the ORG had found that a procedural right under LAW had been disregarded . It conceded that this finding was unsatisfactory in cases in which a reopening of the proceedings was necessary in order to grant redress . It noted that in several other Contracting Parties to the LAW , such as GPE , GPE and GPE , the law permitted the reopening of proceedings following the finding of a violation by the ORG under certain circumstances . However , it was for the legislator , not the courts , to provide for a reopening of the proceedings .", "ORG further left open whether respect for the right to equality could warrant a reopening of proceedings if otherwise the result would be blatantly unjust . In any event , a blatant injustice had not occurred in the present case . Not only had the ORG found that there was no causal link between the violation of the ORG found and the damage claimed by the applicants , the applicants had also been awarded the costs incurred in the proceedings because of the breach of LAW .", "ORG expressly accepted the ORG 's judgment , according to which a breach of LAW had occurred . It agreed , however , with ORG , which had found that its decision , in respect of which the applicants requested a reopening of the proceedings , was not based on that breach . Therefore , the ORG 's finding of a violation of the ORG was sufficient and further measures of restitution were not necessary .", "The decision was served on the applicants ' counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the applicants , in addition to their application lodged with ORG , also requested ORG to reopen the proceedings which it had terminated by its decision of CARDINAL DATE , to quash the decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE and to order that court to take a new decision in fresh proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' request for the proceedings before it to be reopened under LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law and practice \u201d below ) . Referring to the reasons given in its decision taken on DATE in complaint no . PERSON , it found that it was sufficient for it to confirm that the failure to serve the comments of the NORP municipality of CARDINAL DATE on the applicants had breached their rights under LAW ( file no . ORG ) .", "The decision was served on the applicants ' counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE that is , at a time when the reopening proceedings were still pending before ORG , in its PERSON session , concluded its examination of the execution of the ORG 's judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of ORG and Others v.

ORG has already taken account of the possible effect of the violation on the proceedings , holding that the applicants had not suffered any prejudice ( see below ) .", "... General measures", "Stating that the principle of equality of arms is a basic element of fairness of proceedings , the ORG agreed with the applicants ' argument that they should have been afforded an opportunity to be informed of and to comment upon the municipality 's observations . It did note , however , that while the submission contained new information , it had played no role in ORG decision and therefore no prejudice had occurred . Thus ORG concluded that the applicants ' procedural rights had not been interfered with .", "Citing its case - law , ORG held that the actual effect of the observations on the judgment was of little consequence , as it was above all the litigants ' confidence in the work of justice which was at stake . This confidence is based inter alia on the knowledge that they could have the opportunity to express their views on every document in the file ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The judgment of ORG was disseminated in DATE to all authorities concerned , particularly to the domestic courts and published in the Liechtensteinische Juristenzeitung ( ORG ) in DATE ... \u201d", "Pursuant to section LAW ) a party 's request to reopen proceedings which were terminated by a decision on the party 's rights has to be decided upon by applying , mutatis mutandis , the relevant provisions of LAW on the grounds for granting such a request and on the procedure to be followed in the fresh proceedings .", "Under LAW proceedings which were terminated by a judgment can be reopened on a party 's request , in particular , if the party becomes aware of new facts or discovers or is put in a position to use new evidence , the submission and use of which would have brought about a decision more favourable to that party in the previous proceedings ( no .
