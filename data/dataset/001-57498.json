Mr. PERSON , an NORP citizen born in DATE , had left GPE ( GPE ) in DATE to take up residence in ORG ( in the province of GPE ) . He was arrested on DATE , placed in detention on remand in GPE and then charged with conspiracy and being an accomplice to the abduction on DATE of a businessman ; the latter had been freed by his kidnappers on DATE after payment of a substantial ransom .", "The applicant was acquitted on DATE by ORG ( ORG ) for lack of sufficient evidence , but convicted on DATE by ORG which sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and a fine .", "The criminal proceedings in question are not in issue , at least not in direct issue , in the present case .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( first paragraph , item CARDINAL ) of the NORP Code of Criminal Procedure , the applicant \u2019s detention on remand \u2013 during which he married his fianc\u00e9e by whom he shortly afterwards had a son - could not continue for DATE ; it thus had to terminate on CARDINAL DATE at the latest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON was removed from GPE gaol and taken under police escort to the island of Asinara , which lies off GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( questore ) had in fact sent to ORG prosecutor ( procuratore della PERSON ) a report recommending that Mr. PERSON be subjected to the measure of \" special supervision \" provided for in LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ( \" LAW \" - see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) and section CARDINAL of Act no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( \" the DATE LAW paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The report referred to indications that although the applicant claimed to be working in the building trade , he was actually engaged in illegal activities and belonged to a band ( cosca ) of mafiosi ; it listed CARDINAL convictions pronounced against him in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and described him as \" CARDINAL of the most dangerous \" of individuals .", "Following an application made in accordance with this recommendation by the ORG prosecutor on DATE , ORG ( CARDINALnd ORG ) directed on DATE that Mr. PERSON be placed under special supervision for DATE , the measure to be combined with the obligation to reside \" in the district ( comune ) of the island of Asinara \" , a locality that had been designated by ORG . In its decision the ORG further directed that the applicant should :", "- start looking for work within DATE , establish his residence in the prescribed locality , inform the supervisory authorities immediately of his address and not leave the place fixed without first notifying them ;", "- report to the supervisory authorities twice a day and whenever called upon to do so ;", "- lead an honest and law - abiding life and not give cause for suspicion ;", "- not associate with persons convicted of criminal offences and subjected to preventive or security measures ;", "- not return to his residence TIME and not go out before TIME , except in case of necessity and after having given notice in due time to supervisory authorities ;", "- not keep or carry any arms ;", "- not frequent bars or TIME - clubs and not take part in public meetings ;", "- inform the supervisory authorities in advance of the telephone number and name of the person telephoned or telephoning each time he wished to make or receive a long - distance call .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON appealed to ORG ; his appeal had no suspensive effect ( section CARDINAL paragraph , of LAW ) and so did not prevent the contested decision from being put into effect .", "In a memorial of DATE , his lawyer , Mr. PERSON , challenged the decision on a number of grounds , alleging that it was invalid and unjustified . He submitted , in particular , that on Asinara his client could neither find employment nor live together with his wife and child ; there was thus an inconsistency between the reasoning and the operative provisions of the decision of DATE . In addition , the decision referred to a non - existent district since in point of fact the island was no more than a sub - division of the district of GPE ( GPE ) . Mr. PERSON requested ORG , in the first place , to quash the decision in its entirety ; in the alternative , to limit it to special supervision without an order for compulsory residence ; in the further alternative , to designate a district in LOC where the applicant might find work , live with his family , meet with his lawyer in order to prepare his defence in the criminal proceedings and attend , as and when necessary , an urological clinic to receive the treatment required by his state of health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) , by way of a preliminary ruling on submissions to the same effect by the public prosecutor , ordered that Mr. PERSON be transferred to the urological clinic of PERSON hospital ( GPE ) ; it also instructed its registry to seek information from the carabinieri in PERSON on the possibility of finding accommodation for CARDINAL people and work on the island of Asinara .", "However , on DATE the prosecuting authorities requested ORG to revoke or suspend the aforesaid order . They pointed out that during his detention on remand Mr. PERSON had refused to submit to analyses in ORG urological clinic ; that experts considered that he was probably not suffering from any serious illness ; that his covert intention was to use hospitalisation as a means of escape ; that section CARDINAL of LAW did not prohibit an order for compulsory residence in a given locality within a district ; that ORG had so held in CARDINAL judgments , CARDINAL of which concerned precisely the island of Asinara , which was , besides , \" potentially \" CARDINAL of the best places in GPE for tourism .", "ORG consequently suspended its order on DATE and directed that further hearings on the matter be held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The officer commanding the criminal investigation department of ORG wrote , also on DATE , to the ORG of appeal with the following information which had been supplied by the PERSON carabinieri :", "- for those subjected to compulsory residence on Asinara , there were CARDINAL flats suitable for accommodating a family ; they were occupied by the families in turn for periods of DATE ;", "- the island offered no possibility of permanent employment ; there was just CARDINAL firm which employed CARDINAL residents in turn for short spaces of time ;", "- the police stationed on Asinara were in a position to effect the requisite supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , Mr. PERSON filed memorials with ORG challenging the \" fanciful \" statements of the prosecuting authorities and requesting that further enquiries be undertaken in the shape of an investigation on the spot ( sopral - luogo ) . In his view , his client was physically and mentally a prisoner ( carcerato ) on Asinara ; he was vegetating there in conditions worse than those of his detention on remand . The applicant himself , in a letter of DATE , described the island as a \" veritable concentration camp \" .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( CARDINALst Chamber ) dismissed the appeal and confirmed the decision of DATE . As regards Mr. PERSON \u2019s health and the absence of violation of section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG relied in substance on the arguments that had already been invoked by the prosecuting authorities on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above , second sub - paragraph ) . It found no good reason for regarding Asinara as an unsuitable locality for compulsory residence . It emphasised that the contested measure was designed to separate the individual from his milieu and render his contacts with it more difficult . This requirement took precedence over other problems , such as the absence of regular employment and of adequate accommodation for a family ; moreover , at the time of his marriage the applicant could not have hoped to live with his wife and son since he was then in detention on remand and under a serious charge . His criminal record , the most disquieting criminal activities in which he engaged under the cloak of honesty , his violent character and his exceptional cunning showed that he presented a marked danger to society ( spiccata pericolosit\u00e0 sociale ) . Supervision of such an individual was sufficiently important to justify the curtailment of other individual legal interests taken into account by the law ( l\u2019affievolimento di alter situazioni giuridiche soggettive che la legge prende in considerazione ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON appealed to ORG . In a supplementary memorial of DATE , his lawyer put forward CARDINAL grounds of appeal pursuant to Articles CARDINAL par . CARDINAL and CARDINAL par . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW :", "( i ) It was not permissible under LAW to make an order for a person \u2019s compulsory residence - which amounted to subjecting him to a \" judicial sanction \" limiting his private and family liberty ( libert\u00e0 privata e famigliare ) - on any scrap of land ( qualunque pezzo di terra ) , such as Asinara , regardless of its area ( quali che siano i CARDINAL quadrati entro cui si deve osservare il soggiorno ) , rather than on the whole of the territory of a district . The contrary interpretation adopted by ORG was \" restrictive and aberrant \" and disregarded a man \u2019s right to private and family life ( alla vita privata e famigliare ) which was guaranteed by LAW and LAW . If ORG were nevertheless inclined to follow that interpretation , it should refer the matter to ORG .", "( ii ) ORG statement that Mr. PERSON did not need any particular medical treatment was a misrepresentation of the facts ( travisamento dei fatti ) .", "The law did not permit any curtailment of legal interests which it protected , conferred and made mandatory ( non consent[iva ] veruno affievolimento di situazioni giuridiche tutelate , volute e pretese proprio dalla legge ) . It followed that ORG had applied the law incorrectly ( errata applicazione della legge ) when it held that the necessity for special supervision justified such curtailment .", "( iii ) Finally , the reasoning was contradictory ( contraddittoriet\u00e0 ) in various respects . Thus , ORG had - without an investigation on the spot - deemed Asinara to be suitable for the execution of the measure complained of although the applicant would not there be able to comply with the directives contained in ORG decision .", "Mr. PERSON therefore requested ORG to quash the judgment of CARDINAL DATE after transmitting the file to ORG for the purpose of obtaining a ruling that section CARDINAL of LAW , as interpreted by ORG , was incompatible with LAW , fourth paragraph , and LAW paragraphs , of the LAW .", "LAW concerns \" personal liberty \" : the fourth paragraph provides that \" the infliction of any physical or mental violence on persons subjected to any form of restriction on their liberty shall be a punishable offence \" . The second paragraph of LAW the presumption of innocence ; the third paragraph stipulates that \" punishment may not take the form of treatment repugnant to feelings of humanity and must be aimed at re - education of the convicted person \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE . It accepted the submissions of the public prosecutor attached to ORG and dismissed the appeal as being devoid of foundation .", "As regards the first ground of appeal , ORG pointed out that its settled case - law established that under certain conditions , which were satisfied in the present case , an order for compulsory residence could refer to a given locality within a district . Likewise , the \" curtailment \" of , and the \" undoubted limitations \" on , \" various rights of the individual concerned \" stemmed directly from the application of measures which had on numerous occasions been recognised to be in conformity with the LAW , for example in a judgment delivered by ORG on DATE .", "As regards the second ground , ORG held that in the particular circumstances ORG had been right in turning down the argument concerning Mr. PERSON \u2019s state of health .", "As regards the third ground , ORG perceived no contradiction since the intended object was to remove the applicant from GPE and to separate him from the members of the mafia who carried on their activities there without hindrance .", "The ORG also declared the question of constitutionality raised by the applicant to be manifestly ill - founded . There again , the public prosecutor had cited the above - mentioned judgment of DATE ; he had in addition referred to the administrative nature of the decision designating the locality ( natura amministrativa della determinazione del luogo ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON made CARDINAL applications to ORG .", "The first application was addressed to the President of ORG in his capacity of judge supervising the execution of sentences ( giudice di sorveglianza ) . It requested him to cancel ( abolire ) the compulsory residence order , maintaining that if the President , or someone designated by him for the purpose , were to visit Asinara , he would be left in no doubt that the obligation to live there was contrary to the law , the legislation , justice and individual human rights .", "The second application invited ORG to substitute for Asinara a district where Mr. PERSON could work , not come into contact with suspects ( indiziati ) and live with his wife and son who had been obliged to leave the island since their permit to reside there had expired .", "The lawyer referred to an Order of DATE concerning an appeal by CARDINAL PERSON ; ORG had stated therein that it was for the judge supervising the execution of sentence to make an appraisal of living conditions on Asinara .", "The CARDINALnd ORG gave its decision on DATE . First of all , it affirmed that the implementation of preventive measures was a matter within the competence of the police authorities ( pubblica sicurezza ) and not of the judge supervising the execution of sentences . It added that exigencies of the protection of society justified the special form of isolation undergone by those sent to Asinara , namely individuals who were extremely dangerous . However , those exigencies necessitated neither separating those concerned from their families nor depriving them of regular employment . Accordingly , ORG , whilst rejecting both applications , directed that the text of its decision be communicated to the Minister of the ORG and to the ORG questore .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the GPE questore requested ORG to order Mr. PERSON \u2019s transfer to the district of ORG , in the province of ORG , on the NORP mainland . The reason advanced was that the simultaneous presence on Asinara of the applicant and of his co - accused ( coimputato ) , PERSON , who was also in the process of \" serving \" ( scontare ) a compulsory residence measure , might have unfortunate repercussions on the ensuing stages of the criminal proceedings and , above all , on security on the island .", "ORG ( vacation ORG ) gave a decision to that effect , and for the same reasons , on DATE ; it specified that the remainder of its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was to continue in force .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON had to remain at ORG until DATE , on which date the DATE period fixed by the last - mentioned decision expired .", "CARDINAL . Asinara lies off the north - west tip of GPE . The island , which is long and narrow with a rugged terrain , measures QUANTITY . at its greatest length . Whilst the island as a whole covers QUANTITY km . , the area reserved for persons in compulsory residence represented a fraction of not CARDINAL sq . km . This area was bordered by the sea , roads and a cemetery ; there was no fence to mark out the perimeter . CARDINAL of the island was occupied by a prison .", "CARDINAL . ORG , the island forms an integral part of the district of GPE , a small NORP coastal town TIME away by boat . The southernmost point of the island can also be reached in TIME if one embarks at Stintino , to the north of GPE . Sea communications are interrupted during very bad weather .", "CARDINAL . The principal settlement on the island , GPE d\u2019Oliva , houses nearly all of the island \u2019s permanent population - CARDINAL people ; this population comprises the prison staff and their families , schoolteachers , a priest , the post office employees and a few tradesmen .", "The persons in compulsory residence were lodged in the hamlet of ORG which consists mainly of a former medical establishment and certain other buildings including a school , a chapel and a carabinieri station where the applicant had to report twice DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG maintained before the ORG that one could circulate at will within ORG . According to Mr. PERSON on the other hand , an instruction issued by the officer in charge of the carabinieri restricted movement for persons in compulsory residence to a radius of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . Persons in compulsory residence had no access to the prison zone or to ORG d\u2019Oliva . The inhabitants of the latter village could , in contrast , visit ORG whenever they pleased , whereas outsiders - such as tourists - were in principle not allowed to go there .", "CARDINAL . Persons in compulsory residence could apply for authorisation to visit GPE or the NORP mainland if they had good reasons , such as medical treatment , family grounds or compliance with an order of the judicial authorities .", "The Government stated that authorisation was \" normally \" given on production of the appropriate documents of following a brief police enquiry , but according to the applicant it was very difficult to obtain . Even in the case of urgent medical treatment , so he contended , there was a long delay , sometimes as much as DATE . In any event , such trips were made under the strict supervision of the carabinieri .", "CARDINAL . There existed the additional possibility of going in turn to PERSON to buy provisions , likewise after authorisation and under supervision . The frequency of the crossings as well as the number of participants were the subject of dispute . The Government spoke of CARDINAL persons per week , whereas for Mr. PERSON it was just one ; he claimed that he had had to wait DATE before receiving the necessary permission .", "CARDINAL . Most of the persons in compulsory residence were housed in CARDINAL buildings belonging to the former medical establishment ; these buildings were fairly large and consisted principally , so it seems , of bedrooms with CARDINAL beds .", "A third building , a small construction known as the \" LOC \" , was allocated to \" residents \" ( soggiornanti ) who were accompanied by their families . The \" LOC \" contained CARDINAL flats each comprising a bedroom and a kitchen .", "The applicant lived in CARDINAL of the main buildings or in the \" LOC \" , depending upon whether he was alone or with his family . He could not go out TIME , except in case of necessity and after having notified the authorities in due time ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . These various buildings were somewhat dilapidated . According to Mr. PERSON , their state of disrepair was such as to render them almost uninhabitable . For the Government , on the contrary , the condition of the buildings was \" acceptable \" up to the time when some of their occupants committed acts of vandalism , an occurrence not denied by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The medical service at ORG was provided by the prison doctor . He lived at GPE d\u2019Oliva but could be reached by telephone and be on hand within the space of TIME .", "Before the Commission , the Government submitted that there was a dispensary at ORG , with a male nurse in attendance ; the applicant disputed the presence of any nurse .", "When persons in compulsory residence needed to be hospitalised or to consult a specialist , they were sent to the ORG hospital and university clinics in GPE . Such journeys required authorisation from the competent court - ORG in the applicant \u2019s case ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government medical officer for GPE was responsible for supervising health and sanitary conditions at GPE . While the Government considered the level of the conditions to be good , in Mr. PERSON \u2019s view they left much to be desired . In particular , he complained of the lack of any arrangements for removing rubbish ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Persons in compulsory residence could apply to the administrative authority for permission to have their nearest relations join them on the island and stay with them either in the \" LOC \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) or , failing that , in the rather confined bedroom - QUANTITY by QUANTITY - allocated to each of them .", "The Government stressed before the ORG that the shortage of water on Asinara , which had neither a spring nor an aqueduct and was supplied periodically by navy tankers , made is necessary to limit the number of persons authorised to stay there .", "CARDINAL . Initially , the applicant \u2019s wife and son and also , from time to time , his parents - in - law and nephew lived together with him .", "On DATE , the members of his family were ordered to leave the island ; their residence permits had expired on CARDINAL DATE and he had not applied for their renewal . They were , however , able to return at DATE and stayed with him until his departure for ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . There is a chapel at ORG . According to Mr. PERSON , it remained closed except for religious services at DATE and GPE . The ORG submitted in reply that the religious authorities - there was a priest living at GPE d\u2019Oliva \u2013 would willingly have opened the chapel for services at any time had they been asked to do so , but that no one had ever made such a request .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also claimed that a mass was celebrated DATE by the prison chaplain , but on premises situated outside the area in which persons in compulsory residence could move freely ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . For persons in compulsory residence , the prospects of employment were limited to the openings offered by a firm at ORG , GPE - Costruzioni edili , which were somewhat modest CARDINAL persons in DATE and DATE . The Government submitted that Mr. PERSON had shown no interest at all in this possible source of work . PERSON did , however , produce a certificate from GPE showing that he had worked for the company from DATE to DATE and had subsequently made repeated and pressing requests for employment , but without success .", "CARDINAL . Persons in compulsory residence could obtain books and newspapers at ORG , either themselves or through other people who went there . They had the use of CARDINAL television set according to the applicant , several sets according to the Government . The existence of communal canteen and recreation facilities was also the subject of dispute before the Commission .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON had to give to the authorities prior notice of the name and number of the person telephoned or telephoning whenever he wished to make or receive a call ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On the other hand , his correspondence in the form of letters and telegrams was not monitored .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant sent a letter to the GPE pretore in which he confessed that he had not discharged certain of the obligations imposed on him by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , namely seeking employment , looking for a fixed residence and not associating with other \" residents \" and criminal elements . He stated that he had tried in vain to comply with these directives and that the officer in charge of the carabinieri on Asinara had never raised any objection despite section CARDINAL of Act no . CARDINAL of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . No action was taken on his letter .", "CARDINAL . In addition , on DATE all the persons in compulsory residence addressed a collective protest to the PERSON questore . They claimed ( a ) the allocation of a suitable house to each of them ; ( b ) permanent access to ORG by members of their families ; ( c ) work opportunities capable of providing maintenance for them and their families , the subsidy of CARDINAL or CARDINAL ORG paid by ORG not being sufficient for the purpose ; ( d ) the mooring at ORG , instead of PERSON , of the boat used for transporting them ; ( e ) the right to go individually and at least once DATE to PERSON to purchase food supplies ; ( f ) the reopening of the post office at ORG ; ( g ) the improvement of the health and sanitary conditions in the inhabited zones and adjoining areas ; ( h ) on - the - spot medical assistance and the possibility of consulting specialists without delay ; ( i ) more humane treatment from the bodies coming under the authority of the police headquarters ; ( j ) proper upkeep of the LOC ; ( k ) installation of a second telephone .", "The Government asserted that they thereupon took certain steps to satisfy some of these requests , in particular as regards items ( a ) , ( b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) .", "CARDINAL . The situation of the \" residents \" at ORG was also criticised in the press . The administrative authorities investigated possible remedial measures but , in the face of the expense involved and time needed , did not pursue the matter . In consequence , ORG decided in DATE to strike ( depennare ) the island out of the list of places for compulsory residence . By that date Mr. PERSON had been living at ORG for DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; however , CARDINAL of the documents filed show that his application to the Commission was not unconnected with the ORG \u2019s decision . The last individuals in compulsory residence left Asinara on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The treatment complained of by the applicant was based on Act no . CARDINAL of DATE and Act no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . This Act makes provision for a variety of preventive measures which can be taken against \" persons presenting a danger for security and public morality \" ( misure di prevenzione nei confronti delle persone pericolose per la sicurezza e per la pubblica moralit\u00e0 ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the LAW applies to , amongst others , \" idlers \" and \" habitual vagrants who are fit for work \" ( gli oziosi e i vagabondi abituali , validi al lavoro ) , \" anyone who is regularly and notoriously involved in illicit dealings \" ( che sono abitualmente e notoriamente dediti a traffici illeciti ) and individuals who , by reason of their behaviour and style of life ( tenore di vita ) , must be considered as habitually living , even in part , on the proceeds of crime or on the rewards of complicity therein ( con il favoreggiamento ) , or whose outward conduct gives good reason to believe that they have criminal tendencies ( che , per le manifestazioni cui abbiano dato luogo , diano fondato motivo di ritenere che siano proclivi a delinquere ) .", "The Chief of Police may send to such persons a warning ( diffida ) in which he will call on them to mend their ways and notify them that , if not , the measures mentioned in the subsequent sections will be put into effect .", "A report by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) indicates that Mr. PERSON received such a diffida in GPE on DATE that is well before the events prompting his application to the Commission .", "CARDINAL . In the case of individuals who present a danger for public security or morality and are found elsewhere than at their place of residence , the Chief of Police may also send them back to that place and forbid them to return without prior authorisation or until after the expiry of a period not exceeding DATE to the district from which they are being excluded ; non - compliance with such an order will render them liable to a penalty of \" arrest \" ( arresto ) of DATE ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . If an individual presenting a danger to public security or morality has not mended his ways despite the warning , he may , under section CARDINAL , be placed under special police supervision ( sorveglianza speciale della pubblica sicurezza ) ; if need be , this may be combined either with a prohibition on residence in CARDINAL or more given districts or provinces or , in the case of a particularly dangerous person ( particolare pericolosit\u00e0 ) , with an order for compulsory residence in a specified district ( obbligo del soggiorno in un determinato comune ) .", "Only ORG of the chief town of the province has power to order these measures ; it will do so on the basis of a reasoned application by the Chief of Police to its President ( section CARDINAL , first paragraph ) . ORG must give a reasoned decision ( provvedimento ) in chambers within DATE .

That decision may in turn and on the same conditions be the subject of a further appeal to ORG which must give its ruling in chambers within DATE ( section CARDINAL , seventh paragraph ) .", "DATE . When adopting one of the measures listed in section CARDINAL , ORG will specify for how long it is to remain in force - not less than one and not DATE ( section CARDINAL , fourth paragraph ) - and will give directives with which the person in question must comply ( section CARDINAL , first paragraph ) .", "In the case , as here , of an individual who has been placed under special supervision because he is suspected of living on the proceeds of crime , ORG will direct him to look for work within an appropriate time , to establish his residence and advise the police authorities ( autorit\u00e0 di pubblica sicurezza ) thereof and not to leave it ( allontanarsi ) without first informing them ( section CARDINAL , second paragraph ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "In all cases , ORG will order the individual to lead an honest and law - abiding life ; not to give cause for suspicion ; not to associate with persons convicted of criminal offences and subjected to preventive or security measures ; not to return to his residence at TIME after , and not to go out in TIME , a specified time , except in case of necessity and after having given notice in due time to the authorities ; not to keep or carry any arms ; not to frequent bars or TIME - clubs ; not to take part in public meetings , etc .
