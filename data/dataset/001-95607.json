Mr PERSON , the Head of ORG , testified that in DATE PERSON , ORG , and another high - ranking prosecutor , Mr. PERSON . I. , had given instructions that a cargo aeroplane loaded with military equipment be allowed to leave GPE despite suspicions that the shipment violated a ORG - imposed arms embargo . Mr F. had personally explained in private to Mr A.A. that he had intervened at the request of the President of GPE , PERSON , as the latter 's son was co - owner of the company to which the aircraft belonged . Mr PERSON had refused to approve the actions of the prosecutors and had informed the President of GPE and the Minister of the Interior .

Mr ORG , a former Interior Minister , testified that Mr F. had threatened him with bringing criminal proceedings against him .

Mr V.M. , a prosecutor from ORG , stated that he had been the victim of intimidation and threats ordered by Mr F. , ORG . He stated that PERSON had created a climate of fear and submission in the prosecution service . ORG subordinates had become the usual method of management and unconditional submission to ORG was the most valued quality of a subordinate prosecutor or staff member . PERSON and his small circle of trusted individuals ruled the prosecution service . There was a practice of giving unlawful orders orally , with which prosecutors and staff were required to comply . Refusal was punished by arbitrary transfers of prosecutors to other functions and towns and the bringing of criminal charges against members of their families . PERSON cited examples in this respect . PERSON also spoke about specific cases of unlawful termination of criminal proceedings and unlawful intervention by high - ranking prosecutors in private disputes .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , a prosecutor from ORG , testified that she and several of her colleagues had been improperly prevented from working on a case involving a substantial financial interest . She complained to ORG , whereupon she was summoned to furnish explanations before the Deputy Chief Public Prosecutor , PERSON , and CARDINAL other highranking prosecutors , and was told to withdraw her complaint . Having heard her refusal , the Deputy Chief Public Prosecutor said : \u201c A second case of a prosecutor committing suicide may occur \u201d , apparently referring to the suicide , DATE , of a high - ranking prosecutor . After this meeting , disciplinary proceedings were instituted against PERSON and she was deprived of salary bonuses . Following appeals by PERSON , these measures were set aside by the courts .", "CARDINAL . Mr I.I. , an investigator , testified that he had investigated the murder of PERSON , a lawyer from GPE , who had had a close relationship with ORG . In this context , PERSON discovered evidence of criminal acts committed by prosecutors . His efforts to secure evidence and investigate were frustrated , however , apparently as a result of repeated information leaks . Since the only persons who knew about the planned searches and seizures had been the Chief Public Prosecutor and CARDINAL highranking prosecutors from his close circle , the leak must have come from them . ORG personally supervised the course of the investigation despite his close relationship with the victim . Also , PERSON discovered that QUANTITY persons probably implicated in the murder had fled the country with the help of ORG . As \u201c punishment \u201d for his probing into these facts , PERSON was later unlawfully ordered to retire .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard evidence from other prosecutors who also testified about an atmosphere of fear and submission in the prosecution service , unlawful oral orders issued by high - ranking prosecutors and repression against dissenters in the form of deprivation of salary bonuses , transfers and threats .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL other persons who gave evidence to ORG did not share these views .", "CARDINAL . Following heated debates , during which divergent views were expressed by members of the ORG , on DATE it adopted a decision in which it stated , inter alia , that ORG had introduced an authoritarian style and unlawfully \u201c punished \u201d prosecutors by transferring them or depriving them of salary bonuses , and that an atmosphere of fear was paralysing the normal functioning of the prosecution system . On the basis of these and other findings concerning specific violations of the administrative rules , the ORG called on PERSON to resign . ORG adopted the decision by CARDINAL votes to QUANTITY with one abstention . The decision was not legally binding , as at the relevant time the constitutional grounds for termination of ORG appointment were very limited ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . Mr F. refused to resign .", "CARDINAL . In his application to the ORG , dated DATE , PERSON complained under LAW about his detention DATE . He stated that the violations of his rights were the result of a merciless campaign against him orchestrated by ORG and that he had fears for his and his family 's safety .", "CARDINAL . Mr Kolev repeatedly voiced in public and in letters to ORG institutions his fear that he might be eliminated physically .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in the TIME PERSON was shot dead by an unknown assailant in front of his home in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The police were alerted immediately by passers - by . Several police officers and an investigator from ORG arrived at the scene , searched the area for TIME and interviewed passers - by .", "CARDINAL . At the scene the police found and collected bullets and cartridges , a revolver and a hand grenade which had not exploded .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Chief Public Prosecutor , the Interior Ministry Secretary and other high - ranking officials visited the scene the same evening .", "DATE .

On DATE a senior officer of the national anti - terrorist squad , Mr GPE , was shot and killed by an unknown assailant . In statements they made later , the second applicant and other persons stated that his murder was probably connected with PERSON murder , since Mr V.D. had allegedly possessed information about PERSON murderer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr ORG , a former member of ORG who had previously accused ORG of committing crimes , appeared before the investigator as he wished to help with the murder investigation . He had met PERSON many times as both of them had been interested in investigating the crimes allegedly committed by ORG . Their last meeting had been on DATE .", "DATE . Mr ORG passed to the investigator information he had obtained from Mr Kolev , with several supporting documents . In particular , he stated that at their last meeting PERSON had spoken about his findings implicating ORG in the murder of the lawyer PERSON in DATE . PERSON had promised to put PERSON in contact with a fugitive who had been falsely charged with that murder .", "CARDINAL . Mr ORG also stated that PERSON , who had engaged for a certain period in unlawful activities ordered by ORG , had later refused to continue and had started collecting evidence about those activities . Owing to his mental disorder the Chief Public Prosecutor constantly feared plots and considered as his enemy anyone who criticised him or did not execute his orders . Thus , PERSON had been asked to open criminal proceedings on fabricated charges against persons ORG considered his enemies , or even to commit murder . Among those \u201c enemies \u201d had been PERSON , a prosecutor at ORG and a former candidate for the post of ORG , as well as journalists who had revealed that the brother of ORG had been charged in GPE with illegal trading in coins . PERSON had told PERSON that a number of high - ranking prosecutors at ORG and other persons spent their time organising \u201c revenge \u201d against the \u201c enemies \u201d . PERSON had named PERSON , an officer of the national anti - terrorist squad , as one of ORG \u201c confidants \u201d . Mr PERSON had blackmailed a banker , Mr GPE . , and had managed to obtain large amounts of money from him . The banker had finally complained but \u201c in response \u201d had been arrested on fabricated charges and later a bomb had been found in his flat . Mr ORG submitted to the investigator a copy of a written statement made by the banker in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr ORG described in detail several more cases of alleged crimes committed by Mr GPE and ORG , about which he had learned from PERSON . He gave the names of the persons involved .", "CARDINAL . Mr ORG also gave the name of an investigator who had told him that he had been threatened by ORG and who had allegedly witnessed the latter 's fits of insane rage . The investigator had also learned that electronic files from the hard drive of the computer found in the office of PERSON , the lawyer murdered in DATE , had been deleted in the course of the investigation because they had contained information implicating prosecutors .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE affirmed that PERSON had told him that he feared for his life and considered that ORG had instructed PERSON to have him killed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a former trade union leader , Mr P.S. , who had been charged with criminal offences on allegedly fabricated grounds , made public statements and also wrote to the investigation authorities . He stated , inter alia , that he had had numerous conversations with PERSON , the last one having been on DATE of his murder . PERSON had told him about his efforts to collect information incriminating ORG . Mr P.S. suggested that the records of those conversations could be found , as he was convinced that his and PERSON telephones had been tapped .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant , PERSON wife , a prosecutor from ORG , made a public statement addressed to ORG . A copy was also sent to the investigator in the case . She accused PERSON , ORG , of having ordered her husband 's murder , together with Mr GPE and Mr GPE of the national anti - terrorist squad . In her view , ORG was suffering from a mental disorder . Her late husband had refused to engage in unlawful acts ordered by ORG and had revealed the latter 's mental problems publicly , which had triggered a merciless campaign against him . PERSON had been arrested on fabricated charges and several sets of criminal proceedings had been brought in DATE and DATE against him and his family members .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant called on ORG to initiate proceedings for the removal of ORG from office and to entrust the investigation of PERSON murder to independent prosecutors .

On DATE prosecutor PERSON appointed a team of CARDINAL investigators to work on the case . CARDINAL of them were from ORG and the other CARDINAL from ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the experts appointed by the investigator submitted their reports , describing in detail their findings and conclusions . In particular , the shots that had killed PERSON had been fired at very close range , CARDINAL . The bullets found in his body and at the scene had all been fired from the same weapon , a CARDINAL PERSON calibre handgun . Comparison with data kept by the police had not linked the bullets with a weapon previously used to commit another criminal offence . The revolver found next to PERSON body had a different calibre . It could not be linked to information about weapons used in criminal offences . The experts did not find traces of powder on PERSON fingers or hand . The expert who analysed the hand grenade noted that it was of a type used in the army and the police and also considered that it had been placed next to the body . It was further established that the hair taken from the victim 's clothes was Mr Kolev 's hair .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The investigator also questioned a journalist who had known Mr Kolev . The journalist stated that PERSON had shared his fears with him , stating that PERSON , ORG , and CARDINAL senior officers of the national anti - terrorist squad \u2013 Mr GPE and Mr GPE \u2013 wanted to liquidate him .

In DATE the CARDINAL gangs had clashed over a consignment of illegally imported cigarettes and PERSON had tried to use his position to have Mr PERSON moved to another detention facility , allegedly intending to use the opportunity to have him killed . The transfer had been prevented by CARDINAL investigators of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator reported that it had not been possible to identify the perpetrator , and proposed that the proceedings be stayed . He transmitted the file to Mr Ts . I. from ORG since the case was under \u201c special supervision \u201d by that office . The file was then transmitted to ORG , which decided on DATE to stay the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Mr Kolev 's relatives , including the second applicant , appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the decision to stay the proceedings and instructed the prosecuting authorities to take additional measures . That decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . The courts found that the investigation had not taken all the measures that could lead to identifying the perpetrator . In particular , PERSON wife , the second applicant , had not been questioned . Having regard to her statement addressed to ORG , it was important to question her and then carry out further investigative measures to verify her allegations . In addition , the investigator had not attempted to establish whether there might be a link between PERSON murder and persons affected by high - profile cases he had worked on . The courts also noted that contrary to the relevant procedural rules , the case file did not contain information about any efforts on the part of the investigator to continue his inquiry after the proceedings had been stayed and report periodically . The courts also considered that ballistic and other experts should try to establish further details .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instructed the investigator to undertake further investigations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second and third applicants were questioned .

By decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG quashed the order staying the investigation and instructed the prosecuting authorities to undertake further investigations .", "CARDINAL . The courts stated that the applicants were not entitled to refuse to testify , regardless of their fears that the investigation was not independent . Therefore , the applicants should be summoned again and questioned . The applicants ' request for PERSON , ORG , and several highranking prosecutors to be questioned should be considered afterwards .

In so far as the applicants had insisted that the investigation should be handled by ORG , which in their view was more independent , the courts stated that that request was inadmissible . The choice of investigators was at the discretion of the prosecutor supervising the case .

PERSON also noted that Mr Ts . NORP and PERSON , the prosecutors who had participated in planting drugs and arresting PERSON Kolev on fabricated charges in DATE , had been promoted soon thereafter and that the arrest had been effected by officers of the national anti - terrorist squad loyal to ORG .", "CARDINAL .
