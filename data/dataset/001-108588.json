The applicant was born in DATE and lived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant announced , as required by LAW , to ORG his intention to organise a demonstration on DATE on FAC in GPE , in front of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to deal with the application .

It was as such outside ORG jurisdiction as regards the prohibition of , or acquiescence in , a demonstration . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for judicial review , observing in essence that no decision on the merits of the case had ever been adopted by the administrative authorities DATE which excluded such a review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Head of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s further complaint . On DATE the applicant filed an action with ORG , challenging the decisions of both DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of GPE Police dismissed the applicant \u2019s renewed complaint . On DATE the Deputy Head of ORG partly reversed this decision and instructed ORG to substitute the indefinite measure in question with one of definite duration . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s ensuing action , essentially endorsing the police authorities\u2019 earlier reasoning . It pointed out that the proceedings only concerned the police \u2019s decision on non - competence and did not constitute review of the police \u2019s original decision declaring FAC a \u201c security operational zone \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Upon a further complaint , on DATE ORG quashed the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case to ORG . In reaction to the applicant \u2019s petition for review , on DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case to ORG . The latter \u2019s procedure was then interrupted on DATE on account of the applicant \u2019s death . The applicant \u2019s son and heir joined the proceedings as successor on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the subject matter of the litigation pending before ORG was the police \u2019s original decision declaring FAC a \u201c security operational zone \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In another case concerning the same area , on DATE a Mr PERSON challenged the police \u2019s very decision to declare FAC a \u201c security operational zone \u201d . On DATE the Budapest Police Commander rejected his complaint , but this decision was quashed by the ORG Commander on DATE . In the resumed administrative proceedings , on DATE the GPE Commander again rejected the complaint . On DATE the ORG Commander upheld this decision .

On DATE ORG quashed , in judgment no . CARDINAL.K.CARDINAL.CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL . , both the first- and the second - instance administrative decisions and remitted the case to the GPE Commander . The court pointed out that the impugned decisions did not contain any concrete elements establishing the necessity and proportionality of maintaining the \u201c security operational zone \u201d after the prolongation of DATE . Nor did they address the plaintiff \u2019s suggestion that the mere fencing - off of ORG \u2019s immediate vicinity \u2013 rather than the global ban on FAC \u2013 would have been sufficient in the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed first - instance administrative proceedings , on DATE the GPE Commander partly sustained PERSON complaint , noting that , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , the proportionality of the impugned measure had successfully been challenged ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
