SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Corneliu B\u00eersan;David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national born in DATE . The second applicant , PERSON GPE , is an NORP national born in DATE . The third applicant , PERSON , their daughter , was born in DATE . They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The second applicant arrived in GPE and applied for asylum on DATE . The first applicant arrived in GPE and applied for asylum on DATE . The couple met there and moved in with each other on DATE . On DATE their daughter was born .", "On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) rejected their applications and ordered that they be deported to their respective native countries . ORG noted that the first applicant had not submitted any proof of identity . With respect to the first and second applicants\u2019 reasons for seeking asylum , the ORG found that , under the provisions of LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , CARDINAL ) , they were neither to be regarded as refugees or otherwise in need of protection nor entitled to residence permits on humanitarian grounds . As regards the second applicant , who had claimed to risk persecution not only in her native country but also in GPE , ORG considered that her submissions with regard to the latter country were unfounded . In this connection , it noted that her mother is of NORP origin .", "The ORG further held that , as the first and second applicants were not married , their daughter should be considered as having the same nationality as her mother and follow her to GPE . In view of the daughter \u2019s young age and the limited time she had spent in GPE , the move to GPE could not be against her best interests . Moreover , the deportation would not be contrary to the principle of family unity under LAW on the Rights of the LAW , as the first and second applicants could reunite in the country of their choice after deportation .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) rejected the ORG appeal , agreeing with the reasoning given by ORG . It added that the applicants\u2019 deportation would not violate their right to respect for their family life under LAW , as they would be able to unite in either of their native countries . Issues of a formal or practical nature that might arise were to be handled by the responsible authority , in the first place ORG . ORG concluded that the second and third applicants could be deported to both GPE and GPE .", "On DATE ORG reviewed the applicants\u2019 situation under chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL b of LAW , a new temporary provision aimed at extending the right to residence permits for certain groups , including families with children , who had , inter alia , resided in GPE for long periods of time . The applicants submitted that the second applicant was pregnant with a second child and was expected to give birth in DATE . ORG found , however , that they were not entitled to residence permits under the temporary legislation .", "According to the applicants , they were later informed that ORG planned to enforce the deportation orders by sending them to different countries , the first applicant to GPE and the second and third applicants to GPE .", "On DATE , following the ORG \u2019s indication under LAW , ORG decided to stay the enforcement of the applicants\u2019 deportation until further notice .", "On DATE the applicants lodged a new application with ORG , claiming that there were permanent impediments to their deportation and that they should be given residence permits . In substance , they argued that their deportation to different countries involved a violation of LAW Subsequently , the applicants submitted a medical opinion on the daughter \u2019s mental health , given by a certified psychologist and a child psychiatrist on DATE . They noted that the second applicant suffered from depressions and that the overall situation was dominated by stress caused by the family \u2019s insecure future . The daughter showed a serious resignation syndrome , which required qualified , immediate and long - term treatment .", "On DATE the second applicant gave birth to a second daughter . An application for a residence permit for her was submitted to ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the ORG new application , stating that the possible deportation to different countries was not a new circumstance and could not therefore be considered . In regard to the mental health of the third applicant , the eldest daughter , as well as the second applicant \u2019s depression , ORG concluded that they did not constitute medical impediments to the deportation . No appeal lay against this decision .", "The application concerning the youngest daughter has not yet been determined ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
