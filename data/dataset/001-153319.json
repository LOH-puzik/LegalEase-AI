In a letter dated DATE ORG ) warned the first applicant that , if convicted once more , an exclusion order could be issued against her ( Aufenthaltsverbot ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following her latest conviction and threeyear prison sentence , ORG ) issued an unlimited exclusion order against the first applicant , pursuant to sections CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Fremdenpolizeigesetz ) . It stated that after the first applicant \u2019s conviction in DATE , ORG had refrained from issuing an exclusion order against her , because she had already been living in GPE for DATE and held a permanent residence permit . The authorities stated that at that point they did not consider that she posed a serious threat to public order and security within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . However , her most recent conviction did justify the assumption that her further stay in GPE endangered public order and safety . The exclusion order was necessary to protect the economic wellbeing of GPE and to prevent criminal activities , hence it was in accordance with LAW . It further held that even though the exclusion order constituted an interference with her private and family life , because her children and her parents lived in GPE , the public interest in her expulsion outweighed her interest in remaining in the country .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed . During the oral hearing at ORG ( Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat ) on DATE , she provided a letter from a general practitioner , which stated that the separation from the second applicant due to her imprisonment had caused her son severe mental stress , and that it was important for his development to grow up with his mother . She stated that her son visited her frequently in prison , and that they tried their best to keep up their relationship . Furthermore , she pointed out that she also had other close family ties to GPE , with her daughter , her brother and her parents living there . She regretted her criminal convictions and requested that the exclusion order be lifted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It took into consideration the nature and seriousness of the offences the first applicant had committed and the resulting personality profile , reiterating that she had started her criminal activities shortly after her arrival in GPE . Her latest criminal conviction was based on numerous offences against private property , serving her as a source of income . She had therefore demonstrated that she did not respect the property of others , and that she constituted a danger to the public because of her fraudulent activities , which she had committed over a long period of time . Previous convictions for bodily harm and assault on a police officer showed that she did not shy away from attacks on life and limb either . Because she was serving her sentence at the time of the decision , it could not be assumed that the danger emanating from her person had diminished , which was why the unlimited exclusion order was justified .", "CARDINAL . Concerning her private and family life , ORG held that the first applicant was well integrated in GPE , and that many of her family members lived there , in particular her then DATE son . The exclusion order therefore constituted an interference with her rights under LAW . However , due to her criminal record and the serious nature of her offences , the public interest in her expulsion outweighed her personal interest in respect of her private and family life . Furthermore , because of the short distance between GPE and GPE of TIME by train , it would be possible for her family members to visit her frequently . The first applicant came to GPE when she was DATE , speaks the NORP language and could easily reintegrate in her country of origin . Because of the seriousness of her crimes , and because the presence of her family members in GPE could not deter her from repeatedly committing offences , the exclusion order was proportionate to the aim pursued . Because it was not possible to assess when the first applicant would cease to represent a danger , there was no reason to limit the exclusion order . ORG added that the first applicant could apply for the lifting of the exclusion order after an appropriate interval , and in any event DATE after its enforcement , if the circumstances for its issue had changed significantly .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ) relying , inter alia , on LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused to deal with the complaint and referred it to ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected her complaint due to the lack of any important legal question to be answered . It stated that ORG had not deviated from the previous jurisprudence of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged an application for the exclusion order to be lifted pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly granted the first applicant \u2019s appeal and reduced the duration of the exclusion order to DATE , because the relevant legal provisions had changed in the meantime . Pursuant to section CARDINAL ( formerly section DATE ) of LAW as in force at the relevant time , an exclusion order against a citizen of ORG ( ORG ) may not exceed DATE in duration . Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL of that provision , the exclusion order would therefore cease to be in force on DATE , irrespective of whether the first applicant actually left the country .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against this decision . On unspecified dates , ORG and ORG rejected her complaints .", "CARDINAL . The GPE Youth and ORG , in a statement dated DATE , noted that the separation of the applicants due to the first applicant \u2019s imprisonment had already had a traumatizing effect on the second applicant and had strained the relationship between mother and son . Another separation would likely re - traumatize the second applicant and severely jeopardize his psychosocial development , which is why it would be in the best interest of the child to grant his mother a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . A medical report by psychologist ORG dated DATE attested that the second applicant was suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder , emotional disorder and separation anxiety as a result of the separation from his mother when she had to serve her time in prison . He was in need of constant psychological care and had voiced suicidal thoughts after he had learned that his mother would be expelled . Another separation from his mother would traumatise him again and have long - term effects on his mental state .", "CARDINAL . The neurologist PERSON , in a report dated DATE , diagnosed the first applicant as suffering from a pre - suicidal syndrome and stress reaction and stated that any additional stress was to be avoided . Her psychologist E.G. , in a statement of DATE , attested that she suffered from depression , anxiety and claustrophobia . She had also voiced suicidal thoughts .", "CARDINAL .
