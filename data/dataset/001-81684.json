The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant worked as a deputy Head of ORG in PERSON . On DATE an investigation was initiated against him for unlawfully releasing CARDINAL suspects from detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation , finding that the charges had been based solely on the statements of CARDINAL witnesses who had subsequently withdrawn them , declaring that they had made the statements as a result of ill - treatment by the police . Their statements were not supported by other evidence . On DATE the prosecutor informed the applicant of the decision by sending a letter to apartment no . CARDINAL , to where the applicant had recently moved . He sent a copy of his decision to the PERSON head prosecutor \u201c for information and control \u201d . However , the applicant was dismissed from his position .", "CARDINAL . The applicant initiated court proceedings seeking his reinstatement and the payment of salary arrears for the entire period of his involuntary absence from work . On DATE ORG accepted his claim . The court found that the criminal investigation against the applicant had not established his guilt and had been discontinued . It also found that the applicant had not prejudiced the proceedings against the released prisoners , one of whom was later found not to have committed any crime and the other re - arrested . His case is still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was employed as an officer of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was allegedly summoned by his superiors and pressured into arresting Mr ORG , the secretary of GPE . On DATE the applicant arrested PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a video recording of the applicant 's statement in connection with Mr ORG 's arrest was broadcast on television . The applicant stated that the criminal investigation against Mr ORG had been invented for political purposes and that there had been no lawful reason for initiating it ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE the Head of ORG of ORG requested ORG to forward the criminal case file against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor General re - opened the criminal investigation , finding that its discontinuation in DATE had been unlawful because it had not been based on a proper assessment of all the circumstances , that discrepancies in the evidence had not been entirely resolved and that the alleged facts had not been shown to be true . No order was given to open an investigation against the officer who had discontinued the investigation against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was requested to appear as a suspect before a prosecutor at ORG . The relevant letter was sent to apartment no . CARDINAL , where the applicant had not lived since DATE . On DATE a prosecutor reported that it had been impossible to serve the summons on the applicant since nobody had been at home , so it had had to be pinned to the front door . On DATE another summons was issued and on DATE a similar report was drawn up , both in respect of apartment no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor ordered that the applicant be brought before him , by force if necessary . On DATE another report confirmed the absence of the applicant from apartment no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor brought charges against the applicant . No mention was made of his failure to appear before him during the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a warrant for the applicant 's arrest and detention for DATE , finding that he had been absconding from the investigation , was obstructing the establishment of the facts , could re - offend and was a wanted person .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor sent the relevant documents to ORG in order to have the applicant declared a wanted person .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was arrested in the street and was told of the warrant for his arrest issued on DATE . On DATE he was brought before a judge who informed him of the decision of DATE . The applicant appealed , complaining that he had not been notified of the investigation and that it was therefore unjust to accuse him of absconding from it . He argued that he had a permanent residence , a job and a family with CARDINAL children to support . He had no criminal record , and had he intended either to abscond from the investigation or to interfere with it , he could have done so earlier . He also underlined that the criminal investigation against him had been discontinued in DATE . He invoked LAW and asked for his release pending trial , promising not to leave the city .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected his appeal , finding that the lower court had \u201c given proper reasons for the application of the preventive measure and [ had ] not commit[ed ] any procedural violation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution formulated the final charges and on DATE the case was submitted to the trial court .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the trial court set the date for the first preliminary hearing for DATE . On that date the Prosecutor General designated another prosecutor to the case and the hearing was accordingly adjourned to DATE . Since this new prosecutor already had a case scheduled for that date there was another adjournment . On DATE the prosecutor asked for the case to be transferred to another court , a request which was eventually rejected by ORG on an unknown date . A new date for the preliminary hearing was set for DATE but the hearing was adjourned due to the absence of witnesses . According to the applicant , he made habeas corpus requests at each hearing but none was examined because of the adjournments , and no formal decision was ever adopted . The Government have not denied this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a written request for the replacement of detention by a different preventive measure . He complained that the summons had been deliberately sent to the incorrect address and that the examination of his case was being delayed without reason .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected that request , principally because it found that the applicant had absconded from the criminal investigation . The court noted that the applicant had twice been served summonses at \u201c ... apartment no . CARDINAL , where , according to his personal file , he [ is ] registered \u201d but had not appeared before the prosecutor and could not be brought by force as he was not found at the address . The court concluded that the grounds on which the detention on remand had been ordered remained valid as the applicant could abscond or interfere with the investigation . In rejecting the habeas corpus request the court decided that \u201c the measure of detention on remand should be maintained \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made another habeas corpus request , complaining of unnecessary delays in his case . The prosecutor partly agreed and asked the court to release the applicant and to place him under house arrest because no witnesses had been heard by that stage . On DATE , ORG accepted the request and ordered the applicant 's house arrest , prohibiting him from leaving his apartment , talking to prosecution witnesses or using the telephone . Based on the annex to his identity card stating his permanent address as apartment no . CARDINAL , the court ordered the applicant 's house arrest at that address . On DATE the applicant 's house arrest was replaced by an undertaking not to leave the city .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant asked the trial court to annul ORG decision of DATE to re - open the criminal investigation into his case and to discontinue the investigation . He argued that the re - opening had violated both his right not to be prosecuted twice for the same act and the principle of legal certainty , contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and LAW .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG cited Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and found that :", "\u201c ...", "Having examined all the evidence during the hearing , the court considers it necessary to discontinue the case due to the existence of circumstances which prevent the initiation of proceedings and the pursuance of criminal charges , namely the prohibition on repeated charges being brought against the same person for the same offence .", "During the court hearing , it was established that the criminal proceedings in the case of PERSON were initiated on the basis of the criminal proceedings initiation order of CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL(vol I / fd I ) .", "According to the order of the senior investigator at ORG , PERSON , of CARDINAL , the criminal case against PERSON was dropped due to lack of constitutive elements for the offence ( vol II/CARDINAL ) .", "By order of ORG dated CARDINAL , the order of CARDINAL which had discontinued the proceedings was cancelled and the criminal proceedings were resumed . The reason given was the illegality of the order which dismissed the trial , which ran counter to the evidence gathered during the investigation , the [ fact that the ] circumstances allowing such a dismissal did not exist and that the contradictions between the statements of PERSON and those of the witnesses have not been explained and that no procedures had been carried out in order to establish the identity of the persons who had inserted the information in the record registers and statistics cards ( vol II/CARDINAL ) .", "The court finds that the above conclusion is contrary to the evidence in the file .", "In the order of dismissal of the criminal case , dated DATE , the evidence is described in detail and analysed and a conclusion is drawn . In the order of annulment of DATE , however , there is no analysis of the circumstances and the reasons for rejecting the conclusion regarding the lack of constitutive elements of the offence . A simple statement pointing to the illegality of this procedural act can not serve as a legal ground to resume legal proceedings .", "Therefore , the court reaches the conclusion that the order of dismissal of the criminal trial of DATE was determined on the basis of the evidence in the file and issued in accordance with current legislation .", "Therefore , in accordance with Art CARDINAL CPP , the conditions necessary for resuming the criminal proceedings are not met ; [ this situation also gives rise to ] a case of a person being tried twice for the same offence , which excludes the resumption of the criminal investigation and the charging of PERSON .", "...", "In accordance with Art CARDINAL , Code of Penal Procedure , the court decides :", "CESSATION OF PROCEDURE", "The criminal proceedings are discontinued against [ the applicant ] ... owing to the existence of circumstances which exclude the initiation of criminal proceedings and the charging of a person , namely the prohibition on repeatedly charging a person with having committed the same offence . \u201d", "This judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he was detained at the remand centre of ORG in inhuman and degrading conditions . In particular , there was very limited access to daylight and no exercise outside the cell ; poor quality food ; overcrowding ( CARDINAL men in a QUANTITY cell , part of which was taken up by a toilet which was not separated from the rest of the cell ) ; heat and humidity ; irregular artificial ventilation for short periods despite the fact that the other detainees were smoking in the cell , which created breathing problems for the applicant ; a lack of any kind of bedding ; and access to a shower only once a week . He was not allowed to receive any visits from his wife and was placed in a cell with convicted criminals even though he was a former criminal investigator ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He submitted a video recording of an interview with CARDINAL of the persons with whom he had shared the cell . In that recording the person interviewed confirmed the description given above of the conditions of detention . The Government have not commented on this interview .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that his health had seriously deteriorated , that he suffered from headaches while in detention and that the medical treatment given to him was not effective . He was refused a specialist medical examination to determine what was wrong with him and how best to treat him .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the applicant was held in CARDINAL different cells in which each detainee had CARDINAL of space . CARDINAL of the cells in which the applicant was detained ( no . CARDINAL ) measured CARDINAL.CARDINALmCARDINAL and the applicant shared it with CARDINAL others ( including DATE and G.A. ) . There was sufficient ventilation and access to daylight , unlimited access to tap water and the toilet was separated from the rest of the cell by a lateral partition . The food was of adequate quantity and quality and was cooked by staff at a university , as confirmed by the relevant receipts . Moreover , the applicant was allowed to receive bedding from his wife . The applicant 's detention was short and in DATE he was transferred to another remand centre .", "CARDINAL . In order to show the changes in the conditions of detention in GPE prisons , the Government referred to several documents concerning programmes designed to improve the conditions of detention in GPE prisons ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG 's opinion , the applicant was given sufficient medical assistance , as demonstrated by his personal medical file submitted to ORG . All his requests were properly registered and he had been seen by a variety of specialists who recommended treatment , which he had received . In particular , the applicant was subjected to an in - depth ( NMR ) analysis which had not revealed any change in his earlier , satisfactory , state of health . Moreover , the applicant refused to submit the results of his pre - detention medical examinations which meant that there was no medical basis for an additional ORG scan , as confirmed by the prison doctors . The applicant had not been detained along with previously convicted persons , as proved by a letter from the Minister of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The relevant findings of the ORG read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... It appears from the findings of the ORG delegation that in DATE the practice of detaining suspects for prolonged periods \u2013 sometimes DATE in EDPs is still largely followed . Yet the visit has confirmed that EDPs of ORG will never be able to offer suitable detention conditions adapted to the needs of persons remanded in custody for prolonged periods .", "CARDINAL . Conditions of detention .", "a. Institutions of ORG", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , when it first visited GPE , the ORG has had serious concern about the conditions of detention in the institutions of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Whether CARDINAL refers to the police stations or EDPs visited , the material conditions are invariably subject to the same criticism as in the past . Detention cells had no access to daylight or a very limited such access ; artificial light \u2013 with rare exceptions \u2013 was mediocre . Nowhere did persons obliged to spend TIME in detention receive mattresses and blankets , even those detained for prolonged periods . Those who had such items could only have obtained them from their relatives ...", "CARDINAL .
