He represents the second applicant , ORG , and the third applicant , ORG . They were all represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE a privately owned NORP newspaper , GPE , ran an article under the headline \u201c Profound fear of criticism of NORP \u201d ( PERSON angst for kritik af islam ) . It reported on the difficulties encountered by the writer of a children \u2019s book entitled The Koran and the Life of the Prophet PERSON ( PERSON og profeten PERSON liv ) in finding an illustrator for the book .", "On DATE another privately owned NORP newspaper , ORG , published CARDINAL cartoons , most of which were caricatures of PERSON . The most controversial of the cartoons showed PERSON with a bomb in his turban . In the middle of the page carrying the cartoons was an explanatory text by the newspaper \u2019s cultural affairs editor which stated , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c Some NORP reject modern secular society . They demand special status , insisting on special consideration of their own religious feelings . This is incompatible with secular democracy and freedom of expression , where one has to be prepared to put up with scorn , mockery and ridicule . While this is not always agreeable or pleasant to watch , and does not mean that religious feelings can be made fun of at any price , that is a minor consideration in the present context ... we are on a slippery slope , with no one able to predict where self - censorship will lead . That is why PERSON has invited members of ORG to draw PERSON as they see him ... \u201d", "On DATE the ambassadors of CARDINAL NORP - majority countries , referring , inter alia , to the cartoons , asked for a meeting with the NORP Prime Minister to discuss what they perceived as an \u201c ongoing smear campaign in NORP public circles and the media against ORG and NORP \u201d . It appears that the government refused their request in writing , citing the following reasons :", "\u201c Freedom of expression has a wide scope and ORG has no means of influencing the press . However , NORP legislation prohibits acts or expressions of opinion of a blasphemous or discriminatory nature . The offended party may bring court proceedings against the authors of such acts or expressions of opinion , and it is for the courts to decide in individual cases . \u201d", "On DATE several NORP organisations in GPE reported ORG to the NORP police , maintaining that it had violated the provisions of LAW concerning blasphemy and insult on the basis of race or religious orientation .", "By a decision of DATE , the regional public prosecutor for ORG ( Statsadvokaten i Viborg ) decided not to initiate criminal proceedings against the newspaper . The NORP organisations appealed against that decision to ORG ( PERSON ) , who upheld the decision on DATE , giving the following reasons .", "\u201c Decision on possible criminal proceedings in the case of ORG article \u2018 The face of GPE", "...", "CARDINAL . The article in ORG", "The article in ORG was published in the newspaper \u2019s DATE issue of CARDINAL DATE and was advertised on the front page of the newspaper by one of the drawings from the article . The drawing was accompanied by text explaining that the newspaper had invited members of ORG to draw PERSON as they saw him ; that , out of CARDINAL illustrators , CARDINAL had responded to the invitation ; and that the drawings were published under the ORG names . ... The introduction to the article is headed \u2018 ORG ... The introduction to the article reads as follows :", "\u2018 The comedian PERSON recently admitted that he did not dare openly \u201c to take the piss out of the Koran on TV \u201d . An illustrator asked to portray PERSON in a children \u2019s book wishes to do so anonymously , as do the western NORP translators of a collection of essays critical of ORG . A leading art museum has removed a work of art for fear of reactions from NORP . This theatre season , CARDINAL satirical shows targeting the President of GPE , PERSON , are playing , but not a single one about PERSON and his allies . Finally , during a meeting with Prime Minister PERSON of GPE \u2019s ORG , an imam urged the government to use its influence over the NORP media so that they drew a more positive picture of ORG .", "The examples cited above give cause for concern , regardless of whether there is any foundation for people \u2019s fears . The fact is that those fears exist and lead to self - censorship . The public space is being intimidated . Artists , authors , illustrators , translators and theatre people are therefore steering a wide berth around the most important meeting of cultures of our time \u2013 the meeting between ORG and the secular society of the LOC rooted in ORG", "The following section , entitled \u2018 Ridicule\u2019 , is taken from the article :", "\u2018 Some NORP reject modern secular society . They demand special status , insisting on special consideration of their own religious feelings . This is incompatible with secular democracy and freedom of expression , where one has to be prepared to put up with scorn , mockery and ridicule . It is therefore no coincidence that people living in totalitarian societies are sent to jail for telling jokes or for critical portrayals of dictators . As a rule , this is done with reference to the fact that it offends people \u2019s feelings . In GPE , we have not yet reached that stage , but the examples cited above show that we are on a slippery slope , with no one able to predict where self - censorship will lead . ...

In this connection it should be noted that frank and informal debate is not unusual in GPE , where even offensive and insulting expressions of opinion are widely accepted .", "It should also be noted that , when it was adopted in DATE , LAW was intended to afford protection in respect of the most serious offences against religious feelings ; this was also implicit in subsequent debates held in the NORP parliament in DATE and DATE regarding the necessity for the provision . It has also been reflected in practice , as CARDINAL prosecutions have been brought for breaches of this provision since DATE , the most recent of which , in DATE , led to an acquittal .", "An assessment of the drawings described above and the article in the light of the provisions of LAW involves deciding whether they amount to mockery or scorn of ORG \u2019s religious doctrines or acts of worship . ...", "As regards ... \u2018 religious doctrines or acts of worship\u2019 , it should first be noted that the expressions of opinion falling within the scope of LAW cover the internal and external religious life of a religious community , that is , the doctrines ( a creed , if any , and the central texts of the religion ) and the institutions , practices , persons and things ( ritual acts , etc . ) by which the acts of worship of the community take place . However , according to the preparatory legislative material for LAW , the concepts concerned do not encompass religious feelings which are not tied to a community \u2019s religious doctrines or acts of worship , including doctrines of an ethical or social nature or similar .", "The concept of \u2018 CARDINAL covers ridicule and is an expression of lack of respect or derision of the object of mockery . \u2018 Scorn\u2019 is an expression of contempt for the object that is scorned . It must be assumed that these words imply ridicule or contempt with a certain element of abuse , just as it is clear from the preparatory legislative material for the Criminal Code that punishment can be imposed only in \u2018 ORG cases .", "The religious writings of ORG can not be said to contain a general and absolute prohibition on drawing PERSON .", "The basic assumption must be that , according to ORG ( the written narratives of the life of the PERSON and guidelines for the conduct to be observed by NORP ) , there is a prohibition in NORP against depicting human figures , which also includes depicting PERSON . Not all NORP comply consistently with the ban on depiction , as there are pictures of PERSON dating from earlier times as well as the present day . However , in these cases the PERSON is depicted respectfully , in some instances without facial features .", "It can not then be assumed that a drawing of the Prophet PERSON in general will be contrary to the religious doctrines and acts of worship of the religion as practised DATE , even if certain groups within the religion comply fully with the ban on depiction . For that reason alone , a drawing of the Prophet PERSON can not in itself constitute a violation of LAW .", "However , some of the drawings in question which , according to the headline , illustrate \u2018 The face of LOC are not merely a depiction of the Prophet PERSON , but a caricature of him .", "Depending on the circumstances , a caricature of such a central figure in ORG as PERSON may imply ridicule of or be considered an expression of contempt for NORP religious doctrines and acts of worship . An assessment of whether this is the case must be made in the light of the text accompanying the drawings .", "The article states that fear of NORP reaction has led to self - censorship in a number of specific cases and to artists , authors and others avoiding expressing themselves about the cultural meeting between NORP and secular NORP societies with their roots in NORP . The next paragraph states first that some NORP reject modern secular society and demand special status , insisting on special consideration of their own religious feelings . It then continues : \u2018 This is incompatible with secular democracy and freedom of expression , where one has to be prepared to put up with scorn , mockery and ridicule . While this is not always agreeable or pleasant to watch , and does not mean that religious feelings can be made fun of at any price , that is a minor consideration in the present context.\u2019", "From the section that follows , it appears that it was on this basis that ORG invited members of ORG to draw PERSON as they saw him .", "Based on this text , the basic assumption must be that ORG commissioned the drawings for the purpose of sparking a provocative debate as to whether , in a secular society , special regard should be paid to the religious feelings of certain NORP .", "The drawings referred to in paragraph CARDINAL above as drawing CARDINAL , drawing CARDINAL , drawing CARDINAL , drawing CARDINAL , drawing CARDINAL , drawing CARDINAL , drawing CARDINAL and drawing CARDINAL are either neutral in their expression or do not seem to be an expression of derision or spiteful , ridiculing humour . Therefore , in the opinion of ORG , these drawings can not be considered to constitute criminal offences under LAW .", "Drawings CARDINAL and CARDINAL deal with the position of women in NORP society and therefore relate to social conditions in those societies and the lives of their members . On this basis the drawings can not be considered to contain expressions of opinion concerning NORP religious doctrines or acts of worship , and consequently do not amount to punishable offences under LAW .", "The CARDINAL armed figures in drawing CARDINAL could be seen to be an illustration of an element of violence in ORG or among NORP . However , the man standing up , who could be a depiction of PERSON , is denying that there is any reason for anger and speaking in soothing tones , which must be taken to be a rejection of violence . Hence , this drawing can not be considered either as an expression of mockery or scorn of NORP religious doctrines or acts of worship ; see LAW .", "Drawing CARDINAL , showing the face of a grim - looking man with a turban shaped like an ignited bomb , could be understood in several ways .", "If PERSON is taken to be a symbol of ORG , the drawing could be understood to mean that violence or bomb attacks have been committed in the name of ORG . The drawing could therefore be seen as a contribution to the current debate on terror and as an expression of the view that religious fanaticism has led to terrorist acts . Understood in this way , the drawing can not be considered to express contempt for the Prophet PERSON or the NORP religion , but should be considered as an expression of criticism of NORP groups who commit terrorist acts in the name of religion . On this basis , the drawing is clearly not in violation of LAW .", "The drawing could also be taken to depict the Prophet PERSON as a violent person and as a rather intimidating or frightening figure .", "Historical descriptions of the PERSON \u2019s life show that , in propagating their religion , he and his followers were involved in violent conflicts and armed clashes with persons and population groups who did not join ORG , and that many NORP and others lost their lives as a result .", "Even against this historical background , a depiction of the Prophet PERSON as a violent person must be considered an incorrect depiction if the PERSON is shown with a bomb as a weapon , which in DATE \u2019s context might be understood to imply terrorism . This depiction might with good reason be understood as an affront and insult to the PERSON , who represents an ideal for believing NORP .", "However , such a depiction is not an expression of mockery or ridicule , and almost certainly not of scorn within the meaning of LAW . The concept of scorn covers contempt and debasement , which in their usual meaning would not cover situations depicting a figure such as that shown in drawing CARDINAL , regardless of how the illustration might be understood or interpreted .", "...", "CARDINAL . Conclusion", "As is clear from points CARDINAL and CARDINAL ... , ORG does not find any grounds for changing the decision reached by the regional public prosecutor for GPE and therefore concurs in the decision , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG , to discontinue the investigation with regard to LAW ( b ) of LAW .", "Although there are no grounds for instituting criminal proceedings in this case , it should be noted that both provisions of LAW and also other criminal - law provisions , for example with regard to defamation of character \u2013 place restrictions on freedom of expression . LAW protects religious feelings against mockery and scorn and LAW b ) protects groups of persons against scorn and degradation on account of , inter alia , their religion . To the extent that publicly made expressions of opinion fall within the scope of these rules there is , therefore , no free and unrestricted right to express opinions about religious subjects .", "In stating that it is incompatible with the right to freedom of expression to demand special consideration for religious feelings and that one has to be prepared to put up with \u2018 scorn , mockery and ORG , the article in ORG does not therefore accurately describe the law as it stands . \u201d", "Around this time and subsequently , the publication of the cartoons ( and their reproduction in some other countries ) caused international controversy , protests , demonstrations and consumer boycotts , notably in the NORP world .", "Various NORP organisations initiated civil proceedings for defamation against ORG before ORG ( Retten i \u00c5rhus ) which , in a judgment of DATE , found against them ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
