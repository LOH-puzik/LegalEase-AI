NORP legislation on rent control is the result of many historical and recent factors .

That in practice meant that by that date ORG had to enact new , constitutional , legislation dealing with the matter .", "CARDINAL .

According to the information received , levels of controlled rent had never reached the statutory PERCENT of the reconstruction value referred to in section GPE ) but were determined by the municipalities at PERCENT of that figure . As a result , the levels of controlled rent covered merely PERCENT of the maintenance costs of residential dwellings . The rest had to be covered by landlords from their own resources . That did not allow them to put aside any savings for repairs .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment , ORG attached much importance to the fact that the relevant regulations concerning controlled rent had brought about a situation whereby the expenses incurred by owners of dwellings were much higher than the rent paid by tenants and that the former \u201c had no influence on how the rates of controlled rent were determined \u201d . In its view , that shortfall of the rent actually received had resulted in the progressive reduction of the value of tenement houses and this , with the passage of time , entailed consequences similar to expropriation .", "The judgment contains extensive reasoning , the gist of which can be summarised as follows .", "\u201c CARDINAL of the essential elements of the right of property is the possibility of deriving profit from the object of ownership , which is of particular importance in a market economy . The legislature may regulate and limit this right in view of , among other things , the social context of enjoyment of property and duties towards the community that are inherent in ownership . In exceptional cases , ... it is even [ acceptable ] to exclude temporarily the possibility of ... deriving an income from goods that are the subject of ownership . However , if the limitations on a property right go even further and the legislature places an owner in a situation in which his property necessarily inflicts losses on him , while at the same time imposing on him a duty to maintain the property in a specific condition , it can be said that there is a limitation which impairs the very essence of that right . ...", "ORG observes that the applicable provisions very seriously limit the possibility for a landlord to use and dispose of his dwellings , as referred to in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act . In particular , under this section all earlier tenancy relationships , in so far as they originated in administrative decisions on the allocation of a dwelling ... were transformed into contractual leases for an indefinite period . ...", "ORG will not assess the compatibility of those regulations with LAW , as this is not the object of its ruling . It merely observes that , against that background , the owner of a building is practically deprived of any influence on the choice of tenants in his building and on whether the lease relationships with those persons should continue . ...", "Thus , the possibility [ for a landlord ] to enjoy and dispose of property is very considerably limited . While it is not totally extinguished , as he may still sell his building ( dwelling ) or take out a mortgage on it and there are no restrictions on succession rights , the exclusion of the owner \u2019s right to dispose of dwellings subject to the provisions of the DATE Act results in the depreciation of the market value of the building . By the same token , other attributes which have so far not been taken away from the owner , such as the possibility of enjoying and disposing [ of his property ] , are substantially reduced and his property right becomes illusory .", "At the same time , the legal provisions impose on the owner of the building a number of onerous duties ... Not only do most of the applicable laws impose specific duties on the owner but they also provide for specific penalties for failure to comply with those duties or to discharge them properly . ...", "ORG considers that LAW and , especially , its practical application have not secured a sufficient mechanism for balancing the costs of maintaining a building , its equipment and surroundings and the income from controlled rent . ...", "ORG considers it necessary to draw attention to CARDINAL further points which are relevant for the situation of the landlord .", "Firstly , the inadequacy of controlled rent vis - \u00e0 - vis real expenses for maintenance of a building does not allow ... [ landlords ] to put aside savings for repairs and for keeping the building in a good condition . As a result , the tenement houses are gradually losing value . In terms of property rights , this should be perceived as a process of gradual deprivation of this right , leading , with the passage of time , to results similar to expropriation . Also , it has a general impact on the community because many tenement houses are approaching the time of their \u2018 technical ORG and , in consequence , not only will the owner lose his property but tenants will also lose the possibility of housing , which will hardly be compatible with LAW .", "Secondly , the inadequacy of controlled rent vis - \u00e0 - vis real expenses for maintenance of a building has not been duly recognised by the tax laws ... [ Under those laws ] , landlords are treated in the same way as businessmen or persons letting dwellings for a profit and must bear the financial consequences of all losses caused by the lease of their dwellings . ...", "[ As regards the principle of proportionality laid down in LAW ]", "... it may be justified to fix rent in such a way that it will not be disproportionate to the financial standing of tenants , so that it will be possible for them to maintain a decent standard of living ( or at least a minimum standard ) after paying the rent . Thus , it is in conformity with the contemporary perception of a \u2018 social ORG to demand some sacrifice from all members of society for the benefit of those who can not provide subsistence for themselves and their families . By the nature of things , the extent of that sacrifice depends on the level of income and imposes a heavier burden on those who are better off . By the nature of things , the owners of property may be required to make sacrifices , according to the general principle that \u2018 ownership entails ORG . However , the distribution of burdens among specific members of society can not be arbitrary and must maintain rational proportions .", "In the circumstances obtaining in GPE , under LAW it may be justified to maintain the provisions limiting landlords\u2019 property rights and , more particularly , excluding unrestricted freedom in fixing rates of rent and other charges collected from tenants . ... It may still \u2013 in any event in the transitional DATE be justified to impose wider restrictions on property rights , precluding the freedom to derive profit by fixing levels of rent in such a way as to cover only the costs of maintenance and upkeep of the building .", "However , an assessment of the DATE Act leads to the conclusion that the applicable restrictions do not stop there . The present regulations deliberately set the levels of controlled rents below the costs and expenses actually incurred by owners . That , in itself , would not necessarily have had to be considered unconstitutional had there been any parallel legal mechanism compensating for incurred losses . No such mechanisms have been set up . In consequence , the applicable provisions are based on the premise that property must \u2013 until DATE entail losses for the owner and that , at the same time , the owner has a duty to incur expenses to maintain his property in a particular condition .", "That means that LAW placed the main burden of the sacrifices that society had to make for tenants , or at least for tenants in a difficult financial position , on the owners of property . Besides , other remedies \u2013 such as , for instance , subsidising from public funds the costs of maintaining and repairing buildings referred to in section CARDINAL ) , ensuring full recognition in the tax regulations for losses and expenses incurred by landlords and making the level of rent dependent on the tenant \u2019s income \u2013 have not been employed . Instead , the simplest means ( being apparently the cheapest in social terms ) have been applied , namely setting a low maximum level of rent and allowing the municipalities to make exceptions to that level . Consequently , it has been assumed that owners will cover the remaining costs of maintaining their property out of their own pockets . No proportionality whatsoever has been maintained in respect of the distribution of burdens ( sacrifices ) among the owners and the other members of society .", "ORG would stress once again that in the present context there is a constitutionally acknowledged necessity to protect the rights of tenants ... and this may be reflected in , among other things , provisions fixing a maximum level of rent . However , there is no constitutional necessity to afford them such protection mostly at the expense of private individuals \u2013 the owners of dwellings DATE because the duty to help the underprivileged and [ the duties inherent in ] social solidarity are incumbent not only upon those persons . It is possible to adopt other legal solutions so as to secure at the same time the necessary protection to tenants and the minimum financial means needed to cover the requisite costs to the landlords . ... It is not for ORG to indicate concrete solutions and to determine the ratio of costs to be incurred by tenants , landlords and the community as a whole . However , this ORG considers that there are no constitutional considerations which justify imposing the greater part of those costs on the landlords . ...", "Consequently , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) is incompatible with the LAW . A limitation on the right of property ... which is not \u2018 ORG does not satisfy the constitutional requirements of proportionality .", "[ Other considerations ]", "The finding that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) infringes the principle of proportionality makes it unnecessary for ORG to determine whether that provision also infringes the very essence of the right of property since [ a further finding to that effect ] will not affect the merits of the ruling . It should merely be noted in passing that the question whether the \u2018 ORG of the right of property has been preserved must also be assessed ... against the background of the combination of existing limitations on this right . ... The manner in which [ rent control ] has been effected by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) taken together with other provisions regarding privately owned buildings has [ resulted ] in the owners being deprived of even the slightest substance of their property rights .", "It is ORG opinion that , in consequence , the right to derive profit from property , which is an important element of the right of property , has been destroyed and , at the same time , the second element , the right to dispose of CARDINAL \u2019s property , has been stripped of its substance . In consequence , the right of property has become illusory and unable to fulfil its purpose in the legal order based on the principles listed in LAW [ principles of social market economy , economic activity , private ownership , solidarity , dialogue and cooperation ] .", "[ As regards the constitutional aspects of the situation of tenants ]", "A kind of obligation has been placed on the legislature to ensure that up to DATE tenancy relationships concerning municipal dwellings and [ privately owned ] dwellings should retain their present form , including the level of rent [ PERCENT of the reconstruction value of the dwelling ] ...

At present , there is no such necessity ... It should be noted in passing that setting a time - limit for the operation of the rent - control scheme in buildings owned by natural persons also places an obligation on the legislature \u2013 for the benefit of landlords \u2013 to repeal the scheme in its present form by DATE .

It went on to find that section GPE ) perpetuated the state of a violation of property rights that had subsisted under LAW , especially as landlords had not been relieved of any of their previous duties in respect of maintenance of property .", "CARDINAL . The main thrust of ORG reasoning was as follows :", "\u201c During the transition from controlled rent to contractual rent it is necessary to control the increase in rent . ... In most NORP countries legislative bodies exercise control over rent increases . The introduction of such a mechanism into NORP law seems to be particularly justified and the need for it follows quite evidently from the shortage of flats and the absence of a lease market which would influence rates of rent . This very low supply of flats for rent has caused a situation in which tenants are exposed to undue demands from landlords . Hence there is a need to regulate rent increases .", "While recognising this necessity , ORG is convinced that the mechanism introduced by the impugned provision is defective and is objectively inappropriate for accomplishing the aims pursued by the legislature . ...", "To begin with , ORG will examine the impact of the operation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act on landlords who were subject to controlled rent under LAW . In this ORG \u2019s view , the contested provision has not only \u2018 frozen\u2019 the disadvantageous position of landlords subsisting LAW , a situation which was already found to have been incompatible with the LAW , but has also actually aggravated that situation on account of changing economic circumstances . ...", "At the time when the present legislation came into force , tenants paid rent determined by the municipalities . [ The rent paid ] , according to the information supplied by ORG , covered merely PERCENT of the costs of maintenance of residential buildings . LAW did not increase rent to the level that could have been established according to the principles set out by ORG in [ the judgment of DATE ] . Nor did the legislature give landlords an opportunity to increase rent to a level ensuring recovery of their expenses . LAW has frozen rates of rent and fixed them as a reference level for the calculation of future increases . ...", "In ORG opinion , in order to arrive at reasonable levels of rent it is necessary to take CARDINAL of the following CARDINAL measures : either a CARDINAL - off increase in deflated rates of controlled rent , accompanied by a restrictive protection of tenants against further increases or , while freezing the applicable rates , permitting considerable increases in relatively rapid succession until an acceptable level has been reached . However , the legislature fixed an unreasonably low basic rent and allowed only strictly regulated increases , correlated with the inflation rate . The legislature did not take into account the fact that the rate of inflation was constantly declining , which means that permissible increases have been insignificant , amounting merely to a few percentage points of the basic rent and giving no opportunity , for purely mathematical reasons , to reach levels that would ensure profitability , or at least recovery of maintenance costs . The decrease in the inflation rate , although a generally positive sign of economic stability , has resulted in the stagnation of rents at low levels .", "The deterioration of the situation of landlords receiving controlled rent is also shown by a comparison of rent increases under LAW with increases permissible under LAW . As transpires from information supplied by ORG [ in respect of the operation of the DATE Act ] , at the relevant time , municipalities raised controlled rent DATE to a significant extent : in DATE , when the inflation rate was PERCENT , by PERCENT on average , but in DATE , when the inflation rate was PERCENT , by PERCENT . The pace of transition to reasonable levels of rent was faster than at present , if only because municipalities , themselves owning residential buildings , had a strong interest in securing genuine increases in rent . Finally , the previous regulations gave landlords the hope of relaxing rent policy . Irrespective of the rates of controlled rent imposed on them by municipalities , they knew that from DATE they would be able to negotiate rents freely . However , that encouraging prospect was wiped out by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act . Even though the ceiling of PERCENT will no longer apply after [ DATE , given the provision of section GPE ) , this ceiling will not be reached in reality .", "In ORG view , the above circumstances give sufficient grounds to find that the situation of landlords who formerly received controlled rent is now unquestionably less favourable than it used to be under LAW . ... [ O]n the contrary , section GPE ) has perpetuated the violation of the right of property . At this point , it is necessary to determine how the landlords\u2019 situation looks in other respects , apart from the restrictions on rent increases . If , following the ... judgment of CARDINAL January CARDINAL , the legislature had significantly changed any aspect of the legal position of landlords , thereby compensating for losses resulting from reduced rent , the evaluation of levels of rent in the present case would have had to be based on other criteria than those referred to by this ORG in DATE .", "Since DATE there have been no changes to legislation , apart from the enactment of the CARDINAL Act , which seriously aggravated the situation of landlords . They still bear the burden of obligations imposed by LAW , whose non - fulfilment , as stressed by the ORG , is subject to penalties . There have been no changes to regulations on income tax , at least in respect of deductions from tax ( or from taxable income ) of amounts spent on the maintenance of buildings in which flats are let to tenants . Nor has the legislature introduced preferential loans for repairs . ... ORG also points out that LAW has not materially improved the situation of landlords in respect of termination of leases . ...", "Accordingly , it is fully justified to rely on this ORG \u2019s findings in respect of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act . Even though the provisions under consideration have changed , and the ORG is now considering completely different legal instruments ( control of rent increase as opposed to the scheme of rent control under LAW ) , the core of the dispute and the issues under consideration remain essentially the same , namely the situation of landlords on whom the legislature has imposed reduced levels of rent . In addition , section GPE ) leads to a difference in the treatment of landlords , depending on whether they are parties to lease relationships formerly governed by the rent - control scheme , or to lease contracts based on freely determined rents . As shown above , in practice the rent increase mechanism adversely affects the first group of landlords and , at the same time , unjustifiably and at the tenant \u2019s expense , favours the second group .", "In view of the foregoing , the Constitutional Court finds that the [ operation of ] the contested provision is tantamount to the continued violation of the right of property vested in a specific group of landlords , namely those who entered into a lease relationship by virtue of administrative decisions on the allocation of a dwelling , or on another basis , prior to the introduction of ORG management of housing matters in a given municipality . Not only did the legislature fail to adjust rates of controlled rent , despite their having been found to be unconstitutional , but in fact , through the introduction of restrictive provisions on rent increases , it practically froze such rents at levels that can not be regarded as consistent with constitutional guarantees of the right of property . ...", "It is worth reiterating , having regard to the [ judgment of DATE ] , that the restrictions in question are undoubtedly guided by the need to protect public order and the rights of other persons , namely tenants . However , according to ORG case - law , LAW requires restrictions on the rights guaranteed therein to be necessary . In respect of the rent [ control scheme ] , ORG qualified as \u2018 necessary\u2019 DATE at least during the transitional period \u2013 the restriction on the right of property \u2018 precluding the freedom to derive profit , by fixing levels of rent in such a way as to cover only the costs of maintenance and upkeep of the ORG . A reduction below that minimum was seen by this ORG as unconstitutional . Placing the financial burden of subsidising rent on a single social group , namely landlords , was also considered to have been unconstitutional since \u2018 the duty to help the underprivileged and [ the duties inherent in ] social solidarity are incumbent not only upon those ORG . ORG envisaged and still envisages the possibility of applying other legal solutions ... which would result in a more uniform social distribution of the burden linked to the necessity to satisfy housing needs . It is therefore unnecessary to place the entire burden on the single group of landlords . Consequently , ORG considers that the restriction resulting from section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ... does not meet the criteria established by the principle of proportionality and goes beyond the tolerable extent of limitations on the right of property set out in LAW .", "ORG is not competent to fix minimum levels of rent ... [ However , ] from the point of view of the protection of landlords\u2019 rights , [ it ] stresses again the crucial importance of the correct determination of the costs of maintenance and upkeep of residential buildings . This constitutes the absolute minimum rate . ...", "As regards the implementation of the constitutional rights of tenants , ORG stresses that , although in the present judgment section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL LAW has been found unconstitutional , the LAW still imposes significant restrictions on the freedom to increase rents . The most important of them is definitely section CARDINAL ) , which remains in force and which provides that ... up to DATE inclusive the annual rent may not exceed PERCENT of the reconstruction value of the dwelling . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court heard a constitutional complaint lodged by a certain PERSON , challenging the constitutionality of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .

The need to protect tenants against unduly high rents is justified by the housing situation in GPE , which is the consequence of ORG management of housing and has resulted in a commonly experienced shortage of flats .", "A limitation on levels of rent \u2013 such as the one introduced by the contested provision \u2013 does not impair the essence of the right of property because it does not deprive owners of essential elements of that right .

The gist of ORG arguments is summarised in the following paragraphs .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court first analysed the impugned provisions from the point of view of the principle of the rule of law as laid down in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) :", "\u201c In the opinion of the [ ORG ] , the introduction of the contested legal provisions clearly violated the principle of proper legislation , which necessarily leads it to declare those provisions incompatible with the principle of the rule of law as expressed in LAW . The amendments , contrary to the intentions of the legislature itself \u2013 as is confirmed by the content of the PERSON \u2019s written observations [ filed in this case ] \u2013 eliminated a market mechanism in a situation where the actual purpose of introducing restrictions on rent increases was to be the protection of tenants , that is to say , persons who in a given case do not accept the proposed increase . There is a distinct inconsistency between the provisions of the amendment in the initial bill and the provisions introduced following the parliamentary debate . In consequence , none of the declared aims of the [ legislation ] has been attained . Rents were not relaxed within rational limits encompassing the requirements of justice and of protection of landlords\u2019 rights and nor were effective and precisely determined procedures introduced to protect the rights of tenants against abuse of [ landlords\u2019 right to ] determine rent freely .", "The new version of section PERSON ) has also violated the principle of ... confidence in the ORG and the law made by it . Thus , as already mentioned , there is no doubt whatsoever that until the adoption of the DATE Amendment the legislation of DATE consistently assured society , and especially persons directly interested in the situation of landlords and tenants , that rents that were controlled and at the same time limited to the level of PERCENT of the reconstruction value of the dwelling exclusively in respect of a certain category of LOC would apply for the transitional period , that is , up to DATE . This period ... was [ set ] to make it possible for the government and the legislature to develop a new , comprehensive and multi - faceted system governing the relations between landlords and tenants , fully taking into consideration the justified interests of the parties and also realistically allowing those same parties to prepare themselves for surviving the most difficult period and to accept fully the new state of affairs , so that mutual relations between the parties to a lease ( or an analogous relationship ) could be shaped in a rational manner and above all with due consideration for the concrete conditions determining rent . The date of DATE as the deadline for the transition period was also confirmed in LAW , which further strengthened the conviction that after that date the mechanism for determining rent would be compatible with the principle of freedom of contract .", "This societal conviction was further supported by the unambiguous case - law of ORG , which on many occasions underlined the transitional character of the rent - control scheme . It thus follows that in DATE the unambiguous \u2018 rules of the game\u2019 were established , whose period of validity was clearly indicated by LAW ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) and then in some sense confirmed by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act . ...", "In its case - law ORG has frequently expressed the opinion that the legislature must not fail to meet deadlines for those \u2018 rules of the game\u2019 that it set itself . This opinion was expressed , inter alia , in ... the reasoning of [ its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ] . In its judgment ... , ORG expressed the opinion that setting aside the principle of controlled rent for a DATE transitional period would be acceptable only under exceptional circumstances , for otherwise there would be a violation of the principle of legal certainty expressed in LAW .", "These considerations lead to the conclusion that the adoption of the contested Act and its publication on DATE , with its entry into force on DATE , violated the \u2018 rules of the game\u2019 which were laid down in the previous legislation and which were subject to an unambiguous time - limit[. This happened in a situation where ] there were no exceptional circumstances or events that could justify or explain the extension of [ those rules ] for a longer period .", "The breaking of what amounted to a promise laid down in a statute must be regarded as a particular kind of irresponsibility on the part of the public authorities , and hence an exceptionally jarring violation of the principle of confidence in the ORG and the law made by it , a principle constituting one of the foundations of the rule of law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG next referred to the principle of the protection of property and the principle of proportionality :", "\u201c LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW guarantees the protection of ownership and other property rights on an equal basis for all . Among these \u2018 other property rights\u2019 are the right to lease residential LOC and other rights relating to LOC serving to satisfy housing needs . Each of these rights , whether accruing to landlords or to tenants , enjoys constitutional protection , but in different ways . As a rule these rights collide but , as has been pointed out [ in one of ORG previous judgments ] , it would be a simplification to treat this conflict in linear terms , and to presume that providing a certain degree of protection to CARDINAL of these rights must necessarily result in a weakening of the degree of protection afforded to the other .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and section PERSON ) ... were based on the unjustified conviction that relations between landlords and tenants always have an antagonistic nature , which inevitably leads to the \u2018 CARDINAL - sum game\u2019 . In reality , however , this does not have to be the case ; on the contrary , properly determined relations between the parties to a lease agreement are of service both to landlords and tenants , provided that neither of the parties abuses its rights , since everyone is obliged to respect the freedoms and rights of others ( LAW ) .", "ORG is fully aware of how difficult it is to balance the legitimate interests of both landlords and tenants and to create the best possible ways of organising their relations . This is particularly true in the NORP situation , in which the rights of landlords were not respected for a long time and housing matters were subject to ORG management for entire decades[. This ] , combined with other systemic and economic factors , resulted in a degradation of housing supply unheard of in the countries of western LOC , and the consequences of which affected and still affect not only landlords but , ultimately , also tenants . Stepping back from this abyss will be difficult and will take DATE , and the effective change of the present state of affairs will probably not be possible without committing public funds adapted to concrete situations ( see the ORG judgment [ of CARDINAL DATE ] ) .", "It is therefore the legislature \u2019s duty to strive to form a harmonious legal situation for landlords and tenants , so that their relations can be seen as desirably complementary rather than characterised by inevitable antagonism . Charges for the use of the LOC , including rent , are a special element of those relations . They should ensure that the landlord not only covers the costs of building maintenance and repair , but also obtains a return on invested capital ( amortisation ) and a decent profit because no legal provisions may extinguish one of the basic components of the right to property , namely the right to derive profit from property ... This was possible , as found by ORG [ in its earlier judgment ] , in the transitional period , during which it was considered reasonable to restrict profit [ by fixing ] such levels of rent as only covered the costs of maintenance and upkeep . Now complete regulations , fully and precisely determining the elements of rent , are required . LAW specified what are to be regarded as charges that do not depend on the landlord ... but it did not indicate ... the elements of rent as such . As a result , judicial control of reasons for rent increases is to a large extent illusory . ...", "At the same time , ORG considers it necessary to take into account the legitimate interests of tenants , and to establish effective mechanisms to protect them against abuse of their rights by landlords . It is also necessary to develop a set of instruments that would make it possible to support tenants finding themselves in difficult financial and living circumstances . This must not be done , as has been the case hitherto , mainly at the cost of landlords , but mostly through the deployment of special public resources . Thus , the duties inherent in social solidarity and the duty to help the underprivileged are incumbent on society as a whole . ...", "Over DATE or so , attempts have been made in GPE to protect the legal interests of ... tenants through the statutory determination of percentage rent increase indicators , or of rent ceilings , or through the introduction of certain stronger control measures after a certain limit was exceeded , but in fact this has always been done in isolation from the concrete circumstances of given landlords and given tenants . An exception in this respect is the duty to determine officially the so - called \u2018 conversion ORG , which of course adjusts the calculation of rent , but only locally , and , furthermore , is highly formalised and mechanical in nature .", "The end of the transitional period for controlled rents must mean a real break with the statutory automatism in respect of setting levels of rent , determining the rent ceilings or imposing restrictions on rent increases . One should expect the establishment of a system providing flexible solutions , adapted to the requirements of a modern housing market , which \u2013 stressing the parties\u2019 freedom to determine rent levels \u2013 would also ensure effective control in order to prevent arbitrariness and abuse of that freedom .", "The contested provisions allow the parties ... a very small margin of freedom , which does not take into consideration concrete circumstances , such as the technical condition of the LOC and the building , the personal and financial situation of the tenants or local factors . The legislature believes that the elimination of irregularities in increasing rent , apart from rent being subject to an arithmetical ceiling , will be effected through a special procedure for judicial control laid down in section QUANTITY combined with the mechanism restricting rent increases as laid down in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , in particular section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL)(a ) .", "The legislature , declaring that controlled rents would be abolished in the future , never promised that from DATE the levels of rent determined by the parties would not be controlled at all . However , judicial control to this end would be effective if the law clearly determined elements of rent and formulated precise criteria for its evaluation . But this did not happen . LAW does not indicate at all how rent should be determined ( because rent increases as such are a different matter ) , even in such a fragmentary way as section DATE CARDINAL Act did . It thereby deprived a court assessing an increase in rent of the possibility of objective verification , on the basis of concretely enumerated elements of rent and clear criteria for their evaluation , whether or not the increase was justified ( section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act ) , and hence created a risk of divergence between judicial decisions . It should also be noted that in certain situations the limiting mechanism introduced by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL)(a ) either excludes judicial control of rent altogether , or makes it completely illusory ...", "In consequence , ... both the contested amendments amounted to a breach of the principle of proportionality expressed in LAW , [ notably ] through defective formulation of the rules determining [ rent ] , which do not give adequate protection either to landlords or to the rights of tenants . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the context of the principle of proportionality ORG also referred to this ORG \u2019s Chamber judgment in the following terms :", "\u201c ORG paid particular attention to ORG Rights\u2019 judgment of DATE in the case of ORG v. GPE . ...", "Given the date of this judgment , [ considerations ] of ORG were already based on the legal situation obtaining on DATE . Hence they encompassed both DATE Amendments to LAW and the Prosecutor General \u2019s application . In ORG view , the opinion expressed by ORG provides additional arguments in favour of finding that these amendments , in their parts contested in the application , violate the principle of maintaining confidence in the ORG and in the law made by it as laid down in LAW and undermine in an inadmissible manner the standards of property protection common to the member ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It then went on to analyse the general situation :", "\u201c ORG still holds the view ( expressed in its judgment of CARDINAL January CARDINAL ... ) that", "\u2018 it is in conformity with the contemporary perception of a \u201c social ORG \u201d to demand some sacrifice from all members of society for the benefit of those who can not provide subsistence for themselves and their families ... In the circumstances obtaining in GPE , under LAW [ of LAW ] , it may be justified to maintain the provisions limiting landlords\u2019 property rights and , more particularly , excluding unrestricted freedom in fixing rates of rent and other charges collected from tenants.\u2019", "The latter remark was particularly significant for the assessment of legislation during the transition period , but it can not be seen as having fully lost its relevance with the end of that period .", "...", "Thus , GPE which , like GPE , are undergoing radical systemic and economic transformation must create legislative tools that make it possible for them to overcome the consequences of historical events ( arbitrary and peremptory interference with private property by the ORG ) and to ensure the transition to conditions appropriate for democratic , liberal GPE governed by the rule of law . This is a very difficult task , especially given the absence of well - tried models of proceeding in such cases . The scale of the phenomenon far surpasses the post - war experience of western NORP States . Changes in this area are being introduced by trial and error ; they are slow and not effective enough \u2013 as has been pointed out by ORG in the judgments cited above .", "It is therefore not possible , in respect of the rights of landlords , who were formerly deprived of the possibility of fully enjoying their property , simply to give this possibility back to them in the form of unrestricted market - related rent . Such a measure , in a situation where private houses , previously taken in connection with the so - called \u2018 public management of housing ORG , have depreciated and require very major investments in repairs and high running maintenance costs , would mean imposing on tenants an excessive burden undermining their existence . ...", "It must be kept in mind that the fact that landlords\u2019 rights were infringed over DATE did not result from any acts by tenants , but was first and foremost caused by defective legislation . Removing , after DATE of neglect , all those harmful consequences may not therefore be done at the expense of tenants , and certainly not at their expense alone , but must above all stimulate the public authorities themselves to take appropriate action . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its final considerations ORG stressed that , given that its judgment was inherently limited by the scope of ORG application , it could not resolve comprehensively and definitely the fundamental systemic issues arising from the operation of the rent - control scheme . In particular , it could not address the mechanism for balancing the interests of landlords and tenants , a mechanism which was still missing in the existing legal system .", "Having regard to the fact that sections CARDINAL and DATE CARDINAL Act ( in so far as they were still in force following the repeal ) did not provide for any satisfactory and consistent mechanism and no appropriate legislative initiative to that effect had been envisaged , ORG decided to prepare recommendations ( sygnalizacja ) for ORG , whose object would be to formulate clear demands to create a mechanism making it possible to formulate precise criteria for judicial control of rent and related charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave a decision ( postanowienie ) setting out the recommendations for ORG ( \u201c the DATE Recommendations \u201d ) referred to in the judgment of DATE . In its relevant parts , the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Starting - point", "... Under the present legislation , as amended by ORG judgment [ of DATE ] , landlords may increase rents or other charges for the use of the dwelling not more often than DATE but an increase in rent or other charges , apart from those which do not depend on a landlord , whereby rent would exceed PERCENT of the reconstruction value of the dwelling within DATE may take place only in justified cases . ... [ T]he tenant may challenge the increase by bringing a court action to have the increase declared unjustified , or justified but in a different amount , or may refuse to accept the increase with the effect that the contract is terminated at the end of the term of notice .", "However , judicial control of increases in rent and the procedure for such increases do not apply if an increase does not exceed PERCENT of the current rent or current charges .", "CARDINAL . Lack of statutory criteria for judicial control", "[ LAW ] does not indicate , and this is its fundamental shortcoming , the criteria on the basis of which the courts are to control increases in rent or other charges for the use of the dwelling . This situation is detrimental to both landlords and tenants . Accordingly , judicial control , lacking statutory criteria , certainly becomes very difficult and unforeseeable , if not illusory . This may lead to quite arbitrary decisions . It is likely that in this legal situation the courts would be forced to create an ad hoc set of criteria for the future assessment [ of increases ] rather than to review legal grounds for increases . It should be stressed that removing from the judicial control increases in rent and charges that do not exceed PERCENT will , in many instances , deprive tenants of the necessary protection and will , within DATE , lead to rents being hauled up to an objectively unjustified level .", "The above considerations lead to the conclusion that the statutory system of fixing the maximum ceiling of rents and other charges and of controlling increases determined algorithmically , which was justified in the transitional period ... , can neither satisfactorily serve the interests of landlords nor protect the justified interests of tenants . It is therefore necessary to regulate in a complex manner those matters , maintaining at the same time flexible solutions . ....", "CARDINAL . Factors influencing the level of so - called \u2018 basic rent\u2019 [ czynsz pocz\u0105tkowy ]", "The question of determining rents and charges for the use of the dwelling can not be seen only from the perspective of the criteria and rules for their increase . First of all , it is necessary to set a statutory starting - point \u2013 in other words , elements of rent that would adequately take into account the rights of landlords .", "At the same time , not losing sight of the necessarily complementary relationship between a landlord and a tenant , one should have regard to the fact that the essential duty of the tenant is to pay an economically justified level of rent , i.e. not too high but related to the justified economic interest of the landlord .", "The point of departure for determining such ... rent should be an indication that its elements can not be [ fixed without relation to ] running repairs and maintenance , an adequately determined depreciation and a decent profit . ...", "The need to include the costs of repairs and maintenance does not require any further explanation \u2013 it is obvious . Likewise , a decent profit derived from the exercise of the right of property is an indispensable element of the genuine protection of property rights . Without profit , there are no investments or even modernisation works , which are dictated by technological progress and which are also beneficial for the interests of tenants . The future detailed legal solutions should , however , pay due regard to the fact that the aims pursued by the public authorities ( ORG , other ORG authorities and municipalities ) are different from those pursued by private individuals and bodies ( such as housing cooperatives ) and that the expectations of [ those CARDINAL groups ] in respect of a decent rent should be established at different levels . ...", "It is also necessary to include among the elements of rent a return on landlords\u2019 investments in the construction or modernisation of the building in due time , it being understood as a basis for an adequately established depreciation level . ...", "CARDINAL . DATE Additional instruments for monitoring the level of rent", "An auxiliary instrument , enabling the courts to assess thoroughly the basis of the determination of , and increase in , rent could entail , among other things , the setting up by the authorities , in the process of a true social dialogue with organisations of landlords and tenants , a system for monitoring the levels of rent in all municipalities which would , for example , disseminate information on the average level of rent in a given region . Such systems are known in some NORP countries as a \u2018 rent GPE . ...", "CARDINAL . Housing benefits", "The justified \u2018 basic rent\u2019 , determined in the manner indicated above in respect of each residential building , might often be incompatible with the tenants\u2019 financial situation . ... In such cases the poorer tenants should be included in a system of individual benefits , justified by their [ individual ] circumstances , from the public funds , which would genuinely help them to fulfil their duty to pay rent regularly up to a certain determined amount .", "...", "CARDINAL . Instruments for the necessary support of landlords", "In certain situations ( especially in respect of buildings regarded as part of the national heritage ) it may happen that [ even ] properly determined rent will still not be sufficient to cover all the costs required for the necessary expenses involved in normal maintenance , in particular the necessary repairs or modernisation . In such precisely determined cases the system of public finances should provide for forms of individual support for landlords obliged to cover the extra costs involved in the maintenance of the buildings . Such support may take various forms , from housing subsidies , through loans on preferential terms for specific investments and , finally , to tax exemptions . ...", "...", "CARDINAL . Inconsistent regulation of the rights and obligations of parties to a lease agreement", "ORG considers it necessary to point to inconsistencies , as regards the setting out of a catalogue of GPE and tenants\u2019 duties , between the new sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the DATE Act and the provisions concerning the lease of a dwelling contained in ...

It is against the rules of proper legislation to include the provisions governing the lease of dwellings not in LAW , which contains a full set of regulations on lease relations , but in a law whose object is to protect tenants generally , not to regulate the lease relationship .", "[ Final remarks ]", "ORG present recommendations are concerned with shortcomings and lacunas to which it has pointed in DATE either in its judgments or documents providing information about its activities . ... Removing them in the near future is necessary also in view of the principle of the social market economy , which has particular importance in the present context .

It should once more be stressed that they should be resolved through comprehensive solutions pursuing clearly defined aims which are compatible with the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

He further asked that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act be found to be incompatible with LAW ( principle of the rule of law ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG first referred to ORG judgment of DATE , stating that this judgment left no doubt whatsoever that the legislature \u2019s essential duty was to set up a legal mechanism balancing the constitutionally protected rights of landlords and tenants .

He further referred to ORG recommendations , pointing out that there were no statutory criteria for what was to be considered a \u201c justified increase \u201d . In fact , he maintained , from the point of view of the landlord every rent increase was justified as it either increased his profit or reduced the losses involved in proper maintenance , while from the point of view of the tenant every such raise was \u201c unjustified \u201d as it involved greater expense on his part .", "As regards section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the ORG submitted that it was unclear and incompatible with the principle of proper legislation ensuing from the rule of law in that , for instance , it did not specify when the DATE period \u2013 relevant for determining the point from which a given increase in rent had applied DATE was to start . In the ORG \u2019s view , this lack of clarity could not be removed simply by interpretation of that provision and created a possible source of conflicts between landlords and tenants .", "CARDINAL .
