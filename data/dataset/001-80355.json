In DATE the first applicant \u2019s sons , M r PERSON , born in DATE , and Mr PERSON , born in DATE ( the second and the third applicants , both NORP nationals ) , joined the proceedings before the ORG .", "The applicants were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a legal adviser practising in GPE .

In DATE , after the birth the second applicant , the competent authority allocated an additional room to the family . At that time the apartment , which covered QUANTITY , belonged to a private joint - stock company .", "In DATE the property of the company was expropriated without compensation . In DATE the apartment at issue was allocated to ORG at ORG . In DATE the fund issued a tenancy order to the first applicant \u2019s husband .", "In DATE , at a time when he was Deputy Minister of Defence , the first applicant \u2019s husband purchased the whole apartment from ORG .

The applicants were not parties to the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG granted the claim . It found , inter alia , that the apartment had been purchased in breach of the relevant housing regulations as in force in DATE since it had been significantly larger than permitted for a CARDINAL - member family , as the applicants\u2019 . The court also found that certain procedural rules had not been complied with and that , in all likelihood , the first applicant \u2019s husband had abused his position of Deputy Minister of Defence .", "On appeal , on DATE the ORG quashed ORG judgment and dismissed the claim of the pre - nationalisation ORG heirs . The court found that all relevant regulations as in force DATE had been complied with and that the allegation that the first applicant \u2019s husband had abused his position was groundless .", "The heirs of the pre - nationalisation owners submitted a petition for review ( cassation ) .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment and upheld ORG judgment .", "ORG agreed that the allegation of abuse of office had not been proven . However , the apartment had largely exceeded the needs of the applicants\u2019 family under the rules applicable at the relevant time . As a result , the title of the first applicant \u2019s husband to the apartment at issue was null and void .", "The judgment of CARDINAL DATE was final and enforceable .", "On an unspecified date shortly after DATE the first applicant , who had not been a party to the proceedings until then , submitted a request for reopening , stating that in accordance with LAW she should have been cited as a party since she was the owner of CARDINAL of the apartment at issue .", "The first applicant \u2019s husband died in DATE . The first applicant and her CARDINAL sons ( the second and the third applicants ) were his heirs .", "By judgments of DATE and DATE , ORG quashed the judgments of DATE and CARDINAL DATE and reopened the case . The court found that , in violation of the relevant provisions of LAW , the first applicant had not been summoned as a party to the DATE proceedings .", "All CARDINAL applicants became parties to the reopened proceedings .", "On DATE the ORG decided to refer the case for renewed examination by ORG . That decision was quashed by ORG on DATE , as the reopened case fell to be examined by ORG .", "On DATE the ORG found that the DATE transaction was null and void , having regard to the fact that the apartment at issue had largely exceeded the applicants\u2019 family \u2019s needs as determined by the relevant housing regulations . The court thus upheld ORG judgment of DATE .", "The applicants appealed . The proceedings are currently pending before ORG which listed a hearing for DATE .", "In the meantime , DATE , there were separate rei vindicatio proceedings between the same parties regarding the same apartment .
