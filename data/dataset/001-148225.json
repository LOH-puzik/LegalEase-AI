The applicant was born in DATE and prior to his arrest lived in the town of GPE , GPE . He is currently being detained in a temporary detention facility in GPE - on - Don .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , at the material time the deputy Prime Minister of GPE , survived an assassination attempt . However , his spine was badly wounded and he became paralysed . He can not walk and is confined to a wheelchair . He also lost his ability to urinate or defecate without special medical procedures , such as catheters and enemas .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has been mayor of PERSON , GPE .", "CARDINAL . \u0421riminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of organised aggravated murder and attempted murder of ORG officials , including several prosecutors , investigators , a member of the town council and the head of the investigative committee in GPE . The investigation was assigned to a group of senior investigators and criminologists from the investigative committees of various regions of GPE and led by the deputy head of ORG , a major - general . The applicant was arrested on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ordered the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial , citing the gravity of the charges against him and the risk that he might abscond , interfere with the investigation , in particular influence witnesses , and reoffend . ORG decision was based on the applicant \u2019s official powers and his significant contacts with various persons involved in the investigation , as well as his consequent ability to influence the investigation . The court referred to the case - file materials , according to which a number of defendants arrested on suspicion of participating in the murders were also public officials and law - enforcement agents , investigators or police officers . They had identified the applicant as the \u201c master - mind \u201d of the murders , had provided details of the murders and had argued that certain victims had been murdered in retaliation for their failure to obey the applicant \u2019s orders .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s arguments pertaining to his poor state of health , his stable family situation , his age and his standing in the community , having considered that they did not outweigh the reasons warranting his detention . ORG was also not convinced by the description given by the head of the PERSON police department portraying the applicant as \u201c an example of compliance with the law and public order \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The decision of DATE was upheld on appeal on DATE when ORG found ORG finding reasonable and convincing . ORG also noted that no alternative measure , such as house arrest or a written undertaking , could ensure the proper course of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , having again linked the gravity and nature of the charges against him , as well as his standing in society , to the likelihood that he would obstruct the course of justice , reoffend or abscond . ORG once again relied on the applicant \u2019s connections to support the conclusion that if released he would tamper with the evidence . At the same time , ORG took into account a medical opinion issued on DATE ( cited in detail below ) , according to which the applicant \u2019s state of health did not preclude his detention in the conditions of an ordinary detention facility . It also noted that there was no evidence that the authorities had delayed the pre - trial investigation . ORG concluded by stressing that the case was particularly complex , involved a large number of defendants and required a series of investigative steps to be taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE new charges were brought against the applicant . He was charged with firearms trafficking and attempting to organise a terrorist attack on a public official , his political rival . According to the investigation , the applicant and his accomplices had intended to shoot down , with a portable anti - aircraft rocket launcher , a civilian aircraft in which the public official was to travel from GPE to GPE with other passengers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the ORG request to extend the applicant \u2019s detention again until DATE . ORG noted the gravity of the charges , including the new ones , and the fact that the applicant was facing a sentence of up to life imprisonment . It once again cited the risks of the applicant absconding , reoffending and obstructing the course of justice , and expressed concern for the safety of the witnesses and victims . ORG noted that the investigation of certain criminal offences with which the applicant was charged was at an active stage and that the risk of his interfering with the investigation , if he were released , was well - founded . CARDINAL defendants had been arrested and certain suspects were yet to be apprehended . ORG placed particular weight on the complexity of the case and the progress that the investigators were making with it .", "CARDINAL . ORG also examined in detail the arguments put forward by the defence in favour of the applicant \u2019s release and the application of a more lenient measure of restraint . It concluded that neither his family ties nor his state of health outweighed the reasons for his continued detention . In particular , ORG relied on the medical opinions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , which had found that the applicant \u2019s illness was not among those listed in Governmental Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE preventing the detention of a suspect . It further stressed that on a DATE basis CARDINAL medical specialists from municipal and ORG medical facilities ( \u201c generalists , surgeons , neurologists , urologists , endocrinologists , proctologists , an infectious diseases specialist , and a rehabilitation specialist \u201d ) had examined the applicant and that he had received the prescribed drug treatment in full . Moreover , he had undergone all the necessary laboratory testing and clinical examinations in certified civilian laboratories in GPE and on DATE he was to undergo yet another expert examination to determine whether he was suffering from any illness warranting his release . Having cited a long list of the applicant \u2019s illnesses , ORG noted that there was no evidence that his condition had deteriorated or that he required treatment in a specialised medical facility . ORG dismissed as unreliable various expert opinions and medical records prepared by specialists , including foreign ones , in various related fields of medicine and produced by the defence in support of their argument that the applicant \u2019s life was being put at risk by his prolonged detention in the conditions of an ordinary detention facility and in the absence of adequate medical assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . Having again assessed the materials presented to it by the investigation and the defence , ORG concluded that the risks of the applicant influencing witnesses , reoffending , obstructing the investigation by other means and absconding were still present . In particular , the criminal proceedings against the applicant were at a crucial stage of collecting evidence and there was a risk that , using his connections in the criminal underworld , the applicant might try to influence witnesses and victims who feared him . ORG also cited the medical reports of DATE , DATE and DATE , which supported its conclusion that the applicant \u2019s state of health did not preclude his further detention .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant \u2019s detention was further extended . However , neither party provided the ORG with an update .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP Military Court found the applicant guilty of conspiring to organise a terrorist attack and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant was stripped of all ORG awards and commendations . It appears that the criminal proceedings on the remaining charges against the applicant are still pending .", "CARDINAL . Numerous medical certificates and expert opinions submitted by the parties show that the applicant is suffering from a spinal cord injury , paraplegia , chronic urinary tract infection , chronic pyelonephritis ( kidney infection ) , chronic urinary retention , rectal prolapse ( a condition in which the rectum protrudes out of the anus ) , paraproctitis ( an inflammation of the cellular tissues surrounding the rectum ) , ischemic heart disease , chronic heart failure , hypertension , a thyroid gland disease , hepatitis C and non - insulin - dependent diabetes .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the applicant \u2019s representatives a panel comprising experts in neurology , urology and general medicine examined the applicant \u2019s medical records dating from the period DATE . Their report dated DATE found that , due to his inability to satisfy his most basic needs ( such as moving , urinating or defecating ) without help and to his very serious diseases , the applicant required constant medical supervision , treatment and assistance and that he should therefore be placed in a specialised medical facility . His detention in a temporary detention facility could aggravate his condition and , in the absence of a swift reaction to such an aggravation , could result in his death . The report also found that the applicant was suffering from diseases which , according to ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE , were incompatible with detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL doctors from ORG hospital no . CARDINAL in GPE examined the applicant at the investigator \u2019s request . Having studied the applicant \u2019s medical history , the results of his recent clinical blood and urine analyses , as well as the results of his ultrasound scan and FAC examinations , the doctors confirmed the diagnoses and found that the applicant \u201c was not suffering from any of the serious diseases included in the list of serious illnesses precluding detention of a suspect or an accused \u201d . The report did not indicate the field of medicine in which the doctors specialised .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to a request by the investigator , on DATE the director of the medical unit of temporary detention facility ( SIZO-CARDINAL ) in GPE , where the applicant was detained , prepared a certificate describing the applicant \u2019s state of health . Citing extracts from the medical records , the director reported that the applicant was examined by him DATE and also by various specialist doctors , including a urologist , a neurologist , a surgeon , a cardiologist and an endocrinologist . Blood and urine tests were regularly performed . He was prescribed and administered various medications . The applicant used disposable catheters to urinate . He performed that procedure himself , as he had done before his arrest , CARDINAL times a day without the facility administration having the possibility of ensuring the requisite level of asepsis . An enema was carried out by a doctor CARDINAL or CARDINAL times a week to make the applicant defecate . The applicant \u2019s condition was stable and no deterioration in his health had been noted , although he had continued to raise various health complaints .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , the director of the medical unit also noted that , because the applicant was confined to a wheelchair , he could not be transported to the medical unit of the detention facility . He was therefore held in an ordinary cell where he was visited by the doctors and where all the necessary medical procedures were performed . In particular , the neighbouring cell which was used to perform the enemas was not suitable for that medical procedure as it was difficult to ensure the requisite sterility . The director stressed that lack of sterility could result in a serious complication .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyers submitted the medical report of CARDINAL DATE for assessment by CARDINAL medical specialists : a deputy president of ORG , academician and honorary doctor of GPE , PERSON ; and a member of the NORP and ORG , academician and highly respected professor - neurosurgeon , Mr S. On DATE the CARDINAL experts issued their review of the report . Having noticed the lack of information on the medical qualifications and specialisation of the CARDINAL doctors who had issued the report , the CARDINAL experts considered that the report contained a number of \u201c significant and important contradictions \u201d . In particular :", "- a urologist had not examined the applicant or participated in the preparation of the report of DATE , even though the applicant was suffering from a serious urological disorder ;", "- although the CARDINAL doctors had been provided with a complete set of medical records comprising the applicant \u2019s medical history , including those related to his injuries and complications , the report was only based on \u201c fragments of that information \u201d ; major complications arising from the applicant \u2019s condition , such as chronic cystitis and pyelonephritis , remained unassessed ;", "- Governmental Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE listed , among the serious illnesses precluding the detention of a suspect , \u201c serious progressive forms of atrophic and degenerative illnesses of the nervous system accompanied by a stable disorder of the motor , sensory and vegeto - trophic functions \u201d , which fully corresponded to the applicant \u2019s diagnosis . However , that medical condition had not been taken into account by the CARDINAL doctors who had prepared the report of DATE ;", "- the applicant was also suffering from a life - threatening post - traumatic pathology of the kidneys and urinary tracts . However , despite the fact that a similar condition was also listed by the ORG decree among the illnesses precluding detention , the CARDINAL doctors had paid no attention to it .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL experts concluded that the report of DATE was incomplete and was not objective , as it did not fully reflect the \u201c true picture of [ the applicant \u2019s ] pathology , which undoubtedly fell within the serious illnesses precluding detention pending trial , as determined by Governmental Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL doctors from hospital no . CARDINAL issued another report confirming the findings in their previous report of CARDINAL DATE . The doctors again concluded that the applicant \u2019s condition did not warrant his release as he was not suffering from any illness listed in Governmental Decree no . CARDINAL . The findings of the CARDINAL reports were similar , the only difference being that part of the second report was based on more recent clinical tests and examinations of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the ORG to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG and to authorise his transfer to a specialised medical facility as an interim measure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that the medical assistance he was receiving in the temporary detention facility was insufficient in view of his very serious diseases , which required constant medical supervision by specialised medical staff . The facility \u2019s medical staff were not competent to deal with such serious conditions . The treatment he was receiving there did not correspond to the treatment he had received before his arrest . Moreover , he was unable to satisfy his most basic needs without help . In particular , when he wanted to defecate , he had to wait , suffering , until an external specialist was called , as the facility staff were not qualified to carry out an enema . According to the applicant , such inadequate medical assistance could result in a brutal aggravation of his condition and ultimate death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to indicate to ORG , under LAW , that it was desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant be immediately examined by medical experts independent from the prison system with a view to determining : ( CARDINAL ) whether the treatment he was receiving in the detention facility was adequate for his condition ; ( CARDINAL ) whether his current state of health was compatible with detention in the conditions of a detention facility ; and ( CARDINAL ) whether his current condition required his placement in a hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government responded to the ORG \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE , having submitted a handwritten copy of the report prepared when the applicant was examined on admission to the detention facility SIZO-CARDINAL in GPE ; documents showing that the detention facility was licensed to provide medical services to inmates ; certificates issued jointly by the head of the detention facility and the director of its medical unit describing the state of the applicant \u2019s health and listing the medical procedures to which he had been subjected ; extracts from the applicant \u2019s medical history dating back to DATE ; a certificate issued by the same CARDINAL officials informing the ORG that there was no risk to the applicant \u2019s life and limb and that his condition was considered stable ; a handwritten copy of the applicant \u2019s medical record drawn up in the detention facility in which the most recent entry had been made on DATE by a prison doctor ; a record drawn up during the applicant \u2019s stay in hospital no . CARDINAL in GPE from DATE , noting the applicant \u2019s diagnosis and assessing his condition as moderately serious ; a medical record from a psychiatric prison hospital where he had stayed from DATE and where he had been treated for an \u201c adaptation disorder affecting emotions and behaviour \u201d ; copies of the CARDINAL medical reports issued on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively , by a medical commission of CARDINAL doctors from hospital no . CARDINAL who , having cited the applicant \u2019s medical history and the results of his examinations by various specialists and clinical tests performed in the hospital in DATE and DATE , concluded that the applicant was \u201c not suffering from an illness included in the list of serious illnesses precluding detention of suspected or accused persons \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government also answered the CARDINAL questions which , in its letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG had asked them to address to independent medical experts . In particular , having provided an answer to the first question related to the adequacy of the applicant \u2019s treatment , the Government stressed that the applicant had been placed under dynamic medical supervision by the medical personnel of the detention facility in relation to illnesses of the musculoskeletal , endocrine , hepatobiliary and urinary systems . They acknowledged that the applicant , as a wheelchair- bound inmate , required systematic care and permanent medical attention , which were being provided to him in a special cell . He was performing the remaining hygiene procedures himself . The Government submitted that the applicant received the necessary medical attention and that no additional medical procedures were required .", "CARDINAL . In their response to the second question about the compatibility of the applicant \u2019s state of health with the conditions of the detention facility , the Government stressed that the applicant was under the medical supervision of the personnel of the detention facility and was also being seen by various civilian medical specialists . The prison doctors were fully complying with the treatment plan developed by the civilian specialists .", "CARDINAL . In replying to the third question as to whether the applicant needed to be transferred to a hospital , the Government relied on the CARDINAL reports issued by the CARDINAL doctors from hospital no . CARDINAL on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , according to which the applicant was not suffering from any condition included in the list of serious illnesses precluding the detention of suspected and accused persons in detention facilities , as provided for by in Decree no . CARDINAL of the Government of GPE of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG reminded ORG that on DATE an interim measure had been imposed under Rule CARDINAL of ORG , in accordance with which independent medical experts were to examine the applicant and provide their expert opinion on the CARDINAL questions , assessing the quality of the applicant \u2019s treatment , the compatibility of his state of health with the conditions of the detention facility and the need to transfer him to a hospital . The ORG \u2019s attention was also drawn to the fact that the failure of a ORG to comply with a measure indicated under Rule CARDINAL may entail a breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government submitted an LANGUAGE translation of their submissions of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a large number of medical reports and opinions issued by various NORP and foreign experts . In particular , he provided the ORG with a copy of an opinion issued by PERSON of ORG in GPE , where he had undergone treatment on a number of occasions since DATE . The doctor who had attended to the applicant on those occasions stressed that he was in need of permanent medical supervision by qualified specialists . The lack of such assistance , in the doctor \u2019s opinion , was life - threatening . He also noted that the conditions of a detention facility were not suitable for a person in the applicant \u2019s state of health .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also provided the ORG with an assessment report issued on DATE by a deputy president of ORG , academician and honorary doctor of GPE , PERSON , in response to the medical opinion prepared on DATE by the CARDINAL doctors from hospital no . CARDINAL . PERSON again criticised the opinion for the same defects as those identified in the previous report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to another report prepared on DATE by Professor PERSON , a surgeon from ORG in GPE , GPE , the applicant required complex DATE medical examinations and procedures to control his diabetes , hepatitis C and urological problems . The doctor , who had treated the applicant in DATE and DATE , insisted that the lack of such care would be critically dangerous for the applicant \u2019s life .", "CARDINAL . Another medical expert from GPE , a urologist from a hospital in GPE , in his opinion of CARDINAL DATE , described the complexity of the applicant \u2019s health condition and listed the treatment which he should receive on a DATE basis . He concluded that the applicant \u2019s detention in the absence of such treatment posed a threat to his life .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL more specialist reports were issued in DATE : the first , by a professor of urology / andrology from GPE , Dr J. ; and the second by a professor of surgery and intensive surgical medicine from ORG , Dr PERSON The reports were based on the applicant \u2019s medical record and answers to their questions prepared by the applicant \u2019s defence team . Having noted the poor sanitary conditions in which the applicant had to undergo necessary procedures and his \u201c reduced immune system \u201d , their prognosis for him was \u201c very bad \u201d , with the likelihood that \u201c over time he would suffer from antibiotic - resistant urinary tract infection that [ could ] cause urosepsis with a very high risk of [ death ] \u201d . PERSON concluded that from the medical evidence before him , the applicant already had a permanent urinary tract infection which would probably soon develop into urosepsis . There was a PERCENT chance of developing septic shock and death in such a case , even in optimal clinical conditions . That chance became far more probable in a prison environment . The risk was even higher than for otherwise healthy paraplegic men given that the applicant was suffering from diabetes . Having listed various medical procedures and recommendations for treatment , PERSON concluded that the applicant \u2019s life \u201c was in acute danger \u201d and that \u201c high - quality medical management of [ the applicant \u2019s ] problems [ was ] mandatory \u201d .", "Dr PERSON concluded his analysis of the applicant \u2019s health and the treatment to which he was being subjected with the following assessment :", "\u201c In DATE of professional experience as a surgeon , I have never encountered such inhuman , demoralizing and humiliating treatment of [ a disabled person ] bound to a wheelchair . A paraplegic patient has the same life expectancy as a [ non - disabled ] person , provided the measures described above are followed . Based on the documents presented to me , I have no reason to assume that this is the case .", "Given the circumstances described here , one may expect the patient to experience severe and agonizing pain . Due to the non - existent medical care , one may anticipate severe complications or his demise . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr W. amended his expert opinion . Having again listed all the illnesses with which the applicant had been diagnosed by the NORP prison authorities , PERSON stated as follows :", "\u201c From the medical view it is absolutely insignificant if one or more of those diseases are not in the list of serious diseases preventing the holding in custody of suspects or accused of the commission of crimes .", "On the other hand , it is proved in international medical literature that the combination of all these serious diseases causes an enormous life threatening situation for [ the applicant ] . The patient is really very critically ill . \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , relying on the ORG \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE , on DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers asked the investigators in the case to provide the applicant with an opportunity to be examined in person by a number of medical experts from various civilian hospitals , including those who had prepared the reports assessing the ORG opinions of CARDINAL July and CARDINAL DATE . The lawyers insisted that the named specialists had agreed to provide their expert opinion in response to the CARDINAL questions put by ORG before ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyers received a letter from the senior investigator \u201c fully refusing \u201d their request . Having pointed out that the applicant had already been examined twice by doctors from hospital no . CARDINAL , a civilian hospital , and that the doctors had concluded that the applicant was not suffering from an illness included in the list of serious illnesses precluding detention pending trial , the senior investigator dismissed the request .", "CARDINAL . The lawyers sent a similar request to the director of the applicant \u2019s detention facility . The director responded that he did not \u201c in principle \u201d object to such an examination by medical experts , but that the decision authorising the examination could only be taken by the investigator .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was again sent for an examination to hospital no . CARDINAL , where the CARDINAL doctors confirmed their previous findings of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . The new report issued on DATE was very similar .", "CARDINAL . The lawyers also submitted to the ORG a large number of certificates issued by the administration of the detention facility showing that the applicant \u2019s DATE needs in terms of medicines and medical materials , including catheters , were covered by his relatives . The director of the detention facility also confirmed that fact in his letter of DATE .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant was transferred to temporary detention facility no . CARDINAL in PERSON - on - Don . A prison doctor attending on the applicant in that facility issued a record listing a number of visits to the applicant by various medical specialists and registering the applicant \u2019s mounting complaints . In the same record she stated that while the applicant remained under permanent medical supervision and was subjected to regular clinical examinations , with his condition , due to those procedures , being satisfactory , any of his illnesses at any time could lead to a significant deterioration in his health and become acute or chronic , with an unpredictable prognosis for his life expectancy ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "34"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
