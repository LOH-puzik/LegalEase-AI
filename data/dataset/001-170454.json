The applicant is a former rally driver who won several national titles and was still actively competing at the time of the events in the case . His company runs a car repair shop which is also authorised to remodel cars intended to be used for competition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP mesto ORG , at the request of the police , issued a warrant to search the applicant \u2019s premises on the basis of a suspicion that he had exchanged the chassis numbers of CARDINAL cars in order to be able to register the second one , bought in GPE , and smuggle it through the State border without paying customs duties . He was also suspected of the criminal offences of forgery , certifying false documents as genuine and smuggling . The search warrant included an authorisation for the seizure of items subject to the warrant . On DATE the police conducted a search of the applicant \u2019s car repair shop and seized a ORG racing car , the car \u2019s registration papers and other documents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested the return of the car several times because he needed it for future competitions from which he could not withdraw owing to contractual obligations towards his sponsors . He also insisted that he had not committed any of the offences he was suspected of .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Novo mesto ORG lodged a request for a criminal investigation against the applicant in respect of the above - mentioned offences ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) . On DATE the Novo mesto ORG approved the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant paid CARDINAL ( ORG ) to lease another racing car , a ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL kit car , for DATE .

On DATE the Novo mesto ORG dropped the prosecution ( odstopil od pregona ) of the smuggling charge and consequently , on DATE , the Novo mesto ORG discontinued the criminal investigation of that crime . It referred the proceedings related to forgery and the certification of false documents as true to ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE customs offences proceedings were instituted against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a seizure order in respect of the same car on suspicion that the applicant had in DATE avoided paying duties when importing the car into GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the car was transferred from the Novo mesto ORG to the customs authorities .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date the applicant lodged a request for an assessment of customs duties under the regular customs proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a declaratory note ( ugotovitveni zapisnik ) , finding that according to information from the police the applicant had bought a ORG TIME DATE and had registered it in GPE . The car \u2019s number plates and the metallic plate with the chassis number had then been put on the ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL kit car . That car had been brought onto the territory of GPE without any customs duty being paid for it . The note also stated that the duties arose because the applicant had imported the car without paying the duties required by law . As it could not determine the date the debt had been incurred , it based its findings on the regulations in place on DATE , when ORG had found that custom duties for the car had not been paid . It calculated the amount on the basis of documents submitted by the applicant . In the note , the market value of the vehicle was set at ORG CARDINAL . The customs duties , LOC and vehicle tax were CARDINAL NORP tolars ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision on the amount of customs duties to be paid by the applicant was issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant paid the customs duties and the car was returned to him .

He later withdrew it because the civil proceedings had been reopened ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the search warrant of DATE had not complied with section CARDINAL of LAW because it had lacked evidence of reasonable grounds for suspicion ( utemeljeni sum ) . In particular , basic data such as from whom , when and where the information used as evidence had been collected , was missing . That meant the seizure order had been issued and the car seized on the basis of an unlawful warrant . The court , basing its decision on the exclusionary rule , ordered that all the evidence collected on the basis of the unlawful seizure , including the reports and testimony of experts , should be excluded from the file .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE ORG withdrew the charges against the applicant . On DATE ORG dismissed the charges of forgery and the certification of false documents .", "CARDINAL . Following the dismissal of the charges by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant on CARDINAL DATE applied to reopen the civil proceedings . He alleged that the decisions on the unlawfulness of the search warrant and the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings had to be considered as new evidence which could influence the outcome of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application to reopen the proceedings . After a successful appeal , the proceedings were reopened on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant on DATE withdrew his appeal on points of law after the reopening of the civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the reopened proceedings the parties submitted the following arguments . The representative of the ORG argued , inter alia , that the customs duties on the car in question had not been paid and that therefore it could not have been used any way . Once the applicant had paid the duties his debt had been cleared and the car had been able to enter the domestic market . They also argued that the customs proceedings had not taken an unduly long time as they had lasted only from DATE to DATE . The applicant argued , inter alia , that the order which had led to the seizure of the car had been unlawful and that it therefore gave rise to a liability on the part of the ORG for any damage resulting from it . He also submitted that ORG seizure order had been issued only on DATE and was thus irrelevant to the question of liability for damage . The applicant also noted that he had not been found guilty in any of the proceedings and had not done anything wrong . He stated that the car that had been seized had been remodelled in his own repair shop and that he had not yet finished the remodelling or necessary paperwork by the time of the seizure . Such a process included obtaining new approval papers and the registration of the vehicle as a special vehicle . He pointed out that he had finished that process and obtained all the necessary documents once the car had been returned to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim , which it examined under LAW and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The ORG found that there was no dispute about the fact that the car had been seized in criminal proceedings . The court noted that it was not bound by the findings of the criminal court that the seizure had been unlawful , but , basing its conclusion on its own assessment , it concluded that the seizure had been ordered on the basis of gossip and newspaper article and that all the other information relating to the alleged offences had been obtained on the basis of the unwarranted seizure . The search warrant had been general and lacking in precision and therefore could not be subjected to any scrutiny . On the basis of such considerations it found that the seizure had not complied with the requirements set out in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and had therefore been unlawful . However , the court found that the causal link between the unlawful seizure and the damage incurred by the applicant had been broken because the applicant would in any event have been unable to use the car for several reasons . Firstly , the applicant , as a professional driver and owner of the repair shop , should have known that any remodelling of the car required a new technical inspection and registration , which the applicant had not done before the seizure . Secondly , no customs duties had been paid on parts that had been imported and then used in the car . The seized car , which had thus not been properly registered or imported in compliance with customs regulations , could not have been used in traffic and the applicant could not have raced with it . The applicant was ordered to pay the opposing party \u2019s costs of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal . He argued that he had not been given the opportunity to be heard in respect of the alleged break in the causal link . He noted that , in any case , the car had been seized while it had still been in the process of remodelling and that he had intended to register it at the end of the process . He had only been able to complete that process later , after the car had been returned to him . He also referred to the fact that subsequently he had not encountered any problems in obtaining the necessary certificates in order to register the car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that the applicant had never claimed or proved that the car parts had been imported in accordance with customs regulations . ORG had been right in holding that the applicant would not have been able to use the car owing to the illegal importation of the car parts and the incorrect registration procedure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( revizija ) , challenging the conclusions of the court in respect of the break in the causal link and arguing that the loss had already been incurred before the issue of customs duties had arose . He further argued that no customs offence decision had been issued against him and that a car that was not registered for use in normal traffic could still be used in competitions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , confirming that the link in causality had been broken because the applicant had imported some of the car parts in violation of customs regulations .", "CARDINAL . In the above proceedings before ORG , ORG and ORG , the applicant paid ORG CARDINAL in total for court fees .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal , arguing that the seizure of his car had been unlawful and that he had therefore been unable to use the car for racing . He argued that by virtue of the courts\u2019 decisions , in particular their position on the causal link , his human rights , including his right to compensation under LAW , and the principle of the rule of law had been violated . The constitutional appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE by reference to the second paragraph of section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
