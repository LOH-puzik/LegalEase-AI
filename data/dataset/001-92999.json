The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legal system of the former GPE ( SFRY ) distinguished CARDINAL types of ownership : private ownership ( privatno vlasni\u0161tvo ) and social ownership ( dru\u0161tveno vlasni\u0161tvo ) . While owners of property in private ownership were private individuals ( natural persons ) and some private legal entities called \u201c civil legal entities \u201d ( gra\u0111anske pravne osobe ) such as foundations , associations and religious communities , property in social ownership , according to the official doctrine , had no owner . Nevertheless , the federal ORG , the constituent Republics , municipalities being local government units and other various legal entities called \u201c social legal entities \u201d ( dru\u0161tvene pravne osobe ) , among which the most important ones were companies , known at the time as \u201c organisations of associated labour \u201d ( organizacije udru\u017eenog rada ) and later on as \u201c socially owned companies \u201d ( dru\u0161tvena poduze\u0107a ) , were during the socialist period given certain quasi - ownership rights over property in social ownership , such as the right to use it ( pravo DATE ) , the right to administer it ( pravo upravljanja ) or the right to dispose of it ( pravo raspolaganja ) . Private individuals could also acquire certain rights over property in social ownership . Notably , many individuals living in socially owned flats had specially protected tenancies ( stanarsko pravo ) in respect of those flats .", "CARDINAL . The LAW of GPE of DATE ( ORG , ORG , no . DATE with subsequent amendments ) acknowledged CARDINAL type of ownership : private ownership . Therefore , in order to bring the country \u2019s legal system in conformity with its LAW , in the period DATE ORG adopted several legislative acts with a view to transforming social ownership into private ownership .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , ORG ( Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo , Official Gazette no . CARDINAL with subsequent amendments \u2013 \u201c the Sale to Occupier Act \u201d ) , which entered into force on DATE , enabled the holders of specially protected tenancies to purchase their flats which were in social ownership under favourable conditions and thereby become their owners .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL , with subsequent amendments DATE \u201c LAW \u201d ) , entered into force . By entry into force of these two Acts the transformation of social ownership into private ownership was largely completed .", "CARDINAL . The DATE LAW provided that by its entry into force the holders of the rights to use , administer and dispose of socially owned property ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were to become the owners of that property . As regards , in particular , commercial companies created through transformation of socially owned companies pursuant to ORG , the DATE LAW provided that those companies were already from the moment of their transformation to be considered the owners of socially owned property in respect of which they previously held the rights to use , administer and dispose of it ( see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of DATE LAW in paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Denationalisation Act provided that in respect of certain property that had been through nationalisation or confiscation appropriated from its former owners during socialism and transferred into social ownership there was to be restitution in kind . It thereby enabled some former owners or their heirs to obtain ownership of such property which had until then been socially owned property .", "CARDINAL . The legislation of the former SFRY , in particular section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , prohibited the acquisition of ownership of socially owned property by adverse possession ( dosjelost ) .", "CARDINAL . When incorporating the DATE LAW into the NORP legal system on DATE , ORG repealed that provision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the new LAW of DATE provided in section CARDINAL ) that the period prior to CARDINAL DATE was to be included in calculating the period for acquisition of ownership by adverse possession of socially owned immovable property ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Following several petitions for constitutional review ( prijedlog za ocjenu ustavnosti ) submitted by the former owners of property that had been appropriated during socialism , on DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) accepted the initiative , and decided to institute proceedings to review the constitutionality of section CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ( decision FAC .

CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of the [ DATE LAW ] are hereby abrogated .", "II .", "...", "Reasons", "I.", "The petitioners consider that the impugned provision tends to favour various users of property , who used it without any title , by enabling them to acquire ownership at the expense of [ former ] owners from whom it was taken during Communism ...

That provision was repealed by LAW on the Incorporation of the [ DATE LAW ] ( ... ) , as a result of which all immovable property which had been in social ownership before the adoption of the [ new DATE ] LAW , regardless of its status in the transitional period , came under the general regime also as regards [ the acquisition of ownership by ] adverse possession .", "Since , in the court \u2019s view , repealing in the particular case amounts only to abrogation ex nunc [ ukidanje ] and not to annulment ex tunc [ poni\u0161tavanje ] , it has to be concluded that the period of possession of the socially owned property before DATE ( DATE of entry into force of the Act on the Incorporation of the [ DATE LAW ] ) can not be taken into account for the purposes of acquiring ownership by adverse possession ...", "Namely , the possessors of the property , in respect of which the acquisition of ownership by adverse possession was expressly excluded by law , were aware that this property was not susceptible to [ acquisition of ownership by ] adverse possession , which was also known to the holders of [ various ] rights over the same property ( the right to administer , use and dispose of it ) , who therefore did not [ have to ] use relevant remedies against the risk of losing the property on account of its acquisition by its possessors through adverse possession . Therefore , in the application of the impugned provision it may happen that holders of certain property rights lose these rights , which the LAW allows only exceptionally and with compensation .", "What is more , the impugned provision makes possible the acquisition of ownership of certain property even before the time - limits for acquisition by adverse possession started to run , while [ at the same time ] the time - limits for acquisition by adverse possession of many types of former socially owned property are actually being extended ( the property owned by GPE , counties and units of local self - government ... ) .", "[ For these reasons ] , the court finds that the impugned provision is not , in the substantive sense [ substantive unconstitutionality ] , in conformity with the highest values [ of the constitutional order ] of equality , inviolability of property and the rule of law enshrined in LAW , and the guarantee of property enshrined in LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW .", "Furthermore , the court concludes that the impugned provision has retroactive effects , for which reason it is not in conformity with the provision of LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW either .", "...", "... , [ T]he court finds that while determining the retroactive effects of the said provision of section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of the [ DATE LAW ] , the procedure prescribed by LAW was not observed .", "For the court , when [ in the legislative process ] the legislator breaches its self - prescribed rules of procedure .... ... the legislative act adopted in such improper way , is not in accordance with ... the [ principle of the ] rule of law enshrined in LAW .", "This further means that ... the impugned provision ... is not even in the formal sense [ formal unconstitutionality ] in compliance with LAW .", "CARDINAL .
