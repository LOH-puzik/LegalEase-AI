FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG ( kuntien el\u00e4kelautakunta , kommunernas pensionsn\u00e4mnd ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for a disability pension from DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) quashed the decision and remitted the case for fresh examination .", "On DATE ORG ( kuntien el\u00e4kevakuutus , kommunernas pensionsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring ) issued a new decision granting the applicant a disability pension from DATE based on her inability to work since DATE , i.e. it did not grant her a pension for the period DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( vakuutusoikeus , f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ) , which upheld the decision on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant applied again for a disability pension from DATE to DATE . On DATE ORG upheld its previous provisional decision of DATE , according to which the applicant was granted a disability pension only from CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG , maintaining that she had been unfit to work from DATE and requesting a disability pension from DATE with interest . She relied on a medical doctor \u2019s statement of CARDINAL DATE ( according to which she had been unfit to work from DATE ) and an ORG - report of DATE . ORG submitted its observations and the applicant submitted her observations in reply . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , maintaining that the applicant \u2019s working capacity prior to DATE had not been reduced to an extent entitling her to a disability pension .", "The applicant appealed further to ORG , repeating her contention about the date of her inability to work and appending , inter alia , a medical doctor \u2019s statement of DATE ( in which she was regarded as unfit to work from DATE , and which , inter alia , described her finger problems ) . ORG submitted its observations and the applicant submitted her observations in reply . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c The reasons are mentioned in ORG decision . The presented evidence doest not warrant a different conclusion as regards the assessment of [ the applicant \u2019s ] capacity for work . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant applied again for a disability pension from DATE maintaining her unfitness to work from CARDINAL DATE . She appended a medical doctor \u2019s report of DATE . On DATE ORG , having examined the application in the light of the fresh medical report , dismissed it , maintaining that there was no new evidence which justified any different conclusion as regards the date of her incapacity to work .", "The applicant appealed to ORG , repeating her previous requests and claiming interest , reimbursement of her appeal costs and an oral hearing and also relying on LAW . She identified herself and CARDINAL medical doctors ( PERSON and PERSON , or alternatively PERSON ) as witnesses and specified the topics for their proposed testimony . She relied on CARDINAL medical ORG statements of DATE and DATE respectively , a copy of a scientific article and CARDINAL copies of a doctoral thesis . ORG submitted its observations and the applicant submitted her observations in reply . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It held :", "\u201c On DATE ORG found that your working capacity has been reduced to an extent entitling you to a disability pension from DATE . Based on the newly presented medical evidence your disability to work can not be regarded as having begun earlier than CARDINAL DATE . Your request for a disability pension from DATE with interest has consequently been dismissed .", "As regards an oral hearing , ORG finds , based on the presented medical and other evidence , that it is not necessary to hold one . \u201d", "The applicant appealed further to ORG claiming a disability pension from DATE with interest , reimbursement of her appeal costs and an oral hearing . She complained that ORG had taken into account the medical doctor \u2019s statement of DATE although she had expressly stated in her observations in reply that she would not submit the statement in question . She complained that ORG had apparently invited the statement of its own motion and that she had not been given an opportunity to present her observations on that statement . She also complained about the allegedly inadequate reasoning of ORG , in particular as regarded the problem with her fingers , so - called limited joint mobility . She further pointed out that there had been a typing error as regards the date of her disability to work . She proposed herself and CARDINAL medical doctors ( PERSON and PERSON ) as witnesses for an oral hearing and specified that she would testify about her illnesses and inability to work from DATE or DATE and the effect of her finger problems on her working capacity , and that the doctors were to be heard concerning the date of the applicant \u2019s incapacity to work and , in particular , the effects of her finger problems .", "ORG received medical ORG statements of DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . ORG submitted its observations and the applicant submitted her observations in reply . On DATE the court dismissed the appeal without an oral hearing . It reasoned , inter alia :", "\u201c Based on the available documents , [ the medical doctor \u2019s ] statement of DATE arrived at ORG from ORG on DATE together with the applicant \u2019s appeal . Consequently , ORG did not invite the statement in question and has therefore not acted erroneously as claimed by the applicant . \u201d", "As regards the requested oral hearing it reasoned :", "\u201c ... Proceedings before ORG are normally in writing . ORG must hold an oral hearing if requested by a private party . A case may however be examined without an oral hearing if ... it is manifestly unnecessary due to the nature of the matter or other reasons . If a party requests an oral hearing he or she must indicate the reasons why it would be necessary and what kind of evidence he or she would present at the hearing . The lack of necessity for an oral hearing is assessed on the basis of these grounds and a hearing may be dispensed with if it is highly likely that it would not be useful . An oral hearing concerning subjective medical hardships is usually unnecessary provided that there is proper and adequate written medical evidence at hand .", "The case concerns the question whether [ the applicant ] was ... unfit to work before DATE . The same issue has been examined in written proceedings before . ORG finds that [ the applicant \u2019s ] subjective views have already been adequately established in the prior examinations , and that hearing her for this reason is therefore unnecessary , taking into account in particular the lapse of time .", "It appears from the documents that ... PERSON has personally attended to [ the applicant ] from DATE . ... L. met [ the applicant ] for the first time on DATE . The heading of L. \u2019s medical statement of CARDINAL DATE reads : \u2018 A specialist \u2019s statement and summary for ORG , based on documents and CARDINAL meeting with the patient.\u2019 Both medical ORG opinions are therefore based on what [ the applicant ] had told them and on an assessment of documents , which means that they can not give a valuation based on their personal examination about the applicant \u2019s state of health at the relevant time . ORG has apparently had at its disposal similar documentary evidence as they did . In these circumstances written evidence is regarded as sufficient . There is a medical doctor in the composition of ORG , which guarantees sufficient expertise on medical questions .", "ORG finds that the hearing of PERSON and L. about their conclusions concerning [ the applicant \u2019s ] working capacity based on written material is unnecessary , taking into account the ORG composition and the fact that their observations are apparent from their written statements . ... \u201d", "As regards the subject - matter of the appeal , the court held :", "\u201c The reasons are mentioned in ORG decision . ORG however corrects the date of CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE . The presented new evidence does not give rise to different conclusions about the applicant \u2019s working capacity . In addition , ORG notes the following : In the previous proceedings in the matter , which have taken place closer in time to the disputed events , the alleged finger problem has not been raised in the pension applications , appeals or other documents , and its importance to the applicant \u2019s working capacity has not been identified as significant in the previous medical ORG statements . The newly presented evidence ... does not warrant a conclusion that the applicant was unfit to work during the time mentioned in the application either . \u201d", "At the time of the first CARDINAL sets of proceedings the procedure in ORG and ORG was written . When there were exceptional reasons , the court could however decide to hold an oral hearing . As to the third set of proceedings , ORG and ORG were under a Convention obligation to hold a public hearing . If not otherwise provided by an LAW , the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act ( hallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen ; Act no . ORG ) applies to proceedings before ORG and ORG . They must hold an oral hearing when necessary for the purposes of establishing the facts of the case . The parties , witnesses and experts may be heard and other evidence received in an oral hearing . ORG must hold an oral hearing if a private party so requests , unless a hearing is manifestly unnecessary in view of the nature of the matter or for another reason ( sections CARDINAL and DATE ) .", "The compositions of ORG and ORG include a medical doctor in cases where medical assessment is necessary ( section CARDINAL of the then ORG ( kunnallisten viranhaltijain ja ty\u00f6ntekij\u00e4in el\u00e4kelaki , lagen om pension f\u00f6r kommunala tj\u00e4nsteinnehavare och arbetstagare ) and section CARDINAL of the then LAW ) .", "Everyone is entitled to have his or her case examined before a public authority without undue delay ( section CARDINAL of LAW ( perustuslaki , grundlag ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . A decision must be reasoned ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag ; GPE ) . At the relevant time LAW , LAW ( PERSON ) of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) provided that a judgment must be reasoned , indicating the facts and the legal argumentation on which it was based and the grounds which have led the court to hold a disputed issue established or unsubstantiated ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
