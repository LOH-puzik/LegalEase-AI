The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the town of GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG regional police stopped a car . During an inspection of the car , the police discovered a large quantity of aviation fuel . As the driver was unable to produce a certificate for the fuel he was transporting , the police ( officer S ) seized QUANTITY of fuel . The police entrusted it for safe keeping to a Belogorsk technical college and later to military unit no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . As the fuel allegedly belonged to a private company ORG ( the \u201c company \u201d ) , officer S required the company director , ORG , to produce a document confirming that the fuel had been acquired lawfully . Mr P submitted an invoice dated DATE . Criminal proceedings were , however , instituted against Mr P on suspicion of forgery of this invoice . The NORP town prosecutor subsequently discontinued the proceedings on the ground that only the forgery of official documents was punishable under LAW . No decision was taken regarding the fate of the fuel .", "CARDINAL . As can be seen from the domestic ORG findings ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , in the meantime , officer S decided not to institute any criminal proceedings in relation to the seized fuel . However , on DATE the PERSON deputy prosecutor set aside this decision and ordered an additional inquiry . There is no indication that this inquiry led to any prosecution or that any decision was taken in relation to the seized fuel .", "CARDINAL . The company thus attempted to regain possession of its fuel . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON deputy prosecutor informed the company that the fuel had not been attached to the criminal case file against Mr P as evidence and thus no decision had to be taken . He invited Mr P to collect the fuel through the police department . On an unspecified date , however , the company learnt from the LOC police department that the fuel had been stolen when it had been stored in the military unit .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the national authorities endeavoured to identify the officials responsible for the loss of the fuel . Criminal proceedings were instituted against officer S for abuse of power , as well as against the commander of the military unit and officer PERSON , who had allegedly misappropriated the fuel in the military unit . On DATE the Belogorsk town military prosecutor discontinued the proceedings against officer GPE and the head of the military unit because there was no indication of a criminal offence . On DATE the proceedings against officer S were discontinued because his participation in the disappearance of the fuel had not been proven .", "CARDINAL . It does not appear that any criminal or other investigation continued thereafter in relation to the seized but missing fuel . No further claim was lodged in respect of it by the company or any other person or legal entity . Nor does it appear that the company made any attempts to obtain compensation after CARDINAL DATE ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Instead , the company chose to assign the related claims to the applicant ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the company transferred title to the seized fuel to the applicant . On DATE the parties amended the assignment agreement , indicating that the assignment included a claim in respect of any damage or loss caused by the authorities on account of the seizure of the fuel , as well as a claim for compensation in respect of unjustified enrichment on the same account and a claim for return of the fuel . The amended agreement also stated that the signing of that agreement \u201c annulled the company \u2019s debt of MONEY under a contract dated DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The company informed the regional police department of the transfer of title . Since DATE the applicant has unsuccessfully requested the police department to return the fuel .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant sued the ORG , claiming compensation for the damage incurred as a result of the seizure and loss of the fuel . ORG of the LOC designated ORG as the proper respondent , with the applicant \u2019s consent . The court also gave the regional police department , the military unit and the company leave to intervene as third parties in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . The court held as follows :", "\u201c Under an assignment agreement of DATE the ORG company transferred all its rights to the fuel to [ the applicant] ... The assignment did not contravene Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG ... The fuel had been seized in relation to the accusation of forgery against Mr P ...", "[ T]he criminal prosecution against officer PERSON was discontinued ... The fuel was misappropriated by officer PERSON , against whom proceedings were discontinued on DATE ...", "[ T]he responsibility of an officer of ORG for unlawful seizure of the company \u2019s fuel must be established by a final judgment in a criminal case . The commercial court , under LAW , does not have the right to assess the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the actions ( failure to act ) of the investigating authorities and the prosecutor \u2019s office .", "The plaintiff did not submit any evidence showing that the seizure of the fuel by the officer of the ORG regional police department had been declared unlawful by a court and that [ the officer ] was responsible for the loss of the fuel .", "The action must be dismissed because there was no fault on the part of the person who allegedly caused the damage . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed contending that the absence of a criminal conviction in respect of the officer had been irrelevant and that the respondent and the military unit had entered into a contract for storage of the fuel seized from the company . On DATE ORG of the Amur Region upheld the judgment of DATE . The court stated inter alia as follows :", "\u201c Officer PERSON acted lawfully when he inspected and seized the fuel ... Having verified whether the fuel had been lawfully acquired , officer S decided not to bring criminal proceedings ; on DATE the PERSON deputy prosecutor set aside this decision and ordered an additional inquiry ...", "Officer PERSON \u2019s failure to observe the procedure for inspection and transfer of the fuel for safe - keeping purposes has no direct causal link with the loss of the fuel ... \u201d", "Lastly , the appeal court made the following observations in relation to the military unit :", "\u201c Military unit no . DATE received the seized fuel for storage ... in accordance with LAW . Under LAW of GPE the military unit became civilly liable vis - \u00e0 - vis the plaintiff for the safe keeping of the fuel . Under LAW of GPE , in the event of the loss of the fuel [ the military unit ] had to compensate the plaintiff for the resulting damage , unless otherwise provided by the law . \u201d", "The appeal judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG , sitting as a cassation - instance court , upheld the judgments of DATE and DATE . The court noted that the seizure of the fuel had been due to the absence , at the time , of any document confirming the company \u2019s title to it . The court held that the plaintiff had not proved that the investigator had been responsible for the damage caused .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant brought proceedings in the NORP ORG of the Amur Region against , inter alia , the military unit . He claimed that the authorities\u2019 failure to return the fuel or to pay compensation be declared unlawful .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . The court held that the fuel seizure had been carried out by officer S before any criminal proceedings had been initiated because of the need to conduct urgent investigative measures , namely a crime - scene inspection , in compliance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG also held as follows :", "\u201c As established in the judgment of the commercial court , during the seizure of the fuel the OPIUMIK company had not supplied any document to confirm the lawfulness of its acquisition . Later PERSON P submitted a forged invoice , which gave rise to criminal proceedings against him . An agreement dated DATE between the ORG company and a Mr G for the purchase of QUANTITY of fuel was produced before this court . It can not be accepted as a proof of the lawfulness of the fuel acquisition because the content of that agreement does not correspond to the materials in the criminal case which had been discontinued . Nor does it correspond to Mr P \u2019s deposition in the criminal proceedings , to the invoice or the expert report no . DATE which stated that the handwritten inscriptions in invoice no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE had been done by PERSON rejects as unfounded Mr P \u2019s allegation that the documents in the criminal file and his deposition had been obtained under duress . Besides , the ORG considers that Mr P \u2019s and [ the applicant \u2019s ] arguments are intended to challenge the circumstances already determined by the final judgment of the commercial court , in particular as regards the lawfulness of the fuel acquisition by the company ... The ORG concludes that no evidence has been adduced to confirm [ it ] . The ORG does not accept [ the applicant \u2019s ] argument that the commercial court had confirmed the lawfulness of the fuel acquisition ; such matter had not been contested before the commercial court ...", "The grounds for compensation in respect of damage caused by the investigating authorities , including a claim for restitution of the fuel , are regulated by Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . Those grounds were also examined by the commercial courts and can not be subject to a re - examination in the present case . No legal relationship ( \u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f ) was established between [ the applicant ] on the one hand and the military unit , ORG or ORG on the other . Hence , his claims ... should be rejected . \u201d", "Lastly , the court found that the applicant had missed the statutory time - limit under LAW for bringing the matter before the courts of general jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the judgment . The court considered that the commercial court \u2019s judgment of DATE had dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims , inter alia , due to his failure to produce evidence confirming the lawfulness of the fuel acquisition . Neither was the civil court provided with any proof that the company had had title to the fuel .", "CARDINAL . A commercial court issued a private company with an enforcement order for a sum of money against a ORG - owned enterprise . The company did not submit the writ within the statutory time - limit and bailiffs refused to enforce the judgment . The company assigned the claim to the applicant , who then requested the commercial court to designate him as creditor in respect of the above judicial award and to restore the time - limit for lodging the enforcement order . In DATE the commercial court rejected both requests . The applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant also requested a court of general jurisdiction to designate him as creditor in respect of the assigned award and to award him compensation for the damage sustained . On DATE ORG , at final instance , disallowed the first claim because it had already been determined on DATE by the final decision of the commercial court . On DATE ORG , at final instance , dismissed the claim for damages on the ground that the applicant \u2019s title had never been confirmed by a court .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL of the Code required the person or entity making an assignment to supply the new creditor with the documents certifying the assignor \u2019s claims . On DATE ORG of GPE issued an information note summarising the existing case - law on various aspects of the interpretation and application of the provisions of LAW on the assignment of claims and liabilities . In particular , it noted that the invalidity or invalidation of the claim assigned did not imply the invalidity of the assignment agreement . At the same time , it noted that the former gave the assignee the right to sue the assignor under LAW . Nor did LAW prevent the assignment of a future claim or one that was still non - existent when an assignment agreement was signed . ORG also noted that the assignor \u2019s failure to provide the assignee with documents certifying the former \u2019s entitlement or claim did not mean that the entitlement or claim had not been conferred on the assignee .", "CARDINAL .
