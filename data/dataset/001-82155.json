They were represented before the ORG by Mr J .- C. Cavaille , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant cooperatives , may be summarised as follows .", "DATE the first applicant , PERSON , was the subject of an inspection by ORG ( ORG ) aimed in particular at checking that its activities complied with ORG of DATE and DATE and DATE of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant law \u201d below ) .", "In CARDINAL letters of DATE , the first applicant was informed that , following the inspection , it had come to light that the milk production quotas for DATE had been exceeded . The letters informed the applicant that it was required to pay ORG the sums of MONEY ( ORG ) , ORG and ORG ORG , corresponding to each of DATE covered by the inspection .", "By CARDINAL enforceable orders dated DATE , the Director of ORG served notice on Coop\u00e9rative des agriculteurs PERSON , requiring it to pay the above sums to LOC .", "On DATE the cooperative applied to ORG seeking to have the enforceable orders set aside .", "On DATE the cooperative handed over its milk collection operations to another cooperative , ORG laiti\u00e8re ORG ( the second applicant ) .", "On DATE Coop\u00e9rative laiti\u00e8re ORG intervened in the proceedings before ORG and , relying on the same grounds as the first applicant , requested the court to uphold the conclusions set out in the latter \u2019s application .", "On DATE the Director of ORG sent a demand for payment to the first applicant , seeking payment of the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , corresponding to the additional levy for the DATE milk marketing year . On DATE the Director of ORG issued an enforceable order to secure payment of the sum in question .", "Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicants requested ORG to set aside the payment demand of DATE . They subsequently also requested the setting - aside of the enforceable order of DATE .", "In a first judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ruling on the application of CARDINAL DATE seeking to have the enforceable orders of DATE set aside , ORG granted the second applicant \u2019s request to be joined to the proceedings and dismissed the first applicant \u2019s application , in particular on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... The applications ... lodged on behalf of Coop\u00e9rative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne and PERSON laiti\u00e8re ORG raise the same issues and have been the subject of a joint investigation ; they should therefore be joined and dealt with in a single judgment .", "... The judgment in this case ... is likely to be prejudicial to the interests of ORG laiti\u00e8re ORG . Accordingly , [ its ] application to be joined to the proceedings is admissible . ...", "The investigation has shown that ORG , CARDINAL DATE , inspected the accounts for DATE . This inspection revealed deliveries of milk that had not been declared by Coop\u00e9rative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne , which are the subject of the impugned requests for payment . ...", "As to the argument that the basis on which the sums were calculated was not indicated", "In submitting that ORG did not indicate to it the exact amounts by which the quotas had been exceeded , PERSON must be deemed to have claimed that the basis for calculating the amounts to be recovered under the enforceable orders in question was not indicated to it .", "While any enforceable order must indicate the basis on which the amounts payable have been calculated , this requirement does not apply where the person liable has already been informed of the basis for calculation in an earlier document .", "The investigation has shown that , contrary to the assertions of Coop\u00e9rative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne , which was given notice by ORG of the reference quantities allocated to it at the beginning of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE and DATE milk marketing years , the cooperative was informed by this ORG agency in CARDINAL letters dated DATE of the corrections to the basis of assessment arising out of the checks carried out DATE ] and of the resulting additional levies . It follows that PERSON des agriculteurs PERSON Mayenne which , in its capacity as purchaser \u2013 which it can not seriously dispute \u2013 was required to identify the producers whose deliveries were in excess of the quotas , may not validly argue that the basis on which the amounts owing were calculated was not made sufficiently clear .", "As to the argument that the manner in which the cost of the additional levy was to be passed on to producers was not set out in a prefectoral order", "Contrary to what has been asserted by the applicant cooperative , which does not rely on any specific text , it is not stated in any legislative or regulatory provision , or elsewhere , that the manner in which the cost of the additional levy is to be passed on to producers should be set down in a prefectoral order . Accordingly , this argument must be rejected .", "As to the argument alleging unequal treatment between producers", "While the provisions of the decree of CARDINAL DATE , reiterated in the decree of CARDINAL [ DATE , make the levies payable by producers partly subject to the situation of the purchaser whom they supply , the difference which may result is inherent in the mechanism of \u201c Formula B \u201d , as defined in LAW ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Accordingly , the ORG must reject the argument that the impugned enforceable orders , which arose out of the imposition of additional levies triggered by the high level of deliveries , applied rules that were discriminatory .", "As to the argument that the ORG objectives were not complied with", "The applicant cooperative submits that the enforceable orders in question did not comply with the objective of curbing the increase in milk production laid down in the ORG rules , on the grounds that the corrections were made late , after DATE in question , and that the enforceable orders did not make it possible to determine how the levies were to be allocated subsequently .", "In confining itself to these criticisms DATE which , moreover , are shown by the foregoing to be unfounded \u2013 Coop\u00e9rative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne has failed to provide any evidence to demonstrate that the enforceable orders were contrary to Community objectives , as it alleges . Accordingly , the ORG must reject this argument also . ... \u201d", "In a second judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the application lodged on DATE , in particular on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... the applications ... challenge CARDINAL measures taken in the same set of recovery proceedings instituted by ORG against the first cooperative ... and were the subject of a single investigation . They should therefore be joined and dealt with in a single judgment ...", "As to the argument that the basis on which the amounts were calculated was not indicated", "... It is clear from the investigation that the demand for payment in question referred expressly to the provisions of Regulation ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products , cited above , which provides the legal basis for the impugned levies . In addition , the demand for payment presented in sufficient detail the figures for excess production observed at DATE CARDINAL milk marketing year and arising out of the inspection conducted in DATE , and the means of calculating the amounts in question , thus enabling the person liable to assess the validity of the claim and the amount thereof . It follows that there is no foundation for the assertion made by PERSON , whose capacity as purchaser \u2013 which it can not seriously dispute \u2013 required it to identify those producers whose deliveries exceeded the quotas , and by PERSON [ laiti\u00e8re ] ORG , to the effect that the basis on which the amounts to be recovered were calculated was not made sufficiently clear .", "Furthermore , while any enforceable order must indicate the basis on which the amounts payable have been calculated , this requirement does not apply where the person liable has already been informed of the basis for calculation in an earlier document .", "The investigation showed that the enforceable order at issue had been preceded by the above - mentioned demand for payment , which gave details both of the legislation forming the legal basis for the claim and the elements used to calculate it . Accordingly , the requirement referred to above must be regarded as having been fulfilled in the present case ...", "As to the argument that the manner in which the cost of the additional levy was to be passed on to producers was not laid down in a prefectoral order", "Contrary to what has been asserted by the applicant cooperatives , which do not rely on any specific text , it is not stated in any legislative or regulatory provision , or elsewhere , that the manner in which the cost of the additional levy is to be passed on to producers should be set down in a prefectoral order . Accordingly , this argument must be rejected . ... \u201d", "On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal against the CARDINAL judgments of ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the ORG appeal against the first judgment , in particular on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... having regard to the requirement for ORG , pursuant to the ORG rules and Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , to seek payment of the additional levy owed by purchasers , the decisions in accordance with which ORG imposes the levy on purchasers can not be regarded as unfavourable individual administrative decisions for which reasons must be given pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE , cited above ...", "As stated above , Coop\u00e9rative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne was in a position to challenge all the elements in the correction carried out . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG sent it a copy of the findings of the on - site inspection conducted lawfully in DATE by officials of ORG [ ... ] on the basis of Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE and LAW of CARDINAL DATE , cited above , and gave it DATE to reply . The cooperative was able throughout the proceedings to submit its observations , which were taken into account in order to reduce the correction . Hence , the cooperative in question has no basis for arguing a violation of the adversarial principle or of its defence rights . There was no provision of ORG or domestic law , or any general legal principle , requiring the cooperative to be informed of its right to be assisted by a lawyer . Nor is there any foundation for the ORG allegation of a violation of LAW , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , as these provisions do not lay down any rule or principle whose scope extends beyond proceedings before the courts to encompass ORG , which is not a court for the purposes of those provisions ...", "LAW ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as amended by the abovementioned Regulation No CARDINAL/CARDINAL , states that under PERSON , which GPE decided to apply , the additional levy is payable by purchasers of milk and that \u2018 the purchaser liable to the levy shall pass on the burden in the price paid to those producers who have increased their deliveries , in proportion to their contribution to the purchaser \u2019s reference quantity being ORG . However , this provision does not have the effect of requiring member PERSON to introduce a procedure for passing on the cost of the levy under the supervision of the authorities but , on the contrary , states that it is for purchasers to pass on the cost of the levy to the producers . Accordingly , the ground of appeal arguing that the NORP rules are in breach of Regulation No CARDINAL/CARDINAL can not succeed .", "GPE \u2019s decision to opt for Formula B was based on the provisions of LAW ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as amended by Regulation No CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , to which the NORP rules simply gave effect in this regard . Consequently , the grounds of appeal to the effect that those rules are in breach of the principles of equality and proportionality are in any case ineffective .", "... An administrative court , in examining submissions challenging an enforceable order or a collection order as in the present case may , after checking the facts relied upon and their characterisation by the authorities and depending on the outcome , decide to uphold or reduce the amount payable by the person concerned or , where appropriate , to discharge him or her from liability . On the other hand , the provisions concerning the additional levy do not permit the court or the authorities to adjust the rate of the levy . Nor does the need to comply with the provisions of LAW of LAW imply that the court should adjust the amount of the levy . Accordingly , the ground of appeal based on a breach of the right to a fair hearing must fail . ... \u201d", "In a further judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicants against the second judgment , on similar grounds to those outlined above , adding :", "\u201c ... The fact that the order of DATE on arrangements for collection of the additional levy for the CARDINAL milk marketing year came into effect after DATE in question does not mean that it should be regarded as retrospective , in breach of the law , since the levy , which is based on excess production during DATE and the basis and amount of which were laid down by the orders of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE which came into force before DATE , can not be collected until DATE .", "Since ORG ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE applied only from DATE onwards , the ground of appeal to the effect that the decree of CARDINAL DATE on controlling cow \u2019s milk production was in breach of that ORG is ineffective in the context of the present case , which relates to the CARDINAL milk marketing year ... \u201d", "On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law with the ORG d\u2019Etat against the CARDINAL judgments delivered by ORG on DATE . They argued in particular that the levy at issue was in breach of the provisions of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "In a judgment of DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat joined the CARDINAL cases but dismissed the appeal on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... The applications referred to above both relate to the same issue and should therefore be dealt with in a single decision .", "... In addressing the grounds of appeal arguing that the inspection carried out concerning PERSON des agriculteurs de la Mayenne had been unlawful , the court observed that the latter , in accordance with the overall principle of due process , had been in a position to challenge all the elements in the correction notified to it by ORG in its letter of CARDINAL DATE setting out the findings of the on - site inspection conducted lawfully in DATE by officials of ORG , and that it had been able throughout the proceedings to submit its observations , which were taken into account , among other things , in order to reduce the correction . The court dismissed the grounds of appeal alleging that the NORP rules were in breach of the Community rules or contrary to the principles of equality and proportionality . Accordingly , the court addressed adequately those grounds of appeal submitted to it which were not inoperative .", "... An enforceable order must indicate the basis on which the amounts payable have been calculated , even where it is issued by a public agency other than the ORG , for which the requirement is expressly laid down in LAW of the decree of CARDINAL DATE . In accordance with this principle , ORG can not request payment of an additional levy without indicating , either in the order itself or by reference to a document attached to it or previously addressed to the person liable , the basis for and the elements contained in its calculation of the amounts due . ORG satisfied this requirement in the instant case by making reference in the impugned enforceable orders to the letters of DATE to the applicant cooperatives , which the latter do not deny having received and which , in the context of the adversarial procedure which the authorities were obliged to conduct before correcting the declared bases , set out clearly the basis on which the amounts payable had been calculated . Consequently , ORG did not commit any error of law in finding the enforceable orders in question to be lawful . ... \u201d", "\u201c ...", "Whereas the operation and development of the common market in agricultural products must be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy to include in particular a common organisation of agricultural markets which may take various forms depending on the product ;", "...", "Whereas the aim of the common agricultural policy is to attain the objectives set out in LAW ; whereas , in the milk sector , in order to stabilise markets and to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community concerned , it is necessary that the intervention agencies continue to take intervention measures on the market , such measures however to be standardised so as not to impede the free movement of the goods in question within the Community ;", "... \u201d", "\u201c ...", "Whereas the market in milk products in the ORG is suffering from structural surpluses as a result of an imbalance between supply and demand for the products ...", "Whereas a careful examination of the different possible ways of re - establishing balance in the milk sector shows that , despite the administrative difficulties which its implementation may involve , the most effective method , and the one having the least drastic effect on the incomes of producers , is the introduction for an initial period of DATE of an additional levy on quantities of milk delivered beyond a guarantee threshold ;", "...", "Whereas , in view of the diversity of milk production structures in the different regions of the ORG , the administrative problems arising and considerations of regional development policy , the possibility must be provided for of a choice between a formula of a reference quantity per producer and a reference quantity per purchaser ;", "Whereas , where the levy is to be paid by the purchaser , provision should be made for ensuring that the purchaser passes on the burden in the price paid to those producers who have increased their deliveries , in proportion to their contribution to the purchaser \u2019s reference quantity being exceeded ;", "Whereas the purpose of the levy provided for by this ORG is to regulate and stabilise the market in milk and milk products ; whereas revenue from the said levy should therefore be used to finance expenditure in the milk and milk products sector ;", "...", "Regulation ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL is hereby amended as follows : CARDINAL .
