The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s father bought a plot of CARDINAL ha of land in territory which is now part of the city of GPE . The property was nationalised in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant asked the NORP authorities to restore his rights to his father \u2019s land . In DATE the GPE city authorities restored his property rights by conferring on him a right to obtain a plot no bigger than CARDINAL.CARDINAL ha to build an individual house ( individualaus namo statybai ) ; under LAW in force at that time , CARDINAL ha was the maximum area of land returnable in natura within the GPE city boundaries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the authorities transferred into the applicant \u2019s ownership , without any payment , a plot of CARDINAL ha in GPE city to build a house .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the limiting of the return of land in natura , if vacant and consequently of no particular societal value , was in breach of LAW , which protects the right to property .", "CARDINAL . Relying on ORG ruling , on DATE the applicant asked the GPE city authorities to stop distributing or selling the land which he claimed to be that of his father , given that he could now claim a bigger portion of that land . He enclosed land registry maps indicating the CARDINAL ha plot of land that had previously belonged to his father .", "CARDINAL . The GPE city authorities replied on DATE that , taking into account the guidelines set out in ORG ruling , ORG had to be amended as regards the restitution of the land within the city limits . Given that the applicant \u2019s request related to the return of a plot of land in GPE in the actual place where his father had had his land ( perduodant \u017eem\u0117s sklyp\u0105 tur\u0117toje vietoje ) , his request could only be examined after the aforementioned legislation had been amended .", "CARDINAL . Following another unrelated request for restitution , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Vilniaus apskrities vir\u0161ininko administracija ) transferred part of the disputed land , specifically plot no . CARDINAL comprising CARDINAL ha , to ORG to build an individual house . GPE later resold that plot to third parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Law on ORG was amended to the effect that the maximum area of land returnable in GPE city , provided that that land was not ORG redeemable , was CARDINAL ha .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the amended LAW , on DATE the applicant asked the GPE city authorities to return to him the remaining part of the plot , CARDINAL.CARDINAL ha ( that is to say , CARDINAL ha ) , in his father \u2019s land .", "CARDINAL . In their internal correspondence of DATE and DATE the GPE city authorities concluded that the land could not be returned to the applicant in natura because it had been built upon and it also contained a forest of State importance . The land thus had to be bought by the ORG and the applicant was to be compensated by other methods as provided for by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON \u017eem\u0117s tarnyba ) informed the applicant that the land formerly owned by his father was ORG redeemable land . However , having examined the land registry maps of the land owned by the applicant \u2019s father , ORG also noted that only part of that land had been divided into plots for the construction of houses . In that case , the unoccupied land could thus be returned in natura . ORG thus notified the applicant that it had requested the GPE authorities to re - examine the availability of unbuilt land CARDINAL more time .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Seimas ( parliamentary ) Ombudsman , ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and in DATE a prosecutor , found that the transfer of plot no . CARDINAL to GPE by the ORG authorities had been negligent and in breach of the law , because this had been done after ORG ruling of DATE ; it was the applicant who had priority rights to that plot . However , given that the third parties who had acquired plot no . CARDINAL had done so in good faith , the prosecutor ruled that the plot could not be taken away from them and returned to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE county authorities informed the applicant that his father \u2019s land was to be bought by the ORG . The applicant was also informed that he could receive securities to the value of CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) for each hectare of his father \u2019s land as compensation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE , ORG confirmed the above value for CARDINAL ha of land in GPE as had been established by the Methodology set out by the Government ( hereinafter \u2013 \u2018 the LOC ) . It also underlined that in DATE ORG had upheld that Methodology ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . The Methodology set out the average price of the land paid in the course of compulsory purchases by the ORG for the entire territory of a city , taking into account that city \u2019s size and significance . Lastly , the applicant was informed that up to that date PERCENT of persons had been compensated in accordance with the Methodology set out by the Government . Accordingly , it would be against the principle of equality if others , including the applicant , were to be compensated by changing the Methodology .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the authorities to compensate him for CARDINAL ha of land ( that is to say , CARDINAL ha ) by allocating another plot in GPE city to him . Relying on information from ORG , the applicant noted that the indexed value ( indeksuota sklypo vert\u0117 ) of the CARDINAL ha ( plot no . CARDINAL ) sold to ORG was LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . He asserted that the market value of the other plot was even higher . Therefore , it was not fair to conclude that CARDINAL ha of land in GPE city could be compensated by a sum of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The applicant thus asked the authorities to pay him LTL CARDINAL for plot no . CARDINAL and \u201c to quickly return him the remaining CARDINAL ha of land in another place in GPE city or with a decent cash settlement ( gr\u0105\u017einti likusi\u0105 priklausan\u010di\u0105 man CARDINAL ha \u017eem\u0119 kitoje vietoje ORG mieste greitu laiku arba u\u017emok\u0117ti pinigais \u017emogi\u0161k\u0105 kain\u0105 ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to the applicant \u2019s complaint , on DATE the authorities acknowledged that he was \u201c a candidate ( pretendentas ) for restoration of the property rights to CARDINAL ha of his father \u2019s land \u201d . The authorities underlined the applicant \u2019s preference , as expressed in his request , to obtain compensation in money or to obtain another plot of land in GPE [ city ] . Pursuant to the applicable legislation , the authorities asked the applicant to specify how he wished to proceed with the restitution , given that the land his father had once owned in GPE city was to be bought by the ORG and thus the exact same plot could not be returned to him . According to the domestic law as in force at that time , the applicant could either choose to obtain another plot of land in a rural area or pecuniary compensation ( either in securities or by having his liabilities to the ORG annulled ) .", "CARDINAL . In reply to another application by the applicant , on DATE ORG reiterated that it was not possible to return the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s exact same land in GPE city . The applicant was requested to choose another method of compensation provided for in LAW . He was also notified that information about available plots of land in GPE city could be found on the internet site of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , and in reply to another complaint by the applicant , ORG reiterated that he had to choose how he wished to be compensated for the land bought by the ORG , as provided for in LAW . ORG noted the ORG \u2019s conclusion that land had been transferred to ORG in breach of the applicant \u2019s rights , as well as the prosecutor \u2019s conclusion that it was not possible to annul that transfer .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant then started court proceedings , claiming that the ORG should pay him the market value for the CARDINAL ha plot of land , that had been transferred to GPE , which the applicant noted to have an average market value ( vidutin\u0117 rinkos vert\u0117 ) of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) as established in DATE by ORG ( also see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "He also claimed that the ORG should pay market - value compensation for the unreturned CARDINAL ha of land in GPE , which in his view was worth LTL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the claim as unfounded . The court acknowledged that on DATE GPE had been granted a CARDINAL ha plot of land on the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s former holding in contravention of the law , because this was done after ORG ruling of DATE . That being so , the documents in the court \u2019s possession confirmed that the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s land belonged to land destined to be bought by the ORG , because it contained privately owned plots of land with houses or forests of ORG importance as provided for in GPE CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL of the Law on ORG . The court did not specify which part of the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s plot belonged to either of those categories .", "CARDINAL . The first instance court therefore held that the applicant should be compensated for the remaining part of his father \u2019s land according to the Methodology set out by the Government . That methodology had been upheld by ORG in DATE . The domestic law did not provide that the land bought by the ORG should be compensated by paying ORG estimated values .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG fully upheld the lower court \u2019s decision . It observed that both the CARDINAL ha plot and a CARDINAL ha plot were part of land due to be bought by the ORG . Consequently , the applicant was to be compensated for those plots according to the rules set out in ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of the Law on ORG . The latter provision listed the ways the applicant had at his disposal to obtain restitution ; it was up to the applicant which method to choose . The court observed an abundance of documents in the case file which indicated that the applicant wished to be compensated in cash . However , the court stated that the applicant \u2019s position was not entirely concrete and clear . Accordingly , and given the principle of inseparableness of rights and obligations , the applicant had to submit a request to the ORG expressing concretely how he wished to be compensated .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG underlined that no market - value compensation for land being compulsorily bought by the ORG had been provided for in the Methodology .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG wrote to the applicant stating that his name on the list of persons awaiting plots for building a house in GPE had been moved from ORG to GPE because he had already been granted a plot of land to build a house in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , LAW ( CARDINAL ) the Law on ORG was amended by providing , for the first time , for payment in cash ( pinigais ) as one of the ways of compensating for land compulsorily bought by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , ORG wrote to the applicant informing him of this new opportunity and asking him to state how he wished to be compensated , until the statutory deadline to express such choice , namely DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued the applicant with a document to the effect that the average market value ( vidutin\u0117 rinkos vert\u0117 ) of plot no . CARDINAL was LTL CARDINAL , according to its DATE estimate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant wrote to the ORG saying that in DATE he was ORG on the waiting list of persons whose property rights were to be restored in the city of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE city authorities informed the applicant that , in accordance with the Methodology approved by the Government , the indexed value ( indeksuota vert\u0117 ) of the CARDINAL ha of land to be bought by the ORG was ORG CARDINAL . The laws did not allow compensation for this land by market - value payment . The authorities also reminded the applicant that , in accordance with LAW of ORG , should a citizen fail to make a choice as to how he or she wished to be compensated for the land bought by the ORG , or if they favoured a method not provided for by ORG , he or she would be compensated in cash ( pinigais ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to the applicant \u2019s request , on DATE ORG confirmed that the unreturned plot of land to which the applicant could still obtain restitution measured CARDINAL ha ( nustatyta , kad \u017eem\u0117s plotas , \u012f kur\u012f liko atkurti nuosavyb\u0117s teis\u0119 , sudaro CARDINAL ha ) . It reiterated to the applicant that his father \u2019s land had been assigned to the land which should be bought out by the ORG . That notwithstanding , ORG asked the GPE city municipality to verify whether there was the possibility to constitute a plot of land within the overall parcel that had belonged to the applicant \u2019s father . Only if there was an unoccupied plot could ORG restore the applicant \u2019s right in natura .", "CARDINAL . In reply to the applicant \u2019s request to grant him a plot of land , if it was possible to delimit CARDINAL within the territory that had once belonged to his father , on DATE GPE municipal authorities informed him that the entire plot was already occupied , namely it contained plots of land registered in private ownership , those plots being necessary to use buildings and houses . It also contained some forest land that was listed as being of State importance . For that reason , it was not possible to form a plot within the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s land . In accordance with ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Law on Restitution , this exact land could not be returned as it was due to be bought by the ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
