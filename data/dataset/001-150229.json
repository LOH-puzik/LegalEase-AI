The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They are brothers . As the facts of the case are in dispute between the parties , they will be set out separately . The facts as presented by the applicants are set out in Section B below ( paragraphs DATE ) . The Government \u2019s submissions concerning the facts are summarised in Section C ( paragraphs CARDINAL ) . The documentary evidence submitted by the applicants and the Government is summarised in Section D ( paragraphs CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicants\u2019 neighbour , GPE , was shot in the street . The applicants , who were at their aunt \u2019s house at the time , and a number of their friends , took the injured neighbour to hospital , where he died on arrival .", "CARDINAL . A police chief and a number of police officers arrived at the hospital at TIME and asked the applicants and their friends to accompany them to NORP police station , where they could be questioned as witnesses in relation to the incident . By the time they arrived , however , the police officers had already established that the applicants\u2019 neighbour had been shot by a police officer . They then decided to detain the applicants at the station . Although the applicants had been taken to the station at TIME , the time of their arrival was stated as TIME in the relevant police report ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The necessary formalities concerning their detention at the police station were not complied with . For example , their names were not entered in the custody ledgers , and although they were minors and should have been taken to a special police station for minors , this was not done . Furthermore , they were not informed of their rights or allowed to contact a lawyer , nor were their next of kin informed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE QUANTITY police officers working at the special police station for minors went to NORP police station and questioned the applicants in the absence of a lawyer and thus in contravention of the applicable procedure , which stipulates that the presence of a lawyer is compulsory during the questioning of minors . Furthermore , although the applicants were questioned there , it was written in the statements taken from them that they had been questioned at the special police station for minors .", "CARDINAL . While detained at the police station , the applicants were stripped naked , doused with cold water , kicked , punched and beaten with truncheons . The reason for the ill - treatment was to force them to implicate themselves in the incident . As they were illiterate and unrepresented by a lawyer , they had no way of verifying the statements before they were forced to sign them . As a result of those incriminatory statements the prosecutor instigated an investigation against the second applicant , but it was subsequently closed for lack of evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . At CARDINAL or TIME on DATE the police officers hit the applicants with their truncheons and told them to leave the police station .", "CARDINAL . NORP The following day the applicants went to the GPE branch of ORG and were referred to ORG , also in GPE , where they were examined by a number of doctors DATE .

During the prosecutor \u2019s investigation , police chief GPE , CARDINAL of the police officers who had been responsible for the applicants\u2019 ill - treatment , continued to serve as the chief of ORG police station and made numerous attempts to stall the investigation . It was not until he was posted elsewhere and another police chief was appointed to replace him that the necessary information could be handed over to the prosecutor to enable him to start the investigation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . When the prosecutor subsequently started taking meaningful steps to investigate their allegations of ill - treatment , the police officers started putting pressure on the applicants and their family . The applicants were unable to withstand the pressure and were forced to dismiss PERSON . At the behest of the police officers , they appointed PERSON as their new legal representative and informed ORG on DATE that they were withdrawing their complaints . They were also forced to tell the authorities that their allegations of ill - treatment had been fabricated . Mr ORG made submissions against them during the first hearing , held on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Although during that hearing ORG decided to hold its next hearing on DATE , it held an unscheduled hearing on DATE without informing the applicants or their legal representative . Police chief ORG was thus heard by ORG in the absence of their lawyers and in breach of the applicable rules of criminal procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This deprived them and their lawyers of the opportunity to formally identify the police chief and put questions to him .", "CARDINAL . Although they subsequently dismissed PERSON , reappointed PERSON PERSON and informed ORG of the change of representation on DATE , ORG did not entertain the new power of attorney until DATE . It thus attempted to prevent their lawyer from representing them .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the indifference of the national authorities to their allegations of ill - treatment and the collusion between the police authorities and the judiciary , the criminal proceedings against the police officers were not conducted diligently and were intentionally allowed to become timebarred . The investigation into their allegations of ill - treatment showed that the judiciary did not have the courage to prosecute people responsible for ill - treating children as young DATE .", "CARDINAL . In their observations , the Government summarised the investigation documents ( also summarised below in paragraphs DATE to CARDINAL ) , and submitted that the applicants had been taken to LOC police station with a view to being questioned as witnesses of a serious crime , namely the killing of GPE The applicants , who were minors at the time , were taken to the station at TIME with a view to being referred to a special police station for minors .

These included a scratch on the upper right side of his torso measuring QUANTITY , as well as bruising on the back of his body in CARDINAL places , measuring CARDINAL x CARDINAL , CARDINAL x CARDINAL , CARDINAL x CARDINAL and QUANTITY . The doctors concluded that his description of the ill - treatment was compatible with their findings .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant did not appear to have any external injuries , but his description of the ill - treatment was deemed by the doctors to be compatible with his unsettled and nervous state of mind . They concluded that further medical examinations , including a bone scintigraphy and a psychological assessment , were necessary in order to reach a definitive conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , assisted by their lawyer PERSON , lodged a formal complaint with the ORG prosecutor against the police officers .

At the end of their detention they had not been taken to see a doctor , but had been hit with truncheons and told to \u201c leave and never be seen again \u201d . The applicants referred to their rights guaranteed by LAW , and asked the prosecutor to investigate their allegations .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the prosecutor referred the applicants to a doctor , who noted in his report that they had no visible signs of ill - treatment . He considered it necessary , however , that the applicants be examined more thoroughly at a hospital .", "CARDINAL . An investigation which had been started by a prosecutor against the second applicant and his neighbour GPE for the \u201c attempted robbery \u201d of ORG was discontinued on DATE , because the prosecutor observed that the applicants\u2019 neighbour had been killed by the police officer , and there was no evidence implicating the second applicant in the incident .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG prosecutor questioned police officers GPE and GPE , who worked at the special police station for minors and had questioned the applicants on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They told the prosecutor that on DATE they had been asked to go to LOC police station to take statements from a number of children . When they had arrived , they had been presented with CARDINAL statements allegedly taken from the children and had been asked to sign them as if they had prepared them . They had refused to do so and insisted on questioning the children themselves before returning to their own police station at TIME .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of CARDINAL DATE addressed to the ORG prosecutor , the chief of LOC police station , ORG , stated that no records existed at his station to show that the applicants had been detained there from DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the ORG prosecutor sent CARDINAL letters to ORG , unsuccessfully requesting him to ensure that QUANTITY police officers working at LOC police station attended his office . On DATE the ORG prosecutor wrote to him for a fifth time , repeating his previous requests .

On DATE the ORG prosecutor filed an indictment with ORG of First Instance charging a total of QUANTITY police officers with ill - treatment , an offence defined in section CARDINAL of LAW in force at the time of the events . Those indicted included the former NORP police chief GPE", "CARDINAL . The applicants joined as interveners in the criminal proceedings before ORG , which decided on DATE that the police officers should have instead been charged with the offence of torture , an offence defined in section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code which fell within the jurisdiction of ORG . The file was thus forwarded to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the first applicant was shown photographs of the CARDINAL defendant police officers . He identified GPE and CARDINAL other police officers , GPE , GPE and GPE", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , a police chief was appointed to carry out a disciplinary investigation and questioned the applicants at PERSON police station on DATE . They were accompanied by their father , PERSON , and PERSON , a lawyer . In CARDINAL almost identical statements drawn up by the investigating police officer the applicants were reported to have stated that on DATE of the incident they had been taken to the special police station for minors and not LOC police station . Furthermore , they had never been beaten up there by officers . They added that DATE after they had left the police station , they had been sniffing glue and had been high when CARDINAL of their friends had suggested they go to ORG and make a complaint against the police . That way , their friend had told them , the police would never bother them ever again . That was how they had come to make the official complaint against the police officers . The injuries detailed in the medical reports had in fact been caused in a fight they had been involved in on the street that day . The lawyers and ORG had then manipulated everything on their behalf .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicants gave CARDINAL petitions to ORG stating that they wanted to withdraw their complaints \u201c which , in any event , had been made as a result of a misunderstanding \u201d . Also DATE , the applicants officially dismissed PERSON , the lawyer who had been representing them since the lodging of their official complaint against the police officers .", "CARDINAL .

He stated that when he had found out on DATE of the incident that the applicants and their friends had been taken to his station , he had had them transferred to the special police station for minors . He had never beaten them up . In his opinion , ORG had been interested in the incident because it concerned the killing of a civilian by a police officer , and it had then manipulated the incident with the assistance of a number of lawyers .", "DATE . On DATE , at the end of the disciplinary investigation , the investigating police officer recommended that no disciplinary punishment should be imposed on the defendant police officers . In line with that recommendation , the police disciplinary committee decided on DATE not to impose any such punishment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants made a complaint to the ORG prosecutor , complaining that the police officers who had ill - treated them had also been responsible for , inter alia , their unlawful detention . They informed the prosecutor that they had been treated and questioned as suspects at the police station , and had had swabs taken from their hands . Nevertheless , no official records had been kept by the police officers in relation to their arrest , detention or release . This , in their opinion , meant that the police officers had committed an offence , the unlawful deprivation of their liberty . Moreover , although they had been detained for TIME , no authorisation had been sought or obtained from the prosecutor for the period exceeding that time . They argued that although they had been under DATE at the time , and should have been questioned directly by a prosecutor and in the presence of their lawyer , they had been questioned by police officers and in the absence of a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . These complaints were rejected by the prosecutor on DATE , who considered that the applicants had been questioned as \u201c statement makers \u201d , and that in an investigation into an unlawful killing there was nothing unusual about questioning people who had been seen in the vicinity of the incident . The applicants filed an objection against the prosecutor \u2019s decision , submitting that in the NORP legal system there was no such concept as a \u201c statement maker \u201d . They referred to the applicable legislation setting out the procedure to be followed when persons are deprived of their liberty , and argued that none of those formalities had been observed in their case . The objection was rejected by ORG on DATE and the decision served on the applicants on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , PERSON , who had initially represented the applicants but had been dismissed by them on DATE , sent a letter to ORG on DATE stating that the applicants and the other children who had been arrested and ill - treated DATE were being threatened by the defendant police officers . For example , police chief PERSON had personally gone to court with the second applicant and a lawyer , and had made the second applicant sign certain documents there . He and other police officers had then threatened the applicants and their father , and had forced them to withdraw their complaints . Mr PERSON added that when he had suggested to the applicants and their father that they inform the prosecutor about the pressure being exerted on them by the police officers , they had declined to do so because they had been very scared . Mr PERSON further stated in his letter that ORG had given the applicants\u2019 father the business card of a lawyer and had asked him to appoint him to represent the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The trial of the police officers began before ORG . During the first hearing on DATE , the newly appointed lawyer , PERSON , told the court that the applicants were known to the police because of their past criminal activities . Their initial lawyer PERSON also attended the hearing , and informed the court of the pressure being exerted on the applicants by the defendant police officers . In the official court transcript , Mr PERSON was referred to as the lawyer on record for the applicants . The court decided to hold a second hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held an unscheduled hearing and heard the defendant police chief GPE The following entry features in the transcript of the hearing : \u201c Although a second hearing in this case had been scheduled for DATE , the defendant ORG and his lawyer came to court and told us that he was now working in the town of Halfeti and had come to GPE on other business . As it would be difficult for him to come back to GPE for the next scheduled hearing , he informed us that he would like to give his testimony now \u201d . According to the transcript , apart from the CARDINAL judges on the bench , a prosecutor , a court clerk and ORG , no one else was present . The defendant police chief told the court that the applicants and the other teenagers had been taken to his police station to be questioned as witnesses , but had subsequently been transferred to the special police station for minors . Neither he nor any of his colleagues had ill - treated them .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted their written observations to the trial court , complaining that the hearing held on DATE had been unlawful . They argued that the court \u2019s failure to ensure their attendance had deprived them of the opportunity to confront the police chief .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant went to ORG and informed the lawyers there that pressure was being exerted on him and his brother by ORG to dismiss their lawyers and withdraw their complaints . He further stated that the police chief had accompanied them to see a notary public , where they had signed a power of attorney giving their new lawyer authority . He informed ORG of his wish to be represented by his previous lawyer PERSON .", "CARDINAL . According to a report drawn up on DATE by PERSON and signed by one of his colleagues , when he and the applicants arrived at court for the second hearing , which had been scheduled for DATE , PERSON was waiting there with some of the defendant police officers . When he asked the applicants what they were doing at court , the applicants told him that they wanted to attend the hearing and continue to press charges against the police officers . Mr PERSON then unsuccessfully tried to dissuade the applicants and urged them not to attend the hearing . When they insisted on attending , all but one of the defendant police officers waiting for the hearing left the building and did not attend .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing that took place DATE , the applicants repeated their allegations of ill - treatment . PERSON , who claimed to be representing them , told the court that he had been unaware of any allegations of ill - treatment made by his clients against the police officers . The applicants then informed the court that their lawyer was PERSON and not PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants officially reappointed their previous lawyers , including Mr PERSON , dismissed PERSON , and informed the court of the change of representation . At a hearing on DATE the court decided to accept the applicants as \u201c participants \u201d ( kat\u0131lan ) in the proceedings . In all subsequent hearings they were referred to as such .", "CARDINAL . NORP On subsequent dates the lawyers representing the applicants continued to inform ORG and the court about the pressure being exerted on them and the applicants by the defendant police officers . They also submitted official documentation to the court showing that neither applicant had a criminal record , criticising the submissions made by PERSON , who had told the court that \u201c the applicants were known to the police because of their past criminal activities \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The QUANTITY police officers who worked at the special police station and had questioned the applicants on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) attended one of the hearings , and told the court that when they had arrived at LOC police station they had been presented with CARDINAL statements prepared by the police officers working there , and had been asked to sign them as if they themselves had taken them . However , they had refused to do so and had questioned the applicants personally . They also told the court that when they had urged the police officers at LOC police station to release the applicants because they were being kept there unlawfully , they had been told to mind their own business .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings , the court was informed that the special police station for minors did not have in its possession the custody records pertaining to the relevant period . As a result , it was not known whether or not the applicants had been detained there in DATE .", "CARDINAL . A large number of defendants failed to attend the majority of the hearings held by the trial court . On each occasion the court urged them in writing to attend .", "CARDINAL . NORP The lawyers representing the applicants drew the court \u2019s attention to a number of shortcomings in its handling of the case , and the defendant police ORG failure to attend the hearings . They asked the court to ensure the ORG participation by , if necessary , ordering their remand in custody . The other teenagers who were taken to LOC police station with the applicants ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) also gave evidence during the trial , describing how the defendant police officers had beaten them up and tried to force them to admit that they had killed ORG who , as it later turned out , had in fact been killed by a police officer ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of a hearing held on CARDINAL DATE the ORG father gave evidence . He told the court that his CARDINAL children had not come home for DATE . When they had finally come home , they had told him that they had been detained at LOC police station and beaten up there by officers . Mr PERSON explained to the court how his CARDINAL sons\u2019 mental state had deteriorated after the incident .

On DATE the applicants submitted their written submissions to the trial court , urging it to conduct its proceedings effectively and fairly . They warned the court that the proceedings had been continuing for such a long period of time that they could soon risk becoming time - barred .", "CARDINAL . During CARDINAL of the hearings a lawyer representing the defendant police officers complained about the press coverage given to the trial , and criticised suggestions published in various newspapers that his GPE continued failure to attend the hearings would cause delays , which would cause the proceedings to become time - barred .", "DATE . In a hearing held DATE , the prosecutor made his final submissions to the trial court . He argued that police chief PERSON had ill - treated the applicants and caused them minor injuries , which had necessitated minor medical treatment . The prosecutor requested the court to conclude that the offence the police chief had been charged with should be changed to illtreatment , as defined in section CARDINAL of LAW . In his opinion , the police chief had not committed torture , an offence defined in section CARDINAL of the Code , because he had not ill - treated the applicants in order to obtain information from them . In any event , they had not been detained as suspects at ORG police station . The prosecutor also recommended that the remaining police officers be acquitted .", "CARDINAL . In the course of a hearing held on DATE the lawyers representing the police officers were due to present their final defence arguments to the trial court . Nevertheless , they informed the court that they were unable to attend the hearing DATE , and it was thus postponed until DATE . According to the transcript of the hearing , the court also decided to remind the lawyers representing the police officers that attending hearings in which they were scheduled to submit their final defence submissions was a legal requirement .", "CARDINAL . During the CARDINAL hearing , held on DATE , the court decided that there was insufficient evidence to prove that CARDINAL of the defendant police officers had subjected the applicants to \u201c torture \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW , and acquitted them . It also considered that the actions of the remaining QUANTITY police officers , including police chief GPE , had amounted to \u201c ill - treatment \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW and not \u201c torture \u201d , because there was no evidence to show that the applicants had been ill - treated in order to force them to confess to a crime or give evidence . Nevertheless , as the end of the prescription period for the offence had been reached , the court discontinued the criminal proceedings against the QUANTITY police officers .", "CARDINAL . In support of its conclusion that the QUANTITY police officers had ill - treated the applicants , the court stated that they had been \u201c unnecessarily kept at the police station for TIME , and that their injuries had been caused when they had been pushed and jostled for no apparent reason \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed and drew ORG attention to the statements taken from them by the police officers , in which they argued they had been forced to incriminate themselves for offences they had never committed ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . They argued that in the light of those statements , the police officers should have been found guilty of torture and not ill - treatment , because the statements had been obtained from them under ill - treatment . By finding them guilty of ill - treatment , for which the prescription period was shorter , the police officers had been allowed to go with impunity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the applicants had withdrawn their complaints against the police officers on DATE [ sic ] DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and that they did not , therefore , have the requisite standing to appeal against their acquittals .
