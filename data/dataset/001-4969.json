He is represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) convicted the applicant inter alia of attempted extortion ( versuchte ErpressungOberster PERSON ) , it noted that it also had to take into account to what extent punishment was necessary to deter the applicant from further wrongdoing or to deter others from committing similar offences .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity ( PERSON ) . It noted the applicant \u2019s allegation that ORG had violated the law in that it took aspects of deterrence ( Spezial- PERSON ) into account when determining his sentence . However , within the statutory range of punishment , the court , when determining which specific sentence was commensurate to the accused \u2019s guilt , had a certain margin of appreciation within which it could also have regard to aspects of deterrence . Thus , the applicant had to be understood as alleging that ORG had not correctly exercised its discretion . This question had to be examined before ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal ( GPE ) .

Section CARDINAL in the version which was in force at the material time - read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The basis for assessing the sentence is the degree of the offender \u2019s guilt .", "( CARDINAL ) In assessing the sentence , the court must weigh up the aggravating and mitigating factors , in so far as they have not already been taken into account to determine the type or tariff of penalty applicable . It must have regard , above all , to the extent to which the offence can be attributed to an attitude of rejection or indifference on the part of the offender towards values protected by the law , and the extent to which it can be traced back to external circumstances or motives capable of inducing even a law - abiding person to commit it .", "", "( CARDINAL ) As a general principle , the severity of the sentence should be increased in proportion to the significance of the damage or injury , or risk of damage or injury , caused by the offender or for which he is liable , even if he did not cause it himself ; the number of duties he breached by his conduct and the degree of premeditation , of care in preparing or ruthlessness in committing the offence , and in inverse proportion to the extent to which it could be guarded against . \u201d", "The established case - law ( see for instance ORG judgments of CARDINAL , EvBl CARDINAL/CARDINAL , of CARDINAL , EvBl CARDINAL/CARDINAL , of CARDINAL , PERSON and of CARDINAL , EvBl DATE ) , as well as the prevailing opinion in academic writing ( see for example PERSON , ORG in PERSON , DATE ) CARDINAL ) , interpret the above provision as follows : The offender \u2019s guilt is decisive for the determination of the penalty . However , the offender \u2019s guilt can not be equated to CARDINAL precise amount of penalty ( Punktsstrafe ) , but determines a range of possible punishment ( PERSON ) .
