On DATE a bank , Diffusion industrielle nouvelle ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , granted the applicant a consumer loan in the sum of MONEY ( ORG ) with interest at the rate of PERCENT for the purchase of a vehicle . The loan was repayable in CARDINAL DATE instalments of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( making a total of FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the bank notified the applicant of its intention to seize the vehicle as he had failed to pay the DATE and DATE instalments . The applicant settled the arrears .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE the applicant stopped payment of the instalments owing to defects in the vehicle .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE he made a payment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the loan agreement and had the car sold for ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . It issued proceedings against the applicant for payment of the balance of the loan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG ordered the applicant to pay the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The applicant , who contested the amount claimed and the price at which the car had been sold , applied to have that order set aside .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG ordered the applicant to pay ORG plus interest at the contractual rate of PERCENT and a further sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment , arguing that the bank had been at fault for selling the car at a derisory price . He sought an order against the bank for the payment of damages to be set - off against the amount of his indebtedness . In the alternative , he asked to be allowed to pay off the debt over DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who worked as a consultant in GPE , was made redundant in DATE . From DATE he received minimum welfare benefit ( revenu minimum d'insertion \u2013 RMI ) of ORG CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly allowed the applicant 's appeal , ordering him to pay ORG the sum of ORG with interest at the contractual rate from DATE plus ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL by way of statutory compensation . It held that the applicant had not established any fault on the part of the bank such as would warrant an order for damages .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG on DATE . He lodged written submissions containing CARDINAL grounds of appeal on DATE . In particular , he argued that ORG had acted unfairly since , although he had paid off FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE and had undertaken to pay the balance of the loan by DATE , ORG had nonetheless seized the vehicle he had purchased with the aid of the loan and had it sold at a derisory price . The applicant consequently asked ORG to rule that ORG had given insufficient reasons for its decision , in that it had failed to explain why it had rejected his ground of appeal based on the financial institution 's liability for making his situation worse by not selling the car at its true value when the proceeds of sale would have been more than ample to cover the balance of the loan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG applied for the appeal to ORG to be struck out of the list pursuant to LAW , as the applicant had failed to comply with ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged submissions in which he explained that he was not in a position to pay any of the amount claimed as he was unemployed , his only income since DATE being minimum welfare benefit of ORG CARDINAL DATE . Furthermore , he was DATE in arrears with his rent . He lodged additional submissions informing the court that he had made an application for legal aid on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE following a hearing on DATE the delegate of the President of ORG made an order for the case to be removed from the list , holding :", "\u201c An order for ' removal from the list ' , which under this provision [ Article DATE ] may be made against a judgment debtor who appeals to ORG , does not constitute a penalty for failure to exercise diligence or as a result of any inadmissibility .", "It is an administrative and regulatory measure intended to remind parties that an appeal to ORG is an extraordinary remedy and to enable beneficiaries of enforceable judicial decisions to enjoy the prerogatives afforded them by the judges of the courts below in full , all in accordance with the fundamental rules of the administration of justice .", "An application may be made for such an order , which is provisional only and preserves all rights , remedies and grounds of appeal , as soon as the notice of appeal bringing the case before ORG has been lodged with the registry of that court , without the applicant 's having to wait until the time allowed to the appellant and the respondent for lodging their written submissions has expired .", "In the instant case , PERSON has failed to show that he has taken any steps apt to demonstrate his intention to comply with the decision of the court below and has not pleaded any personal circumstances that give rise to a danger or presumption that compliance will entail manifestly unreasonable consequences .", "In those circumstances , the appeal must be removed from ORG list ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

After a loan offer was accepted on DATE , a finance company , ORG , granted PERSON a credit facility in the sum of ORG CARDINAL , with interest at PERCENT , for the purchase of a vehicle .

Alleging an event of default under the agreement , it brought an action against the applicants for immediate payment of the sum of ORG , that being the outstanding capital , together with interest at the contractual rate of PERCENT since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed PERSON 's claim . It held that since the authorised overdraft of ORG had been used in a single transaction , it did not constitute a credit facility usable in tranches , but an ordinary loan . LAW DATE on consumer information and protection in financing transactions laid down that a statement of the total cost of the credit , broken down item by item , had to be provided for loans of that type . Noting that the agreement did not contain a statement of the total cost of the credit , ORG held that the loan offer was not in the required form and that by virtue of section CARDINAL of the Law SOVAC , accordingly , forfeited its rights to interest . SOVAC appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overturned that judgment . In so doing , it accepted PERSON 's submissions that the statement required by LAW DATE was too inflexible to be applicable to an offer with a variable rate of interest , and that a single rate had been applied solely because the applicants had been paid the amount in full , and not in tranches , as they had been at liberty to request . ORG ordered the applicants to pay the sum claimed together with compound interest from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied on CARDINAL DATE for legal aid to appeal to ORG . The legal aid office granted their application on DATE on the ground that they had insufficient means ( their disposable income being put at minus FRF CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants accordingly appealed to ORG on DATE through the lawyer assigned to represent them and he lodged written submissions on DATE . The applicants alleged that the finance company had contravened the statutory consumer - protection provisions . They relied in their appeal on judgments in which ORG of ORG had overturned awards of interest made in cases in which the evidence had showed that the lender had failed to state the overall effective rate of interest or the total cost of the credit , broken down item by item , in the loan agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE SOVAC requested the President of ORG to order the removal of the case from the list pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . In submissions dated DATE the applicants opposed that application on the ground that they had insufficient means , as attested by the fact that they had been granted legal aid in DATE .", "CARDINAL .
