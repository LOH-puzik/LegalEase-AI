In DATE , at DATE , the applicant became a member of ORG , joining the ORG regiment of ORG . In DATE the applicant was posted to ORG ( \u201c the HCMR \u201d ) where he was taught to ride a horse .

According to the applicant , towards DATE the lance - corporal hit him on the side of the head with his fist , causing him to fall and strike his head on the ground . On DATE , DATE after the attack , the applicant reported sick and told the medical officer that the injury to his face had been caused by falling off a horse . On DATE the applicant , who alleges to have feared a further physical attack , went absent without leave . On DATE he wrote to the commanding officer ( \u201c CO \u201d ) of the regiment ( a lieutenant - colonel ) , stating , inter alia , that \u201c [ his ] inability to express sufficient enthusiasm during training sometimes resulted in physical abuse by certain NCOs [ non - commissioned officers ] \u201d , and asking to terminate his service .

He was subsequently released by the ORG into open arrest on DATE . The ORG remanded him for trial by district court martial on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a statement dated DATE to ORG , the applicant stated that the attack by the lance - corporal had occurred in DATE prior to his going absent without leave , while in a statement dated DATE he stated that the attack occurred sometime in DATE . The police found that the lance - corporal had left the army and took statements from other soldiers who had been on the same riding course as the applicant . They found that there was no evidence to support his complaint . The applicant subsequently signed a statement saying , inter alia : \u201c I have come to the conclusion that I just want to get out of the army and get on with my life ... Even though this assault happened , I do not want ORG ... to take any further action concerning the incident . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant 's remand for trial , the ORG appointed Captain A. as \u201c defending officer \u201d . PERSON was an army officer with no legal training , serving as a troop commander with the HCMR . The applicant applied to ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) for legal aid to enable him to be represented by a solicitor . On the application form he stated that his DATE income after deduction of tax , rent and national insurance was MONEY ( GBP ) , and that he had no savings or other property of value . The form was countersigned by his ORG . By a letter dated DATE , ORG replied that a charge of absence without leave did not normally warrant legal representation but that either the ORG or the applicant should write setting out his reasons if he considered that , exceptionally , legal aid should be granted . The applicant 's solicitor wrote to ORG on DATE pointing out that the applicant faced a custodial sentence and needed to be represented . ORG offered the applicant legal aid subject to a down - payment of GBP CARDINAL in a letter dated DATE . The Government maintain that he could have paid in CARDINAL DATE instalments of GBP CARDINAL each , but this is disputed by the applicant . On DATE the applicant 's solicitor wrote asking ORG to reconsider the down - payment condition , but on DATE , before ORG had replied , the applicant refused the offer of legal aid and was not , therefore , represented by a solicitor at the court martial .", "CARDINAL . Also on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant signed a document , addressed \u201c to whom it may concern \u201d , in which he made the following statement :", "\u201c This is to certify that I , CARDINAL ORG of ORG no longer wish to be represented at my pending ORG other than by my Defending Officer , Captain [ A. ] .", "I have made this decision of my own free will . I understand that all previous correspondence with regard to my application for legal representation will now be ignored . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's court martial took place at FAC on DATE . The court was composed as follows : a president , ORG FAC of ORG and ORG , who was a permanent president of courts martial ( appointed to his post in DATE and due to remain until his retirement in DATE ) ; Captain PERSON of ORG , GPE ; Captain PERSON of ORG , GPE , GPE and ORG ( Volunteers ) , Reading ; and a legally qualified civilian judge advocate ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . All CARDINAL military officers were outside the command area in which the applicant was serving . The president worked from home when not attending court - martial hearings .", "CARDINAL . Captain PERSON represented the applicant , who pleaded guilty to the charge of being absent without leave between DATE and CARDINAL DATE . The applicant 's letter of CARDINAL DATE to his ORG was handed to the court , but no other mention was made of the bullying allegedly suffered by him . The applicant was sentenced to dismissal from the army and DATE detention .", "CARDINAL . After the hearing , PERSON erroneously advised the applicant that if he appealed against the sentence he risked the commencement date for his sentence being put back to the date of dismissal of the appeal . On DATE the applicant instructed a solicitor to represent him . On DATE the solicitor lodged a petition with ORG in its role as the \u201c reviewing authority \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , relying on the facts that the applicant had had no legal representation before the court martial and that his allegations of assault were not presented to the court , either by way of a defence of duress ( which applies when a person charged with a criminal offence can show that , at the relevant time , he reasonably believed that he would be killed or seriously injured if he did not commit the offence ) or in mitigation of sentence . The petition asserted that it was unlikely that the defending officer understood that the applicant might have had a defence on the basis of duress and that the defending officer had indicated that he had been \u201c ordered \u201d not to allude to the allegations at the court martial without indicating who had so ordered him . It also mentioned instructions which the defending officer had given about what the applicant ought to do in the event that the court martial should , of its own volition , ask the applicant about the allegations which had been made . It also indicated that the defending officer had advised the applicant that , \u201c if he appealed , his sentence might well be increased \u201d . On DATE the petition was introduced , the solicitor wrote to PERSON asking for his comments on it and reminding him that he was subject to the rules of client privilege and should not disclose details of his dealings with the applicant to any third party . Despite this , PERSON provided a statement to ORG , in which he said , inter alia :", "\u201c As [ the applicant 's ] Troop Leader I was asked to represent him at Court Martial , this was the first Court Martial I have attended in any capacity . Although I have had experience in civil cases at both NORP ' and ORG . ...", "[ The applicant ] had indicated to me that he had gone absent from the ORG for CARDINAL reason . As expressed in his letter of CARDINAL DATE . He was showing reservations about his enthusiasm , commitment and devotion to duty . ...", "[ T]he petition states that I assumed the petitioner had no choice but to plead guilty , as he had been Absent Without Leave . I was unaware that he could have entered a plea of not guilty to the charge on the basis of duress . [ The applicant ] and I did not discuss the allegations of bullying in any great detail . This was because these allegations had been withdrawn by him under interview by ORG .", "[ The applicant ] indicated to me that he wanted to drop all the references to the violence by the ORG during his training . This was in order that the trial date would be set significantly earlier and that the trial would be substantially shorter . This led me to advise [ the applicant ] to plead guilty as charged , as I had felt that this gave him his best opportunity to be discharged from the ORG at the earliest date which was , after all , his overall aim . ...", "I discussed with the Adjutant my role as the Defending Officer . We talked about the procedural steps of the court martial and my conduct leading up to the trial . It was confirmed to me that a guilty plea would produce an earlier trial date than that of not guilty .", "I advised [ the applicant ] that references to his allegations of bullying could prolong and complicate his court martial . The mention of bullying would be introduced as part of his letter to his commanding officer dated DATE , which he agreed could be put forward for the court as mitigation . [ The applicant ] agreed that he did not wish to answer questions about his previous allegations , which he had dropped .", "I therefore advised him to refer such questions to me and I would state to the court that this was an avenue down which he did not wish to proceed . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The petition was refused by the reviewing authority on DATE , in the following terms :", "\u201c ORG has considered the petition submitted by your above - named client , and has denied it for the following reasons .", "The down payment for ORG was carefully calculated , and was well in line with the amount the petitioner would have had to pay under the civil system . The certificate signed by him shows clearly that he had decided not to proceed with his application for legal representation . We can not accept that [ the applicant ] was in any way forced to accept this decision . He also appears to have been content to accept Captain [ A. ] as his defending officer .", "The complaints about the petitioner being bullied were investigated by the ORG and the allegations could not be substantiated . Indeed it came to light during this investigation that the petitioner had told [ another soldier ] that he planned to go absent because he was merely tired of the training and TIME being worked . In view of the ORG report , ORG must accept that the allegation that the petitioner was subjected to violence by a Non - Commissioned Officer can not be substantiated , and can not be regarded as a mitigating factor .", "In considering your complaint that , had the petitioner been advised by a qualified solicitor , he would have been able to plead not guilty on the basis of duress , we had to rely on the advice given by the Judge Advocate General . He stated that a person is subject to duress when words or conduct from another person cause him to fear that he will be killed or seriously injured , if he does not commit the offence . Clearly , the petitioner could never have reasonably believed that he had cause to fear that he would be killed or seriously injured .", "ORG notes that the petitioner had dropped his allegations of being subjected to violence by the time he appeared in ORG . All Captain [ A. ] intended to do was to inform the ORG that the petitioner did not wish to proceed with these allegations . In fact the ORG was made aware of them because the letter from ( sic ) the Commanding Officer was read out to them .", "We accept that Captain [ A. ] was mistaken in referring the petitioner to the booklet ' Appeals and Petitions after conviction by ORG , which was out of date after DATE . In addition the wrong paragraph was used in his advice to the petitioner . However as we have now received a petition , in spite of this mistaken advice , we believe that no harm has been done . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence to ORG . Leave to appeal was refused by the single judge on DATE , on the grounds that the defence of duress had not been open to the applicant , that he had been properly advised to plead guilty , and that the sentence was not manifestly excessive .", "CARDINAL .

Once the higher authority has taken this decision , he has no further involvement in the case .", "CARDINAL . Where the accused is a member of the army , the role of prosecutor is performed by ORG ( \u201c the prosecuting authority \u201d ) . Following the higher authority 's decision to refer a case to it , the prosecuting authority has absolute discretion , applying similar criteria as those applied in civilian cases by ORG , to decide whether or not to prosecute , what type of court martial would be appropriate and precisely what charges should be brought . In addition , it conducts the prosecution ( DATE Act , Schedule I , Part II ) . The prosecution is brought on behalf of the Attorney - General . The current prosecuting authority is ORG . In his role as prosecuting authority , ORG is answerable to the Attorney - General , while in his coexisting role as the army 's senior lawyer he is answerable to ORG ( the army 's principal personnel and training officer , responsible , inter alia , for army disciplinary policy and a member of ORG ) . In pursuit of his latter role , ORG provides some military legal advice to the army chain of command . He does not advise the disciplinary chain of command of the army , this role being reserved to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG is also the responsibility of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( now ORG ) , independent of both the higher authority and the prosecuting authority , is responsible for making the arrangements for courts martial , including arranging venue and timing , ensuring that a judge advocate and any court officials required will be available , securing the attendance of witnesses and selecting members of the court . Its officers are appointed by ORG . Before commencement of the court - martial hearing , the power to dissolve it is vested in the responsible court - administration officer . Until DATE the person in charge of ORG was a retired officer . ORG was then created in its place , the head of which is now a serving brigadier .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , a district court martial ( \u201c DCM \u201d ) was required to consist of a permanent president of courts martial , not CARDINAL serving military officers of DATE military experience and a judge advocate ( section CARDINAL of LAW as amended by LAW ) . The court - administration officer , commanding officers of the accused , members of the higher authority , investigating officers and all other officers involved in inquiring into the charges concerned were all barred from selection to the court martial ( section CARDINALC(CARDINAL ) of LAW as amended by LAW ) .

NORP The post of permanent president of courts martial ( \u201c the permanent president \u201d ) was first created in DATE . Permanent presidents were routinely appointed thereafter to sit on DCMs whenever CARDINAL was available until suspension of the post in DATE , around the time of a ruling by Assistant Judge Advocate PERSON on DATE in ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that the appointment of permanent presidents meant that courts martial did not have the necessary impartiality and independence for the purposes of LAW . Permanent presidents were selected from the ranks of serving army officers of suitable age and rank . Until DATE , permanent presidents of courts martial held the rank of major . Thereafter their rank was raised to lieutenant - colonel , which resulted in permanent presidents routinely outranking the other serving officers on a ORG , who were never above the rank of major . Legal qualifications or experience were not required . Their appointment was usually expected to be for a period in excess of DATE and was almost without exception the officer 's last posting before his retirement from the army . The Military Secretary ( a senior subordinate of ORG ) had power to terminate the appointment of a permanent president , but this has never happened in practice .", "CARDINAL . NORP Judge advocates are appointed by the Lord Chancellor and are civilians who must have DATE experience as an advocate or DATE experience as a barrister .

Once the court martial hearing has commenced , the power to dissolve it is vested in the judge advocate . He has a vote on sentence , but not on verdict . Under LAW , the Judge Advocate General lost his previous role of providing general legal advice to the Secretary of ORG I , Part III , sections CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

The court dismissed the appellants ' complaint that the position of permanent presidents on courts martial violated LAW because permanent presidents lacked the necessary independence and impartiality . The court declined to follow the reasoning of Assistant Judge Advocate PERSON in ORG . Lord Justice Laws , delivering the judgment of the court , said :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Mr Mackenzie of course relies on the decision of Assistant Judge Advocate General PERSON in ORG . His judgment was given as we have said on DATE , by way of a ruling in a then current court martial upon objections raised on behalf of the defence to the ORG [ Permanent President ] sitting as a member of the court . The judge advocate 's essential reasoning appears at pp . CARDINAL of the transcript , after he had correctly directed himself as to LAW CARDINAL standards to be applied ( the numbering attached to the judge advocate general 's text is ours , not his ) :", "' CARDINAL . I am concerned as to the terms of appointment of these Permanent Presidents . It seems to me that there is no fixed time limit other than a time which may be quite short DATE , CARDINAL or DATE ; certainly DATE is probably too short to ensure full independence , DATE may be suitable \u2013 I express no comment on that .", "CARDINAL . NORP I am concerned as to their training . This reference to their visiting the APA [ ORG ] , I suspect that is mistyping , nevertheless it is there in their current job description and I must be concerned with the perception of bias , and it does not look appropriate , in my view , for Permanent Presidents to be told they should attend a briefing from ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP I am concerned obviously with their potential removal . Clearly anybody exercising judicial or quasi - judicial functions should be free from arbitrary removal , and there should be some sort of guarantee that the removal would only be on the basis of some sort of misconduct within that particular office . There is no security , therefore , it would seem to me , that applies to Permanent Presidents at the present time in their role .", "CARDINAL . I am also obviously concerned with the question of reporting , whether it be DATE \u2013 which I doubt ; it is more likely to be DATE , or perhaps on the renewal of their appointment \u2013 I can not say , but certainly there is some reporting that appears to take place , and it seems to me again that is a significant difficulty which affects the perception of independence .", "Now , I have specified those CARDINAL [ in fact , CARDINAL ] as being the main concerns that I have ... those particular concerns are sufficient in my view for me to rule that in the particular circumstances of the system as it now stands , the appointments of Permanent Presidents do not give rise to an independent and impartial tribunal . '", "The judge advocate was at pains to insist that his ruling was ' limited to this particular case ' ; but its reasoning plainly applies at least to all DCMs presided over by a ORG .", "CARDINAL . Mr Mackenzie sought to build on the reasoning in ORG with a series of further points ... In particular , he submitted that ( a ) there were no objective regulatory provisions governing the ORG 's appointment , beyond the ordinary procedures for staff appointments ; ( b ) ' the medium rank of ORG prevents such officers from being immune from general ORG influence ' ... ; ( c ) the ORG is senior in rank to the other officers on the court martial ... , and would be likely to exert a substantial influence over them .", "CARDINAL . It is convenient to deal with this last point first . In ORG the judge advocate stated at CARDINAL - D ( referring to junior members of a ORG ) :", "' Speaking for myself , having of course sat in on many , many sentencing matters with Permanent Presidents , I can say that I have found that the junior members ... the fact that they happen to be junior in rank , has not prevented them from being very robust in their sentencing arguments . '", "As judge advocate he would not , of course , have participated in the court 's deliberations upon conviction . It is to be noted that by paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG the junior officer is required to speak first in the course of any court martial 's deliberations . The provision is plainly intended to ensure that junior members ' genuine opinions are put forward .", "CARDINAL . Upon this point , PERSON argument does not go to the particular position of the PERSON at all , but rather to the differences in rank among the members of the court martial , whether the president is a ORG or not . As such we doubt whether it is open to him . But we are clear in any event that there is no merit in it . If the argument were right , it would presumably mean that Article CARDINAL ) required that the members of a court martial should be officers of the same rank . That can not be the law . The notion , were it accepted , that it is reasonable to fear that between joint decision - makers of different rank there is a systematic likelihood that the more junior may be unduly influenced by the perceived views of the more senior would , surely , be an unlooked for and unwelcome side - effect of the ORG 's beneficent regime . We consider it perfectly reasonable to suppose that junior officers would regard it as their duty to speak with their own voice , and that the modern culture of the ORG would promote that very point of view . We do not think it would be reasonable for the accused soldier to entertain any different perception . This point is a bad one .", "CARDINAL . The argument as to the ORG 's medium rank and ' general ORG influence ' falls to be disposed of in like manner . But there is another point to be made . The way this argument is formulated DATE ' the medium rank of ORG prevents such officers from being immune from general ORG influence ' \u2013 amounts , looked at rigorously , to an allegation of actual bias ( whether unconscious or not ) . It is not , or not only , a matter of the appearance of the thing or of the presence or absence of objective guarantees . It is a delicate way of saying that such medium - ranking officers are relatively prone to take a prosecution line . That is quite a serious allegation , for which there is not a whisper of any supporting evidence . And in our view it is simply patronising to suggest that an officer in the rank of Lieutenant - Colonel ... will have his judgment on the concrete facts of a particular case affected by anything so amorphous as ' general ORG influence ' .", "CARDINAL . In our judgment Mr LOC 's further submission about the absence of any specific regulatory provision goes nowhere , unless it supports an argument to the effect that the PPCMs lack sufficient tenure in office for this court to be satisfied that the Article CARDINAL requirements of independence and impartiality are met . ...", "CARDINAL . ... we should dispose of point ( CARDINAL ) in ORG . This rested in the judge advocate 's understanding that ORG PPCMs were required , as a training exercise , to visit and be briefed by ORG . In fact the judge advocate himself reported ( CARDINAL ) the assurance given to him that no such visits took place . Lt Col Stone states in terms that he has never visited the ORG . From the judge advocate 's reasoning in ORG it looks as if there must have been some rogue document or documents in circulation ; but there is obviously nothing of substance in the point . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice Laws concluded as follows on the appellants ' complaint about the position of permanent presidents ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c ... We consider that the conditions upon which PPCMs have been appointed , and held office , have involved no violation of Article CARDINAL ) , and in particular there was no violation on the facts of these cases . We should first collect the facts which have weighed with us . ( CARDINAL ) The PPCMs effectively operated outside the ordinary chain of command . They advisedly lived their professional lives largely in isolation from their ORG colleagues . ( CARDINAL ) While Mr Havers rightly accepted that there was no ' written guarantee ' against removal , there is in fact no record of a ORG ever having been removed from that position . Removal from office , we may readily infer , would only take place in highly exceptional circumstances which have never eventuated . ( CARDINAL ) The appointment was the officer 's last posting , offering no prospect of promotion or preferment thereafter . Neither of the PPCMs in these cases entertained any such prospect , hope or expectation . ... ( CARDINAL ) The term of these PPCMs ' appointments was for DATE ... ( CARDINAL ) There have been no reports on ORG PPCMs since DATE . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] ORG Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG examined , inter alia , the compatibility of a NORP general court martial with section CARDINAL(d ) of LAW , which provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Any person charged with an offence has the right", "...", "( d ) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A general court martial consisted of CARDINAL voting members , who were joined by a judge advocate who was called upon to determine questions of law or mixed law and fact during the trial . The judge advocate was appointed to the general court martial by the Judge Advocate General on an ad hoc basis .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the judge advocate did not possess sufficient security of tenure to satisfy the requirement of \u201c independence \u201d under section CARDINAL(d ) of the Charter . PERSON , delivering the leading judgment of the court , commented as follows :", "\u201c ... the judge advocate was appointed solely on a case by case basis . As a result , there was no objective guarantee that his or her career as a military judge would not be affected by decisions tending in favour of the accused rather than the prosecution . A reasonable person might well have entertained an apprehension that a legal officer 's occupation as a military judge would be affected by his or her performance in earlier cases ... [ or ] that the person chosen as judge advocate had been selected because he or she had satisfied the interests of the executive , or at least has not seriously disappointed the executive 's expectations , in previous proceedings . ...", "Military judges who act periodically as judge advocates must therefore have a tenure that is beyond the interference of the executive for a fixed period of time . \u201d", "He went on to note that amendments to NORP court - martial procedures , which had come into force subsequent to the proceedings at issue in the case , had corrected deficiencies in the judge advocate 's security of tenure , providing for appointment for a period of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"]}
