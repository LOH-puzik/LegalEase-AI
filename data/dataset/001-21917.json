FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE and resident in GPE ( GPE ) . She is represented by PERSON of ORG ( Perheen Suojelun Keskusliitto ORG r.y . ) . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , Director in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a mother of CARDINAL . Her oldest daughter PERSON , born in DATE , was placed in public care from DATE to DATE on account of the applicant \u2019s mental problems . The care was terminated after sole custody of ORG had been granted to her father S.", "At the beginning of the events of relevance to the application , the applicant \u2019s sons PERSON and J. , born in DATE and DATE respectively , lived with the applicant and her partner PERSON father is PERSON and J. \u2019s father is NORP", "DATE ORG of ORG , having received an indication under LAW ( lastensuojelulaki , barnskyddslag CARDINAL ) , on several occasions attempted to interview the applicant and NORP and to verify their home conditions . As the applicant refused social officials access into her home and refused to allow ORG and J. to undergo expert examinations , ORG ( sosiaali- ja terveyslautakunta , social- och h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rdsn\u00e4mnden ) , on DATE , decided to place them in public care pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW .", "ORG considered that the applicant was suffering from mental problems which had taken the form of \u201c deviating behaviour \u201d and difficulties in her personal relations . For DATE the ORG had received information about the family which had given rise to concerns . The applicant had been \u201c abandoning \u201d J. , stating that he was not her son but R. \u2019s . She had also been threatening PERSON and was suspected of not feeding him properly . Because of her strong personality the whole responsibility for the children \u2019s upbringing had been placed on her . She and NORP had not been co - operating with the social authorities . A home helper had only managed to control to some extent \u201c the chaos \u201d in their home . They had turned down an offer to place J. in a day care centre and had brought ORG to day care only irregularly . ORG short - term stay in a foster home with the applicant \u2019s consent had not been appropriate , since that home had been located in the same town as the applicant \u2019s home . The applicant had also taken ORG home before his planned DATE stay had come to an end . ORG expressed the hope that the applicant would seek treatment .", "According to the applicant , the information on which the ORG \u2019s findings were based had not been submitted by persons qualified to assess her mental health . CARDINAL opinions were submitted by physicians who had allegedly never examined her . Some opinions were allegedly based on information provided by a social worker without the applicant \u2019s knowledge and consent . A further opinion was submitted by an official of ORG who had not examined those involved either .", "The care orders were not enforced immediately . The applicant and NORP appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE .", "At the relevant time the applicant had sole custody of ORG , who was spending his DATE with his father P. in GPE . The social authorities told PERSON not to return PERSON to the applicant after DATE . Thereafter his public care was implemented in his father \u2019s home .", "On DATE ORG , without holding an oral hearing , rejected the applicant \u2019s and NORP \u2019s appeal against the care orders . They appealed further to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) .", "On DATE J. was forcibly removed from the applicant \u2019s arms in their home with a view to implementing the care order . Following an observation period in a hospital J. was placed in FAC at LOC . The applicant \u2019s complaint about the enforcement manner did not lead to charges being brought by ORG .", "On DATE , the applicant and NORP requested ORG to revoke the public care orders . This was refused on DATE . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal without holding an oral hearing . She did not appeal further to ORG .", "In a decision of DATE a social welfare officer refused to provide the applicant with a copy of her client records , since they also contained information concerning third persons . The official noted that the applicant \u2019s counsel had studied the records in ORG . The official scheduled a further appointment when the applicant could read the records in the ORG .", "On DATE ORG apparently ordered that the documents in question could be released to the applicant as the information relating to third persons had been deleted .", "On DATE ORG adopted a care plan for J. It further rejected the applicant \u2019s request for access to documents relating to her daughter PERSON \u2019s taking into care in DATE , since that material was in the possession of the social authorities in ORG , which the applicant could petition directly . In her appeal the applicant , inter alia , questioned the continued public care of the children and the collection of information supporting such care . Her appeal was rejected by ORG on DATE but the court did afford her an opportunity to study the documents relating to her daughter PERSON \u2019s taking into care in DATE . The applicant did not appeal further in so far as this was possible ( with the exception of the terms of the care plan ) .", "Meanwhile , when returning home in DATE or DATE before the applicant was about to give birth to her fourth child she saw an ambulance waiting for her in her yard . Expecting to be placed in compulsory psychiatric care , she had her partner NORP drive her to GPE , where she gave birth on DATE . She returned to GPE shortly thereafter but later moved back to GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of DATE after having obtained written observations from ORG . The applicant was also able to submit a rejoinder", "At ORG request ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , on DATE , transferred the custody of ORG from the applicant to ORG \u2019s father PERSON The applicant did not attend the court hearing , though duly summoned .", "A further request by the applicant to have the public care orders concerning ORG and ORG revoked , alternatively to have the access restrictions alleviated , was rejected by ORG on DATE . Her appeal was rejected by ORG on DATE after an oral hearing where NORP was also heard . The court noted the applicant \u2019s lack of co - operation which had rendered it impossible for the social authorities to ascertain the alleged improvement in the home conditions . Nor had any other evidence of such improvement been adduced . ORG also upheld the care plan adopted by ORG on DATE in respect of J. It urged ORG to specify the support measures necessary for improving the home conditions , but this again required co - operation between the social authorities and ORG parents ( i.e. the applicant and NORP ) .", "The applicant apparently did not appeal to ORG against the decision to uphold the care order .", "On DATE ORG terminated ORG \u2019s public care , noting that he was in the sole custody of his father P. As regards ORG noted that the applicant and NORP had failed to show up to any of the recent meetings scheduled for discussing his care plan . On CARDINAL DATE the number of meetings between J. and his parents and sister was reduced from DATE to DATE . NORP was allowed CARDINAL further DATE visit . This restriction was extended on DATE . Reference was made , inter alia , to the applicant \u2019s threats against staff at FAC ( including a threat to blow up CARDINAL employee \u2019s car ) , her assault of a social welfare worker and her refusal to return PERSON to her father after a visit . Moreover , the applicant had failed to communicate the family \u2019s new address to the authorities .", "The relevant legislation is outlined in the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON and GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) . Those provisions of particular relevance to the present case are described below .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG shall take a child into care and provide substitute care for him or her if ( a ) the child \u2019s health or development is seriously endangered by lack of care or other conditions at home , or if the child seriously endangers his or her health and development by abuse of intoxicants , by committing an illegal act other than a minor offence , or by any other comparable behaviour , ( b ) the measures of assistance in open care are not appropriate or have proved to be inadequate ; and ( c ) foster care is considered to be in the best interests of the child . PERSON care shall be provided without delay where it is needed and is in the best interests of the child ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . The care order must be forwarded to the administrative court for approval if a party opposes it and in certain other circumstances ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "If a child is in imminent danger for a reason stated in LAW or is otherwise in need of an urgent care order and substitute care , ORG may take him or her into care without submitting the decision to the administrative court for approval ( section CARDINAL ) . An emergency care order expires within DATE of the decision unless a normal order under section DATE is requested during that period . Such an order must be made within DATE , or on special grounds within DATE of the emergency order .", "The child \u2019s custodians , biological parents and de facto carers shall be heard in respect of a proposed public care order and be notified of the decision taken ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , as amended by Act no . GPE ) . The hearing procedure is governed by LAW ( hallintomenettelylaki , lag om f\u00f6rvaltningsf\u00f6rfarande CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Under LAW of the said LAW a party shall be afforded the opportunity to reply to any claims put forward by others as well as to any evidence that may affect a decision to be taken . LAW does not lay down any minimum period of time which a party shall have at his or her disposal for preparing such a reply . A matter may be decided without a preceding hearing of a party inter alia if such a hearing would be manifestly unnecessary , would jeopardise the purpose of the decision or if the decision can not be postponed . LAW requires that the competent authority duly investigate the matter before it and ensure the equality of the parties .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( sosiaalihuoltolaki , socialv\u00e5rdslag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , a decision made by ORG is enforceable regardless of an appeal ( a ) if the decision requires immediate implementation ; ( b ) if , for reasons due to the arrangement of social welfare , the enforcement of the decision can not be delayed ; or ( c ) when ORG has ordered the decision to be enforced at once .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , a child who is being cared for outside his or her original home shall be ensured those important , continuous and secure human relations which are important for his or her development . The child is entitled to meet his or her parents and other close persons and to keep in touch with them ( subsection CARDINAL ) . ORG shall support and facilitate the child \u2019s contacts with his or her parents and other close persons ( subsection CARDINAL ) .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG or the director of a children \u2019s home may restrict the right of access of a child in foster care to its parents or other persons close to him or her if ( a ) such access clearly endangers the development or safety of the child ; or if ( b ) such a restriction is necessary for the safety or security of the parents , or the children or staff in the children \u2019s home . The restriction shall be limited in time . It shall mention the persons whose rights are being restricted , the kind of contacts concerned by the restriction and the extent of the restriction .", "The care plan to be drawn up in respect of a child in public care shall mention ( a ) the purpose and objectives of the placement ; ( b ) what kind of special support will be organised for the child , for the persons in charge of the child \u2019s care and upbringing and for the child \u2019s parents ; ( c ) how the child \u2019s right of access to its parents and other persons close to the child will be organised ; and ( d ) how after - care is going to be organised . According to section CARDINAL of LAW , the care plan shall be elaborated in co - operation with those involved .", "Under LAW ( sosiaalihuoltolaki , socialv\u00e5rdslag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) social welfare officials may not , without the consent of the person concerned or that of , for instance , his or her custodian , disclose personal and family information obtained in the performance of their duties . This duty of confidentiality does not prevent officials from disclosing information to those entitled to obtain it for the performance of their official duties ( section CARDINAL ) . Thus the social welfare authorities are entitled to obtain , from a public body such as a municipal care centre , any material required for the performance of their duties ( section CARDINAL ) . The confidentiality of patient records , as stipulated in the LAW on the Status and Rights of Patients ( laki potilaan asemasta ja oikeuksista , lagen om patientens st\u00e4llning och r\u00e4ttigheter DATE ) , may thereby be waived ( section CARDINAL of the said Act ) . A refusal to disclose information requested under section CARDINAL of LAW constitutes an offence ( section DATE ) .", "LAW obligates the authorities to provide social welfare authorities with information not only in accordance with LAW of LAW but also actively and on their own initiative . According to section CARDINAL of LAW , certain officials are under a duty to notify the social authorities immediately whenever a child appears to be in evident need of child welfare measures . Others may also notify ORG of similar suspicions ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
