SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Constitutional proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing)", "JUDGES": "Branko Lubarda;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged an action with the Bratislava V ORG ( ORG s\u00fad ) seeking a ruling declaring that a meeting of flat owners in a block of flats held on DATE was contrary to the law , and that the decisions adopted at that meeting were void .", "The defendant of the action was an entity with legal personality referred to as a community of owners of residential and non - residential LOC in the given building ( \u201c the defendant \u201d ) . Such entities are officially registered with the local ORG ( obvodn\u00fd \u00farad ) . The defendant was so registered with ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a submission was made to ORG by a lawyer indicating that he was acting on behalf of the defendant and informing the court that on DATE the defendant had ceased legally to exist . In that connection he submitted a letter from ORG which indicated that the defendant had been struck out of the relevant register on DATE , the context being that the administration of the building was no longer the responsibility of the defendant and that that responsibility had been transferred to a specialised agency .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that a hearing scheduled before ORG for DATE be postponed sine die . She submitted that she had just learned of the striking out of the defendant by consulting the relevant register , and that she would make a further submission once she had analysed the situation , for which she needed time . The hearing scheduled for DATE was accordingly adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings , on the grounds that the defendant had ceased to exist and had no legal successor . In particular , ORG held that neither the individual owners of the flats in the building nor the newly contracted administration agency could be considered as having succeeded to the defendant \u2019s position in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed ( odvolanie ) , raising CARDINAL principal arguments .", "First , she submitted that the administration agency was the successor to the original defendant , and that consequently the proceedings should have continued against it .", "Second , even assuming that the first contention was not correct , the court should not have terminated the proceedings but should rather have stayed them pending the outcome of another set of proceedings before the same ORG , in which a decision was being contested which had been taken at another meeting of the flat owners on DATE , to the effect that the defendant should be wound up ( zru\u0161enie ) . If that other set of proceedings ended with a ruling declaring the winding up of the original defendant void , its striking out of the given register would lose basis and the proceedings could continue against that defendant . More details about those other proceedings are set out below ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) upheld the first - instance decision , noting that the defendant had been struck out of the relevant register and had thereby lost capacity to be a party to the proceedings , in which situation there was no alternative to a discontinuance of the proceedings . The relevant legal provisions were referred to , but no reasons were offered for the latter conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law ( dovolanie ) , relying on Article CARDINAL ( f ) of LAW ( Law no . PERSON . , as amended ) ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , under which such an appeal was admissible if the courts had prevented a party to the proceedings from pursuing a case before them . In particular , she argued that ORG had provided neither any factual nor legal grounds for its conclusion , as a result of which it was not amenable to review . In addition , she pursued and further developed the same line of argument as in her appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) declared the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law inadmissible , holding that the shortcomings alleged by the applicant did not fall within the purview of LAW ( f ) of the ORG . This applied specifically to the alleged deficiency in ORG reasoning and the alleged errors of fact and law in the lower courts\u2019 decisions .", "In addition , in so far as the applicant had contested an error of procedure in that the courts had failed to stay the proceedings rather than to terminate them , ORG held that staying the proceedings was an option and not a duty of the court concerned , and that the fact that the present proceedings had not been stayed did not make out the admissibility ground cited by the applicant .", "As the appeal was not admissible , ORG did not examine the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint under LAW of LAW ( Constitutional Law no . PERSON . , as amended ) with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) . She directed the complaint against all CARDINAL levels of the ordinary courts and pursued and further developed in principle the arguments described above .", "She considered that the discontinuance of the proceedings had been unlawful , submitted that it had been a mistake of the ordinary courts not to have examined the merits of her claim , and argued that this had amounted to a breach of her rights of access to court and to a fair hearing LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible . It considered it separately with reference to the individual levels of ordinary jurisdiction involved .", "As regards the alleged shortcomings in the proceedings leading to ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , it held that the applicant had failed to submit her complaint within the statutory time - limit of DATE .", "As regards ORG , it observed that the central argument in the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law was the alleged error of law . In that regard , it went on to hold , inter alia , that :", "\u201c ORG ... rightfully emphasised ... that , as there were no grounds on which the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law would be admissible , it was not possible for it to review the merits of ORG decision . ORG did not exclude in a binding manner that the decision of ORG was the result of a wrongful legal assessment of the matter , nor did it exclude the possibility of there having been another error in the proceedings before it which had resulted in a wrongful decision on the merits . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , ORG found that , as regards the admissibility of the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG had given relevant reasons for its decision and that that decision was not arbitrary .", "In particular , it also noted that , should the other set of proceedings end with a ruling declaring the winding up of the defendant void , this would create for the applicant the opportunity to seek reopening of the proceedings in her case . Future examination of that case on the merits thus could not be completely excluded . However , at the same time , ORG noted that even if the winding up of the defendant were to be declared void , this would not automatically mean that the defendant would legally come into existence once more . The coming into being of a legal entity such as the defendant required incorporation , which in turn necessitated a decision of ORG , and could not result directly from a judicial decision .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court \u2019s decision was served on the applicant on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an individual brought proceedings against the above - mentioned defendant as well as the above - mentioned newly appointed management agency , seeking a ruling declaring void a decision to wind up the defendant taken at a meeting of flat owners in the block held on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . After the first dismissal of the action was quashed following the claimant \u2019s appeal , the action was again dismissed by ORG on DATE and , following the claimant \u2019s appeal , by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the claimant challenged the judgments last mentioned by way of a complaint to ORG .", "The complaint appears to be still pending ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
