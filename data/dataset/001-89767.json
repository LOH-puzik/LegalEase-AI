The authors made an allegation that the then President of GPE elected in DATE , PERSON , had spent DATE in DATE , before he had been elected to office , in the same hotel as a NORP spy resident in GPE at that time , a certain PERSON , and had had extensive contacts with him . He had at that time been a member of ORG ( PERSON ) and represented the ORG of the NORP Left ( ORG \u201c the SLD \u201d ) .", "The opening text under the heading read :", "\u201c There were no accidental visitors to the PERSON [ a hotel in W\u0142adys\u0142awowo ] . The \u00e9lite of the NORP post - communists and business had been spending their holidays there for a long time . And , as it happens , an agent of the NORP intelligence services , PERSON , also stayed there . And they formed , as the employees of the hotel say , ' a particularly close - knit company ' .", "The article read :", "\u201c PERSON [ the President ] often spent his holidays in FAC in GPE ] . In DATE he arrived there with his family and took a room in the Rybitwa . Subsequently , PERSON took a room in the same building . The PERSON should not be confused with the main building of FAC . The latter can house up to CARDINAL people , while the LOC , situated only a short distance away in a secluded place contains CARDINAL apartments .", "As the employees of the ORG say , visitors to the PERSON are most certainly not there by chance . Most often they are friends of PERSON , the ORG 's director , a former official of the NORP ORG ( PZPR ) . NORP officials often visited the ORG , and later also officials of the SLD . When wellknown public figures visited the hotel it was kept under special surveillance by security agents . The PERSON visited PERSON from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . They got the best apartment , on the third floor . On CARDINAL DATE , in TIME , PERSON arrived at the LOC and remained there also until DATE . He was introduced to the employees by the deputy director of the ORG as a \u201c special guest of director PERSON .", "This colonel of the NORP intelligence was given apartment no . CARDINAL , just beside the main entrance to the hotel and close to the reception room . Neither A. nor PERSON was listed in the official list of the hotel 's guests , even though it was mandatory . Nonetheless , thanks to the efforts of some of the former employees of the Centre , we managed to obtain copies of invoices by which they had both paid for their stay in the PERSON .", "After we announced on DATE the publication of the present article , at DATE 's press conference the journalists asked PERSON whether he had ever had contacts with A. ' I have never met him ' said the President firmly . Nevertheless , having conducted some investigations , we have found persons who tell us of meetings which A. and PERSON held at FAC . We have talked with CARDINAL employees of the LOC , past and current . Most of them are afraid to talk about what was going on in the LOC . Some of them remember , however , that its visitors were good chums . They often had drinking parties . On CARDINAL such occasion A. and PERSON were seen together .", "CARDINAL former employee remembers another meeting between PERSON and GPE This time , it was a t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate .", "' They met in the socalled lower dining room in the main building of ORG says the employee , who was serving at their table .", "' Apart from PERSON and the NORP , nobody else was present . I remember that they spoke in NORP , but some NORP words were thrown in from time to time .

DATE he worked in GPE embassy in GPE . DATE he was First Secretary of the embassy responsible for political affairs , and at the same time deputy to the Head of the ORG in GPE , General PERSON .", "A. formally left the service in DATE . After that he worked as a socalled secondline officer , which meant that he carried on his spying activities , posing as a businessman and a civilian without any links to the NORP State apparatus . He became known in GPE after it became publicly known that he had been a longtime friend of the then Prime Minister , PERSON . Minister [ of ORG ] PERSON accused PERSON of being a spy . However , the investigation was discontinued as the prosecution authorities found that there was insufficient evidence to put PERSON on trial .", "During his stays in GPE A. was , as far back as DATE , kept under surveillance by ORG ( ORG ) . In the White Paper , a compilation of documents published by ORG and relating to the PERSON case , we find information that during DATE the NORP was in ORG . However , we find no information there about his activities or contacts during that time \u2013 despite the fact that there is a wealth of information concerning his movements before and after his stay in ORG .", "In DATE ORG warned PERSON that he should sever his ties with A.

It summarised the affair in which in DATE TIME , the then Minister of the ORG , declared in ORG that the then Prime Minister PERSON , a member of the same political party to which the President had belonged before his election in DATE , had been a NORP spy recruited by PERSON", "The President lodged a civil action with ORG against the applicant and the publishing house which published \u201c GPE \u201d , claiming that the defendants should publish apologies for the text , which he qualified as deliberately misleading given that he had never met PERSON He also requested that the applicants pay , jointly , MONEY ( ORG ) to ORG .", "During the proceedings the court heard evidence from CARDINAL witnesses with whom the authors had spoken before the article was published and CARDINAL other witnesses whom they had contacted after its publication . The court further heard evidence from CARDINAL witnesses called by the plaintiff . It also had regard to CARDINAL documents submitted by both parties , which all related to the plaintiff 's schedule and private and public activities DATE . The court examined an expert opinion verifying the plaintiff 's signature on attendance lists of various parliamentary bodies during the material period .", "The applicants argued , inter alia , that in publishing the article they had exercised their freedom of expression , and referred to LAW .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court partially allowed the plaintiff 's claim . It had regard to CARDINAL documents relating to the essential message of the article , namely that the plaintiff had spent his holidays in W\u0142adys\u0142awowo in DATE at the same time as A. and had had friendly contacts with him . The court concluded that the evidence before it was insufficient to make a finding that the applicants had shown sufficient diligence in gathering the material for their article . It further observed that the material which they had had at their disposal before publication was insufficient for the conclusion , which they had nevertheless presented in the article , that the plaintiff had indeed spent the period concerned in PERSON , that he had been A 's friend and that they had stayed in the same hotel at the same time .", "It ordered the applicants to publish an apology in their newspaper , worded as follows :", "\u201c Editor - in - chief of \u201c \u017bycie \u201d [ ... ] and [ the second and third applicant ] present their apologies to Mr PERSON for having breached his personal rights by publishing in \u201c GPE \u201d of DATE , No .

No award regarding the reimbursement of other costs borne by the plaintiff was made .", "The applicants appealed . They argued that the courts had failed to establish the facts of the case correctly and had wrongly assessed the evidence . This failure had had a direct bearing on the court 's conclusion that they had failed to act with diligence when preparing and publishing the article concerned . They further argued that the court had ordered them to publish an apology with a different content from that requested by the plaintiff . The applicants finally referred to the LAW , in so far as it guaranteed freedom of expression and access to information .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the appeal in so far as the first - instance court had ordered the applicants to apologise for the photographs published on the first page of the newspaper and for the caption underneath , and discontinued the proceedings in the relevant part . The court observed in this connection that the plaintiff 's claim had not related to the photographs and the caption and that the court , consequently , had not been required to rule over and above the claim .", "The court dismissed the appeal in its remainder .", "It observed that the provisions of the LAW adopted in DATE relied on by the applicants could not be applied because they had entered into force after the events concerned . Nonetheless , at the material time freedom of expression had been guaranteed by LAW , ratified by GPE in DATE . The court went on to state :", "\u201c The caselaw of ORG provides that freedom of expression of the press plays an essential role in a NORP society . Although the press should not overstep certain bounds , in particular in respect of reputation and rights of others , its duty is nevertheless to impart DATE in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest . There is little scope for restrictions on political speech or on debate on questions of public interest . The limits of acceptable criticism are wider with regard to a politician than with regard to a private individual . A politician is entitled , like any other citizen , to legal protection of his or her personal rights and reputation , but the scope of this protection is considerably narrower than in respect of private individuals . Such an interpretation of LAW was made in [ the ORG 's ] cases PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; PERSON v. GPE , CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ( ... ) All these cases were brought [ to the ORG ] by journalists who had been parties to criminal proceedings on charges of defamation against politicians . Neither the veracity of information which they had published nor their diligence had been challenged by domestic courts . None the less , various criminal sanctions had been imposed on them . The [ NORP ] Court did not criticise the mere fact that the applicants had been found criminally liable ; it found violations of LAW finding that the measures complained of had not been necessary in a democratic society . \u201d", "The court further noted that the article had attributed to the plaintiff close and friendly contacts with the agent of the ORG , an assertion which in NORP society could not but provoke negative reactions . Hence , the firstinstance court had been right in its finding that the plaintiff 's reputation , protected by LAW as one of his personal rights , could be negatively affected . The defendants ' conduct could only be protected if it was found to be lawful within the meaning of that provision . However , it could not be so qualified . It was true that the defendants had shown diligence and good faith when gathering the material for the article , in that they had talked with many persons who could have known about the plaintiff 's holidays in DATE . Nevertheless , the conclusions which they had drawn on the basis of that material published in their article , were seriously flawed . While there had been sufficient grounds for a finding that the plaintiff and his family had spent some time in the hotel concerned in DATE and DATE , it was also clear that during this period the plaintiff had left W\u0142adys\u0142awowo from time to time to attend to his political duties . There were no indications , let alone any sound evidence to show that he as much as had ever seen PERSON during this period , let alone been friends with him , as was strongly suggested , or that the CARDINAL men had met in private while at the LOC . While it was true that , on the whole , the article did not contain obvious statements of opinion , it was clearly implied that the plaintiff 's conduct had been reprehensible .", "The court went on to state that the reasoning of the first - instance court as to the admissibility and assessment of the voluminous evidence before it had been correct and logical . The defendants had failed to show that the article 's conclusion that the plaintiff and PERSON had indeed been friends , who in DATE had spent holidays together , had any factual basis . Their conduct when publishing the article presenting such a conclusion regarding facts , based on manifestly flimsy grounds , was open to criticism and the lower court had been right in making such a finding .", "The court further noted that in the same issue another article had been published . It referred to the close contacts between PERSON , one of the leaders of the party to which the plaintiff belonged , and PERSON The tone of the article concerned , seen in that context , clearly suggested to the reader that there might have been close relations also between the plaintiff and the ORG officer in question . This was not sufficiently borne out by the evidence , either that gathered by the plaintiffs prior to the publication or that available to the first - instance court .", "The applicants lodged a cassation appeal with ORG , making essentially complaints similar to those contained in their appeal .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the judgment of the appellate court in so far as it had dismissed the applicants ' appeal , and remitted the case to be reheard by that court .", "ORG observed :", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW the press is obliged to safeguard the citizens ' right to obtain reliable information , to ensure transparency of the public life and to exercise public control and supervision of public affairs . This is why the press enjoys the freedom of speech and print , guaranteed by LAW , and when the impugned article was published \u2013 by the constitutional provisions as amended in DATE and DATE , and also by LAW . The importance of tasks to be fulfilled by the press and their character taken together with the freedom it should enjoy provide foundations for its crucial role in a democratic society . This is why it is often referred to as \u201c a fourth power \u201d .", "The press is obliged to impart an accurate picture of social phenomena which it presents to the public . The significance of this duty flows from the fact that it has been included in LAW . Hence , it is not open to doubt that the press should provide accurate information . However , the obligations incumbent on journalists could not be interpreted as a straightforward obligation to present only \u201c true \u201d information to society . Similarly , one can not say that every instance of publishing untrue information amounts to unreliability on the part of the press . It should be borne in mind that the journalists have at their disposal only limited measures , that it is impossible for them to have access to all sources of information and that , as a result , it often is not feasible to give a complete picture of a given situation or event . If the journalists were obliged to write only \u201c truth \u201d , it would amount to a serious restriction on the exercise of the freedom of expression guaranteed by LAW .", "ORG referred to the ORG v. GPE judgment of ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . ORG , ORG CARDINALVI ) . However , it noted that journalists were obliged to act with diligence when gathering and verifying information for the purposes of publication . It was a lack of such diligence which could make their conduct unlawful and consequently entail a breach of LAW . It had not been convincingly demonstrated that the defendants ' conduct when preparing and publishing the article concerned had lacked such diligence . Hence , the judgment of the appellate court had to be quashed and the applicants ' appeal reexamined .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG reexamined the applicants ' appeal and dismissed it . As a result , the firstinstance order to publish their apologies for having published the article was upheld . The defendants were also ordered to pay ORG CARDINAL to the defendant to cover his costs incurred in the appellate proceedings .", "The court was of the view that the defendants had failed to show diligence when gathering the material on which they had later based their article . The evidence gathered by them and by the first - instance court had shown that the plaintiff had indeed been in ORG to CARDINAL DATE which , in any event , had not been in dispute . However , on DATE he had travelled from GPE to GPE . Subsequently , he had come back to GPE on DATE and from that date until CARDINAL DATE had attended to his political duties , as confirmed by various witnesses and documents . In the light of the evidence , there had been no grounds on which to accept that he had been in ORG from CARDINAL to DATE , when PERSON had been spending his holidays there . Likewise , there were no grounds for a conclusion that the plaintiff and ORG had been friends or that they had been members of a \u201c particularly close - knit company \u201d as alleged in the article .", "The court concluded that in the light of the evidence gathered by the defendants themselves prior to publication of the article and , additionally , other evidence submitted to the first - instance court , the conclusions drawn by the defendants , namely that the president and PERSON had spent DATE in the same hotel as good friends , lacked any factual basis . It was of the view that the defendants had not demonstrated the necessary objectivity and detachment when presenting their conclusions to the public , also because they had omitted to present in reasonable detail the basis on which they had reached those conclusions .", "The applicants lodged a cassation appeal with ORG , raising various procedural complaints to the effect that the courts had failed to establish the facts of the case correctly and had wrongly assessed the evidence .", "By a decision of DATE served on the applicants ' lawyer on CARDINAL DATE , ORG refused to entertain their appeal .", "LAW , adopted in DATE , provides as follows :", "\u201c GPE shall ensure freedom of the press and other means of social communication . \u201d", "LAW reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
