THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE . The second applicant , also a NORP national , is his wife , born in DATE . The third and fourth applicants are their children , born respectively in DATE and DATE . The applicants were represented in the initial stages of the application by the first applicant and then by PERSON , a legal consultant with ORG , GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant was the owner of a NORP restaurant situated in a designated conservation area in the centre of GPE . The applicant and his family lived on the LOC . In DATE the applicants had to abandon their restaurant and their home above it on account of the emission of toxic cellulose paint spray fumes from a warehouse ( unit CARDINAL ) used by a company ( \u201c Namesakes \u201d ) owned by a Mr PERSON . The company was engaged in the manufacture of wooden toys . In addition to the financial loss they suffered as a result of the closure of their business , the applicants\u2019 health ( as well as that of others living in the locality ) was also badly affected by the toxic emissions .", "A complaint was first made to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in DATE . Subsequent complaints followed . Although the ORG served a prohibition notice and an abatement notice on the company DATE and DATE , it would appear that no steps were taken to enforce these notices . In DATE the company relocated its activities and the applicants returned to their premises in DATE .", "The applicants insist that the paint spraying operation was illegal and that the ORG has tried to conceal the illegality by purporting there to be planning permission for the activity operating out of unit CARDINAL . They maintain , inter alia ,", "The applicants commenced litigation against Mr PERSON in DATE . The applicants subsequently sued the ORG , claiming damages for personal injury and damage to property . They contended that the ORG acted beyond its discretion , ultra vires and abused its power by purporting there to be planning permission when , according to the ORG \u2019s own records , no planning permission had ever been granted to the building ( unit CARDINAL ) where the company \u2019s operation took place . The actions against the company and the ORG were consolidated .", "On DATE Mr Justice PERSON , on the application of the ORG , ordered that the applicants\u2019 writ against the ORG be struck out as showing no cause of action either under statute or at common law . Mr Justice PERSON considered that the applicants\u2019 primary remedy was the private law remedy for damages and/or an injunction against the company to stop the nuisance . Mr Justice PERSON also referred to the range of remedies which allowed an individual to protect himself in the event of a local authority not taking action to bring an end to a nuisance , including a private law claim against the person creating the nuisance and the laying of a complaint before a ORG .", "According to the applicants , Mr Justice PERSON , without justification , diverted the basis of their claim by proceeding on the assumption that planning permission had been given in DATE to the company to use unit CARDINAL for its paint spraying activity .", "On DATE ORG , dismissed the ORG appeal against Mr Justice PERSON ruling . According to the applicants , ORG accepted the false statement of the ORG that planning permission was in place without requiring it to substantiate this or to have regard to their evidence disproving the ORG \u2019s assertion .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "The first applicant subsequently complained to the ORG that a pottery business which had taken over occupancy of CARDINAL of the units ( unit CARDINAL ) was emitting smells and noises and that it did not benefit from planning permission . He contended that planning permission had never been granted in respect of either unit CARDINAL or unit CARDINAL .", "At the meeting held on DATE the ORG \u2019s planning committee ( \u201c the committee \u201d ) decided that there had been no breach of planning conditions and that no enforcement action had to be taken against the owner of the pottery business . According to the first applicant , the committee did not answer his challenge to the very existence of planning permission for the use of units CARDINAL and CARDINAL . The first applicant insists that the committee was deliberately misinformed by its officers about the scope of the original planning application made by Mr PERSON \u2019s company and the true state of the planning record .", "The first applicant was present at part of the meeting and made representations to the committee . According to the first applicant , he only received official notification of the committee \u2019s decision on DATE through a ORG official who had agreed to reconsider the local authority \u2019s decision . The ORG official confirmed in the letter that the premises were being used legitimately and added that any smells or fumes emanating from the premises were intermittent and did not constitute a statutory nuisance .", "On DATE , DATE after being notified of the committee \u2019s decision , the first applicant sought leave to apply for judicial review . He maintained , inter alia , that the ORG had failed to take enforcement proceedings against the owner of the pottery business who was operating it without the necessary planning permission .", "The first applicant stresses that , in the ensuing judicial review proceedings , the ORG argued that planning permission had been granted to unit CARDINAL . However , this was in contradiction to the stance the ORG had taken in the earlier civil proceedings in which it contended that unit CARDINAL benefited from planning permission . The first applicant reiterates that the true position is that neither unit benefited from planning permission since the records showed that planning permission only covered a storage building at the rear of their home and restaurant . The first applicant draws attention to his view that ORG officials fraudulently deleted the existence of the storage on the planning documentation which was submitted in the judicial review proceedings .", "On DATE Mr Justice PERSON refused the first applicant \u2019s request for an adjournment to enable him to put forward evidence as to why he had delayed the initiation of the leave proceedings in respect of the decision of DATE . The judge considered that the applicant had ample time to produce such evidence between the date when the ORG notified him that it would oppose the application on grounds of delay and the start of the proceedings . The judge dismissed the first applicant \u2019s application for leave to apply for judicial review .", "On appeal , Lord Justice PERSON conceded that the scope of Mr PERSON \u2019s application for planning permission and the extent of the permission granted was not entirely clear . However , with reference to Order CARDINAL , rule CARDINAL ) of the Rules of ORG and by analogy with time - limits laid down in planning legislation , Lord Justice PERSON found himself :", "\u201c ... driven to the conclusion that here the application was not made promptly , as required by LAW , rule CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG . There seems to be no reason why the applicant should have waited to receive the letter of DATE before seeking to challenge the decision of CARDINALth DATE . I can find no good reason to extend the period laid down by the LAW . \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON further observed that , even if DATE the use made of the LOC was unauthorised , it was now too late for the local authority to institute enforcement action . Lords Justices PERSON and PERSON agreed with Lord Justice PERSON \u2019s reasoning . In a judgment dated CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s renewed application .", "The first applicant points out that Lord Justice PERSON had sat in ORG in the appeal against the ruling of Mr Justice PERSON and failed to draw the attention of his colleagues hearing the appeal on the applicant \u2019s judicial review application to the fact that the ORG had earlier argued that planning only related to unit CARDINAL , whereas in the judicial proceedings it was now claiming that it only covered unit CARDINAL .", "Meanwhile , the applicants\u2019 civil claim in ORG against PERSON had been stayed pending the outcome of the proceedings against the ORG . In DATE Mr PERSON applied for an order that directions be given for the future conduct of the applicants\u2019 claim .", "On DATE Deputy Master PERSON ordered that the stay be lifted and that the case be transferred from FAC in GPE to GPE ORG . Deputy Master PERSON noted in this connection that the proceedings against the ORG had come to an end and , moreover , that ORG had on DATE declared inadmissible an application lodged by the applicants ( no . ORG ) .", "The applicants appealed against the Order . The ORG appeal was heard by PERSON Justice PERSON on DATE . The applicants argued that it was premature to lift the stay in the proceedings since they had lodged a further application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) with the ORG in GPE contesting the ORG \u2019s inadmissibility decision of DATE . Mr Justice PERSON dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal on this point . Having examined the ORG \u2019s inadmissibility decision , he considered that the applicants\u2019 fresh application had no prospects of success . As to the applicants\u2019 objection to the transfer of the civil action from GPE to GPE , the judge concluded that Deputy Master PERSON has reached his decision in the proper exercise of his discretion on case management issues .", "COMPLAINTS", "The applicants maintain that the ORG \u2019s inadmissibility decision of DATE ( application no . CARDINAL ) is based on an incorrect statement of the facts and that the legal reasoning is seriously flawed . They contend that the ORG in that decision committed the same error as the domestic courts by assuming that planning permission had been granted to PERSON by the ORG in DATE and at no stage addressed themselves to the true scope of the permission actually given . The applicants submit that the ORG should establish what was actually granted by the ORG under planning application no . CARDINAL . DATE and to reach its decision with reference to the documentation that they have supplied . They maintain that the documentation clearly shows that neither unit CARDINAL nor unit CARDINAL was covered by planning permission and that the only premises addressed in planning application no . CARDINAL was a storage building .", "The applicants assert that the facts of their case disclose breaches of ORG , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention and Article CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL thereto insofar as an illegal industrial activity has been deliberately allowed to operate to the detriment of their health and property and the ORG has knowingly sought to conceal the true nature of the planning record and to purport throughout that planning permission had been given .", "Furthermore , the facts relied on show that they had no effective remedy to obtain a determination of their complaints against the ORG and its officers who acted unlawfully and abused their powers by purporting there to be planning permission for the illegal activity . They rely on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention .", "The applicants submit that they have been discriminated against on account of , among other things , their NORP origin and have been treated differently from those responsible for the emission of the toxic fumes behind their home and restaurant . They rely on LAW in conjunction with ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention and Article CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL .", "With reference to the pending civil action against PERSON , the applicants stress that the outcome of that action is closely linked to the question whether PERSON can rely on the grant by the Council of planning permission to carry on his paint spraying operation . In their submission , if the domestic courts were to accept PERSON defence , despite clear evidence to the effect that ORG officials purported there to be planning permission for his activity and unlawfully misled the domestic courts in the litigation against the ORG by manipulating and concealing the true nature of the planning record , there would a breach of their rights under LAW , DATE , DATE and DATE of the Convention . They maintain that the ORG was biased n favour of Mr PERSON .", "The applicants contend , among other things , that Mr Justice PERSON in his judgment of DATE did not act independently or impartially since he did not query the documents allegedly showing that the ORG had given Mr PERSON planning permission , and this despite evidence confirming that ORG officials had acknowledged that this was not the case . They invoke Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "The applicants further contend under LAW that the judge was wrong to rely on certain statements in the ORG \u2019s inadmissibility decision of DATE , misconstrued the essence of their claim against the ORG and made impermissible use of domestic case law .", "The applicants insist that the facts relied on disclose a breach of their rights under LAW since the domestic courts treated their claim as a claim based on damage caused by a legal activity , whereas the true basis of their claim was that they had suffered harm on account of an unlawful activity .", "The applicants further allege a violation of LAW , including in conjunction with LAW . They maintain that they have been discriminated against on account of their NORP origin and that by denying them their rights to a fair hearing ORG failed to treat them on an equal footing to other citizens .", "The applicants argue that the facts of the case give rise to a breach of LAW .", "With reference to LAW the applicants state that the judge purported that the toxic emissions from which they suffered emanated from a legal industrial activity , whereas that activity was illegal and interfered with their property rights .", "The first applicant lodged the above application on DATE . In the proceedings before the ORG , the applicant is represented by PERSON , a legal consultant with ORG , GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG of ORG refused the applicants\u2019 petition for leave to appeal . TIME of the proceedings recorded that the ORG could apply for its costs and if the application was granted the amount would be certified if no agreement could be reached on it .", "The first applicant \u2019s solicitor at the time received a notification dated DATE to attend a taxation hearing regarding the costs incurred by the ORG in respect of the applicants\u2019 petition for leave to appeal to the ORG of the ORG against the decision of ORG in the civil proceedings against the ORG referred to in application no.CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "A taxation hearing was held on DATE before the Judicial Taxing Officer of ORG . By a decision of DATE , the Judicial Taxing Officer of ORG allowed the ORG \u2019s bill of costs in full ( MONEY ) .", "The first applicant protested about the decision , including through his MP , but without success . The first applicant maintained that the ORG had not been invited to make submissions on the above - mentioned petition ( and which was in effect ex parte ) , that his solicitor had informed him that he had never seen any such submissions , that the ORG had never discussed with his solicitor that it would be making an application for costs and what the nature of those costs would be and that the Taxing Officer had abused his powers .", "The first applicant sought to challenge this decision by way of judicial review . By letter dated DATE the first applicant was informed by ORG that ORG had no jurisdiction in the matter since its jurisdiction only extended to decisions of inferior courts and tribunals .", "COMPLAINTS", "The first applicant complains , inter alia , that the Taxing Officer abused his discretion , acted in breach of procedural rules , was biased against him and overlooked the fact that the local authority itself had not complied with ORG own practice directions on the matter of costs . He submits that the Taxing Officer ordered him to pay the ORG \u2019s inflated costs in the absence of any authority to do so and further maintains that there was no justification for seeking the ORG \u2019s comments on his petition before it had been considered by ORG .", "The first applicant submits that he was denied a fair hearing in the proceedings before the Taxing Officer , had no effective remedy in respect of the decision reached by him and was the victim of an abuse of rights since the Taxing Officer awarded costs to the defendant ORG to which it was not entitled .", "The first applicant relies on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention .", "The application was lodged on DATE . In the proceedings before ORG , the first applicant is represented by PERSON , a legal consultant with ORG , GPE , GPE .", "The first applicant joined ORG ( \u201c FSB \u201d ) in DATE . He paid his membership fee , and thereafter renewed his membership DATE . His decision to become a member was influenced by the ORG \u2019s undertaking in its promotional literature to pay legal and accountancy fees up to GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL in dealing with an in - depth Inland Revenue investigation .", "The Inland Revenue carried out an in - depth investigation of the first applicant in DATE , after he had sought advice from the tax authorities about his tax situation . In DATE the Inland Revenue cleared the first applicant of any suspicion of fraud . The first applicant sought to be indemnified for the accountants\u2019/consultants\u2019 costs he had incurred in defending himself during the investigation . According to the first applicant , the ORG \u2019s insurer reversed its initial decision not to indemnify him and agreed to reimburse him the costs he had incurred , only to renege later on its promise . The first applicant declined the insurance company \u2019s proposal to submit the full claim to arbitration . Dissatisfied with the outcome of his dealings with the insurer , on DATE the first applicant sued the ORG for breach of contract , relying on the ORG \u2019s unqualified undertaking to cover its ORG costs .", "On DATE District Judge PERSON ordered that the first applicant \u2019s claim be struck out as disclosing no cause of action against the ORG . The judge accepted ORG \u2019s defence that the first applicant \u2019s claim lay against the insurance company which underwrote the undertaking and that ORG \u2019s obligation was limited to introducing him to an insurer .", "On appeal , His Honour Judge PERSON , on DATE , ordered that the first applicant \u2019s claim be reinstated , being satisfied , firstly , that there was no contractual relationship between the first applicant and the insurance company and , secondly , that the first applicant \u2019s only avenue of redress was to sue the ORG with which he had concluded a contract . Further directions for trial of the case were to be given by a District Judge .", "On DATE District Judge PERSON ordered that the question whether the ORG was liable to the first applicant and , if so , the scope of its liability , be determined as a preliminary issue .", "On DATE His Honour Judge PERSON ordered that all matters relating to the case were to be tried in the current trial window . The first applicant sought leave to appeal against that order in the hope of having the issue of liability tried separately .", "On DATE Mr PERSON proceeded to try the issue of the ORG \u2019s liability to the first applicant . Following a hearing , the judge found on the evidence , and with reference to domestic case - law ( the ORG of Lords\u2019 decision in PERSON v. ORG ) , that the ORG had only agreed to gave the first applicant the benefit of an insurance policy to guard against the expenses incurred as a result of an in - depth tax investigation . The first applicant \u2019s claim to be indemnified therefore lay against the insurer , and not with the ORG . The judge however expressed the view that the ORG could have clarified better in its advertising what the scope of its obligation was in this area . The first applicant appealed .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal following a hearing . Having reviewed the documents relied on by the applicant , Lord Justice Laws considered that the first applicant had not made out a case that he had concluded a contract with the ORG under which the ORG would meet without qualification all of the expenses incurred by the first applicant in the course of an in - depth FAC investigation . In his opinion , the words used by the ORG were not inconsistent with an intention to provide insurance services rather than an unqualified indemnity . Furthermore , the provision to the first applicant of insurance documentation at the time he joined the ORG indicated that his membership entailed his access to insurance services .", "Complaints", "The first applicant maintains that the domestic courts distorted the facts of the case , reached conclusions in the absence of evidence , erred on matters of law , diverted the basis of his claim , abused their powers and did not act independently and impartially . He refers , among other things , to the improper manner in which Mr PERSON and ORG dealt with the issues before them and to the fact that the ORG took it upon himself to decide who was the correct defendant to the proceedings , even though this issue had already been settled by Judge PERSON . The first applicant relies on LAW to condemn these and other breaches of his right to a fair hearing which he has identified .", "Under LAW , the first applicant complains that ORG reached its decision by adducing a document which did not exist , thereby abusing its power and acting without authority by assuming there was such a document .", "The first applicant further relies on LAW . He maintains , among other things , that he was discriminated against in his access to justice on account of his status as a litigant in person .", "The first applicant finally maintains that the abuse of power on the part of ORG amounts to a breach of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
