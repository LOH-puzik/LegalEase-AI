The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant attended The Lord PERSON , a maintained secondary ( foundation ) school ( \u201c the school \u201d ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE a fire was discovered in a waste paper basket in a classroom . The fire brigade took the view that the fire had been started deliberately and the police were informed . The applicant and CARDINAL other pupils were identified as being in the vicinity of the classroom at the time the fire was started . The Deputy Head advised the QUANTITY boys that they should not return to the school until the police investigation was completed . Contrary to the statutory procedure for school exclusions set out in sections DATE of ORG \u201c the DATE LAW ) and ORG and Skills Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( \u201c the ORG circular \u201d ) , no time limit was placed on the applicant 's exclusion ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head Teacher wrote to the applicant 's parents to tell them that he remained excluded from school until DATE . She offered to provide extra work for the applicant and stated that if his parents so wished , they could write to the Chairman of Governors to discuss the matter with them . This letter did not comply with LAW and the PERSON circular as it failed to advise the applicant 's parents that they had a right of appeal to ORG . Moreover , the Governors also failed in their duty to hold a hearing to confirm the exclusion or re - instate the applicant as required under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Head Teacher wrote to the applicant 's parents to exclude him further until DATE . The letter was drafted in similar terms to that of DATE , and for the same reasons it failed to comply with the statutory requirements in LAW and the PERSON circular .", "CARDINAL . During the period of exclusion , the school had been sending the applicant revision - based , self - assessing work in mathematics , LANGUAGE and science . This continued until DATE , the date of the applicant 's final Standard Assessment Tests ( \u201c SATs \u201d ) . He was permitted to attend school from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE in order to sit these examinations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the school met and were informed that the CARDINAL pupils suspected of involvement in the fire had been excluded . Contrary to the requirements of LAW , ORG did not convene a Governor 's ORG or consider either the exclusion of the applicant or whether he should be reinstated .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was charged with the offence of arson against the school and he entered a not - guilty plea . On DATE the Deputy Head Teacher wrote again to the applicant 's parents . She indicated that as some of the witnesses in the case were students at the school , the applicant and the other CARDINAL boys could not be permitted to return until the proceedings were concluded . She further indicated that she was making a referral to the access panel for alternative provision for the applicant 's education . Finally , she advised the applicant 's parents that he was being excluded for DATE from DATE and that the school would continue to set work as appropriate . The applicant 's parents were asked to contact the school to arrange to collect the work . They did not contact the school and no work was set after DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a form referring the applicant to ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) for the provision of alternative education was finalised , although it was not received by the ORG until DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW there was a standard CARDINAL-day maximum period for fixed term exclusions . That CARDINAL-day period expired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG notified the applicant 's solicitors that the prosecution had been discontinued on the ground that there was insufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction . DATE the applicant attended court and the proceedings were formally ended . He then went to the school to meet with the Head Teacher , who advised him that she would act to arrange his re - entry as soon as she received written confirmation of the cessation of criminal proceedings . She received a fax to this effect from the court on DATE and official notification from the police on DATE . On DATE she wrote to the applicant 's parents , inviting them to attend a meeting on DATE to facilitate his re - integration . The invitation was extended again on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG 's access panel met on DATE , unaware that proceedings against the applicant had been discontinued . The panel recommended that the applicant should be provided with tuition by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) until a decision was taken on his future at the school . The ORG offers part - time education to children who are out of school , generally because they have been excluded , but it is not required to provide the full national curriculum . On DATE the ORG 's Flexible Learning Co - ordinator wrote to the applicant 's parents to inform them that the ORG would provide tuition until term ended on DATE while the school resolved the exclusion issue . The school alleged , and the domestic courts subsequently accepted , that ORG had again contacted the applicant 's parents in DATE and they had declined the offer of tuition . The applicant 's parents , however , deny that any offer was made at DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's parents did not attend the meeting with the Head Teacher on DATE . The reason for non - attendance was heavily contested but the judge at first instance concluded that they had chosen to stay away . CARDINAL of the other QUANTITY boys did attend and was admitted back to the school . However , as a consequence of their non - attendance , the Head Teacher wrote to the applicant 's parents to advise them that she was removing the applicant from the school roll . The school governors and the ORG were also copied in . The applicant 's name remained on the roll until DATE although he was not provided with any education by the school during this period .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was due to begin the first term of DATE of his ORG studies . He did not return to the school . At DATE , the ORG 's welfare service completed a notification of absence . On DATE the ORG wrote to the Head Teacher , stating that the applicant was in GPE and that a place at the school was not required for him . The judge at first instance accepted that this was wrong : the applicant had not been in GPE and had been at home all along . Neither the school nor the ORG contacted the applicant again before removing his name from the roll , and the applicant and his parents were not subsequently informed of the removal .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant 's family met with FAC - ordinator . At this stage they were unsure about whether they wished the applicant to return to the school . They were advised to decide quickly , and to arrange interviews either at the school or at other schools so that he could resume his education on a full - time basis . From DATE in DATE , the applicant 's parents made it clear that he wished to return to the school . On DATE the applicant 's father wrote to the Head Teacher formally to request his re - instatement . On DATE the Deputy Head Teacher replied , advising that the applicant 's name had been removed from the roll , that his place had been allocated to a student on the waiting list and that the school was now oversubscribed in his year group . The applicant 's father was advised to contact the ORG to find another school place . On DATE the applicant was admitted to a new school , ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant issued a free - standing human rights claim against the school in ORG , claiming , inter alia , that his right to education had been violated contrary to LAW . CARDINAL to the LAW . The ORG was not a party to the proceedings . The case was transferred to ORG . In rejecting the application , the judge held that the school was not the cause of the respondent 's lack of suitable education DATE and DATE term on DATE because his family had declined the ORG 's offer of tuition . The cause of the respondent 's lack of schooling or education during DATE was more complex to ascertain but it was the ORG 's responsibility to provide suitable education and there were educational facilities available to him . Thus although the decisions to exclude the respondent and to remove him from the roll were unlawful in domestic law , and could have been challenged by judicial review , they did not give rise to a liability in damages for breach of his rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , ORG found that the provision of self - assessing work during DATE of exclusion amounted to sufficient access to education to answer the applicant 's Convention claim . However , ORG held that the respondent 's right to education was denied DATE and DATE , notwithstanding that the school was still offering to provide him with substitute work to do at home , a matter held to be relevant only to damages . In relation to the last phase of the respondent 's exclusion , from DATE \u2013 DATE , ORG regarded removal of the respondent 's name from the school roll as improper , although giving rise to no separate legal consequences . But the respondent 's exclusion during this period was , as the judge held , unlawful and unreasonable . In para CARDINAL of the judgment ORG concluded :", "\u201c So characterised , the exclusion of [ the respondent ] from DATE until he was finally placed in a new school amounts , in my judgment , to a further denial of his Convention right to education . It was complete and it was prolonged . It was not terminated by the deletion of [ the respondent 's ] name from the school roll because there was no lawful ground for deletion . To the extent that it may nevertheless have been acquiesced in , the damage may be mitigated . But this is not our present concern , and it will require ( if the case goes that far ) a factual inquiry into a number of things including the family 's state of knowledge and understanding . \u201d", "\u201c ... the bare existence of the education authority 's fallback duty , together with [ the respondent 's ] right to seek to enforce it , relieves the school either of its obligations or of the legal consequences of failing to discharge them . On the contrary , it is on the CARDINAL public authorities who are the present respondents ( or put more realistically , the school ) that the state has chosen to devolve the material elements of the obligation which it has undertaken to provide universal secondary education . It is the head teacher and the governing body who in law bear the primary duty to educate a child who has been accepted in their school and , as a corollary , not to exclude him except as authorised by law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The school was granted leave to appeal to ORG . In the course of the proceedings , the applicant did not contest the lower courts ' rejection of his complaint that the period of exclusion DATE and DATE had violated his rights under LAW No . CARDINAL . In relation to the period of exclusion after DATE , ORG unanimously held , albeit for different reasons , that there had been no violation of LAW No . CARDINAL . The majority accepted that the applicant 's exclusion from school was at times unlawful , but held that there would be a denial of the Convention right only if there were a systemic failure of the education system which resulted in the applicant 's not having access to a minimum level of education . As regards the scope of LAW No . CARDINAL , Lord PERSON stated that :", "\u201c This does not however guarantee access to any particular educational institution the domestic system does provide : see ORG DATE ) CARDINAL DR CARDINAL . Nor is there a right to remain in any particular institution . Everyone is no doubt entitled to be educated to a minimum standard ( R ( ORG ) v Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) but the right under article CARDINAL extends no further . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG found that in this case there was no systemic failure of the education system : the applicant 's parents failed to collect work from the school ; the offer of tuition from the ORG was declined ; the applicant 's parents failed to attend the meeting at the school on DATE ; and finally , during the autumn the ORG 's attempts to secure the applicant 's re - admission to school were thwarted by his parents ' uncertainty . Baroness PERSON of GPE , however , was concerned that the applicant had been let down badly by the school , although she also allowed the appeal because , in view of the judge 's findings , it would not have been just to require the school to pay damages when the applicant 's parents had refused various offers of tuition . Nevertheless she indicated that this was the paradigm of a case in which it would be just and appropriate to grant the applicant a declaration that the school had acted in a way that was incompatible with his rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) places on the Secretary of ORG for ORG the general duty of promoting education for the people of GPE and GPE . This obligation has been largely discharged by LEAs . Pursuant to sections DATE of LAW , the ORG has a general responsibility for education and is required to secure that efficient primary and secondary education are available to meet the needs of the population of their area . ORG ) of the DATE Act further provides that each ORG shall make arrangements for the provision of suitable education at school for those children of compulsory school age who , by reason of exclusion , may not otherwise receive suitable education . Moreover , the ORG circular further provides that the ORG should ensure that temporarily excluded pupils are reintegrated where possible and educated meanwhile .", "CARDINAL . Foundation schools were established under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . They have wider self - governing functions than other maintained schools . Pursuant to LAW CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , LEAs can only intervene in the management of a ORG school if there has been a serious breakdown in the way the school is managed or governed , or the safety of the pupils or staff is threatened . General responsibility for the conduct of the school lies with the governing body ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) , while the Head Teacher is responsible for the internal organisation , management and control of the school ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) of ORG ) ( Terms of Reference ) ( England ) Regulations CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The legislative provisions concerning school exclusions are contained in sections DATE of the DATE Act and the ORG circular . Pursuant to these sections , a Head Teacher of a maintained school may exclude a pupil for a fixed period or permanently , but the pupil may not be excluded for CARDINAL or more fixed periods which amount to DATE in DATE . Exclusions should be for the shortest time necessary , and should not be used for , inter alia , punishing pupils for the behaviour of parents . Where a pupil is excluded , the Head Teacher must take reasonable steps to inform relevant persons ( in this case , the parents ) of the period of exclusion , the reasons for the exclusion , and that he or she may make representations to the governing body . If a pupil is excluded for DATE in any CARDINAL term , the Head Teacher must inform the ORG and the governing body . The governing body must then consider the circumstances in which the pupil was excluded , any representations made by a relevant person , and , where practical , whether the pupil should be reinstated . The ORG must make arrangements for enabling the relevant person to appeal against any decision of the governing body not to reinstate a pupil who has been permanently excluded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
