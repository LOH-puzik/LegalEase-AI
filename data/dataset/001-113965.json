NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP and NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE GPE started issuing a multifunctional smart card called \u201c Opencard \u201d for GPE residents and visitors . It can be used for numerous services offered by the LOC or other providers , including the GPE public transport system .", "CARDINAL . There were CARDINAL kinds of Opencard : ordinary or anonymous . An ordinary card is free of charge and anybody can apply by completing an application form that includes personal details such as name , date of birth , place of residence , email address , telephone number and a photo . Applicants must also sign a consent form on the processing of personal details and provision of information in which they consent to the further processing of the personal data from the application form and from using the card by both GPE and any provider of a service which the applicant would use in the future with the PERSON system . Withdrawal of consent by the applicant results in suspension of the card \u2019s use for services . An anonymous card without any personal identification information costs CARDINAL NORP korunas ( CZK ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) but its use is limited to certain services .", "CARDINAL . DATE an Opencard could be used as a public transport pass . A yearly pass that could be downloaded onto the card cost CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) . Those without an PERSON could not buy a DATE pass but instead could buy CARDINAL DATE passes , which together cost CZK CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG concluded its investigation into the Opencard system and found that GPE had not adequately informed users of the future processing of their personal data and that they were therefore in violation of ORG ( no . CARDINAL ) . The ORG also reiterated its previous opinion that there should be an alternative way to access the services for those not wishing to use an Opencard . It also ordered GPE to offer each PERSON user the possibility of using a card without the necessity of consenting to further processing of his or her personal data .", "CARDINAL . As a result GPE introduced in DATE a third type of PERSON , which is personal . Personal data are printed on the card but not stored or further processed . Adults holding this PERSON can buy long - term passes for public transport under the same conditions as holders of Opencards who gave consent to the processing of their personal details . This new type of card costs CZK CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The current price ( from DATE ) of a yearly pass for GPE public transport is CZK MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL ) for holders of both types of personal LAW CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) for holders of an anonymous PERSON or for those without an PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not want to provide his personal details to GPE and consent to processing , and therefore did not apply for an Opencard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he asked ORG ( a joint - stock company PERCENT owned by GPE ) whether he could buy a yearly pass for the same price as users of the PERSON system . He explained that he did not wish to consent to the processing of his personal data . As he received no reply he bought CARDINAL consecutive DATE passes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he requested ORG to reimburse him CZK CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) , corresponding to the difference between the price of DATE pass and the price he had to pay for DATE passes . Having received no reply , the applicant brought civil proceedings for unjust enrichment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG rejected this claim . It held that the income from fares was further redistributed and thus the defendant was not its only receiver and was therefore not responsible for any loss suffered by the applicant . No appeal lay against that decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal alleging a violation of his right to privacy and fair trial . He argued that the brief judgment of ORG was beyond any legal logic and in effect lacked any reasoning . He further maintained that there was no other remedy in the domestic law to protect him from violations of his private life and that he could only claim compensation for the financial loss he had sustained as a result of refusing to give his personal details .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal as manifestly ill - founded . It held that the subject matter of the proceedings was CARDINAL and , applying the de minimis non curat praetor rule , there could be an interference with fundamental rights only exceptionally in such instances . It did not find any special circumstances in the present case that would require it to hold otherwise . It added that it was obvious that the applicant \u2019s primary concern was not unjust enrichment but protection of his personal data ; however , an action for unjust enrichment was not a means to protect those rights ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
