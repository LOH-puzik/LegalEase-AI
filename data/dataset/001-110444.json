On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE , referring to the absence of a transcript of that hearing in the materials of the case , and remitted the matter to the same court for a fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered , under LAW of LAW , that the term of the applicant \u2019s detention be extended until DATE .

The court dismissed their request for release and extended , on the basis of LAW of LAW , the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE , until DATE , for reasons identical to those cited in its previous decisions .

On DATE ORG scheduled a preliminary hearing in the case for DATE . It also ordered that the preventive measure applied to the applicant in the form of detention on remand remain unchanged . It does not appear that the applicant appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended , with reference to LAW of LAW , the term of the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE , to be calculated from CARDINAL DATE until DATE . The court noted that the term of the applicant \u2019s detention , as previously extended on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , had expired on CARDINAL DATE , and that it had received the case file from ORG only on DATE . The applicant requested the court to release him , referring to the deterioration of his state of health and his stomach ulcer . The court held as follows :", "\u201c ... the accused ...... established in detail ... in the course of the trial , the evidence which could have determined [ his ] guilt [ or innocence ] was not examined ...", "The positive character references of the accused ... do not constitute sufficient grounds to release him ... because , if released , he might abscond ... and hinder the establishment of the truth in the case .", "The court can not take into account ... the claim that the accused is ill and needs medical treatment as he has not submitted any relevant documents .", "The court has not established any procedural violations in respect of his detention on remand . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his counsel appealed against the decision of CARDINAL September CARDINAL , arguing that the previously authorised term of the applicant \u2019s detention had expired on CARDINAL DATE and had not been extended by the court . According to them , the applicant had therefore been detained unlawfully for DATE from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE on appeal . It stated that the fact that the applicant was accused of a particularly serious criminal offence had rightly been taken into account by the first - instance court ; that the applicant \u2019s state of health did not preclude his being kept in custody and that there had , therefore , been sufficient reasons for extending his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG further extended the term of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand until DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively . In its similar decisions the court relied on the same reasons to justify the applicant \u2019s continued detention as those set out in the decision of DATE . The applicant did not appeal against either of those CARDINAL decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . During the hearing witness PERSON . ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) stated that the applicant had sometimes been taken out of his cell for interrogation after TIME , that he had seen a scratch on the applicant \u2019s lip and that the applicant had told him that he had been beaten up . According to PERSON . , he did not remember whether there had been other injuries on the applicant . PERSON . also stated that he had lived at the applicant \u2019s GPE home for DATE and had done some work for them and that the applicant \u2019s family had supported him when he had been detained in the context of another criminal case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment and remitted the case to ORG for a fresh examination . It found , in particular , that the first - instance judgment was based on conflicting evidence . It also held that the preventive measure should remain in place as there were no grounds to release the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case file arrived at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a preliminary hearing in the case for the purpose of taking a decision on the preventive measure to be applied in respect of the applicant . The applicant requested the court to replace his detention with any preventive measure other than deprivation of liberty . His counsel requested that the preventive measure be changed to an undertaking not to leave a specified place and an undertaking of good behaviour , since the applicant had been held in custody for DATE , had positive character references and did not intend to evade the trial . The prosecutor asked for the preventive measure to remain the same .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s criminal case had been pending before the court since DATE , and that from DATE his detention had been regulated by LAW of LAW , which allowed it to be extended beyond the initial DATE period for further periods of DATE . It further noted that the term of the applicant \u2019s detention had been extended on numerous occasions , and that the last time , on DATE , ORG had authorised his detention until DATE . It also noted that before the expiry of that period , on DATE , the applicant had been convicted by the trial court . The court then noted that the term of the applicant \u2019s detention , as extended on DATE , should be considered as having run out on DATE , provided that the period between DATE , the date of the conviction , and DATE , the date of its quashing on appeal , was excluded from the term of detention on remand , in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL of resolution no . CARDINAL of ORG of GPE dated DATE . The court thus held that the term of the applicant \u2019s detention had not been extended in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law and that therefore , despite the seriousness of the charge against him , there were no legal grounds for his further detention on remand . It ordered that the preventive measure be changed to an undertaking not to leave a specified place and an undertaking of good behaviour and that the applicant be released immediately .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor appealed against that decision , arguing that ORG had erred in its interpretation of paragraph CARDINAL of resolution no . CARDINAL of ORG of GPE dated DATE , since it followed from the meaning of LAW that the term of detention should run from DATE of a criminal case \u2019s arrival at a first - instance court and not from DATE of delivery of an appellate court \u2019s decision . Therefore , in the prosecutor \u2019s opinion , the term of the applicant \u2019s detention should have run out on DATE . The applicant disagreed , pointing out the fact that he was employed , that he did not intend to evade justice and that he simply wanted the trial to be concluded as soon as possible and his good name restored .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that ORG had violated LAW of LAW , as the term of detention of a person who had committed a serious or particularly serious criminal offence had to be extended by a court decision each time , and such extension could not be authorised for a period DATE at any one time . It went on to agree with the prosecutor \u2019s submissions and stated that the term of the applicant \u2019s detention should have started running on DATE , the date when the case file had been received by ORG , and that therefore it should be regarded as having expired on DATE . The court then held that this procedural breach was grounds for the annulment of the decision of CARDINAL DATE , and ordered that the case be sent to ORG for a new examination . According to the applicant , he attended the hearing of DATE and was placed in detention immediately after that hearing .", "DATE . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release on an undertaking not to leave his place of residence . It stated that the applicant had been held in detention on remand for DATE , that after his release on DATE he had immediately started working and that he had been given positive character references from his employers . The court held that there were no reasons to believe that he would evade the trial or put pressure on witnesses and thus obstruct the establishment of the truth , and therefore there were no grounds to keep him in detention . The applicant was released immediately .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG examined the criminal case against the applicant for the fourth time . At the hearing , the applicant insisted that he was innocent and reiterated that he had made his confession at the pre - trial stage because he had been beaten and threatened by the police .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the charge against the applicant had mainly been based on his self - incriminating statements and written confession made during the preliminary investigation , which he had later repudiated as having been made under duress . It further noted , as regards the applicant \u2019s medical examination on DATE , which had not revealed any injuries on him , that the applicant had not been apprised of the investigator \u2019s order to carry out that examination until it had been over . Therefore , in ORG opinion , a note on the resulting expert report to the effect that the applicant had had no comments or questions for the expert , and had not wished to call into question the expert \u2019s authority , was devoid of any legal meaning .", "CARDINAL . The court further stated that on DATE the decision of CARDINAL DATE , by which the district prosecutor \u2019s office refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment during his administrative detention in DATE , had been quashed , and that on DATE the district prosecutor \u2019s office had again refused to institute criminal proceedings owing to the absence of the constituent elements of a criminal offence in the police ORG actions . In ORG opinion , however , the applicant \u2019s allegation that he had made self - incriminating statements and had signed his confession as a result of coercion by the police was corroborated by the evidence in the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the court examined the register of detainees of the temporary holding facility where the applicant had been held and noted that the applicant had been taken out of his cell on DATE , from TIME , and on DATE from TIME to TIME and from TIME to TIME The court further observed that , according to the applicant \u2019s written confession , it had been given on DATE in office no . CARDINAL of the temporary holding facility and not in his cell . However , the register did not contain any records confirming that he had been taken out of his cell on DATE . Therefore , ORG doubted the reliability of the official records . It found that the applicant \u2019s confession could not be regarded as having been given voluntarily and was therefore inadmissible as evidence .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that , when the applicant had been interviewed as a suspect on CARDINAL and DATE , he had not been warned that his statements could be used as evidence , in breach of the domestic law . Having examined the body of evidence in the case , ORG further stated that it had been contradictory in a number of aspects . In particular , a report on the medical forensic examination of PERSON . \u2019s body had attested to the presence of numerous internal injuries . The investigating authorities , however , had never attempted to establish the circumstances in which the victim had sustained those injuries , and the applicant had never admitted inflicting any such injuries on the victim , simply having confessed to having strangled her ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In this respect ORG noted that , as was clear from the materials of the case , at the time when the applicant had made his self - incriminating statements and signed his confession , the aforementioned expert examination had not yet been carried out and the investigating authorities had not known of the existence of those injuries .", "CARDINAL . The court further listed a number of other shortcomings in the preliminary investigation and discrepancies in the adduced evidence . It found it unproven that the applicant had committed the imputed offence . The court thus acquitted the applicant and acknowledged his right to rehabilitation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal . It agreed with the trial court \u2019s finding that the confession had been signed as a result of coercion by the police officers . The court noted in this respect that the very fact that the applicant had been taken out of his cell in breach of relevant regulations had been the proof of coercion , and therefore the arguments of the prosecuting party in the appeal submissions to the effect that the trial court had failed in its judgment to specify the methods of that coercion and to identify those responsible were unfounded . It also agreed with the trial court that the applicant \u2019s self - incriminating statements , which he had later repudiated , had contradicted the other evidence in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel lodged a complaint with the district prosecutor \u2019s office about the applicant \u2019s ill - treatment by the police officers from the district police department . An inquiry was carried out in connection with that complaint . Several police officers were questioned . They all denied the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor \u2019s office decided , relying on their statements and medical expert certificate no . CARDINAL of DATE , to dispense with criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment owing to the absence of evidence that any crime had been committed . The applicant did not appeal against the decision in court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor \u2019s office received a complaint from the applicant \u2019s mother about alleged ill - treatment of the applicant by the officers of the district police department .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a decision not to prosecute the police officers was taken . The ORG has not been furnished with a copy of that decision . It does not appear that the applicant attempted to challenge the decision in question before a court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor \u2019s office quashed the decision of DATE and ordered an additional inquiry .", "CARDINAL . During that inquiry PERSON , the head of the investigation department , responsible for the investigation of PERSON . \u2019s murder at the time of the events in question , and PERSON , deputy head of the temporary holding facility of the district police department at the material time , were interviewed . They stated that no physical or psychological pressure had ever been exercised on the applicant and that the applicant had voluntarily confessed to the murder and later confirmed his self - incriminating statements during an interview in the presence of his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor \u2019s office , with reference to the aforementioned statements of PERSON and PERSON , decided not to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the applicant \u2019s allegations owing to the absence of the constituent elements of a criminal offence in the police ORG actions . The applicant did not appeal against that decision in court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office of the Stavropol Region quashed the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE as unlawful and unfounded in view of the investigating authorities\u2019 failure to establish all the relevant facts . In particular , it pointed out that the applicant had not been questioned ; that the materials of the inquiry lacked an extract from the official records of requests for medical aid in the period from DATE ; that the register of detainees of the temporary holding facility , where the applicant had been held during the relevant period , had not been examined with a view to establishing when and by whom the applicant had been taken out of his cell(s ) for interrogation and to identifying who had been in the cell(s ) with him so that they could be questioned in respect of his allegations ; that a police officer who had been present when the applicant had signed his confession had not been questioned in that connection ; that another police officer who had drawn up the administrative offence record in respect of the applicant had not been questioned in that connection ; and that PERSON and PERSON , who had allegedly shared a cell with the applicant , had not been interviewed either . The district prosecutor \u2019s office was thus ordered to eliminate those defects in the course of an additional inquiry .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the district prosecutor \u2019s office again refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers owing to the absence of the constituent elements of a crime in their actions .", "CARDINAL . According to the decision , when interviewed during an additional inquiry , the applicant had stated that on DATE he had been taken from his home to a police station where he had met police officers PERSON and PERSON The latter had drawn up , on PERSON instructions , an administrative offence record which stated that that the applicant had used obscene language in public . The applicant had been held at the police station from TIME and then transported to the district police department . On DATE he had been placed under administrative arrest for DATE and placed in the temporary holding facility of the district police department . Each night the officers of the ORG district police department , PERSON and PERSON , had taken him to an office on the third floor in which they had subjected him to psychological pressure . On DATE , because of that pressure , he had been compelled to make a written confession to the murder of PERSON . , which had been dictated to him by PERSON", "CARDINAL . The decision went on to quote police officer PERSON , who had stated that he had been present when his subordinates , PERSON and PERSON , had interviewed the applicant . No physical or other form of coercion had been used on the applicant , who had voluntarily confessed to the murder and then confirmed his statements in the presence of his counsel .", "DATE . Mr Z. , deputy head of the temporary holding facility of the district police department at the material time , had stated that no force had ever been applied to the applicant , who had made no complaints during his detention in that facility . Mr PERSON also stated that the applicant , PERSON and PERSON S. had never been held in the same cell at the same time .", "CARDINAL . PERSON had stated that on DATE he had been told that the applicant wished to see him . He had met the applicant at the temporary holding facility . The applicant had told him that he had killed PERSON . and had voluntarily written out his confession .", "CARDINAL . Mr B. had stated that on DATE Mr PERSON had complained to him that the applicant had sworn at him . He had drawn up an administrative offence record and sent it to the court .", "CARDINAL . Mr NORP , who had been detained in the temporary holding facility from CARDINAL to DATE for committing an administrative offence , had confirmed that he had shared a cell with the applicant and stated that the applicant had not made any complaints concerning the police officers who had questioned him . PERSON , another detainee during the relevant period , had also been interviewed but had not given any relevant information regarding the applicant \u2019s allegations .", "CARDINAL . The decision then indicated that , according to the temporary holding facility records concerning medical aid , the applicant had never applied for medical assistance .

NORP The decision thus concluded that during the inquiry the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment had proved unfounded .
