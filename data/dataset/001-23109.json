{"ITEMID": "001-23109", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FIN", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "USKI v. FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant and another man , A. , intended to found a real estate company ORG They bought CARDINAL pieces of property and signed the purchase deeds on behalf of PERSON The applicant owned CARDINAL parts of the shares of ORG owned CARDINAL/CARDINAL parts of them .", "In DATE the applicant sold his shares to his female friend PERSON Later the foundation of PERSON elapsed as the applicant and PERSON had failed to apply for its registration within the relevant time - limit . Their application concerning the registration to ORG of the real estates on behalf of PERSON was refused as PERSON had never been registered as a company within the meaning of LAW .", "DATE the applicant failed to pay a loan he had guaranteed on behalf of ORG ordered that the above - mentioned real estates be sold in a forced auction in DATE . The applicant objected to this and informed the Bailiff that he did not own any of the real estates as he had sold his shares of GPE to T. already in DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision was not examined by ORG as the applicant was not found to be a party to the proceedings as he had not owned the real estates . It was found that it was only the actual owner who had the sole competence to make such an allegation ( ORG had not appealed against the Bailiff \u2019s decision ) . Insofar as A. \u2019s part of the shares was concerned , ORG found that A. had not been informed of the Bailiff \u2019s decision . The relevant time - limit for appeal was returned to A.", "On DATE ORG ordered the forced auction to be adjourned until it had examined ORG \u2019s appeal . In the meantime , it ordered that A. should institute proceedings before the local ORG in order to establish the real owners of the real estates . He was also requested to inform ORG outcome of such proceedings if he wished to continue the examination of his appeal before ORG .", "On DATE and PERSON instituted civil proceedings against the applicant , a bank , and various other parties , requesting ORG to confirm that the real estates were owned by PERSON , that ORG owned CARDINAL/CARDINAL parts of PERSON , and that ORG owned CARDINAL parts of it . They argued that the ORG \u2019s decision to seizure the real estates and to order them to be auctioned in order to pay the applicant \u2019s debts was illegal as the applicant was not an owner any more . They , thus , requested that the seizure be quashed by ORG .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the case insofar as it concerned the claims instituted by PERSON , finding that the case was based on ORG decision of DATE in which ORG \u2019s appeal had not been examined insofar as it concerned ORG \u2019s possible ownership of the shares as T. ( nor PERSON ) had not appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision herself . It considered that the ORG \u2019s decision only concerned the question whether ORG ownership was to be confirmed and that it , thus , lacked competence to examine the case any further in that respect . It adjourned the case insofar as A. \u2019s ownership was at issue .", "PERSON appealed against ORG decision to ORG which upheld ORG decision on DATE . Both T. and the applicant sought leave to appeal from ORG even though it was only PERSON who had appealed against ORG decision to ORG . On DATE ORG refused the applicant and T. leave to appeal .", "On DATE ORG issued a judgment by default in respect of the rest of the case , i.e. in respect of A. \u2019s ownership of the real estates . It confirmed that ORG owned CARDINAL/CARDINAL parts of each of the CARDINAL real estates as he had owned CARDINAL/CARDINAL parts of ORG \u2019s shares and as the foundation of PERSON had elapsed , in which occasion the assets of ORG were returned to the owners of its shares .", "ORG having confirmed that ORG owned CARDINAL/CARDINAL parts of the real estates at issue , the Bailiff rectified , on DATE , his own earlier seizure decision and ordered that CARDINAL parts of the real estates were to be seized and auctioned ( i.e. he annulled the decision only insofar as A. \u2019s property was concerned ) . As T. had failed to institute any proceedings within the relevant time - limit to have her ownership to the rest of the real estates confirmed , and as CARDINAL else had instituted such proceedings either , the seizure decision concerning the CARDINAL parts of the real estates stayed unchanged .", "The applicant , A. and ORG all appealed to ORG against the Bailiff \u2019s decision concerning the seizure of the CARDINAL parts of the real estates . The applicant \u2019s and A. \u2019s appeals were dismissed as they were not found to be affected by the decision which concerned seizure of ORG \u2019s property .", "ORG \u2019s appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE because the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE had concerned only the rectification of his earlier decision in respect of the part of the real estate owned by ORG and as there is no appeal against a decision not to rectify a decision ( i.e. no new decision had been issued in this respect and the decision of DATE , against which ORG had failed to appeal within the relevant time - limit , was still valid ) .", "The applicant , A. and ORG appealed against ORG decision to ORG which , on DATE , upheld the ORG decision . On DATE ORG refused all the parties leave to appeal .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant , A. and ORG all requested from ORG that the forced auction , which was planned to be held on DATE , be cancelled until ORG had examined their appeal against ORG decision of DATE . The applicant , among others , argued that the auction would be illegal and claimed that ORG had adjourned the enforcement of the seizure decision until the question of the ownership had been legally decided and until the parties had informed the ORG , within CARDINAL months\u2019 time - limit , of that decision .", "This request was refused by ORG on DATE . It found that an auction which had already been announced publicly could only be cancelled if there were exceptional reasons for such a cancellation and if the person seeking for such a cancellation had paid a full guarantee of the auction expenses . As the applicant and his counterparts had not submitted any such exceptional reasons to their request nor paid the guarantee , ORG could not accept their appeal .", "On DATE ORG refused the parties leave to appeal . Their later request to re - open the proceedings was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "The CARDINAL parts of the real estates were sold in an forced auction on DATE .", "The applicant , A. and ORG all complained about the enforcement of the forced auction to ORG . They argued , inter alia , that ORG had ordered on DATE that the forced auction shall be adjourned until ORG had examined A. \u2019s appeal after the final decision had been issued in the proceedings concerning the ownership of the real estates . As those proceedings had not yet ended at the time of the forced auction , the auction was to be considered illegal and should , thus , be annulled . The applicant also claimed that ORG judge was biased as he had participated also in the proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s earlier appeals in respect of the same seizure of the same real estates .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s and the other parties\u2019 complaints . It found that the final decision concerning the ownership proceedings had been issued on DATE when ORG had issued a judgment by default . The Bailiff had informed ORG orally about the decision . As ORG had found no reason to a further adjournment of the auction after having received that information , ORG found the complaint manifestly ill - founded .", "The applicant , A. and ORG appealed against ORG decision to ORG which , on DATE , upheld ORG decision . It found that , even though ORG decision would have been needed in order to continue the seizure which had been adjourned by ORG , it was important to note that the real estates had in fact been auctioned also in order to pay the debts of A. That payment was , however , based only on the Bailiff \u2019s later seizure decision of CARDINAL DATE which had not been appealed against . Thus , there was no need for the protection of A. \u2019s legal rights in respect of the earlier seizure as the question was to be regarded only of theoretical interest . Insofar as the other part of the real estates was auctioned , ORG noted that ORG \u2019s ownership had never been confirmed by a court and that , thus , that part could be auctioned in order to pay the applicant \u2019s debts .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "In DATE the applicant , A. and ORG requested the police to investigate whether the Bailiff , ORG and various other authorities had committed an offence when allowing the auction to take place even though the ORG \u2019s decision of adjourning the enforcement proceedings had still been valid . Having received the relevant police report the local public prosecutor decided , on DATE , not to institute criminal proceedings against anyone as he found that the ORG \u2019s decision had not been valid any more ( as the Bailiff had informed the ORG within the relevant time - limit of the final court decision concerning the ownership proceedings ) and that no offence had been committed by any of the relevant authorities involved .", "The applicant has since submitted numerous complaints to various authorities , including , inter alia , ORG , the Chancellor of ORG , the NORP President and the Minister of Justice . None of these complaints has been successful , no more than the applicant \u2019s efforts to institute criminal proceedings against persons involved in the decision - making in some of these complaint proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
