In particular , the investigator had not interviewed the applicant and his wife and had failed time and again to make a legal assessment of the applicant \u2019s injuries , a failing which had been established by the courts in the course of a previous LAW review ; the police ORG suggestions that the injuries had been selfinflicted had been refuted by the expert conclusions in report no .

The applicant further argued that the facts of the case could only be established as a result of investigative measures within the framework of a criminal case , such as the identification of the police officers responsible for the illtreatment , a confrontation between him and the police officers and their questioning .

The applicant appealed against ORG decision , relying on the PERSON case - law and arguing , in particular , that in order to take a lawful and reasoned decision it was necessary to carry out investigative measures such as identification , confrontation , questioning of the police officers , investigative experiments and on - site verification of statements . That would only be possible within the framework of a criminal case , which the investigative committee had never opened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Nizhniy ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .
