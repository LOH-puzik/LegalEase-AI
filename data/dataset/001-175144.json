The newborn baby was in a serious condition , so she was taken to a hospital in GPE for intensive care .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the baby died . The applicants decided not to have an autopsy performed on her body \u2013 according to them , they were informed by doctors that an autopsy was not necessary . The Government contested this and submitted that the applicants had been informed that an autopsy had been necessary but refused it nonetheless .", "CARDINAL . Following the baby \u2019s death , ORG conducted an internal inquiry into the medical services provided to the first applicant . The inquiry report , issued on DATE , found that some erroneous entries had been made in the first applicant \u2019s medical file , the assessment of her and the baby \u2019s condition had probably been inadequate , and certain actions to resuscitate the baby had been taken too late .", "CARDINAL . At the ORG request , ORG also conducted an inquiry into the medical services provided to them at ORG . A provisional report , issued on DATE , found that the first applicant \u2019s labour had not been induced in compliance with the relevant rules , the condition of the foetus had not been properly monitored , there had been shortcomings in the resuscitation of the baby , and CARDINAL of the doctors ( PERSON ) had not been properly qualified to provide obstetric services .

On DATE the applicants asked the NORP district prosecutor ( hereinafter \u201c the prosecutor \u201d ) to open a pre - trial investigation into the medical negligence at ORG which had led to their newborn daughter \u2019s death . The pre - trial investigation was opened on DATE and carried out by the LOC police . In DATE and DATE the applicants were interviewed and granted victim status in the investigation .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE and DATE the police interviewed the doctors who had provided medical services to the first applicant , and obtained various documents from ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants asked the prosecutor to exhume their daughter \u2019s body so that an autopsy could be performed and the cause of her death could be more precisely determined . However , the prosecutor denied their request , relying on an opinion from medical experts that performing an autopsy DATE after the baby \u2019s death would not give any results because of the significant post - mortem changes to the body during that time .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the police asked CARDINAL court - appointed doctors for a specialist opinion on the causes of the baby \u2019s death and the actions of the doctors at ORG . The applicants also submitted questions and their questions were forwarded to the specialists . The opinion , delivered on CARDINAL DATE , stated that no causal link between the ORG actions and the death could be established , and that it was not possible to determine whether the death could have been avoided because an autopsy of the body had not been performed . Subsequently , the applicants asked the police to order another opinion from specialists , and they submitted additional questions . On DATE CARDINAL other court - appointed doctors provided answers to the applicants\u2019 questions . Their overall conclusions were the same as those of the previous specialists .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor discontinued the pretrial investigation on the grounds that no causal link between the actions of the doctors at ORG and the baby \u2019s death had been established . On DATE a senior prosecutor upheld that decision , but on DATE ORG upheld a complaint submitted by the applicants and reopened the pre - trial investigation . The court found that the CARDINAL specialist opinions ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had not answered some of the questions submitted because certain medical data had not been made available . It also found that the investigation had not established why an autopsy had not been performed ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Therefore , the court ordered the prosecutor to ask additional questions of some of the witnesses and order a comprehensive forensic examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor asked the court to order a forensic examination of the causes of the baby \u2019s death and the causal link between the ORG actions and the death . The applicants submitted a list of additional questions to be forwarded to the forensic expert . On DATE ORG ordered the examination , but that order included only the prosecutor \u2019s questions and did not provide any reasons as to why the applicants\u2019 questions had not been included .

On DATE the applicants submitted a complaint to ORG , stating that the pre - trial investigation was being conducted inefficiently and with undue delays . They complained , in particular , that the court \u2019s decision of DATE to order an additional forensic examination ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had not been forwarded to the expert until DATE , DATE and DATE after it had been issued . ORG conducted an official inquiry , which on DATE concluded that NORP prosecutors had committed disciplinary violations , and that the pre - trial investigation had not been properly conducted and supervised . The inquiry found that the LOC district prosecutor \u2019s office had been reorganised in DATE , which was the likely reason for the above - mentioned shortcomings . No individuals were penalised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a court - appointed forensic expert delivered the answers to the applicants\u2019 questions ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Among other things , the expert found that some of the LOC actions had not been in line with the relevant requirements , but there was no direct causal link between their actions and the ORG daughter \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor discontinued the investigation on the grounds that no causal link between the actions of the doctors at ORG and the ORG daughter \u2019s death had been established ( see paragraphs DATE , CARDINAL and DATE above ) . The applicants appealed against that decision , and on DATE a senior prosecutor reopened the pretrial investigation and assigned it to a different police department . The senior prosecutor considered that , following the decision to discontinue the investigation , new relevant circumstances had emerged , although he did not specify what those circumstances were .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , the gynaecologist , was served with a notice that , under Article CARDINAL of LAW , she was suspected of having failed to perform her official duties ( see paragraph DATE below ) .

On DATE ORG terminated the case on the basis that it was time - barred . It held that PERSON had been charged with a crime of negligence , and the DATE statutory limitation period had ended on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . The court also dismissed the application to reclassify the charges and noted that , in any event , reclassification would not alter the statutory limitation period .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that judgment . They submitted that , in line with LAW , the statutory limitation period must have been suspended while the examination of the case had been adjourned owing to ORG illness ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal and upheld the judgment of the first - instance court . It firstly held that the legal provision cited by the applicants had been adopted after the alleged offence had been committed , and that at the time the alleged offence had been committed domestic law had not provided for suspension of the statutory limitation period during the adjournment of a case ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . The court further held that , in any event , the examination of the case had been adjourned for an important reason PERSON \u2019s hospitalisation \u2013 so there were no grounds for suspending the statutory limitation period .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG granted the applicants\u2019 claim in part . Relying on the available inquiry reports , as well as the specialist opinions and results of the forensic examinations delivered in the criminal proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE above ) , the court held that the doctors at ORG had breached their duty of care and that their actions \u201c had contributed \u201d ( tur\u0117jo \u012ftakos ) to the death of the ORG daughter , so there were grounds for the hospital incurring civil liability . However , the court considered that the ORG actions had not been premeditated or grossly negligent , so the ORG claim in respect of non - pecuniary damage was granted in part , and they were awarded a total of LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) under that head .
