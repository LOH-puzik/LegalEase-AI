They stood for election in the parliamentary elections of DATE as candidates of ORG ( DEHAP ) in the province of PERSON , but neither of them was elected .", "CARDINAL . Following the DATE earthquakes GPE went through CARDINAL serious economic crises in DATE and DATE . There then followed a political crisis , due firstly to the state of health of the then Prime Minister and secondly to the numerous internal divisions within the governing coalition , a grouping of CARDINAL political parties .", "CARDINAL . It was in that context that on DATE ORG of Turkey ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) decided to bring forward the date of the next parliamentary elections to DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE left - wing political parties , ORG , ORG and ORG , decided to form a \u201c ORG \u201d and to form a new political party , DEHAP . The applicants began their electoral campaign as the new party \u2019s leading candidates in the province of \u015e\u0131rnak .", "CARDINAL . The results of the elections of DATE in the province of PERSON gave the DEHAP list CARDINAL of the CARDINAL votes cast , a score of PERCENT . However , as the party had not succeeded in passing the national threshold of PERCENT , the applicants were not elected . The CARDINAL seats allocated to \u015e\u0131rnak province were shared as follows : CARDINAL seats for the ORG ( ORG ve GPE \u2013 the Justice and ORG , a party of the conservative right ) , which had polled PERCENT ( CARDINAL votes ) , and CARDINAL seat for PERSON , an independent candidate who had polled PERCENT ( CARDINAL votes ) .", "CARDINAL . Of the CARDINAL parties which had taken part in the elections only the ORG and the ORG ( PERSON \u2013 ORG , a left - wing party ) succeeded in passing the PERCENT threshold . With PERCENT of the votes cast , the ORG won CARDINAL seats , PERCENT of those in ORG . The ORG , which polled PERCENT , obtained CARDINAL seats , or PERCENT of the total . CARDINAL independent candidates were also elected .", "CARDINAL . The results of these elections were generally interpreted as a huge political upheaval . Not only did the proportion of the electorate not represented in parliament reach a record level in GPE ( PERCENT ) but in addition the abstention rate ( PERCENT of registered voters ) exceeded PERCENT for the first time since DATE . As a result , ORG which emerged from the elections was the least representative since DATE , DATE in which a multi - party system was first introduced . Moreover , for the first time since DATE , CARDINAL parties were represented in parliament .", "CARDINAL . To explain ORG unrepresentativity , some commentators have referred to the cumulative effect of a number of factors over and above the existence of a high national threshold . For example , because of the protest vote phenomenon linked to the economic and political crisis , the CARDINAL parties which had obtained seats in the DATE parliamentary elections were unable to reach the PERCENT threshold in DATE and were accordingly deprived of representation in parliament . Similarly , electoral fragmentation had an effect on the results in that numerous attempts to form pre - electoral coalitions had come to nothing .", "CARDINAL . The electoral system is one of the subjects which have been the most debated in GPE ; it still remains highly controversial .", "CARDINAL . NORP The elections of DATE in which the majority representation system was used DATE were unable to ensure an institutional balance between the majority in parliament and the opposition . This imbalance was CARDINAL of the main reasons for the DATE coup ORG . Following the intervention of the armed forces parliament adopted proportional representation , using the D\u2019Hondt method , to strengthen pluralism and the political system . As a result , the elections in DATE and DATE produced stable majorities in ORG while enabling small parties to be represented . However , in the elections of DATE and DATE the main political movements were unable to establish stable governments , although they had wide electoral support . That period of government instability was marked by the formation of CARDINAL coalition after another , each made fragile by the disproportionate influence of the small parties on government policy .", "CARDINAL . Following the military regime of DATE PERSON no . CARDINAL on the election of members of ORG , enacted on CARDINAL DATE , re - established proportional representation , with CARDINAL electoral thresholds . To the PERCENT national threshold was added a provincial threshold ( the number of electors divided by the number of seats to be filled in each constituency ) ; in DATE ORG declared the provincial threshold null and void . In the DATE parliamentary elections ORG ( ANAP ) obtained an absolute majority in parliament .", "CARDINAL . The parliamentary elections of CARDINAL DATE likewise enabled the PERSON , with PERCENT of the vote , to form a stable parliamentary majority . CARDINAL other parties also won seats . PERCENT of votes were cast in favour of parties which ultimately failed to reach the PERCENT threshold . In the elections of DATE CARDINAL parties gained seats in parliament . This result was due in particular to the fact that CARDINAL small political parties ( ORG , ORG and ORG ) had taken part in the elections under the banner of other political parties with the aim of circumventing section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL , which makes it illegal to form joint lists before elections . The proportion of the votes cast in favour of parties not represented in the new parliament thus fell to PERCENT . The Government was based on a coalition of CARDINAL parties . In those elections the CARDINAL candidates of the HEP ( ORG DATE pro - NORP ) were elected to parliament on the list of the ( social - democratic ) ORG party ; they later resigned from the ORG to join the ranks of their own party , the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the general election of DATE CARDINAL parties gained seats in parliament . However , as none of them had a parliamentary majority , a coalition was formed . The proportion of the votes cast in favour of parties not represented in parliament came to PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . The DATE parliamentary elections again resulted in no party having a parliamentary majority . CARDINAL political parties won seats in ORG . A coalition of CARDINAL parties formed a government .

[ T]he LAW defines ORG as a Republic ... The constitutional structure of the ORG , which is based on national sovereignty , is a product of the nation \u2019s will , mediated through free elections .

Paragraph DATE , as amended , provides that electoral laws must be framed in such a way as to strike a balance between the principles of \u2018 fair representation\u2019 and \u2018 governmental ORG . The aim is to ensure that the electors\u2019 will is reflected as far as possible [ in ] the legislature . ... [ In order to ] choose the system whose methods are most conducive to the expression of the collective will and the taking of collective decisions in the legislature , ... enacting the appropriate legislation in the light of the country \u2019s specific circumstances and the requirements of the LAW , it is necessary to opt for [ the system ] which is most compatible with the LAW or to reject any system incompatible with it .", "The impact of a representative democracy is visible in various fields .

Where representation is concerned , the importance attached to fairness is the main condition for governmental stability . Fairness ensures stability .

In the same judgment , however , ORG declared null and void an electoral threshold of PERCENT for the allocation of seats within provinces ( provincial threshold ) . Holding that such a threshold was inconsistent with the principle of fair representation , it observed :", "\u201c Although a national threshold is imposed in parliamentary elections in accordance with the principle of \u2018 governmental ORG , imposing in addition a threshold for each electoral constituency is incompatible with the principle of \u2018 fair representation\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the NORP stock exchange went up by PERCENT .", "However , it also means that PERCENT of the voters have no representation in the ORG .", "The results must thus be considered as a clear protest vote against the establishment as a whole , since none of the CARDINAL parties in the old governing coalition got enough votes for a single seat ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has not issued any binding standards for electoral thresholds . The question has not been raised in the organisation \u2019s standard - setting texts . On the other hand , the Code of good practice in electoral matters , adopted by ORG , makes recommendations on the subject ( see ORG , \u201c Code of good practice in electoral matters : Guidelines and explanatory report \u201d , Opinion no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . As a general principle , the LAW requires suffrage to be direct , but in the case of a bicameral parliament it permits CARDINAL of the ORG to be elected by indirect suffrage . As for the electoral system to be used , the PERSON \u2019s guidelines state that any system may be chosen .", "CARDINAL . Paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) on \u201c Honouring of obligations and commitments by GPE \u201d , adopted by ORG of ORG on DATE , are worded as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . With regard to pluralist democracy , the ORG recognises that GPE is a functioning democracy with a multiparty system , free elections and separation of powers . The frequency with which political parties are dissolved is nevertheless a real source of concern and the ORG hopes that in future the constitutional changes of DATE and those introduced by the DATE legislation on political parties will limit the use of such an extreme measure as dissolution . The ORG also considers that requiring parties to win PERCENT of the votes cast nationally before they can be represented in parliament is excessive and that the voting arrangements for NORP citizens living abroad should be changed .", "...", "CARDINAL . The ORG therefore invites GPE , as part of its authorities\u2019 current reform process , to :", "...", "ii . NORP amend the electoral code to lower the PERCENT threshold and enable NORP citizens living abroad to vote without having to present themselves at the frontier ;", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Although there is no uniform classification of types of ballot and electoral systems , it is usual to distinguish CARDINAL main types : majority vote systems , proportional systems and mixed systems . In majority vote systems the winner is the candidate or list of candidates obtaining the majority of the votes in the decisive round of voting . This type of ballot makes it possible to vote in governments with clear parliamentary majorities , but at the same time it militates against the representation of minority political parties . Thus , for example , in GPE the use over DATE of a single round of voting in a single - member majority - vote system ( \u201c first past the post \u201d ) , combined with the existence of CARDINAL dominant political parties , has had the effect of giving few seats to other parties in relation to the number of votes that they obtain . There are other similar cases , in GPE for instance , where there is a majority - vote system spread over CARDINAL rounds of voting . At the opposite extreme , the aim of the proportional representation system is to ensure that the votes cast are reflected in a proportional number of seats . Proportional representation is generally considered to be the fairest system because it tends to reflect more closely the various political forces . However , the disadvantage of proportional representation is that it tends to lead to fragmentation among those seeking electoral support and thus makes it more difficult to establish stable parliamentary majorities .", "CARDINAL . Currently , proportional systems are the most widely used in LOC . By way of example , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE have opted for CARDINAL or other variant of proportional representation . There are also mixed systems containing various combinations of the CARDINAL types of ballot ( in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , for example ) .", "CARDINAL . In order to ensure stable majorities in legislatures elected by proportional representation , statutory electoral thresholds are often used . Thresholds are \u201c limits , fixed or variable , defined in terms of the electoral result , which determine the share of a list or candidate in the distribution of seats \u201d . However , the role played by thresholds varies in accordance with the level at which they are set and the party system in each country . A low threshold excludes only very small groupings , which makes it more difficult to form stable majorities , whereas in cases where the party system is highly fragmented a high threshold deprives many voters of representation .", "CARDINAL . Among the member ORG which use CARDINAL or other variant of proportional representation in the context of a mixed system , and which set an electoral threshold , the following examples may be found . In GPE a party must gain PERCENT of the votes cast nationally or PERCENT of the votes cast in the base constituency in which the seat is to be allocated . In GPE a national threshold of PERCENT is imposed . In GPE it is necessary to pick up PERCENT of the votes cast nationally . In GPE parties must either pick up PERCENT of the votes cast nationally or obtain a particular number of votes in CARDINAL of the country \u2019s CARDINAL geographical zones . In the GPE there is a national threshold fixed at PERCENT of the votes cast .", "CARDINAL . As a general rule , the threshold fixed does not apply as such to coalitions , which must pass higher thresholds . In GPE , for example , the threshold for CARDINAL party is PERCENT , whereas in the case of a coalition it is raised by PERCENT for each of the constituent parties . In GPE the base threshold of PERCENT is raised by PERCENT , and only a further PERCENT for coalitions with CARDINAL or more members . In GPE the electoral threshold varies PERCENT for local lists and PERCENT for national lists ; for a coalition the threshold is set at PERCENT whatever the number of constituent parties . Following the same logic , the threshold for independent candidates is lower PERCENT in GPE , for example ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
