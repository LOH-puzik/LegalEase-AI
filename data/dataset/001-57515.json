He is a consultant engineer and resides at ORG , a town in the immediate vicinity of GPE .", "On DATE he rented an apartment . The lease contained a \" negotiation clause \" ( f\u00f6rhandlingsklausul , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) which was worded as follows :", "\" During the running of the lease the parties undertake to accept , without prior termination of the lease , the rent and other conditions agreed upon on the basis of the negotiation agreement ( f\u00f6rhandlingsordning ) in force between , on the one hand , a DATE union affiliated to ORG ( Sveriges Fastighets\u00e4garef\u00f6rbund ) and a landlord , who with his property is affiliated to such a union , and , on the other hand , a ORG union affiliated to ORG ( Hyresg\u00e4sternas riksf\u00f6rbund ) . \"", "An agreement between the CARDINAL unions laid down the negotiating procedure . For conducting the negotiations the ORG union in question received a commission of PERCENT of the rent ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant was dissatisfied with the rent and with the fact that he was represented by ORG of GPE ( hyresg\u00e4stf\u00f6reningen i GPE , \" GPE \" ) . He therefore gave notice of his intention to terminate the lease in accordance with LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ( jordabalken ) , with a view to having its terms altered . He proposed to the landlord the conclusion of a new agreement with a fixed rent and no negotiation clause . Following the rejection of his offer , he brought the dispute before ORG ( hyresn\u00e4mnden ) for GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In accordance with the legislation in force ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the section of ORG which examined the case was composed of a chairman and CARDINAL lay assessors ( intresseledam\u00f6ter ) . At the time of his appointment , the chairman , PERSON , held a non - permanent judicial appointment as an associate judge in ORG . The CARDINAL assessors , who were nominated respectively by ORG and ORG , were experts on the administration of apartment buildings and on the problems of tenants . CARDINAL , Mr PERSON , the managing director of his own electricity business , was also the president of CARDINAL of the district associations affiliated to ORG ( PERSON , \" the Landlords\u2019 Union \" ) . The other , Mr PERSON , a retired customs official , was a member of ORG and had previously been the president of CARDINAL of the district associations for DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant first challenged the CARDINAL lay assessors because they had been nominated by a DATE association and a tenants\u2019 organisation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He considered that they could not decide his case objectively and impartially because GPE depended for its existence on the sums paid to it for conducting the rent negotiations ( see paragraph CARDINAL , last sub - paragraph , below ) and ORG also derived a major part of its raison d\u2019\u00eatre from its participation in these negotiations . In addition he claimed that there was a risk of discrimination on political grounds because GPE was socialist in outlook , whereas he was a local elected representative belonging to a moderate right wing grouping . As regards the merits , he sought the deletion of the negotiation clause from the lease and contested the amount of the rent .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG held a hearing at which the applicant and his representative and the landlord \u2019s representative were present .", "The chairman dismissed the applicant \u2019s challenge because the rules governing the appointment of the lay assessors did not in themselves provide a ground for such a challenge and because there were no other grounds on which it could be based .", "After having heard the views of the parties as to the merits of the case , ORG went on to state that its decision would be available at its secretariat on DATE .", "On that date it dismissed PERSON claims .

Mr PERSON appealed from this decision to ORG ( bostadsdomstolen ) . He relied on Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ( article CARDINAL , LAW , LAW ) of the LAW and sought a thorough examination of the challenge which he had submitted at first instance ; he also challenged the lay assessors of this court . As to the merits , he repeated his claim that he should not be represented by GPE and that he should be permitted to fix his rent in direct negotiations with the landlord .", "CARDINAL . ORG The court which examined the applicant \u2019s appeal was composed of CARDINAL members ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The President , Mr PERSON , had , until his appointment to ORG , presided over a Chamber of ORG and still retained this post , on a formal basis , while exercising his new function .", "The other lawyer , who acted as rapporteur , Mr PERSON , remained a Rent Judge ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The CARDINAL lay assessors had ( like the assessors sitting on ORG ) been nominated by , respectively , ORG and ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

According to the preparatory documents , this possibility was introduced to provide legal protection for private individuals , in particular those who were not members of the organisations which participated in the negotiations . The board may exempt the party concerned from the obligation to accept a negotiation clause ; in deciding whether to do so , it must , inter alia , weigh the interest in adopting a rational approach to rent negotiations against the fundamental need for the greatest possible contractual freedom for the individual ( Government PERSON .

CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "Section CARDINAL provides that these conditions are to be negotiated between , on the one hand , the landlord or the landlord and a landlords\u2019 organisation and , on the other hand , a tenants\u2019 organisation . The tenant - who therefore has no right to negotiate - need not be a member of the organisation . Under section CARDINAL , the system applies in principle to all the flats in a building . These negotiations , which must be conducted in the manner laid down in the LAW , are not compulsory but depend on the desiderata of the parties . If CARDINAL of them refuses to conclude an agreement , the dispute may be referred to ORG .", "Under LAW , the rent may incorporate the amount - a percentage of the rent agreed in the negotiations - payable to the ORG organisation for its role in these negotiations .", "CARDINAL . ORG The principal advantage which the landlords\u2019 associations derive from the system is that they only have to negotiate rents with the tenants\u2019 organisations and not with the individual tenants .

CARDINAL ) , it is not intended that the lay assessors in their capacity as judges should feel bound by the interests which they can be said to represent . They should , like the other members , carry out their duties as independent judges and not as representatives of party interests . \"", "Turning then to the case at hand , it rejected the challenge which was based on \" the viewpoint that every member who is closely linked to the tenants\u2019 movement , for that reason alone , is biased when dealing with such a case \" .", "In setting out its reasoning ORG said inter alia :", "\" ... it should first be pointed out that it is not the task of the lay assessors of ORG to represent their organisations . They should represent the whole interest group in question without regard to their involvement in a particular organisation .
