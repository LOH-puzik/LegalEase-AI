Pursuant to point CARDINAL , there must be reasonable grounds for suspecting that a criminal act has been committed in connection with the bankruptcy or the activities that led to insolvency . Pursuant to point CARDINAL , an assessment of suitability is to be made . The effects of a disqualification order are the same in both cases , with the exception that sub - section CARDINAL also authorises disqualification from the debtor 's existing offices in other companies . This applies only to a disqualification order imposed pursuant to point CARDINAL of the first sub - section .", "( CARDINAL ) Disqualification after bankruptcy was first introduced into the DATE LAW . Sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) introduced an automatic DATE disqualification period for board members and managing directors of limited liability companies and also for all personal debtors in bankruptcy . During this period , a disqualified person was not permitted to form a new limited liability company , take up any new office on a board or become a managing director in any other limited liability company .", "( CARDINAL ) Although the general rule was that a DATE disqualification period was mandatory , section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) authorised the probate and bankruptcy court , on an application , to decide that all or part of the disqualification period was to be remitted . Such a decision was to be made if there was no suspicion that the debtor had contravened any penal clause in connection with the bankruptcy or the company 's activities , and there was no doubt about the soundness of the debtor 's conduct as a manager or in another position he or she held in the company . The probate and bankruptcy court could also decide that a disqualification period was to be remitted if it found that no reasonable or public interest militated against this .", "( CARDINAL ) On the other hand , the effect of disqualification pursuant to sections CARDINAL could be made more severe . If there were reasonable grounds for suspecting the debtor of having committed offences in connection with the bankruptcy or the company 's activities , the probate and bankruptcy court could decide that he or she was also to be removed from any position on a board or as a managing director of another company during the disqualification period , in other words the provision that we also find in section CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) The preparatory works for LAW ( Proposal No . DATE ) to the PERSON [ the larger division of ORG ] , p. CARDINAL ) explain the purpose of introducing provisions relating to disqualification as follows :", "' There are several arguments for preventing a person who is involved in a bankruptcy from holding managerial responsibilities . If the bankruptcy is the result of dishonesty or other errors on the part of the company 's management , it will be desirable to ensure that the same people are not involved in the management of other limited liability companies . In other cases too , there can be reasons for introducing a certain disqualification period pending investigation of the circumstances of the bankruptcy with a view to revealing any irregularities or other inappropriate conduct . Even if the question of possible irregularities is disregarded , CARDINAL other important considerations are society 's interest in ensuring that resources are soundly managed and the interests of the creditors . Moreover , it is not in the interests of the company 's shareholders or helpful to its reputation for it to be managed by persons whose fitness for the position or solvency can be questioned . '", "( CARDINAL ) ORG commented on the need for rules on disqualification in Recommendation O. No . DATE ) , p. CARDINAL :", "' In the committee 's opinion , there is particular reason to withdraw the right to form new companies or take up new positions . It is particularly in this connection that we find the typical cases that disqualification is intended to deal with . The position with regard to offices that a person already holds is somewhat different . Disqualification from these can easily have unintended and negative effects both for the individuals targeted and for companies that lose a board member or managing director . The committee has therefore concluded that disqualification from already existing positions should be treated separately and made dependent on an individual evaluation , with a view to dealing with the cases where the need for disqualification is most obvious , that is , those where the circumstances suggest that offences have been committed in connection with the bankruptcy or the company 's activities . '", "( CARDINAL ) The provisions on disqualification were later transferred from LAW to LAW , and later amendments have resulted in the current wording . Proposal No . CARDINAL ( DATE ) to the PERSON , p. CARDINAL , describes the purpose of these provisions as follows :", "' The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that certain persons who have been involved in an earlier bankruptcy ( either personally or as part of the management of an insolvent limited liability company ) are not involved in forming or managing other limited liability companies for a certain period ( DATE ) .", "...", "The enactment of the provisions relating to disqualification periods in the new LAW will make it easier to stop serial bankrupts who , after being involved in CARDINAL or more bankruptcies , start up new companies and continue in business until these also fail , and who are suspected of irregularities in connection with their business activities .", "The imposition of a disqualification order pursuant to the provisions of LAW is additional to other possible measures based for example on criminal liability , liability for damages , or the voidability of transactions . There is particular reason to note that the provisions of LAW relating to the stripping of rights are not made superfluous by the disqualification provisions . In practice , LAW is seldom used , but in cases where it is , it can be an advantage that the debtor is already subject to a disqualification order from the time of the bankruptcy and thus can not take up the types of positions to which the provisions of the new LAW apply , since it will generally take some time before a case can be tried pursuant to LAW . '", "( CARDINAL ) Proposal no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) to the PERSON was not debated by the PERSON ( ORG ) , and the bill was put forward again , see Proposal no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) to the PERSON . This time , the Government proposed that disqualification should not be automatic , see section CARDINAL of the current LAW . The reason for this was partly to improve security under the law . The original wording of sections CARDINAL of LAW concerning exemptions from disqualification was characterised by the fact that the person in question was expected to prove his or her own innocence . It was also partly for practical reasons : as disqualification applied automatically , it was difficult to find qualified people who were willing to become board members or managing directors , particularly in cases where the goal was to save a company that was in difficulties .", "( CARDINAL ) It was also proposed that the trustee 's first report to the probate and bankruptcy court , which must be submitted DATE after his or her appointment , should include an evaluation of whether any circumstances in the case come under the rules on disqualification , see section CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , of LAW . ORG submitted the following comments on this provision :", "' ORG is of the opinion that this provision will help to make the rules on disqualification after a bankruptcy more effective . Such reports will provide probate and bankruptcy courts with material that will enable them to evaluate whether disqualification orders should be imposed at an early stage of the proceedings . A ruling can of course also be made before a report is received . It is important that a ruling on disqualification is made as promptly as possible if this provision is to stop serial bankrupts who are suspected of irregularities in connection with their business activities . '", "( CARDINAL ) Under LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL , a central Disqualified Directors Register was established as part of ORG , see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the current LAW . This was done as a means of ensuring compliance with disqualification orders . In the preparatory works , Proposal no . DATE ) to the PERSON , p. CARDINAL , the Ministry commented that although consideration for the right to privacy of the person disqualified was an argument against an ' open ' register , this was less important than ensuring a real possibility for enforcing disqualification orders .", "( CARDINAL ) Thus , on the basis of the preparatory works , it can be established that the purpose of the provisions relating to disqualification orders is to prevent a debtor in bankruptcy or the company managers from forming or managing new limited liability companies . The underlying consideration is that there are risks involved in the operation of a limited liability company , and that others must be protected against misuse of this form of business organisation by dishonest or irresponsible people . CARDINAL considerations are particularly emphasised , namely , sound management of resources and the interests of creditors and shareholders . The preparatory works emphasise that a decision to impose a disqualification order must be taken as soon as possible in order to prevent continued irregularities . Disqualification is not considered to be a penal measure ; on the contrary , it is emphasised that disqualification and penal sanctions supplement each other .", "( CARDINAL ) Such interactions between disqualification and criminal prosecution are also laid down in the provisions of the LAW . By virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the prosecuting authority is entitled to act as a party in cases concerning disqualification in the probate and bankruptcy court , and may apply for the disqualification period to be extended until there is a legally enforceable judgment in a criminal case in which the prosecuting authority has proposed , or is contemplating proposing , that the bankrupt be stripped of his or her rights under LAW . It is not possible to strip the bankrupt of his or her rights under LAW at an earlier stage than this . On the other hand , in ORG Reports DATE , p. CARDINAL , ORG established that if the police withdraw a charge for the offences that formed the basis for imposing disqualification , it is not possible to maintain the disqualification order under LAW ( CARDINAL ) , point CARDINAL , of LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) LAW in relation to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , point CARDINAL , of LAW", "( CARDINAL ) I shall now return to the question of how the disqualification provisions are to be evaluated in relation to the LAW and the prohibition against double jeopardy in LAW and will first consider a disqualification order pursuant to the provision of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) item DATE on the grounds that unsound business conduct makes the person in question unfit to form or manage a company . With CARDINAL minor reservation , which I shall discuss later , the parties in our cases agree that disqualification imposed under the first sub - section , point CARDINAL , is not a penalty and does not entail double jeopardy . Here , there is case - law from ORG dealing with the NORP provisions on disqualification . These are very similar to the NORP provisions in section CARDINAL ) , point CARDINAL . The NORP provisions are set out in LAW DATE . They stipulate , among other things , that a person who has been a director of an insolvent company and whose conduct is found to make him or her unfit to manage a company is to be disqualified ( the court issues a disqualification order ) from setting up or managing a company for a period of DATE . The court can make exemptions from disqualification . The public authorities must institute legal proceedings within DATE after the company is declared insolvent , and the decision is made by the ordinary courts .", "( DATE ) ORG has examined the NORP rules on disqualification under the ORG in CARDINAL cases . In PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , judgment of DATE ) the parties agreed , and the ORG was of the same opinion , that proceedings concerning a decision on disqualification determined ' civil rights ' pursuant to LAW . The case concerned whether the legal proceedings had taken an unreasonably long time , and the ORG found that there had been a violation of the LAW . I note here that ORG ( see ORG ( PERSON ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ) has also found that decisions on disqualification in connection with a bankruptcy concern a ' civil right ' pursuant to LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) In the case GPE , GPE and GPE v. GPE DATE . ) no . CARDINAL , decided on DATE , the applicants claimed that the decision to disqualify them determined a criminal charge . The ORG replied :", "' The criteria for ascertaining whether a ' criminal charge ' has been determined are the domestic classification of the ' offence ' , the nature of the ' offence ' , and the nature and degree of severity of the potential and actual penalty ( see , for example , the PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL with further references ) . In the present case , the proceedings were classified as civil in domestic law , the disqualification of directors is a matter which is regulatory rather than criminal , and the ' penalty ' is neither a fine nor a prison sentence , but rather a prohibition on acting as a company director without the leave of the court . Whilst a great deal was undoubtedly at stake for the applicants , it can not be said that what is inherently a regulatory matter can thereby become a ' criminal charge ' within the meaning of LAW . Thus , none of these criteria indicates that the applicant was charged with a ' criminal offence ' , and the ORG considers that the proceedings in the present case did not determine a criminal charge within the meaning of LAW ( see also No . CARDINAL , ORG . DATE ) . '", "( CARDINAL ) On the basis of this decision , I presume that the same applies to a NORP decision to impose a disqualification order under section CARDINAL ) , point CARDINAL , that is , it is not to be construed as a criminal charge within the meaning of LAW . This means that LAW will not bar subsequent criminal prosecution .", "( DATE ) I would like to mention that in case no . CARDINAL , the defence counsel claimed that disqualification imposed under the first sub - section , point CARDINAL , must also be considered to determine a criminal charge if the grounds for considering a person unfit are suspicion that specific offences have been committed . I do not agree with this distinction . The basis for disqualification under section CARDINAL ) , point CARDINAL , is that the court has found the person in question to be unfit to form a new company or take part in the management of a new company . This is the case regardless of the further grounds cited by the court for judging the person unfit to take up such functions .", "( CARDINAL ) LAW in relation to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , point CARDINAL , of LAW", "( DATE ) I shall now consider whether a disqualification order imposed under section CARDINAL ) , point CARDINAL ( reasonable ground for suspecting the person concerned of offences in connection with the bankruptcy ) , precludes subsequent criminal prosecution .", "( CARDINAL ) For LAW to preclude subsequent criminal prosecution , the person charged must already have been ' finally acquitted or convicted ' . The first question here is whether it is the decision to impose a disqualification order that must be ' final ' , which it clearly is , or whether the requirement for a final decision refers to the offences that are the grounds for issuing the order . The real question in the present case is whether the imposition of a disqualification order precludes subsequent criminal prosecution of these underlying offences . In my opinion , it follows directly from the wording of LAW that the final decision relates to the offences that are the grounds for disqualification ; see the text of the LAW , ' tried or punished again ... for an offence for which he has been finally acquitted or convicted ' .", "( CARDINAL ) There is no doubt that by issuing a disqualification order the adjudicating court expresses a view on whether the person in question may have committed the offences that constitute the grounds for imposing disqualification . But does it make sense to claim that when the court has decided whether or not to impose a disqualification order , the person has been finally acquitted or convicted of these offences ? In my opinion , it does not .", "( CARDINAL ) Firstly , I refer to the requirement of guilt for the criminal offences in question here . A finding that there is reasonable ground for suspicion is not a final conviction , either literally or according to NORP legal tradition . The concept of just cause for suspicion is associated particularly with the conditions in which coercive measures \u2013 arrest , custody , search , and so on DATE may be used pursuant to LAW , and a decision to use such measures clearly does not constitute a final decision on guilt . These are of course temporary measures directly related to the criminal investigation . Coercive measures are used for the purpose of the investigation , and must be construed as ceasing to apply if the investigation is discontinued . However , as I have described above , the imposition of a disqualification order is also linked to the investigation of the case . ORG of ORG has established that if the prosecuting authority withdraws a charge in respect of the offences that were the basis for issuing a disqualification order , the disqualification order must also be withdrawn ( see ORG Reports DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . The same must apply in the event of an acquittal .", "( CARDINAL ) Furthermore , the purpose of disqualification is an argument against the interpretation that a disqualification order constitutes a final decision regarding the underlying offences . In the preparatory works it is stated several times that the purpose of imposing a disqualification order is to prevent the person in question from continuing to misuse the company form through irregularities or other misconduct , and that disqualification orders must be issued swiftly . Use of the criterion ' reasonable ground for suspicion ' is related to the need for a rapid response , which is expected before investigation of the case is completed . This is not in keeping with the interpretation that disqualification constitutes a final decision on guilt . The preparatory works point to the fact that the completion of the investigation of a criminal case will take longer , and is thus something that will be considered later .", "( DATE ) Finally , the procedural rules militate against regarding a decision to impose a disqualification order as a ' final conviction ' . The DATE amendments reversed the provisions on disqualification , so that instead of disqualification being automatic , it required a ruling by the probate and bankruptcy court , and at the same time a provision was introduced requiring the trustee to evaluate whether there were any circumstances in the case that came under the rules on disqualification , see section CARDINAL item CARDINAL of LAW , in the first report to the probate and bankruptcy court , which must be submitted DATE after appointment . In the report , the trustee gives a survey of possible criminal offences , but is unlikely to be able to assess the strength of the suspicion in relation to each offence . In general , the district court too has only limited opportunities for making a closer assessment of guilt as regards each offence . Since disqualification requires only that there is a reasonable ground for suspecting the person in question of CARDINAL offence , there is little reason for a debtor in bankruptcy to object to a single count , unless he or she claims not to have committed any offences at all . This means that there is little focus on specific offences . Thus , a ruling from the district court is not a suitable basis for determining which specific offences can be construed as having been finally adjudicated .", "( CARDINAL ) In my opinion , these CARDINAL elements \u2013 the form of guilt , the purpose of disqualification and the rules of procedure \u2013 considered together lead to the conclusion that the imposition of a disqualification order can not be interpreted as a final conviction for the offences on which the decision is based .", "( DATE ) It is of course the case that the phrase ' finally .... convicted ' is to be interpreted as an autonomous concept within the framework of the Convention . However , in my view , the raw material for the analysis must be the domestic legal system . On this basis , it seems to be reasonably clear that a debtor in bankruptcy has not been ' finally acquitted or convicted ' of the offences that form the basis of a decision to impose a disqualification order , and that LAW therefore does not apply .", "( CARDINAL ) However , I would like to point out that in the limited case - law from ORG relating to LAW , I have not found any material from the ORG 's own legal system that can clarify the meaning of the term ' finally acquitted or convicted ' .", "( CARDINAL ) In the decision of inadmissibility in the case of ORG v. GPE on DATE ( application FAC ) , the question was whether the temporary withdrawal of a driving licence for DATE for driving under the influence of alcohol and causing injury precluded subsequent criminal prosecution for the same offence . The withdrawal was a temporary measure involving no assessment of guilt . It could apply for a maximum of DATE and would cease to have effect if the person was convicted . ORG established that LAW did not preclude subsequent criminal prosecution , but reasoned that the withdrawal of the driving licence was a traffic safety measure and thus was not a ' criminal charge ' . ORG also referred to a ORG judgment DATE , on DATE , relating to LAW LOC v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ) , which concerned the immediate withdrawal of a driving licence for DATE , without any finding of guilt . In this case too , it was found that the withdrawal of the driving licence ought to be regarded as a preventive measure for the safety of road - users .", "( DATE ) On this basis , there is reason to consider whether , in the alternative , a disqualification pursuant to section CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL of LAW can be construed as a criminal punishment under LAW . A similar question has been of central importance in several of ORG decisions relating to LAW . I refer for example to ORG Reports DATE , p. CARDINAL and DATE , p. CARDINAL , both of which include a thorough discussion of the term ' punishment ' in this connection .", "( CARDINAL ) There are strong indications that an evaluation of the legal institution of disqualification under the LAW must lead to the same conclusion for both the conditions laid down in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , which in practice are often invoked together . In the preparatory works , the purpose of disqualification is described in the same terms for both conditions . The primary purpose is to satisfy a non - penal need for protection in cases where bankruptcy is related to criminal or unsound business conduct on the part of a manager or board member , indicating that he or she is unfit to engage in such business activities . The person in question should therefore , for a period of time , be excluded from holding managerial responsibilities in limited liability companies . The condition set out in item DATE reasonable ground for suspicion of a criminal offence \u2013 can be regarded as a special case of the general criterion of fitness set out in item CARDINAL . Even if section CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL , is viewed separately , an evaluation relative to the Convention must be based on the common purpose of these CARDINAL provisions .", "( CARDINAL ) In the above - cited GPE , GPE and GPE v. GPE , the key sentence in the reasoning is as follows ,", "' In the present case , the proceedings were classified as civil in domestic law , the disqualification of directors is a matter which is regulatory rather than criminal , and the ' penalty ' is neither a fine nor a prison sentence , but rather a prohibition on acting as a company director without the leave of the court . '", "( DATE ) In my opinion , these CARDINAL criteria are applicable in exactly the same way to a NORP disqualification order pursuant to section CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL of LAW . Thus , there is no doubt that disqualification is classified as a civil matter in NORP domestic law . The next criterion is often described as the nature and purpose of the measure . Here , ORG emphasises that disqualification is a matter that is regulatory rather than criminal . It is presumably of key importance here that the provisions relating to the disqualification of directors in GPE DATE and also in GPE \u2013 govern a very narrow field of business activities , namely , forming and managing limited liability companies . The nature of the measure can not be said to be significantly influenced by the fact that it is grounded on suspicion of offences rather than an assessment of unfitness . In any event , the fact that the main reason for disqualification is to protect others , not to punish , is a factor that weighs more heavily here . I would also like to mention one particular feature of the NORP provisions , which is that an assessment of whether disqualification is reasonable in the circumstances is always required before a decision is made , see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . This also tends to strengthen the conclusion that disqualification is a means of regulating business activities rather than a punishment .", "( CARDINAL ) Finally , as regards the severity of the measure , disqualification entails a prohibition against forming or managing new limited liability companies for DATE . It does not entail a general prohibition against engaging in business activities . As ORG stated in its judgment in the present case ,", "' A person who is subject to a disqualification order is not prevented from running a general partnership , but is merely DATE for a relatively short period of time DATE prevented from using a form of business organisation in which personal liability is limited , and where there may therefore be less incentive to operate according to sound business principles . '", "( DATE ) As regards the severity of the measure , particular attention has been paid to the provisions of section CARDINAL ) . In cases where this provision applies , disqualification may also apply to current positions and offices held in other companies . It is quite clear that this form of disqualification has a greater effect , see the comments in Recommendation O. No . DATE ( DATE ) , at the time when the provision was incorporated into LAW . The question is whether its effects are so severe that a different conclusion must be drawn with respect to the term ' punishment ' as used in the LAW . In my opinion , this is out of the question . As I understand the NORP rules , a disqualification order always applies to current positions held in other companies . Despite DATE and the fact that the disqualification period is longer than in GPE \u2013 ORG did not consider that the disqualification determined a ' criminal charge ' .", "( CARDINAL ) Further , it has been claimed that recording disqualifications in an open register is particularly defamatory and thus increases the severity of the measure . As I have shown earlier , the purpose of establishing a register was to enforce disqualification orders more effectively . The Ministry considered that the need for effective enforcement overrode the interests of protection of privacy . In my view , no particular importance can be attached to such registration when evaluating the severity of disqualification as a measure .", "( CARDINAL ) In accordance with the above , I am of the opinion that given the nature of disqualification orders , their purpose , and the fact that this is not a particularly severe encroachment on a person 's rights , a disqualification order can not be construed as a punishment within the meaning of the Convention . Therefore , and also because disqualification does not entail a criminal charge , LAW Protocol No . is not applicable .", "( CARDINAL ) In the light of these conclusions , I will not discuss the third question in this case , namely , whether the offences that were the basis for the disqualification order pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) item CARDINAL , are identical to the offences for which PERSON has been prosecuted and convicted . \u201d", "On DATE ORG pronounced judgment in a similar case , which also became the subject of an application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) lodged under LAW Per PERSON against GPE and which is being dealt with simultaneously with the present case .", "In so far as relevant , section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL LAW ) read :", "Section CARDINAL -Conditions for imposing a disqualification order", "\u201c If a debtor 's estate is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings , the district court may impose a disqualification order on the debtor if", "CARDINAL ) there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the person concerned of a criminal act [ straffbar handling ] in connection with the bankruptcy or the activities that led to insolvency , or", "CARDINAL ) if it must be presumed that , for reasons of unsound business conduct , the person in question is unfit to establish a new company or to serve as a director or general manager ( managing director ) of such a company .", "In taking a decision on this matter , importance shall be attached to whether , having regard to the debtor 's conduct and the circumstances as a whole , it appears reasonable to impose a disqualification order .", "The imposition of a disqualification order means that , for DATE from the opening of bankruptcy proceedings , the debtor may not establish such a company as mentioned in the fifth sub - section , or undertake the office or de facto exercise the powers of a member or deputy member of a board of directors or managing director of such a company .

In the event of a significant and unwarranted delay from the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings until the submission of a request for a disqualification order , the court might conclude that it would be unreasonable to impose a disqualification order .", "In the preparatory works to LAW DATE , ORG had stressed that the rules would make it possible to put a stop to the activities of persons who were repeatedly involved in limited liability companies which became insolvent , and where there was reason to suspect improper business conduct . It had also been emphasised that disqualification orders should function as a supplement to stripping the offender of his or her rights ( rettighetstap ) , which was a punitive measure imposed under LAW . In this context , the Ministry had pointed to the advantages of the fact that a disqualification order could be imposed shortly after the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings , whilst it would normally take longer to investigate and prosecute possible criminal offences . The possibility of swift action was necessary to achieve the preventive purpose of the measure .", "The duration of the disqualification DATE usually DATE could be extended if the public prosecutor in a criminal case had requested or was contemplating requesting the trial court to strip the person in question of their rights under LAW . The disqualification period could then be extended until the court had decided the criminal case .", "The competent court could remit a disqualification order if any of the parties so requested and there was relevant new information . If a person subjected to a disqualification order was later acquitted in criminal proceedings for an offence which constituted the basis for the disqualification order , or further investigation showed that no such criminal offence had been committed , the public prosecutor was to request that the disqualification order be lifted ( PERSON , ORG of ORG ) .", "A disqualification order could be imposed by a court of first instance ( tingretten ) or by the probate and bankruptcy courts ( skifteretten ) . Such a measure was usually taken on the basis of written proceedings . However , the parties had the right to request an oral hearing . In his or her report to the probate and bankruptcy court , the liquidator was to provide information on whether , in his or her opinion , there were circumstances suggesting that a disqualification order should be imposed . Both the bankrupt 's estate ( represented by the liquidator ) and the prosecuting authority had a right to intervene as parties in the proceedings concerning the disqualification order . The opposing party would be the debtor , board member or other person against whom the order would apply . It was rare that the prosecution or the bankrupt 's estate intervened as a party to the proceedings . The court 's decision would , accordingly , normally be taken only on the basis of the information and recommendation in the liquidator 's report , and the information and objections provided by the defendant .", "Under section CARDINALA of LAW , a failure to comply with a disqualification order was a criminal offence punishable by DATE imprisonment and/or fines ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
