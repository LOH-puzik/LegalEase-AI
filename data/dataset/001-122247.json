On DATE , holding that there were no grounds for finding that another person had been responsible for PERSON death , the prosecution service issued a decision not to bring a prosecution . The prosecutor set out the evidence gathered during the investigation . He considered that the shot had been fired when the young man , with his chest bent , had been leaning towards his right side and the barrel of the rifle was pointed towards his neck . He stated that this explained , in particular , the bullet impact on the ceiling . However , the prosecutor \u2019s decision gave no reason for the shot having suddenly been fired .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG air - force military court upheld the ORG appeal and ordered the prosecution service to carry out an additional investigation . In particular , it considered that the bullet \u2019s trajectory and the firing position needed to be clearly established , on the basis of the entry and exit wounds on the body and the impact mark of the bullet on the ceiling . It also indicated that no plausible grounds for suicide had been identified . It added that , in any event , the position of the body at the time of the shot had been unusual for a suicide . Finally , it stated that no explanation had been provided for the gunshot residue on the hands of GPE , the last person to have seen PERSON before the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military prosecutor went to the Perenco site , accompanied by CARDINAL criminal investigation experts .", "CARDINAL . The group went to the guard post where the incident had taken place . Once all of the materials in the case file had been examined , a reconstruction of the events was carried out , assisted by an individual who was similar in build to the deceased man .", "CARDINAL .

Photographs were taken .", "CARDINAL . The experts observed that the floor was made of concrete , although the previous records described a dirt floor . According to material provided by the site managers , various LOC , including several dirt tracks , had been cemented over since the incident , with a view to keeping the soldiers\u2019 uniforms clean . During this work , the floors had not been raised . This was confirmed by measurements which established that the ceiling height was still QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . In the light of all the evidence gathered , the experts reached the following conclusion : PERSON had been sitting or crouching and was holding his rifle in his right hand ; when he tried to stand up by leaning on his weapon , and with his knees still bent , his hand had pulled the trigger and the shot had been fired .", "CARDINAL . During his visit to the site , the prosecutor questioned private GPE He stated that , when he arrived , PERSON was crouching down behind PERSON and was trying to lift him by pulling him under the arms .", "CARDINAL . All of this evidence was set out in a report dated DATE .", "DATE . On DATE the prosecutor completed the investigations and sent the file to the military court , together with a report on the additional investigation requested ( report no . CARDINAL ) , setting out the measures taken and responding to the shortcomings noted by the court . With regard to the traces of gunshot on the hands , he pointed out that the file contained an expert report indicating that gunshot residue was very volatile and that it could have moved from the dead man \u2019s clothes or hands to GPE \u2019s hands immediately after the incident . He added that several statements had supported such a hypothesis , in that they confirmed that PERSON had been in physical contact with the deceased when attempting to lift him .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the court \u2019s claim that the firing position hardly corresponded to that of an individual who intended to commit suicide , and its argument about the lack of a motive , the prosecutor stated that the decision not to prosecute contained no indication that the incident had been a suicide and , furthermore , that the conclusion of suicide had not been entertained .", "CARDINAL . As to ascertaining the bullet \u2019s trajectory in the light of the impact mark on the ceiling and the entry and exit wounds on the body , he stated that the following theory had been accepted : PERSON had been sitting on an ammunition box and playing with the rifle \u2019s cocking lever and magazine ; when he was holding the weapon , with the magazine removed and at an angle on his right side , he had leaned forward and towards his right side with the intention of using the rifle as support in standing up , his hand on the part of the weapon near the trigger , and the shot went off ; the bullet had entered through the right side of his neck and emerged under the lower edge of the left shoulder - blade , before hitting the ceiling ; thus , PERSON had not committed suicide , he had been the victim of an accident . The prosecutor added that he had organised a reconstruction of the scene of the incident on DATE , in order to ascertain the credibility of this hypothesis , having regard to the entry and exit points of the bullet , the point of impact on the ceiling and the deceased man \u2019s build , and that the conclusions of the reconstruction confirmed the scenario put forward .", "CARDINAL . He attached the record of the reconstruction of the incident to his report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military court dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal .", "CARDINAL .

This indicates that the muzzle end of the barrel was close to but not in contact with the skin of the deceased .
