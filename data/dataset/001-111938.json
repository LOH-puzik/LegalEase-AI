She refused to undergo somatic and neurological examinations and special examinations , such as magnetic resonance imaging of the brain . She also refused laboratory tests and psychological tests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr PERSON gave his written opinion to ORG on the basis of the assessment conducted DATE and DATE . His conclusions were that the applicant was suffering from a delusional disorder and had not been criminally responsible at the time of the alleged offence . PERSON also found that the criteria for involuntary confinement , set out in section CARDINAL of ORG , were met and that the applicant could not be heard at the trial . Her capacity to look after her own interests was diminished by her mental illness , and she was thus in need of a guardian for the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG for a second opinion . On DATE that authority informed the applicant that ordering a psychiatric assessment of a defendant in a criminal case was outside its authority , and she should therefore direct her request to the court .", "CARDINAL .

PERSON was also invited to provide detailed reasons why he considered that the criteria for involuntary care were met and why outpatient treatment was not considered sufficient . The results of the supplementary examination were to be submitted to ORG as soon as possible .", "CARDINAL . The supplementary examination was completed on DATE . The applicant again refused psychological tests by the hospital staff , doubting their impartiality . In his report , dated DATE , Dr PERSON found that the applicant was suffering from a psychotic delusional disorder and that her condition had already been present prior to the events leading to the criminal charges . The applicant had observed indications of sexual abuse which other experts had not been able to detect . In Dr PERSON \u2019s opinion , the applicant was in need of involuntary psychiatric treatment in order to recover from her disorder , which mainly related to judicial matters , but also to a delusion of grandeur as to the correctness of her own actions . Further , as a doctor she was endangering other people \u2019s well - being by prescribing them treatment which put their health at risk . Because the applicant had for a long time evaded psychiatric assessment , and as she opposed treatment , outpatient treatment would not be sufficient . In conclusion , PERSON considered that the applicant was paranoid and that she had made accusations against various authorities about continued abuse of office . She had become entangled in the tiny details of her own case without being able to perceive the wider picture . He considered that her delusional disorder had reached the level of psychosis , which distorted her conception of reality . Owing to her illness , she did not understand the unlawfulness and repercussions of her actions and she had been psychotically deluded when she had taken part in the deprivation of a child \u2019s liberty . Moreover , she was in denial of her illness .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant sent a number of letters to ORG , in which she criticised the psychiatric assessment conducted by Dr PERSON , among other things . She also submitted to ORG divergent medical opinion of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted its opinion on the psychiatric assessment to ORG under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , finding that the applicant had not been responsible for her actions at the time of the offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the psychiatric assessment being complete , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release from detention . She was , however , to remain in hospital for treatment , as ordered on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered , on the basis of Dr PERSON \u2019s proposal , that the applicant receive involuntary treatment in ORG . It considered that she was suffering from a delusional disorder , which had affected DATE and which made her incapable either of seeing a matter from a viewpoint other than her own or of questioning the correctness of her own conclusions . She suspected that the authorities had \u201c ganged up \u201d on her . During the psychiatric assessment she had tried , as a medical doctor , to take a stand regarding the treatment of other patients on the ward . The delusional disorder , if not treated , would considerably worsen her mental illness or seriously endanger her health and the health of others . No other mental health services were considered adequate , having regard to the fact that the applicant did not consider herself to be mentally ill . The decision referred to sections CARDINAL , ORG ) and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant considered that she was not in need of mental health treatment , and wished to obtain a second opinion on her need for treatment . However , at DATE the hospital refused to allow a Dr M - P.H. to visit her during the ongoing psychiatric assessment .", "CARDINAL . The initiation of medication was discussed with the applicant on DATE . She was given the opportunity to take medication orally , but she repeatedly refused to do so . Owing to the applicant \u2019s resistance , the administering of medication began with involuntary injections of GPE . As the applicant had made it clear that she would not cooperate , it was decided to continue her medication by giving long - acting injections of ORG every DATE , starting on DATE . The basis of the decision was explained to the applicant and she was also given information about the drug . The issue of medication was discussed with the applicant on several occasions after that . She was encouraged to take it orally , but she persistently refused .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant \u2019s core symptoms persisted after DATE of medication , it was decided on DATE to increase the dosage of PERSON from QUANTITY to QUANTITY . It was reduced to QUANTITY again from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that when she had questioned the forcible administering of medication , she was informed that it was intended to cure her telephone surveillance delusion . The applicant argued that the surveillance had taken place and that there had been no delusion on her part .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant claimed to have been assaulted in connection with the forcible administering of medication . She had resisted , as she considered the medication unnecessary , whereupon she had been dragged by her arms and legs to her room . When she was put on the bed her thigh had hit the edge of the bed . She had reported the incident to the police , who had asked a medical doctor , PERSON , to examine her , which he did on DATE . In his medical opinion of CARDINAL DATE he noted that the applicant had a QUANTITY bruise on her thigh , which could have been caused in the manner described by the applicant .", "DATE . On DATE the head physician of the hospital decided to continue the applicant \u2019s involuntary treatment .", "CARDINAL . In a written statement of CARDINAL DATE to ORG the head physician of ORG , GPE , noted that the applicant was still in denial of her illness and very strongly opposed medical treatment . She was literally fighting back , and this had resulted in several difficult situations when attempts were being made to proceed with the administering of medication in a manner which would be safe for both the applicant and the hospital staff .", "CARDINAL . It appears that in DATE enquiries were made about a possible transfer of the applicant to a different hospital in her home town . However , that hospital did not consider itself able at that point to accept responsibility for the applicant \u2019s care .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that she was still suffering side effects from the medication . The applicant \u2019s patient records indicate that the alleged side effects could not be objectively verified . The applicant refused to undergo further medical examinations whereby any side effects could be detected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was visited by PERSON , a general practitioner at an occupational health care centre . In his opinion of CARDINAL DATE PERSON emphasised that he did not specialise in psychiatry and he could not therefore take a stand as to the diagnosed delusion on the basis of CARDINAL visit . He noted , however , that the applicant had been lucid and well - orientated . During their conversation he had not observed any signs of psychosis or delusion . In his capacity as a general practitioner , he considered that the conditions for involuntary treatment were not met .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was visited by a psychiatrist , Dr M - P.H. , who in a written medical opinion of DATE considered , as an outsider , that the choice of medication for the applicant ( QUANTITY of PERSON injected into the muscle DATE ) seemed excessive , given the patient \u2019s age and state of health . Furthermore , he considered that the involuntary and forced medication fulfilled the constitutive elements of assault . In conclusion , he considered that open - care measures were possible and that the danger posed by the applicant to herself and others had been considerably exaggerated , and accordingly that the criteria for involuntary care were not met .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the applicant \u2019s patient records that from DATE at the latest she was no longer physically resisting the injections , although she was still verbally opposing her medication .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hospital decided to move the applicant from the closed ward to an open one .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant agreed to blood tests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again saw PERSON , who in a written medical opinion of DATE considered that the conditions for involuntary care were not met .", "CARDINAL . The applicant spent DATE at home . She had with her a dose of PERSON , which she injected during her holiday with the assistance of a nurse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it was decided , by mutual agreement with the applicant , that the medication should be terminated , as she was not at all motivated to take it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head physician of the hospital took a further decision to continue the applicant \u2019s involuntary care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was discharged from hospital .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE Dr PERSON considered that the grounds for continuing the involuntary care under section CARDINAL of LAW no longer existed , whereupon the treatment was officially terminated by a decision of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltnings - domstolen ) against the decision of CARDINAL DATE by ORG , arguing that there was no legal basis for the involuntary care . She alleged that Dr PERSON had erred in his assessment . She relied , inter alia , on the above - mentioned medical opinion of PERSON , who had seen her twice , in DATE , and who had not found any signs of mental illness on the basis of those meetings . She alleged that there was no other reason for the forced medication than the hospital LOC attempt to conceal their incorrect diagnosis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found no reason to stay execution pending its proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prohibited Mr PERSON from acting as the applicant \u2019s representative . Under LAW , LAW ) , of LAW the applicant was invited to inform the court of her choice of counsel . Subsequently , the applicant was represented by PERSON , counsel chosen by her . She was granted legal aid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to hold an oral hearing in the case .", "DATE . On DATE and DATE the applicant requested the court to postpone the oral hearing until she had obtained an impartial medical opinion and until she had recovered from the side effects of her medication . On DATE she informed the court that she had fallen ill and again requested that the hearing be postponed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing and received the testimony of , inter alia , the applicant and CARDINAL witnesses proposed by her . The applicant was represented by PERSON", "CARDINAL . The court refused the applicant \u2019s request for a stay of the proceedings pending the submission of fresh medical opinions . The court considered this unnecessary given the fact that the issue to be decided was whether the applicant had been in need of involuntary care at DATE . The validity of the impugned decision had already expired , DATE had elapsed since it had been given . It was difficult to see how a fresh examination could affect the court \u2019s assessment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to the court a medical opinion by PERSON dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . Having first noted that the impugned decision met the formal requirements and that the applicant \u2019s complaint of partiality on the part of Dr PERSON and the members of ORG could not be upheld , it went on to note that the question to be decided was whether the criteria for involuntary care under section CARDINAL of ORG had been met on DATE , when the ORG had given its decision . The question of whether a person was mentally ill was a factual question to be decided on the basis of medical evidence , having due regard to the correctness of the decision - making procedure applied .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that Dr PERSON , a specialist in psychiatry since DATE , was an experienced psychiatrist . His opinion and the opinion of ORG were based on a professionally qualified and reliable medical assessment .", "CARDINAL . As to the subject matter the court reasoned , inter alia :", "\u201c ... PERSON interviewed the applicant on QUANTITY occasions and was then able to make observations on her . PERSON and ORG explained at the oral hearing that the diagnosis of delusion was affected by the absoluteness of the applicant \u2019s views on incest . They stressed that incest diagnoses required examinations by doctors specialising in gynaecology and also child psychiatry examinations . The applicant is a specialist in paediatrics . In particular , PERSON gave evidence that in his discussions with the applicant she had refused to take into account the possibility that there had been no incest , although she admitted in general that doctors could also be mistaken . The fact that witnesses PERSON and PERSON gave evidence that the applicant had explained her situation in a pertinent manner did not undermine the view of PERSON and ORG The doctors gave concordant evidence that the discussions with the applicant were pertinent as long as her view on the alleged incest was not contradicted . At the oral hearing it became evident that witnesses LAW had not disputed the applicant \u2019s views , but had mostly listened to what she had to say . S. indeed gave evidence that she had checked the information provided by the applicant against other sources , but as she had concluded that the views of the applicant were tenable , she had naturally not come into conflict with her . Witness P. had not taken a stand as to whether or not the applicant had a delusional disorder . He had only judged whether or not open - care measures were possible .", "According to PERSON , the diagnosis of delusion had also been affected by the applicant \u2019s continuing suspicion of authority and of medical and psychological examinations . PERSON also gave evidence about the numerous appeals made by the applicant and how her world centred on them . The applicant had refused a somatic and neurological examination , magnetic imaging and psychological tests because she believed that the tests would be carried out by biased and prejudiced persons .", "The applicant has the right to refuse to be examined in respect of her mental health . On the other hand , it is justifiable to question the basis for the absolute refusal to undergo the examinations offered and whether the refusal may be based precisely on thinking typical of a delusional disorder . Having regard to these considerations , it can not be said that the diagnosis of delusional disorder was based on improper or arbitrary grounds , although the applicant has explained her refusal of examinations by stating that she had the right to do so , and her writing of legal submissions by stating that it was necessary to do so . At the oral hearing the applicant admitted that a deluded person would probably not be aware of her own illness .", "At the oral hearing the applicant \u2019s son , PERSON , a doctor in general practice , gave evidence stating that he understood , given his mother \u2019s absolute and rigid behaviour , that she had been diagnosed as delusional . He could not , however , be certain of the correctness of the diagnosis , since he had seen his mother only a few times in DATE .", "On the basis of the documents in the file and the information received at the oral hearing , and on the above grounds , ORG finds that reliable evidence has been provided for the diagnosis of delusional disorder in the decision of ORG .", "A diagnosis of delusional disorder as such does not , however , suffice to warrant involuntary treatment . In addition , its effects on the person concerned and on others must be assessed .", "The decision of ORG was that the applicant was in need of involuntary treatment and that , if not treated , her mental illness would considerably worsen and seriously endanger her health and the health of others .", "According to information received , when the decision on treatment was taken regard was had to the repercussions for the applicant \u2019s life if her conflicts with the authorities and raising of associated issues were to continue . At the time it was considered that the applicant was not able to think matters through and that ordering treatment could help her to continue life in a calmer way .", "These considerations must be held to be pertinent to an assessment of the need for the involuntary treatment for the sake of the applicant \u2019s own health . The fact that after DATE of treatment and medication the head physician , Dr ORG , in his explanation of CARDINAL DATE , and the witnesses put forward by the applicant , in their statements , expressed divergent conclusions does not justify calling into question the assessment of ORG regarding the need for treatment on DATE for the sake of the applicant \u2019s health .", "ORG did not consider that , if not treated , the applicant would seriously endanger the safety of others . However , it held that the health of others could be seriously endangered . It should be taken into account that the applicant could have an influence on other people , owing to the authority which she enjoys by reason of her status as a paediatrician . She may engender in other people suspicions which lack real foundation , causing them to act hastily , inappropriately or even criminally . The possibility of this kind of influence is not lessened by the fact that the applicant is retired . Nor would the possibility of influence be prevented by the mere withdrawal of the applicant \u2019s licence to practise medicine , because the influencing is exerted on a psychological level and also in contexts other than that of a doctor \u2019s consulting room .", "The nurse assigned to the applicant , P. , gave evidence to the effect that the applicant was not dangerous to other people . Although in his witness statement he also raised the issue of whether the applicant had given other patients dangerous advice , P. \u2019s testimony can be regarded as a common judgment of a person \u2019s dangerousness , such as violent behaviour or similar . This is not the case when it comes to the applicant . On the contrary , all the witnesses have concordantly testified that she tries to do good things and tries to help others . The doctors treating her have made similar statements . This intention does not , however , obviate the possibility that the actions of the person could cause harm to others . In this case there are sufficient grounds for holding that , if not treated , the applicant could have seriously endangered the health of others .", "Other mental health services are inadequate , having regard to the fact that the applicant is in denial as regards her illness . That being the case , it can be held that the applicant would try to avoid treatment and would refuse examinations .", "Conclusion", "ORG finds , on the basis of the documents in the file and the information received at the oral hearing , that it has been reliably and objectively shown that the applicant was , at the time of the decision of ORG , mentally ill within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW . Owing to her mental illness , she was in need of treatment and , if not treated , her mental illness would have considerably worsened or seriously endangered her health and the health of others . Other mental health services would not have been adequate . The conditions for ordering the applicant to undergo involuntary hospital treatment were thus present . The decision of ORG ordering treatment was based on LAW and was made in accordance with the procedure laid down by law . Nor is the decision unlawful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of a medical observation report by the doctor treating the applicant and the applicant \u2019s medical records , the head physician of ORG decided to continue her treatment . It was noted that the applicant had , inter alia , criticised the treatment being given in the hospital and had tried to play a role in other ORG treatment in her capacity as a doctor . She had also given them instructions concerning medication , even after she had been forbidden to do so . Open - care measures were considered insufficient , because the applicant was in denial of her illness and completely lacked motivation in relation to her treatment .", "DATE . The decision of DATE was submitted for confirmation to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) . The applicant also appealed against that decision to the same court , requesting an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having obtained a statement from the head physician of ORG and the applicant \u2019s comments on it , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It observed that the applicant \u2019s condition had improved during treatment and that there had been discussions about a possible transfer to a psychiatric hospital in her home town . The court noted that the applicant was not suicidal and thus not endangering her own health , nor was she violent towards others . She was able to discuss DATE matters in a pertinent and polite manner as long as no one contested her views . However , she was still denying her illness , which manifested itself in her opposition to medical treatment and all further medical examinations offered her . The denial of the illness and lack of motivation in relation to treatment led the court to the conclusion that the applicant would most likely neglect treatment outside the hospital , which would severely aggravate her illness and endanger her health . As her delusion was related to her medical profession and her patients , lack of treatment could also put the health of others at serious risk . ORG also dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing as manifestly unnecessary , making reference to the hearing held by ORG on DATE . Moreover , the court considered that the main issue , that of whether the applicant \u2019s condition had improved to the extent that grounds for involuntary treatment no longer existed , could be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file alone .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed further to ORG , citing , inter alia , the medical opinion of DATE by PERSON , the medical opinion of DATE by PERSON , and those of DATE and DATE by PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having obtained a fresh statement from the head physician of ORG and the applicant \u2019s comments on it , upheld the lower court \u2019s decision , on mainly the same grounds . It rejected the applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing , finding oral evidence on circumstances which prevailed after the adoption of the impugned decision of DATE irrelevant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head physician of ORG took a further decision to continue the applicant \u2019s involuntary care , based on a medical observation report by another hospital physician . It was noted that the applicant \u2019s condition had improved and that she was currently cooperating with hospital staff . While her sense of reality still failed her as far as the criminal charge against her was concerned , she was able to discuss the matter pertinently and without agitation .

On DATE ORG gave its decision in respect of those complaints . It relied on the judgment of DATE by ORG in finding that the confinement of the applicant in involuntary care had been justified . As a general remark it was noted that the primary and sometimes only symptom of a delusional disorder was a false belief which the patient holds to and attempts to act upon . The delusion was continuous , clear and systematic , and could be very persistent and steadfast . It was common for a patient suffering from a delusional disorder not to manifest any other anomalous behaviour . A special form of delusion was what was known as a querulous delusion , which was characterised by continual claims for rectification , complaints and legal proceedings , driven by psychotic thinking , with the aim of restoring the person \u2019s injured self - esteem . A delusional disorder was treated with therapeutic consultations and antipsychotic medicines . Lack of motivation for treatment and an inadequate response to treatment posed fundamental risks to the successful outcome of medical treatment . As regards the applicant \u2019s treatment , and the forced administration of medication in particular , ORG found no indication of conduct deviating from appropriate and commonly accepted medical practice , so her representations could therefore be considered erroneous .

The regional medical officer also met the applicant \u2019s representative . Furthermore , the authority acquainted itself with the applicant \u2019s medical records and other documents related to the case and obtained written statements from hospital staff and the applicant \u2019s comments on them . In its decision of DATE ORG noted that the issues raised by the applicant had previously been thoroughly examined by ORG , which had found no irregularities . In the light of its own examination of the case , ORG did not find that there was any reason to take further measures . The decision was not subject to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG found that the applicant \u2019s capacity to look after her own interests in the criminal proceedings was reduced by her mental illness and that she was therefore in need of a guardian .

The court did not pass sentence on them as they were not responsible for their actions at the material time . However , it ordered them to pay damages and legal costs .", "CARDINAL . As regards the background to the case , the court noted that ORG had been examined from DATE TIME as a result of her mother \u2019s suspicions that she had been sexually abused . The public prosecutor PERSON had decided on DATE not to prefer charges against the father , as there was no evidence that an offence had taken place during the period from DATE . On DATE the public prosecutor PERSON waived charges against another person , as there was no evidence that an offence had taken place in DATE . On DATE the public prosecutor PERSON waived charges against the father , as there was no evidence that an offence had taken place during the period from DATE . In DATE the mother took ORG to a university hospital for examination . Those examinations did not support her suspicions of sexual abuse .

Meanwhile , on DATE the mother removed the girl from the centre without permission and they were found DATE in a town QUANTITY away , whereupon the girl was returned to the centre by the police . On DATE ORG granted the father sole custody of the girl , who was to see her mother during supervised visits CARDINAL times a week .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s actions , the court noted that she had expressed a number of opinions which could not be regarded as medical opinions . She had predominantly functioned as an aide to the girl \u2019s mother , making suggestions on what measures to take . The applicant had been aware of the fact that the girl had been taken into public care and on DATE the police had told her that the girl was missing . The court found it established that ORG and her mother had come to meet the applicant on DATE . Since that date the applicant had found accommodation for them and transported them in her car . The applicant had allowed the mother \u2019s mail to be redirected to her address . The court noted that it had not even been suggested that the applicant had been in [ town A ] on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE Mr GPE informed the applicant that , as her guardian , he had notified ORG of the applicant \u2019s intention to appeal against its judgment . He asked the applicant to state her opinion on the judgment in writing and informed her that he would be in GPE on DATE , should the applicant wish to meet him in person . It appears that no meeting took place .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE subsequently appealed on the applicant \u2019s behalf , arguing that the charge should be rejected on the grounds of lack of intent . In her capacity as a doctor , the applicant had only wished to protect the mother and the child as she was firmly convinced that the girl had been sexually abused . The guardian took the view that the case could be examined by the appellate court in a written procedure . On CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON sent a copy of the notice of appeal to the applicant for information , noting that it corresponded , in the main , to the draft he had sent her earlier , on DATE . He also noted that the applicant had not made any comments on that draft .", "CARDINAL . In her own writ of appeal the applicant requested an oral hearing , at which she wished the court to hear the same CARDINAL witnesses she had requested in the proceedings before ORG . She also questioned the motives of the public prosecutor in bringing charges for an aggravated offence . The applicant had acquired a copy of his notes to the proceedings , in which it was implied that a psychiatric assessment was the only means of treatment , which , in turn , was the only means of stopping the terrorising of the father and the child and the misuse of justice .

Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW stipulates , inter alia , that it is a court \u2019s task to ensure that a case is dealt with in a coherent and orderly manner . It shall also ensure that the proceedings are conducted appropriately and that no irrelevant issues are introduced .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG report concerns the consent of a patient to treatment given in a mental hospital . It reads as follows :", "\u201c Patients should , as a matter of principle , be placed in a position to give their free and informed consent to treatment . The admission of a person to a psychiatric establishment on an involuntary basis should not be construed as authorising treatment without his consent . It follows that every competent patient , whether voluntary or involuntary , should be given the opportunity to refuse treatment or any other medical intervention . Any derogation from this fundamental principle should be based upon law and only relate to clearly and strictly defined exceptional circumstances .", "Of course , consent to treatment can only be qualified as free and informed if it is based on full , accurate and comprehensible information about the patient \u2019s condition and the treatment proposed ; to describe ECT as \" sleep therapy \" is an example of less than full and accurate information about the treatment concerned . Consequently , all patients should be provided systematically with relevant information about their condition and the treatment which it is proposed to prescribe for them . Relevant information ( results , etc . ) should also be provided following treatment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG visited GPE from DATE , ORG being among the establishments visited . In paragraph CARDINAL of its report , published on DATE , the ORG made the following remark :", "\u201c As regards safeguards , the procedures concerning the mental examination of persons accused of a crime and the initial placement of such persons offered , overall , adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality as well as objective medical expertise . By contrast , the manner in which an order for treatment in respect of both civil and forensic patients was being renewed would merit a reassessment . The ORG considers that the periodic review of an order to treat a patient against his / her will in a psychiatric hospital should involve a psychiatric opinion which is independent of the hospital in which the patient is detained . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP On its next visit to GPE , CARDINAL DATE , the ORG visited , inter alia , ORG and another psychiatric establishment . In its report , published on DATE , the ORG made , inter alia , the following remarks and recommendations :", "\u201c ... CARDINAL - In both establishments , the use of psychiatric medication appeared appropriate . As regards ORG , the current rhythm of formal multidisciplinary clinical review ( twice a year ) is not sufficient . Staff representing different specialties ( psychiatrists , nurses , psychologists , occupational and work therapists , social workers ) should all meet and discuss each patient \u2019s condition and progress on a more frequent basis . The ORG recommends that steps be taken in the light of these remarks ...", "CARDINAL - Involuntary hospitalisation of a psychiatric patient continued to be construed as automatically authorising treatment without his / her consent . In practice , doctors in the CARDINAL psychiatric establishments visited sought to obtain ORG verbal consent to treatment , but there was no written proof that such informed consent had been given . Further , a patient \u2019s refusal or subsequent withdrawal of consent to treatment did not result in an external independent psychiatric review as to whether treatment could be provided against the patient \u2019s will . In addition , patients could not appeal against such decisions to a court .", "The ORG recommends that a special form relating to informed consent to treatment , signed by the patient and ( if he is incompetent ) by his legal representative , be introduced at the ... and ORG ( as well as in all other psychiatric establishments in GPE ) . The relevant legislation should be amended so as to require an external psychiatric opinion in any case where a patient does not agree with the treatment proposed by the establishment \u2019s doctors ; further , patients should be able to appeal against a compulsory treatment decision to the court ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-e"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
