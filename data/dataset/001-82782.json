{"ITEMID": "001-82782", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "BUSSMANN v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( Main ) . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE ( Main ) .", "The applicant has a daughter born in DATE . In DATE , he divorced the mother of the child who has obtained the sole right to custody ( alleiniges PERSON ) and with whom the child is living . In DATE , both parents agreed that the applicant should have access to the child on a DATE basis . The relationship between the parents subsequently deteriorated . In DATE , the mother refused the applicant \u2019s access because the child suffered from headaches and bad dreams . In DATE , the child \u2019s mother filed a claim in order to exclude the applicant \u2019s access rights .", "On DATE , the GPE ( Main ) ORG suspended the applicant \u2019s access rights to his child for DATE . ORG had heard the child in DATE in the presence of the curator ad litem ( PERSON ) . After the competent judge at ORG had changed , it heard the child again in DATE . Moreover , it considered an expert opinion and heard the expert , a psychologist , in person . On this basis , ORG concluded that the exclusion of the applicant \u2019s access rights was necessary for the child \u2019s welfare pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law , below ) . It reasoned that the child , being almost DATE and going through the period of puberty , severely suffered from the fact that her mother was unable to give her the necessary support to deal with the applicant \u2019s visits . ORG observed that the mother had reacted very agitated during a court hearing because of the applicant \u2019s presence . According to the expert , that situation was emotionally extremely difficult for , and harmful to , the child . The child had testified during the last court hearing that she wanted to decide for herself when to see the applicant , a view that was also confirmed by the curator ad litem . During the visits , the applicant would constantly talk , mostly in a derogatory way about the mother , and seek to manipulate the child \u2019s views , even in the presence of a neutral third person . Because of his age and his lack of understanding , the applicant could not be expected to change his behaviour , as could be seen by the content of a letter which he had sent for the child \u2019s twelfth birthday . Moreover , the applicant had approached the child at school on CARDINAL occasions which had been very embarrassing for her . ORG also ordered the mother to ensure that the child would write to the applicant DATE . Considering that the child did not obtain the emotional support from her , ORG ordered the mother to bring the child to a psychological clinic for juveniles in order to start a therapy with a view to teach the child that affection and sympathy was not inevitably connected with the intrusive and manipulative conduct which the applicant had shown . As results of that therapy could not be expected earlier , it was necessary to exclude the applicant \u2019s access rights for DATE .", "On DATE , the GPE ( ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , granted the mother legal aid and refused to grant legal aid to the applicant because his appeal lacked any prospects of success . ORG found that ORG had rightly excluded the applicant \u2019s access rights for DATE , in particular taking into account that during the proceedings the child had clearly stated that she felt hassled and not taken serious by the applicant , that she did not want any further visits ( even in the presence of third persons ) and that she wanted the applicant to respect her decision . The present proceedings however showed that the applicant was incapable of accepting this . The applicant had paid CARDINAL uninvited visits to the child \u2019s school which had been very awkward for the child . Moreover , the letter which the applicant had sent to the child showed his negative attitude towards the mother and put the child under massive pressure . The content of the father \u2019s letter indicated that the child \u2019s objections had not been manipulated by the mother . ORG had rightly found that there was no indication that the applicant would show comprehension and change his behaviour . The applicant did not appear to be aware or interested in the child \u2019s needs . Moreover , ORG had rightly taken the view that the mother \u2019s behaviour had also not contributed to a normal relationship between the child and the applicant either . At the same time the mother had been willing to accept the help offered by ORG . Taking into consideration the age of the child , ORG considered it best to give the child the opportunity to reflect on her situation without the distress of the applicant \u2019s visits and to decide for herself about any future contacts with the applicant to whom she still had a clearly visible relationship .", "ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint on DATE .", "Section DATE", "\u201c CARDINAL . The child is entitled to have access to both parents ; each parent is obliged to have contact with , and entitled to have access to , the child .", "CARDINAL . NORP The parents must not do anything that would harm the child \u2019s relationship with the other parent or seriously interfere with the child \u2019s upbringing . ...", "CARDINAL . The family courts can determine the scope of the right of access and prescribe more specific rules for its exercise , also with regard to third parties . They may order the parties to fulfil their obligations towards the child .", "CARDINAL . The family courts may restrict or suspend the right of access or the enforcement of previous decisions on access if this is necessary for the child \u2019s welfare . A decision restricting or suspending the right of access or its enforcement for a longer period of time or permanently may only be taken if the child \u2019s well - being were endangered otherwise . The family courts may order in particular that contacts may only take place in the presence of a cooperating third party . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
