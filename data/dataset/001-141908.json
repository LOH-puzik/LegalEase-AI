The report drawn up by the police officers described the CARDINAL NORP youths as skinheads , adding that they were already known to the police for various offences such as breach of the peace , theft , burglary and drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police initiated a preliminary investigation . The applicant and his friend , the CARDINAL NORP youths and an eyewitness were interviewed . According to the applicant \u2019s submissions , PERSON and he had been coming out of the shopping centre when they were attacked by the CARDINAL young men . The first NORP , who had a shaved head , had thrown the applicant on to the ground and kicked him . The applicant had then got up and punched him back . The CARDINAL NORP had insulted them by calling them \u201c NORP \u201d ( \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0438 ) , also shouting \u201c dirty GPE , what are you doing here ? \u201d . The second NORP , who had long hair , had brandished a knife and threatened GPE with it . The applicant and PERSON had fled , and had met a police patrol , which had started looking for the CARDINAL NORP and managed to arrest them TIME . PERSON \u2019s statements broadly corroborated those of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the fight had begun because CARDINAL of the NORP youths had shoved him with his shoulder when they had passed each other at the entrance to the shopping centre . He said that he had not paid any attention to what his friend PERSON had been doing . The fighting had stopped at some stage and his friend and he had fled when someone warned them that the police were on their way .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed that CARDINAL of the NORP men had pushed his friend PERSON as he passed by and that that was when the fight had started . Blows had been exchanged on both sides , and PERSON had had his face bloodied . At CARDINAL stage ORG had taken out his knife , which had put an end to the fight , and the CARDINAL groups had then gone their separate ways . PERSON and PERSON had been arrested by the police TIME .", "CARDINAL . The eyewitness stated that he had seen one of the NORP , the one with the shaved head , trip up CARDINAL of the NORP men , who had then riposted with a punch . A general fight had then broken out among the QUANTITY persons involved .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was examined by a forensic medical expert on CARDINAL DATE . According to the medical certificate drawn up on that occasion , the applicant had a swelling of the nasal base , an approximately onecentimetrelong abrasion on the left - hand side of his nose , covered with a scab , a swollen finger on his left hand and a contusion to the right knee . According to the medical certificate , the injuries noted had caused physical pain . They had resulted from blows struck by blunt instruments and could have been occasioned in the manner described by the applicant , namely in the course of a fight .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the investigation the police transmitted the evidence gathered to the public prosecutor for a decision on instituting a criminal prosecution for racist violence pursuant to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE the district prosecutor decided not to bring a criminal prosecution . He considered that while a fight had indeed occurred among the CARDINAL men , it had not been established that GPE and ORG had acted for reasons linked to ORG and the applicant \u2019s racial origins . The causes of the altercation were unclear , and the CARDINAL versions of the facts \u2013 by the applicant and PERSON , by PERSON and GPE , and by the eyewitness \u2013conflicted as to how and by whom the fight had been started . The CARDINAL NORP men had claimed that they had been called \u201c dirty NORP \u201d , but the fact that it had been precisely their racial origin that had motivated the violence had not been corroborated by any other piece of evidence . The eyewitness , in particular , had not mentioned having heard any exchanges between those involved . The prosecutor concluded that in the absence of evidence of the specific motivation provided for by law , the offence had not been made out .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with the higher prosecutor against the decision not to prosecute . He submitted that the investigation had been incomplete and that the investigators should have questioned PERSON and GPE about their motivation and their reasons for wearing black clothing , \u201c Ranger - style \u201d military shoes and even NORP insignia , as he remembered seeing such insignia on a T - shirt worn by CARDINAL of the assailants . According to the applicant , the police officers who had attended the scene should also have been interviewed about how PERSON and GPE had been dressed at the time of their arrest . Similarly , the investigators should have explicitly asked the eyewitness whether he had heard the exchanges between those involved , which they had not .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office confirmed the district prosecutor \u2019s decision . The public prosecutor held that there was nothing to suggest that the violence had been perpetrated on the grounds of the applicant \u2019s racial origin as the sole fact that he was black was insufficient to make out the offence .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked for a copy of the criminal case file , without providing reasons for her request . On DATE the district prosecutor refused to supply the copies requested on the grounds that the lawyer had already been notified of the prosecutor \u2019s decisions and that now that the appeal had been dismissed , the case was closed .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
