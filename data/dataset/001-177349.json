The applicant is a journalist for PERSON , a NORP Internet - based version of the newspaper ORG ( \u201c DN \u201d ) , published by the company ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was indicted for market manipulation and insider trading under LAW on ORG ( verdipapirhandelloven ) . He was accused of having requested Mr Y , an attorney , to draft a letter concerning ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a limited liability company quoted on the stock exchange . The letter , addressed to a trustee company representing the interests of bond holders in ORG ( \u201c the bond trustee company \u201d ) , gave the impression that it had been written on behalf of a number of bond holders who were seriously concerned about the company \u2019s liquidity , finances and future . In fact , it had been written only on PERSON behalf . He had owned CARDINAL bond , which he had acquired DATE as he had asked attorney Y to draft the letter .", "CARDINAL . Mr X had sent a copy of the above - mentioned letter by fax to the applicant on DATE , and in this connection he had a telephone conversation with her . DATE , on DATE , the applicant wrote an article entitled \u201c Fears of ORG collapse \u201d ( \u201c PERSON at ORG rakner \u201d ) , in which she expressed strong concerns about the content of Attorney Y \u2019s letter , a central feature in the article .", "CARDINAL . The price of ORG stock fell by PERCENT on DATE , the first trading DATE after the content of the letter had become known in the press . On DATE , a new article on the topic was published in ORG . Other media also reported on the first article , including an online newspaper ( ORG online ) which on DATE reported that an analyst had stated that he would not be surprised if the letter had been sent by a person with a short - position or who wanted cheap stocks . The GPE stock exchange ( GPE b\u00f8rs ) suspected market manipulation and , having looked into the matter , forwarded the case to ORG ) with suspicions that PERSON had infringed the LAW on ORG . During subsequent questioning by ORG , PERSON confirmed that he had initiated the letter and been the source of the article in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was questioned by the police on DATE . They informed her that PERSON had told the police that he had given her the letter . She was handed a signed statement from PERSON in which he confirmed this . The applicant was willing to say that she had received the letter on which the article was based by fax on DATE , at TIME She also stated that the article had been published on PERSON at TIME on DATE . The applicant further explained that she had considered the information in the letter as price - sensitive . She had no particular thoughts as to how many persons were behind the letter , beyond the fact that it had been signed on behalf of several bond holders . The applicant refused to give additional information , referring to the journalistic principles on protection of sources .", "CARDINAL . During the criminal case against PERSON in DATE before ORG ( tingrett ) , the applicant was summoned as a witness . She refused to answer questions about possible contacts between her and Mr X and other sources , if any , related to the publication by PERSON on DATE . Relying on LAW , she argued that she was under no obligation to give evidence on those points .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor requested that the court impose on the applicant an order to testify . In the court records ( \u201c rettsboken \u201d ) , his arguments in favour of issuing such an order are restated as having included the following :", "\u201c The prosecutor rose to speak and argued that the witness had an obligation to give testimony about her contact with the defendant in connection with the letter to [ the bond trustee company ] of DATE and asked the court to make a decision on the matter . The prosecutor further justified the obligation of the witness to make a statement and argued that undoubtedly in this case it was desirable to hear her explanation , even if the prosecuting authority found the case adequately disclosed ( fullgodt opplyst ) without her statement . The press was sometimes abused by investors to take actions liable to affect the share price . The element of abuse should suggest that in a case like this the press would also have an interest in making a statement in order to avoid being abused in this way . Whether or not consent had been given by the source to the witness making her statement had no bearing on the obligation to give evidence . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . From the same records , it appears that PERSON , through his counsel and cocounsel , had submitted that he had described his contact with the applicant and that she could contribute nothing further of interest .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the applicant had a duty to give evidence about her contacts with PERSON in relation to the letter of DATE from Attorney Y to the bond trustee company . As to the scope of that duty , ORG held :", "\u201c The obligation to make a statement is , however , limited to the contact with the defendant as a source and not her communication with possible other unknown sources with whom she has been in contact and who may be protected by the protection of sources . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor then stated , according to the hearing protocol , \u201c that he would not ask for postponement of the case as the prosecuting authority considers the case to be sufficiently disclosed ( \u201c tilstrekkelig opplyst \u201d ) even without the statement of the witness [ the applicant ] \u201d . It was then clarified that the applicant \u2019s appeal against the order would not be forwarded to ORG until after ORG judgment in the case against PERSON had been delivered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted PERSON in accordance with the indictment and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , of which DATE were suspended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The judgment contains the following passage :", "\u201c CARDINAL of the witnesses pleaded , as a journalist , the protection of sources under LAW and was not willing to explain about her potential contact with the accused . The court held that the witness had an obligation to explain about her contact with the accused since he , as the source of the PERSON article , was known and the court ruled accordingly . An appeal was immediately made against the decision . No motion for extension was made ( pending a final decision ) as according to the prosecutor the case was sufficiently disclosed ( tilstrekkelig opplyst ) even without the statement by [ the applicant ] and this was used as a basis by the court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr X appealed to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) against ORG assessment of the evidence and application of the law in relation to the issue of guilt , its procedure and the sentence ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG against ORG order of DATE . It rejected the appeal by a decision of DATE , finding it generally decisive whether the source was known . In this case , it had been established beyond reasonable doubt that PERSON had been the applicant \u2019s source .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicant to ORG was rejected by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL on DATE ( PERSON . DATE page CARDINAL ) . The appeal had been directed at ORG assessment of evidence as well as its application of the law . The disagreement in ORG concerned primarily the interpretation of the first paragraph of LAW , according to which , inter alia , journalists may refuse to answer questions as to who is the source of information confided to them for use in their work ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The CARDINAL factions of ORG disagreed , in particular , as to whether this provision was applicable if the source had stepped forward or the identity of the source had otherwise been established .", "CARDINAL . NORP The majority observed that it did not appear from the wording of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW that it was relevant whether the source had disclosed his or her role or that this role had in other ways become known . However , the wording could not be given decisive weight . It emerged from the preparatory work that the legislature had not , with the chosen formulation , taken a stance on the issue at stake in the present case . There was therefore greater reason to assess whether the rationale underpinning the main rule , namely the right not to answer questions concerning the identity of the source , could also be given significant weight when the person , who had been the source of the information , had given evidence concerning his or her role and had confirmed being the source . It was difficult to see that this should be the case .", "CARDINAL . If the imposition of an obligation on the press to give evidence were limited to cases where the source had come forward , the person who was considering giving information to the press would know that it was up to him or her to determine whether the person who received the information would have an obligation to give evidence . There was thus no cogent reason why such a conditional obligation to give evidence should lead to increased scepticism towards providing information to the press . The same would , to a great extent , be true if the obligation to give evidence also applied when the identity of the source had become known in some other way . While the possibility that the identity of the source might be disclosed could well constitute a deterrent , it would hardly make much difference if information already known was also confirmed by the recipient of the information .", "CARDINAL . An obligation on the press to give evidence in such cases was not thought likely to weaken the public \u2019s general trust that the press would protect its sources . The situation under review did not concern the disclosure of sources but rather whether the person \u2019s role had become known by other means .", "CARDINAL . The majority further disagreed with the applicant \u2019s view that there was no reason to treat a situation , where the informant had identified himself or herself as the source , differently from those cases where the source had consented to being identified . A person who so consented could do so , trusting that the recipient of the information would respect the protection of sources as long as the identity of the source was unknown . Once an informant had confirmed that he was the source , this fact would become known . Should the recipient of the information then refuse to give evidence , this would normally appear futile . In such a situation , an exemption from the obligation to give evidence would in reality not constitute a protection against having to disclose the source , but rather a right to avoid contributing to the elucidation of a criminal case .", "CARDINAL . Interpreting LAW in the light of certain statements made in the preparatory work ( PERSON . nr . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , pp . CARDINAL and DATE ) as followed up in ORG caselaw ( ORG . DATE page DATE and DATE page CARDINAL ) , the majority held that this provision did not apply when the source had come forward and had confirmed his or her role . The same ought probably to apply when the identity of the source had been established beyond reasonable doubt by other means . If the state of the evidence was such that confirmation by the journalist of the identity of the source could not be said to assist in identifying the source , it seemed unquestionable to maintain the obligation to testify .", "CARDINAL . As to whether a more wide - reaching protection of journalistic sources followed from LAW , the majority had regard to ORG case - law , including PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL ) , ORG and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) and the ORG judgment in ORG v. the GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE noting that ORG had decided the latter case on a different ground ) . They observed that in the CARDINAL NORP cases , a violation had been found under the necessity test even though strong countervailing arguments had been present . The majority further noted that there was no decision where the ORG had examined the situation where the source had come forward and where in this sense there was no source to protect ( \u201c ingen kilde \u00e5 beskytte \u201d ) . The principal justification for source protection , as elaborated by the ORG in its case - law , was based on the consequences that the disclosure of a source \u2019s identity might have for the free flow of information . However , these considerations did not apply where the source had confirmed his or her participation .", "CARDINAL . Against this background , one could safely assume that no violation of the ORG would arise where a source had come forward and the obligation of the witness to give evidence had been expressly limited so as not to include questions that might lead to other sources being revealed . Also , the charge in this case had been based on the fact that the journalist had allowed herself to be used by the source in his efforts to manipulate the bonds market in a criminal manner . It was a serious criminal case , where it seemed likely that the applicant \u2019s evidence might significantly assist in elucidating the concrete circumstances of the defendant \u2019s contact with her .", "CARDINAL . The minority observed that , should the applicant be ordered to testify concerning her possible contact with PERSON about Attorney Y \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE to the trustee company , she would have to confirm or deny that PERSON was the source for her article on PERSON on DATE . By making a statement on this matter , she might also inadvertently reveal other potential sources . The legal question at hand was whether a journalist might rely on source protection if the source , without the journalist having revealed it , could be identified with more or less certainty by other evidence .", "CARDINAL . The wording of LAW was absolute and granted members of the press , broadcasting and other media the right to \u201c refuse to answer questions concerning who is ... the source \u201d . The provision made no exception for cases where the identity could be established with more or less certainty in some other way .", "CARDINAL . The protection of sources by journalists was , according to ORG case - law , \u201c one of the basic conditions for press freedom \u201d ( PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) . The purpose was not to protect the source , but rather the public interest in free communication of news and opinions ( ORG . DATE page CARDINAL ) . If journalists were allowed to protect their sources , they would obtain information enabling them to uncover matters in society that were worthy of criticism more easily than they would otherwise . The fact that it was for the journalist to decide to what extent he or she would rely on such protection reflected that it was not the source who was protected . If the journalist was willing to reveal the source , the source could not prevent it .", "CARDINAL . If it were a precondition for the protection of journalistic sources that no other proof of the source had been presented , such protection would be undermined . This would enable a source to be tracked down , even if a requirement for waiver of source protection was that the source be identified with a criminal standard of proof . If the hearing of evidence on the identity of a source were to be allowed , the media \u2019s working conditions would become considerably more constricted and society \u2019s interest in free communication of information and opinions would suffer .", "CARDINAL . If consent to source disclosure by a potential source should have the effect of removing source protection , the actual source might easily be identified and source protection would be undermined . In the present case PERSON had stated that he was the source . A situation where someone claimed to be the source ought to be considered in the same way as where the source consented to disclosure of his or her identity . A person might incorrectly claim to be the source so that the actual source might be identified by a process of elimination . And even if it were true that this person was the source , it would erode the journalist \u2019s right to source protection should the person who was the source be able to cancel the journalist \u2019s right . In addition , journalists often had several sources . If a journalist could be ordered to describe his or her contact with a person who claimed to be the source , his or her contact with other sources might also be revealed .", "CARDINAL . Equally , a combination of someone claiming to be the source and other evidence confirming this , should not lead to source protection being removed . Effective source protection was necessary in order to ensure free communication of information and opinions . It should not be permissible for press journalists to confirm or deny that a person claiming to be the source was in fact the source , even where there was weighty evidence to this effect . As mentioned above , it was not the source , but society \u2019s interest in free communication of news and opinions , which was to be protected .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor had argued that PERSON had used the applicant as a tool to commit serious crimes , and this would have constituted a relevant argument , had the case been one concerning a possible individual exception to the right to non - disclosure of sources made under the third paragraph of LAW . However , the prosecutor had not relied on that paragraph of the provision , and the source \u2019s motive could not render the principle of source protection as such inapplicable . Within the ambit of LAW , freedom of speech did not protect only information and views that were positively received , but also those which offended , shocked or disturbed the ORG or parts of the population . Therefore , the fundamental right of journalists to protect their sources could not be dependent on the sources\u2019 motives .", "CARDINAL . Mr X \u2019s appeal against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was examined by ORG , which summoned and heard the applicant as a witness on DATE . She answered certain questions but affirmed that she still would not reply to questions about her contacts with Mr X. The court records contain the following passage :", "\u201c When heard as a witness [ the applicant ] stated that she had received Attorney [ Y ] \u2019s letter by fax on DATE at TIME She does not wish to answer questions about who she had received the letter from or on her possible contact with Mr [ X ] during the period before or after this point in time . The presiding judge pointed out to the witness that after a legally enforceable decision by ORG she was obliged to give evidence about her contacts with Mr [ X ] . The presiding judge underlined that an omission to reply to such questions could constitute a ground for the imposition of a fine for an offence against the good order of court proceedings [ \u201c rettergangsbot \u201d ] . It was emphasised that the duty to reply lay on the witness personally and that a possible fine would be imposed on her personally . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On account of her refusal to comply , ORG , by a decision of DATE , ordered the applicant to pay a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) , MONEY ( ORG ) for an offence against the good order of court proceedings , failing which she would be liable to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant did not appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG convicted PERSON on the charges and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
