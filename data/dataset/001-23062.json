GREECE", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in Xanthi . The Government are represented by PERSON and PERSON of ORG , Acting Agents .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant , who considers himself a member of the NORP minority of Thrace , is a graduate of ORG . He used to work as a teacher in the minority schools of CARDINAL . His conditions of employment were not different from those of other civil servants .", "On DATE ORG GPE called all the NORP teachers of the minority schools of GPE to attend an educational meeting on DATE . The aim of the meeting was to present new books for the teaching of the NORP language , which would be delivered to the directors of the schools between QUANTITY and DATE .", "A similar order was issued on DATE by ORG .", "On DATE the Co - ordination ORG of the NORP Minority of Western Thrace issued a statement to the effect that the content of these books \u201c was in breach of the autonomy of the NORP Minority of Western Thrace \u201d and failed to respect certain international agreements . The NORP teachers were called upon not to collect these books and the NORP pupils not to attend school DATE , in order to voice the protest of the NORP Minority of Western Thrace .", "On DATE ORG issued a statement to the effect that the NORP schools of LOC would be closed DATE , because the NORP teachers of LOC were against the NORP language books which ORG intended to distribute to the pupils of the minority schools . The statement also said that all the NORP teachers of LOC would participate in the strike . Reference was made to the members of ORG who were graduates of ORG . The statement specified that all those who felt they were NORP and who wanted to learn or teach the NORP language would take part in the boycott .", "On an unspecified date , a NORP religious leader , the mufti of Xanthi , called on the NORP teachers who felt they were NORP , not to go to the presentation of the books on DATE .", "On DATE CARDINAL teachers of the minority schools of Xanthi , including the applicant , signed a statement to the effect that they would not attend the educational meeting in ORG in order to protest about certain unfair decisions against them concerning posting , transfer and secondment and their exclusion from training seminars in GPE and GPE . They specified that they would not carry out their duties DATE .", "On DATE ORG of ORG of the NORP Minority of Western Thrace issued a statement congratulating the pupils and teachers who took part in the mobilisation which showed the length to which the minority was prepared to go in order to vindicate its rights .", "On DATE ORG decided to institute disciplinary proceedings under LAW against CARDINAL minority school teachers , including the applicant , for having failed to attend the educational meeting of DATE .", "On DATE ORG ordered an inquiry and decided provisionally to suspend the applicant from his duties for DATE pending the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings against him .", "On DATE ORG confirmed the decision of ORG regarding the provisional suspension of the applicant from his duties .", "On DATE ORG issued a decision in which it considered the following :", "\u2013 Firstly , the applicant had been asked by his superiors to attend the educational meeting of CARDINAL DATE but had failed to do so , arguing that attending the meeting would have disrupted his relationship with his pupils and their parents and put his personal integrity in danger . However , ORG considered that this excuse was not valid , because the meeting would have taken place in the city of Xanthi far from the applicant \u2019s school area . Moreover , the applicant took part in the strike between CARDINAL and DATE complying with the order and appeal of the irregular Co - ordination ORG of the NORP Minority of Western Thrace and the appeal of the illegally self - proclaimed mufti of Xanthi calling on the NORP teachers who felt they were NORP not to attend the meeting of QUANTITY DATE . He had accused ORG persecuting him . His illegal acts had contributed to creating tension and commotion in the minority community . The applicant had allied himself with certain subversive elements in the minority community who falsely contended that there was no equality before the law in LOC . Thus , he had become an agent of foreign anti - NORP powers . These facts constituted the following disciplinary offences : not having faith in and dedication to his country ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL of ORG ) , refusing to discharge his duties or employing obstructive tactics ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code ) , taking part in a strike in breach of LAW and the relevant legislation ( LAW of the Code ) and intentionally engaging in an act or omission which could damage or endanger the interests of ORG Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL of the Code ) .", "\u2013 Secondly , the applicant had publicly criticised ORG on the ground that the new books were distributed in breach of international agreements concluded by GPE . As a result , he had committed the disciplinary offence of criticising the actions of his superiors in public using phraseology which showed lack of respect or intentionally using unfounded arguments ( LAW of the above - mentioned Code ) .", "\u2013 Thirdly , the applicant had become an organ of irregular committees acting against the interests of the nation . His actions had stirred up trouble in the minority community and had led to the involvement of NORP newspapers , to tension between the CARDINAL countries , and to criminal proceedings being instituted against parents who had disrupted the functioning of the schools . As a result , the applicant had committed the disciplinary offence of failing to respect a duty imposed by criminal law ( LAW ) .", "ORG was fully satisfied that the applicant \u201c acting in full conscience and with intent and malice , behaving in a manner incompatible with [ his ] status as civil servant , acting against the nation and obeying the commands of anti - NORP power structures , aimed at destabilising the region where the situation was until then normal and creating social unrest \u201d . In the light of all the above , the ORG decided to dismiss the applicant .", "On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s dismissal by virtue of LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Under that decree , pertaining to the appointment and career of NORP teachers in the minority schools of NORP , the ORG is the competent authority to pronounce the termination of service of NORP teachers .", "On DATE the applicant challenged the decision of ORG and the ORG \u2019s decision before ORG . He claimed that he did not lack faith in and dedication to his country , that he had not acted against social order , that he had the right to engage in objective and reasonable criticism of the actions of his superiors or the Government , that he had not refused to discharge his duties but had instead participated in a lawful strike , that he had not engaged in any acts which could have caused damage to the ORG or in any criminal offences , that he had been forced not to collect the books in person because his life had been threatened by other NORP , that the ORG had attributed wrong motives to his actions which were not anti - NORP and that his punishment aimed at his destruction . He further submitted that the hearing before ORG had not been preceded by a proper inquiry , that he had been punished for offences which were not mentioned in the decision instituting proceedings against him and that ORG had not heard a number of witnesses he had proposed . Finally , the applicant argued that the decision of ORG was not duly reasoned in that it failed to specify how his actions amounted to the particular disciplinary offences which should be punished with the particular penalty .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of ORG of DATE . The ORG considered that the inquiry ordered on DATE satisfied the requirements of the law and that ORG had not failed to examine any witnesses proposed by the applicant . The ORG also considered that the applicant could not be punished for facts other than those which were mentioned in the decision of CARDINAL DATE by which the disciplinary proceedings had been instituted . The applicant could only be punished for having failed to attend the educational meeting of DATE . However , ORG and ORG remained free to examine these facts under different legal provisions from those mentioned in the decision instituting disciplinary proceedings . The ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s failure to attend the meeting of DATE in order to participate in the strike CARDINAL DATE amounted to the disciplinary offence of serious disobedience under LAW of LAW . The ORG found that the punishment imposed was appropriate given the circumstances in which the offence had taken place . The ORG referred in this connection to the statement of DATE of the Co - ordination ORG of the NORP Minority of Western Thrace , the statement of QUANTITY DATE of ORG and the statement of the mufti of Xanthi which called on all the NORP teachers who considered themselves NORP not to attend the educational meeting of DATE . The ORG considered that the applicant had obviously associated his failure to comply with the order to attend the educational meeting with the above - mentioned statements of organisations which purported to represent the self - proclaimed NORP minority of LOC . Seen in the light of the above , the applicant \u2019s actions had had as a result the disruption of the functioning of the minority schools in LOC in which the ORG was particularly interested . They had also resulted in social unrest among the NORP minority of this sensitive region . This in turn could have resulted in dangerous albeit unwarranted disruption of the friendly relations between GPE and neighbouring countries and in the disruption of the harmonious coexistence between the NORP citizens , NORP and NORP , who lived in LOC .", "Finally , the ORG considered that the decision of the ORG was duly reasoned . All the elements of the disciplinary offence of serious disobedience were set out in the decision which specified that the applicant had not attended the meeting of DATE , although he had been asked to do so by his superiors . The decision also specified that the applicant had complied with the order and appeal of the irregular ORG of ORG of the NORP Minority of Western Thrace and the appeal of the illegally self - proclaimed mufti of Xanthi calling on the NORP teachers who felt they were NORP not to attend the meeting of QUANTITY DATE ( decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE the Prefect of Xanthi revoked his decision of CARDINAL DATE and , in compliance with decision no . CARDINAL of ORG , ordered the applicant \u2019s dismissal as from the same date .", "On DATE ORG struck out the proceedings instituted against the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE , on the ground that the decision complained of had already been revoked by the ORG ( decision no . ORG ) .", "On DATE the ORG ordered for the third time the applicant \u2019s dismissal .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE to ORG of PERSON . He claimed that all other civil servants were dismissed by ministerial decision and complained that his dismissal by prefectural decision was contrary to religious freedom . He further complained that he was not previously heard by the Prefect . The applicant further invoked Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal ( decision no . CARDINAL ) . The court held that , by definition , the ORG had a better knowledge of the local situation than the Minister ; therefore , it could not be sustained that the delegation to the ORG to pronounce the termination of service of NORP teachers violated the religious freedom . Moreover , the court held that the ORG \u2019s decision aimed at complying with the relevant decisions of ORG ; therefore , the previous hearing of the applicant was not required . The applicant did not appeal against this decision to ORG .", "The applicant claims that he has instituted civil and administrative proceedings in order to recover several sums ( arrears of salaries , compensation for his dismissal , etc . ) . The applicant alleges that a set of proceedings instituted on DATE before ORG of Rodopi is still pending . He further alleges that on DATE ORG notified to him a decision of ORG that his pecuniary claims had been statute - barred .", "On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings also before ORG of PERSON . On DATE the court noted that the applicant had perceived his salaries for a certain period after his dismissal . It declared his recourse inadmissible on the ground that the applicant was not duly represented by a lawyer ( decision no . CARDINAL ) . The applicant did not appeal against this decision within DATE time - limit provided for by LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
