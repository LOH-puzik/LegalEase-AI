AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1 + 6-3-d;Just satisfaction partially reserved;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , a pensioner of NORP nationality , is at present residing in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On TIME DATE a burglary was committed in a caf\u00e9 at PERSON , in the GPE . From footprints found at the scene of the crime , the police inferred that CARDINAL persons had taken part in the burglary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE QUANTITY women , a mother and a daughter , came to the police station . After having received the assurance that their anonymity would be respected , they reported to the officers in charge that , on TIME , they had seen CARDINAL men in a minibus in the vicinity of the place where the crime had been committed . CARDINAL of the men had passed them in the street , under a street lamp , at TIME , his face partly covered by a handkerchief . The suspicious appearance of the men led the CARDINAL witnesses to take down the licence number of the minibus .", "The police arrested the owner of the minibus , who denied having had anything whatsoever to do with the burglary . As to the second man referred to by the anonymous witnesses , suspicion first fell on a former waiter at the caf\u00e9 , but he had an alibi for TIME in question . The investigations then concentrated on his acquaintances , including the applicant .", "Subsequently , the police informants were shown various photographs of the applicant and they recognised him as being the man who had passed them in the street .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was arrested on DATE . On DATE the police arranged for a \" covert confrontation \" of the applicant with the CARDINAL witnesses . It took place in PERSON at TIME : they were sitting in a car QUANTITY from the suspect and could not be seen by him ; he was holding a handkerchief in front of his face . They had no hesitation in identifying him as CARDINAL of the men they had seen . The applicant denied having been at PERSON , claiming that he had been in GPE throughout TIME in question .", "On DATE he and the owner of the minibus were charged with burglary ( schwerer PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( PERSON ) held a hearing on DATE during which CARDINAL police officers gave evidence concerning the statements made by the QUANTITY witnesses mentioned above . Their identity was not , however , disclosed in the court proceedings .", "The applicant \u2019s requests to have those witnesses summoned to appear and to be confronted with them were rejected by ORG . It noted that the police officers concerned had promised not to reveal the names of the witnesses , who feared retaliation , and that ORG ( Landesgendarmeriekommando ) had not released the officers from their duty of secrecy in this respect . The court also considered that the police ORG testimony established sufficiently what the QUANTITY women had seen and that they were reliable . The decision not to disclose their identity was therefore justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after hearing evidence from several witnesses , including another police officer , convicted the applicant and his co - accused of burglary and indicated orally the principal grounds for its decision . PERSON was sentenced to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , from which the periods of detention on remand were to be deducted . He stated immediately that he intended to lodge an application for a declaration of nullity ( PERSON ) and an appeal against sentence ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The written judgment of ORG was served on the applicant on DATE . Extensive reference was made therein to the statements of the CARDINAL unidentified witnesses to the police . In relation to the question of their anonymity , the court stated :", "\" The names of these QUANTITY women are not known to the court . ORG had not released the investigating officers from their duty of secrecy , and they could not therefore disclose the identity of the CARDINAL women . The court is bound by this decision ... . In this connection it should be stated that the police are under instructions to co - operate with the public in investigating crime . The QUANTITY women asked the investigating officers not to disclose their names , because they are afraid of reprisals . The QUANTITY women are simple but trustworthy persons . The investigating officers of the criminal investigation department can be relied upon for this kind of assessment . It is therefore entirely acceptable that the QUANTITY persons should remain anonymous . \"", "ORG also took into consideration that another witness had provided the applicant , at his request , with certain details concerning the victim and his financial situation , and that the CARDINAL defendants had been seen in GPE , leaving a bar together , shortly before the events in question . Furthermore , the court found that the evidence given by the QUANTITY witnesses called on PERSON behalf had failed to establish an alibi . It concluded that PERSON , together with his co - accused , had committed the crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) rejected PERSON application for a declaration of nullity . In its view , his request to have the anonymous witnesses summoned and examined could serve no purpose since it had not been specified how their identity would be established and because the police had refused to answer enquiries in this respect . It would have been possible to identify the CARDINAL witnesses by taking evidence from X , whom , according to their statement , they had met on the TIME in question . However , the applicant had not submitted any request to this effect .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal against sentence was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the Government informed the Registrar that the Attorney - General had recently brought before ORG a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes - Article CARDINAL of LAW ) against the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The taking of evidence at a trial is governed by ORG to CARDINAL of LAW Strafprozessordnung ) .", "Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL provides that \" witnesses and experts shall be called separately and heard in the presence of the accused \" . The presiding judge and the other members of the court , the public prosecutor , the accused , the party seeking damages and their representatives may question them ( Article CARDINAL ) . However , in certain exceptional circumstances , their previous statements may be read out at the hearing ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "No provision deals expressly with statements made by anonymous witnesses and hearsay evidence .", "CARDINAL . The assessment of evidence by the trial court is provided for in LAW , which reads as follows :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) In passing judgment the court shall only have regard to what has occurred at the trial", "( CARDINAL ) The court has to examine the evidence carefully and conscientiously with regard to its trustworthiness and conclusiveness separately and in its entirety . The judges do not decide upon the question whether or not a particular fact has been proven according to formal rules of evidence , but only according to their own conclusions drawn on the basis of their careful examination of all evidence before them . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
