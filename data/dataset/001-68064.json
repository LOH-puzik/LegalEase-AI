The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( PERSON ) , arguing that , in addition to knee problems , her incapacity was also due to psychiatric problems , for which she had begun treatment in DATE .", "Pending those appeal proceedings , the occupational association reconsidered its decision on the basis of the conclusions of psychiatric and orthopaedic examinations of the applicant . These examinations had been requested by ORG and the results were submitted to the social security medical experts . According to the latter , the applicant was suffering from more severe psychiatric / social problems than had initially been assumed . On DATE the occupational association informed the applicant that it had withdrawn its decision of CARDINAL DATE . Finding that the applicant was PERCENT incapacitated for work on DATE , i.e. the date on which the ORG entered into force , she was granted AAW benefits corresponding to that level .", "On DATE the social security authorities informed the applicant that , pursuant to the Act of CARDINAL DATE ( see below under \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d ) , AAW benefits would be withdrawn if a beneficiary had become incapacitated for work before DATE without having earned any income from work in DATE the occurrence of the incapacity .

On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) .", "On DATE the Acting President of ORG informed the applicant that the examination of her appeal would be adjourned pending the outcome of proceedings before ORG ( ORG ) in a similar case . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that , in similar cases pending before ORG , the tribunal intended to put preliminary questions to ORG of ORG ( ECJ ) . As the answer to those questions could be of importance for the applicant 's case , her appeal would be adjourned pending the determination by ORG of those similar cases , and this could take some time .", "On DATE , the ECJ gave its ruling on the preliminary questions put by ORG ( see below under \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d ) . This ruling was published in the Social Security Law Reports ( PERSON \u2013 \u201c RSV \u201d ) PERSON .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It rejected the applicant 's argument that she should be considered as having become incapacitated for work in DATE and that , having been gainfully employed in DATE , she was thus eligible to retain her AAW benefits . On this point ORG held :", "\u201c It appears from [ the case file ] that until DATE the [ applicant ] worked as an interior designer ... and subsequently , until DATE , worked occasionally as a freelance interior designer . The [ applicant ] married in DATE , her daughter was born in DATE and she divorced in DATE .", "On DATE the [ applicant ] applied [ for AAW benefits ] indicating that she had been incapacitated for work since DATE .

In the course of the investigation [ for AAW purposes ] by ORG Gemeenschappelijke Medische Dienst ) in DATE , the applicant told the social security medical officer that she had stopped working ... because her husband was providing the family income .", "... Initially ... [ the applicant 's request for ] benefits for incapacity for work was rejected because [ the applicant ] was considered fit to do work which spared her knees , but after a letter from [ her ] neurologist she was granted AAW benefits from DATE ( entry into force of AAW ) on medical - psychological grounds . ...", "ORG does not find it established ... that the [ applicant ] has been uninterruptedly incapacitated for work to a relevant degree since DATE . It considers that , from DATE onwards , work which would spare her knees was indicated to [ the applicant ] but , apart from the period in DATE during which she underwent a knee operation , [ the applicant ] has not been incapable of undertaking gainful employment . In this connection ORG points out that the [ applicant ] worked until DATE , albeit irregularly , and ceased to work on grounds which were not medical .", "This leads ORG to conclude that the defendant has correctly considered DATE as DATE of [ the applicant 's ] incapacity for work .", "ORG further finds it established that the [ applicant ] has not had any income from employment or in connection therewith in DATE . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal with ORG against the decision of DATE . She argued , inter alia , that ORG had unjustly found that she had not been incapacitated for work since DATE . She further argued that the decision violated her rights under LAW No . CARDINAL and LAW in conjunction with LAW No . CARDINAL .", "In its decision of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . It noted that the applicant 's AAW benefits had been withdrawn from DATE because the applicant had not had any income from work in DATE the occurrence of her incapacity for work . It further noted that this decision was based on LAW DATE as amended by LAW ( Reparatiewet AAW ) of DATE . Under those provisions , eligibility for continued receipt of ORG benefits after DATE by persons whose incapacity for work had occurred before DATE was subject to the conditions set out in LAW as worded following the entry into force of LAW DATE . As regards the determination of the date on which the applicant 's incapacity for work had occurred , ORG accepted ORG ruling as correct and upheld its findings .", "Relying , inter alia , on its findings in a decision of DATE published in GPE CARDINAL ( Administratiefrechtelijke Beslissingen \u2013 \u201c GPE \u201d ) , in which it had examined the compatibility of LAW ( see below under \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d ) with LAW , ORG rejected the applicant 's complaint that the withdrawal of her AAW benefits was contrary to her rights under LAW , without giving any additional reasons . Insofar as the applicant complained that the withdrawal of her benefits also violated her rights under LAW No . CARDINAL , ORG accepted that this withdrawal constituted a deprivation of property within the meaning of the second sentence of this provision . It noted that , according to the criteria established in the ORG 's case - law , a deprivation of property must strike a fair balance between the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual 's fundamental rights , and that there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued . Moreover , a ORG enjoys a wide margin of appreciation in applying these criteria . On this point ORG considered :", "\u201c In answering the question whether those criteria have been met in the present decision , taken pursuant to LAW , ORG recalls the history of that LAW as set out in the preliminary questions to the ECJ which resulted in the Posthuma - PERSON judgment [ of DATE ] ( RSV CARDINAL ; the preliminary questions in RSV CARDINAL ) :", "' The ORG , in force since DATE , originally conferred on men and unmarried women , after DATE of incapacity for work , entitlement to labour disability benefits , the amount of which did not depend either on any other income or on any loss of income by the beneficiary .", "Entitlement to benefits under the ORG was extended to married women by LAW on LAW ( PERSON Uitkeringsrechten voor ORG ) of DATE . At the same time this LAW made entitlement to benefits for all those insured , save for certain categories , subject to the condition that during DATE the occurrence of the labour incapacity the beneficiary had received from employment or in connection therewith a certain income which was initially set at no less than MONEY ( NLG ) ( hereinafter \u201c the income requirement \u201d ) . The income requirement applied to all persons whose incapacity for work had occurred after DATE .", "By virtue of the transitional provisions contained in the above - cited LAW DATE , men and unmarried women whose incapacity for work had occurred before DATE continued to be entitled to benefits without having to satisfy the income requirement . Married women whose incapacity had occurred before DATE were not entitled to benefits even if they satisfied the income requirement . Married women whose incapacity had occurred DATE and DATE were entitled to benefits only if they satisfied the income requirement .", "By several judgments of CARDINAL DATE ORG held that those transitional provisions constituted discrimination on the ground of sex , contrary to LAW ORG ) ... and that married women whose incapacity for work arose before DATE were entitled , with effect from DATE , the date on which LAW DATE entered into force , to AAW benefits on the same conditions as men , that is to say without having to satisfy the income requirement , even if their incapacity had occurred before DATE . '", "The legislature 's choice in LAW to make an income requirement apply to all persons claiming entitlement to AAW benefits from DATE , subsequent to the development outlined above , was mainly inspired by CARDINAL considerations :", "\u2013 under the regime of a long - term benefits arrangement , namely until DATE in the case of continuous labour disability , there was a significant difference in the conditions for benefits ( the income requirement ) that was solely determined by the date of occurrence of the labour disability ( prior to , on or after DATE ) and which as such raised serious concerns regarding the principle of equal treatment of similar cases ;", "\u2013 the case - law had considerably enlarged the group of persons incapacitated for work who , without having to comply with the income requirement , had a continued entitlement to benefits after DATE , which could result in unacceptable budgetary consequences .", "In reconstructing the ORG to take account of these considerations , the legal norms on equal treatment also had to be respected for other reasons , in which connection a major role was played by ORG legislation concerning equal treatment of men and women and the prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination of men and women in the field of social security as further elaborated in the ECJ case - law .", "The balance struck by the legislature has led to full equality in the conditions for benefits as regards previous income from work for the entire group of persons entitled to AAW benefits . Although , for part of that group , as in [ the applicant 's ] case , this means that , after receiving AAW benefits for a period of up to a ( maximum ) of DATE , their benefits are withdrawn , a situation which must undoubtedly be considered as a serious interference with the right protected by LAW , and although the construction opted for , through the retroactive introduction of an eligibility condition , meets with objections as formulated in ORG decision ORG , ORG is of the opinion that , given the [ above ] development and the limited options subsequently available to the legislature , the chosen measure must also be upheld when examined in the light of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "In reaching this finding , ORG further notes that , for the group concerned , a statutory transitional period of , ultimately , DATE has been created , within which the entitlement to benefits continues in full . In this limited compensation it deserves to be mentioned that , as regards measures that are ( also ) inspired by compelling considerations of a financial nature , full or even considerable compensation can not come into play without ( to a large extent ) annihilating the aim of those measures .", "ORG further takes into consideration that the additional condition was intended to affect only that group which , prior to the occurrence of the incapacity for work , did not depend for subsistence on AAW benefits .", "ORG finally considers it relevant that in the GPE system LAW ( PERSON ) functions as a social \u201c safety net \u201d which therefore is also applicable to those who were dependent for their subsistence on AAW benefits .", "ORG concludes that on this point also the appeal can not succeed and that the impugned decision must be upheld . ... \u201d", "As the applicant 's assets , i.e. her personal savings and the value of the mortgage - free home that she owned , exceeded the exemption limit under LAW ( PERSON ) , she was not entitled to general welfare benefits during the period DATE , when her AAW benefits were withdrawn , and DATE , when \u2013 having turned DATE she became entitled to benefits under LAW ( PERSON ) .", "The ORG , as in force between CARDINAL DATE and DATE , provided for a general labour disability insurance scheme under which all persons residing in the GPE DATE were guaranteed index - based benefits if , owing to labour incapacity having lasted for DATE , they were unable to generate income from work .", "Given that , since DATE , employees were already insured against labour incapacity under ORG ( Wet op de Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering \u2013 \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , the ORG was primarily of importance for those groups who , until then , had been ineligible for ORG benefits , namely the self - employed and those who were disabled from birth or who had become disabled before completing their education .", "Entitlement to AAW benefits was not linked to payment of contributions : contrary to social security schemes based on employment ( werknemersverzekering ) such as , for instance , the ORG , the ORG was a general social security scheme ( volksverzekering ) . Until DATE the ORG scheme was funded by employers on the basis of a percentage of paid wages . From DATE AAW contributions were collected through income tax .", "The level of AAW benefits was linked to the level of incapacity and did not depend on a person 's personal savings or other property . Entitlement to benefits started when the level of incapacity exceeded PERCENT . Full incapacity for work entailed entitlement to AAW benefits equal to PERCENT of a base figure ( grondslag ) related to the statutory minimum wage in force in the GPE . The base figure applicable to married men and single persons caring for a child DATE was higher than the base figure applicable to single men and women .", "Beneficiaries remained entitled to AAW benefits for as long as they were incapacitated for work , but not beyond DATE . Initially , married women were not eligible for AAW benefits on the basis of the then prevailing view that men were the breadwinners in the family .", "On DATE ORG issued Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC on the progressive implementation of equal treatment between men and women in the field of social security , granting member states a period of DATE until DATE within which to make any amendments to their legislation which might be necessary in order to bring it into conformity with the Directive .", "This Directive led to the LAW on LAW DATE , which entered into force on DATE and as a result of which married women also became entitled to AAW benefits in their own right . However , given the slowdown in economic growth in the GPE in DATE , and in order to avert major financial repercussions from granting an additional category of persons an entitlement to AAW benefits , an additional requirement for entitlement to benefits was simultaneously introduced . From DATE , anyone who had become incapacitated for work on or after DATE ( thereby taking into account DATE waiting period ) was required to have earned a fixed minimum amount of income from work in DATE the occurrence of the labour incapacity ( \u201c the income requirement \u201d ) , thus rendering entitlement to AAW benefits dependent on the existence of a demonstrable link with actual income from work .", "In accordance with the transitional provisions of LAW December CARDINAL , married men and single persons who had become incapacitated before DATE retained their entitlement to AAW benefits without having to comply with the newly introduced income requirement .", "As regards married women a difference in treatment was made between those who had become incapacitated before DATE ( DATE before the entry into force of the AAW ) and those who had become incapacitated DATE and DATE . The first group was not entitled to AAW benefits even if the persons concerned complied with the income requirement , whereas members of the second group were entitled to AAW benefits only if they complied with the income requirement .", "In CARDINAL decisions given on DATE , ORG held that these ORG rules in respect of married women constituted discriminatory treatment on the basis of sex , contrary to LAW ORG , as the requirement that a person 's incapacity had to have occurred on or after DATE in order to be entitled to AAW benefits applied to married women but not to married men . According to those decisions , married women whose incapacity for work had arisen before DATE were entitled , from DATE , to AAW benefits under the same conditions as married men , i.e. without having to comply with the income requirement and on the basis of the same base figure as that applicable to married men . It was further held in those decisions that married women who had become incapacitated for work before DATE and who were not entitled to AAW benefits , even if they did comply with the income requirement , were entitled , from DATE , to AAW benefits .", "This finding led to LAW of DATE , which entered into force on CARDINAL DATE and which created the following situation :", "married women who had become incapacitated for work before DATE were entitled to AAW benefits . Married women who had applied for AAW benefits before CARDINAL DATE did not have to comply with the income requirement in order to be entitled DATE with retroactive effect DATE to AAW benefits . Married women who had applied for AAW benefits on or after CARDINAL DATE had to comply with the income requirement in order to be entitled to AAW benefits ;", "married women who had become incapacitated for work before DATE and who had already been granted AAW benefits obtained , from CARDINAL DATE , AAW benefits on the basis of the same base figure applied to married men ; and", "all persons DATE men and women alike \u2013 who had become incapacitated for work before DATE were to lose their entitlement to AAW benefits on DATE if they did not comply with the income requirement .", "By the LAW of DATE the date of withdrawal of AAW benefits , originally fixed at CARDINAL DATE for those concerned , was postponed to DATE .", "This resulted in numerous proceedings brought by persons whose AAW benefits had been withdrawn on the ground of non - compliance with the income requirement . In a judgment of DATE , ORG held that , with regard to the income requirement , the fixed minimum income constituted indirect discrimination against women , in violation of LAW ORG and LAW MONEY , and that the income requirement was to be regarded as being satisfied if , during DATE prior to the occurrence of the incapacity for work , the beneficiary had earned \u201c some income \u201d .", "In other sets of appeal proceedings concerning the withdrawal of AAW benefits for failure to comply with the income requirement , in which it was argued that the income requirement under the ORG was contrary to Directive FAC and was discriminatory , ORG decided on DATE to seek a preliminary ruling from the ECJ on this point .", "On DATE the ECJ handed down the requested preliminary ruling . This ruling , insofar as relevant , states :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... it should be recalled in the first place that the ORG [ has previously ] ruled ... that ORG law does not preclude the introduction of national legislation which , by making continuance of entitlement to benefits for incapacity for work subject to a condition applicable henceforth to men and women alike , has the effect of withdrawing from women in future rights which they derive from the direct effect of LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also ruled that LAW QUANTITY precludes the application of national legislation which makes the grant of benefits for incapacity for work subject to the condition of having received some income during DATE the commencement of the incapacity , a condition which , although it does not distinguish on grounds of sex , affects far more women than men , even if the adoption of that national legislation is justified on budgetary grounds .", "CARDINAL . Next it should be observed that , when the ORG examined whether Community law precluded the introduction of national legislation which , by making continuance of entitlement to benefits for incapacity for work subject to a condition applicable henceforth to men and women alike , has the effect of withdrawing from women in future rights which they derive from the direct effect of LAW , it expressly reserved consideration of the question whether , as such , an income requirement of the kind at issue in the main proceedings complied with the principle of equal treatment between men and women . ...", "CARDINAL . In view of the foregoing , the questions referred for a preliminary ruling by ORG should be construed as seeking to establish whether LAW QUANTITY precludes the application of national legislation which makes receipt of a benefit for incapacity for work subject to the requirement of having received a certain income from or in connection with work in DATE the commencement of incapacity where it is established that that requirement affects more women than men . ...", "CARDINAL . [ As to the question whether persons who did not receive a certain income from or in connection with work in DATE the commencement of incapacity fall within the scope ratione personae of Directive CARDINAL , the ECJ concludes ] that such persons do not necessarily fall outside the scope ratione personae of Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL . ...", "CARDINAL . In order to reply to the national court 's question , as reformulated in paragraph CARDINAL , it should be recalled that LAW prohibits in social security matters all discrimination whatsoever on grounds of sex either directly , or indirectly by reference in particular to marital or family status , in particular as concerns the scope of the social security schemes and the conditions of access thereto .", "CARDINAL . As the ORG has consistently held , LAW precludes the application of a national measure which , although formulated in neutral terms , works to the disadvantage of far more women than men , unless that measure is based on objective factors unrelated to any discrimination on grounds of sex . That is the case where the measures chosen reflect a legitimate social policy aim of the Member ORG whose legislation is at issue , are appropriate to achieve that aim and are necessary in order to do so ....", "CARDINAL . NORP ... ORG essentially argue that , by introducing the income requirement in the ORG , the PERSON of DATE caused the GPE scheme relating to incapacity for work to shift from being pure national insurance to insurance against loss of income guaranteeing a minimum income to insured persons and that , by providing that the income requirement was henceforward to apply to all insured persons , whether male or female , married or unmarried , who became unfit for work before or after DATE , the LAW DATE accentuated the nature of that scheme as CARDINAL providing insurance against loss of income . They consider that , in so doing , the GPE legislature pursued a legitimate social policy aim , inherent in numerous social security schemes , of restricting eligibility for a given benefit to persons who have lost income following the materialisation of the risk which the benefit is intended to cover .", "CARDINAL . As the ORG has held [ in its judgment of DATE ] in PERSON , n\u00e9e PERSON , and Others [ Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] at CARDINAL , Directive FAC leaves intact the powers reserved by ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW to LAW to define their social policy within the framework of close co - operation organised by ORG , and consequently the nature and extent of measures of social protection , including those relating to social security , and the way in which they are implemented . In exercising that competence , the Member States have a broad margin of discretion ....", "CARDINAL . It must be held that guaranteeing the benefit of a minimum income to persons who were in receipt of income from or in connection with work which they had to abandon owing to incapacity for work satisfies a legitimate aim of social policy and that to make the benefit of that minimum income subject to the requirement that the person concerned must have been in receipt of such an income in DATE to the commencement of incapacity for work constitutes a measure appropriate to achieve that aim which the national legislature , in the exercise of its competence , was reasonably entitled to consider necessary in order to do so .", "CARDINAL . The fact that that scheme replaced a scheme of pure national insurance and that the number of persons eligible to benefit from it was further reduced to those who had actually lost income from or in connection with work at the time when the risk materialised can not affect that finding .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the case - law of the ORG ( PERSON , n\u00e9e PERSON , and Others , at paragraph CARDINAL , confirmed in Case PERSON [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) that Community law does not prevent Member GPE from taking measures which have the effect of withdrawing social security benefits from certain categories of persons , provided that those measures are compatible with the principle of equal treatment between men and women as defined in LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Subject to that proviso , Member GPE are also free to lay down , as part of their social policy , new rules which have the effect of reducing the number of persons eligible for a social security benefit .", "CARDINAL . The reply to the national court 's questions must therefore be that LAW does not preclude the application of national legislation which makes receipt of a benefit for incapacity for work subject to the requirement of having received a certain income from or in connection with work in DATE the commencement of incapacity , even if it is established that that requirement affects more women than men . \u201d", "In other domestic proceedings the income requirement was challenged on grounds , inter alia , of its incompatibility with the prohibition of discrimination set out in , for instance , LAW .", "In a judgment given on DATE , ORG rejected this argument . This judgment , insofar as relevant , reads :", "\u201c It has been argued that the withdrawal of the AAW benefits on grounds of [ non - compliance with the income requirement ] is in violation of LAW in conjunction with LAW No . CARDINAL . On the assumption that AAW benefits , such as in issue in the present case , can be regarded as a \u201c possession \u201d within the meaning of the latter provision , which assumption finds support in the [ PERSON v. GPE ] judgment of ORG DATE , it must be examined whether LAW of CARDINAL DATE entails a violation of LAW ...", "ORG is of the opinion that , insofar as Article PERSON links the ( continuation of ) entitlement to [ AAW benefits ] to the condition that prior to the occurrence of labour incapacity ( some ) income from or in connection with work must have been obtained , this is without any doubt an \u201c objective and reasonable justification \u201d in the sense of the ORG 's case - law which , in accordance with that same case - law , entails that a \u201c legitimate aim \u201d must be pursued and that there must be a \u201c reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON judgment ) .", "In this connection ORG points out that LAW DATE has already passed a similar test on the basis of certainly no less strict criteria , as apparent from the above - cited ECJ judgment of DATE ( RSV CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "The ORG was repealed on DATE and replaced , as regards persons not employed by others , by the ORG - employed Persons Disablement Benefits Act ( PERSON ) and LAW ( PERSON jonggehandicapten ) .
