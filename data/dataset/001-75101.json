The applicants , CARDINAL in all , are NORP nationals of NORP origin , born in DATE respectively , and are living in GPE ( GPE ) . The second applicant is the first applicant \u2019s father , the third applicant his mother and the fourth applicant his uncle . On DATE ORG filed a bill of indictment against the applicants charging them with rape under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , coercion and deprivation of liberty . The public prosecutor stated that since DATE the first applicant had been the fianc\u00e9 of PERSON Their future marriage had been arranged by their respective fathers . After the death of PERSON \u2019s father in DATE , ORG considered herself no longer bound by the promise of betrothal given by her father . She told this to the first applicant and his parents who , however , refused to accept her change of mind .", "CARDINAL . NORP Ever since the death of PERSON \u2019s father the second applicant regularly brought ORG by car to her place of work and drove her home again after work . On DATE , around TIME , the second applicant , accompanied by the first and third applicant , picked up PERSON and brought her to the home of the fourth applicant . The second applicant told her that she was going to have sexual intercourse with the first applicant . He also told her that if she resisted she would be held by the second and fourth applicants and that the third applicant would force her legs apart . She was accompanied to the bedroom . The first applicant attempted to have sexual intercourse with her , but this attempt failed because of ORG \u2019s resistance . Thereupon , the first applicant requested the third applicant to help him . The third applicant tied PERSON \u2019s hands with adhesive tape and stuck a strip of adhesive tape over her mouth . She then held F.D.s arms while the first applicant had intercourse with PERSON Thereafter , PERSON was constrained to spend the rest of DATE with the first applicant in the house .", "CARDINAL . The second and third applicants phoned her mother and told her that ORG had been kidnapped by them and that she should not contact the police , otherwise PERSON would be killed . Nevertheless , PERSON \u2019s mother informed the police about the incident . Around TIME was allowed to phone her mother . Soon afterwards police officers arrived at the house and arrested CARDINAL applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 trial was held before ORG . The applicants , assisted by counsel , Mr. PERSON , maintained their innocence and claimed that PERSON had accompanied them voluntarily in order to become closer acquainted with the first applicant \u2019s uncle and that , on this occasion , she had had sexual intercourse with the first applicant of her own free will . No violence whatsoever had been used against her . The court heard the applicants and several witnesses , including the victim , her mother and a doctor who had examined the victim at the hospital . PERSON repeated to the court the statements she made to the police and the investigating judge , but added that her family and the applicants\u2019 family had meanwhile settled the matter and that she had received a payment of CARDINAL ORG from the applicants\u2019 family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicants of rape under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW and of deprivation of liberty . The first and second applicants were also convicted of aggravated coercion . The first applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , the second applicant to DATE , the third applicant to DATE and the fourth applicant to DATE of imprisonment . In its judgment , the court described the course of the events in the same terms as in the bill of indictment .", "CARDINAL . As regards the classification of the offence in law , the court found that from the facts established it was apparent that ORG had been exposed to and had been threatened with acts of serious violence . It therefore had to convict the applicants of rape under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed pleas of nullity ( PERSON - beschwerde ) and appeals against sentence ( PERSON ) . The applicants complained , inter alia , that their conviction for rape had gone beyond the terms of the indictment ( PERSON ) as they were convicted of rape under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW while the bill of indictment had charged them with rape under LAW of LAW . In the applicants\u2019 submission , if ORG had been of the opinion that the public prosecutor \u2019s indictment had not corresponded to all the elements of the case it should have given the public prosecutor the opportunity to amend the indictment . This would at the same time have given the applicants the opportunity to react to the amendment and to dispute the existence of any aggravating circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG appeal under section CARDINALd \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure without holding a hearing . As regards the complaint that the judgment had exceeded the terms of the indictment with respect to the charge of rape , ORG found that a ground of nullity could only be made out if the applicants had been found guilty of an offence which had not been the subject matter of the indictment . The subject matter of an indictment was a specific act or event which , in the eyes of the public prosecutor , had brought about a punishable result . If , on the basis of the evidence taken , the event which formed the basis of the indictment had , in certain details , occurred in a manner different from that assumed by the prosecution , the court had to apply the correct law to the established facts even if the result was that the legal qualification then applied differed from the one made by the public prosecutor .", "It was only where the taking of evidence showed a course of events which was entirely different from the events described in the indictment such that it could no longer be considered covered by the terms of the indictment , that a conviction would pre - suppose the prior amendment of the indictment . In the present case , the act with which the applicants were charged was identical to the established facts as set out in the judgment . The trial court had merely come to a different legal qualification on the facts . However , this did not exceed the terms of the indictment ( PERSON ) . Moreover , the different legal qualification given to the offence was not in breach of the LAW . It was the main purpose of LAW ( d ) of the LAW to achieve equality of arms between the prosecution and the defence . However , it could not be considered that a legal qualification in the judgment which differed from the one in the indictment infringed this or any other provision of the LAW . ORG remitted the ORG appeal against sentence to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal and confirmed the sentences fixed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ) reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Anyone who compels another person , by use of serious violence or threats of immediate serious danger to life or limb , to have sexual intercourse or to perform a sexual act which amounts to sexual intercourse shall be punished by imprisonment of DATE . Rendering unconscious also qualifies as use of serious violence .", "CARDINAL . Anyone who , except for the case under paragraph CARDINAL , compels another person , by use of violence , deprivation of liberty or threats of danger to life or limb , to have sexual intercourse or to perform a sexual act which amounts to sexual intercourse shall be punished by imprisonment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . If the violence resulted in serious bodily harm to the victim , or if the victim has endured great pain for a prolonged period or has been particularly humiliated , the perpetrator of the offence shall be punished by imprisonment of DATE in the case of paragraph CARDINAL and by imprisonment of DATE in the case of paragraph CARDINAL . If the violence resulted in the death of the victim the perpetrator of the offence shall be punished by imprisonment of DATE in the case of paragraph CARDINAL and by imprisonment of DATE in the case of paragraph CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW the remedies against a judgment by a chamber of ORG are , on the one hand , a plea of nullity ( PERSON ) and , on the other , an appeal against sentence ( GPE ) . A plea of nullity has to be addressed to ORG while an appeal against sentence has to be addressed to ORG . Section CARDINAL enumerates exhaustively the various grounds for nullity which can be invoked in a plea of nullity . They comprise such elements as participation of an excluded judge ( S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) , lack of proper assistance by a defence counsel ( S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) or breach of a provision of LAW for which the sanction of nullity is expressly provided for ( S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) . Moreover , it is a ground for nullity if , due to incorrect interpretation , an inapplicable legal provision has been applied to the act underlying a judgment ( s. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . In a plea of nullity the assessment of evidence by ORG can not be challenged unless in the judgment the assessment of evidence is not set out , or if it is unclear , illogic , or in contradiction to the case file ( S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
