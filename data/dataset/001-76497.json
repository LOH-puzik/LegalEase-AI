On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s complaint and rejected the second applicant \u2019s complaint . It noted that only the applicant company as the proposed employer , not the second applicant , had the right to lodge a request for the grant of an employment permit . According to s. CARDINAL of ORG an alien only became a party to proceedings concerning the issue of a work permit if his personal circumstances were relevant to the decision or if there was no employer . In the present case , however , neither of these conditions applied . In particular , ORG had based its decision exclusively on the situation of the labour market , and in particular the fact that the maximum quota for the employment of foreign workers had been exceeded . For that reason , the second applicant was not a party to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

As regards the applicant company \u2019s complaint , ORG noted that the official statistics showing that the maximum quota had been exceeded constituted documentary evidence which it had been open to the company to contest by adducing proof to the contrary . The company had , however , failed to make any valid objection to ORG to the statistical evidence that the maximum quota had been exceeded . The complaint now made before ORG that ORG had failed to establish objectively in adversarial proceedings that the maximum quota for PERSON had been exceeded was unsubstantiated and , in any event , inadmissible , as it had not previously been raised before ORG .", "CARDINAL .
