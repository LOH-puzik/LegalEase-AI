{"ITEMID": "001-5227", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "BIJLEVELD v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE , and living in GPE . She is represented before ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The applicant and her husband have CARDINAL sons , born in DATE and DATE respectively , and CARDINAL daughters , born in DATE and DATE respectively .", "Pursuant to the relevant rules of NORP law , these children bear the surname of the applicant \u2019s husband . As the applicant and her husband wished their sons to bear the surname of their father and their daughter to bear the surname of the applicant , the applicant filed a request on DATE to change the surname of her , at that time still unborn , daughter .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal to ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE was rejected on DATE . The applicant filed a further appeal with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) .", "It recalled that the ORG Secretary had based the refusal of the applicant \u2019s request on a finding that the relevant rules on the chance of surnames did not foresee in a request like the applicant \u2019s one and that it had not been established that there were such special circumstances on the basis of which a strict application of the relevant rules would not be acceptable ex aequo et bono . It further noted that ORG had also not found such circumstances .", "Insofar as the applicant argued that the NORP rules on surnames are contrary to LAW in that they amount to a discriminatory treatment between men and women , ORG held that the request at issue only concerned one of the applicant \u2019s children whereas no such request had been made for her other CARDINAL children . The refusal at issue was not found to be discriminatory as it achieved that all children having the same parents bear the same surname and that therefore no difference between boys and girls was made . Moreover , in GPE DATE amending Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Book I of the Civil Code ( Burgerlijk Wetboek ) , the legislator had , in the meantime , created the possibility for parents to choose themselves which of their respective surnames their children will bear , albeit with the restriction that all of their children must bear the same surname . It held that this restriction was in conformity with its consideration as to the alleged discriminatory character of the refusal of the applicant \u2019s request .", "As to the applicant \u2019s argument that the refusal of her request was in violation of LAW , the Administrative Law Division held that there was no interference , as such , with the applicant \u2019s rights under this provision in that the refusal did not alter the applicant \u2019s personal situation or her family life with her daughter . As to the question whether the GPE were under a positive obligation under LAW to grant the applicant \u2019s request , it was held that the applicant \u2019s personal interest , i.e. the continuation of her family name by her daughter \u2019s surname , was outweighed by the general interest in preserving the stability required in the legal rules governing names ( \u201c de handhaving van de nodige stabiliteit in het namenrecht \u201d ) and that , therefore , the GPE authorities were not under a positive obligation to grant the applicant \u2019s request .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Until DATE , a child born in wedlock or a child whose father had recognised his paternity automatically obtained the father \u2019s surname . Only limited possibilities existed to obtain change of one \u2019s surname .", "On DATE , as a result of the entry into force of the Act of DATE amending Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Book I of the Civil Code , the rules governing surnames were changed .", "Under the new situation , married parents may make a joint formal declaration , either before or when formally registering the birth of their first child , stating whether the child will bear the surname of the father or the mother . This declaration will continue to apply to any children born subsequently to the couple . In the absence of any declaration , a child will automatically obtain the father \u2019s surname .", "If the parents are not married , the child will obtain the mother \u2019s surname ; also where the father has recognised his paternity . If unmarried parents wish their child to bear the father \u2019s surname , a joint formal declaration to this effect must be made at the time of the father \u2019s recognition of his paternity .", "The change in the law also included transitory rules in respect of children born before DATE , provided that the oldest child , at the time the parents make their formal declaration , has not yet attained DATE . These transitory rules remained in force until DATE . Under these transitory rules , parents may make a joint formal declaration to the effect that their child or children bear the mother \u2019s surname . Any children born subsequently to the couple will then automatically obtain the mother \u2019s surname ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
