He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , GPE , assisted by Mr PERSON , counsel .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . During GPE recent civil war , the main fighting occurred between Government forces and ORG ( the ORG or \u201c NORP Tigers \u201d ) . In DATE , a paramilitary group broke away from the ORG ; this became known as the \u201c GPE group \u201d from the name of its leader PERSON ( alias \u201c Colonel PERSON ) . The political wing of this group was called ORG ( TamilEela Makkal PERSON : TVMP ) . DATE and DATE the GPE group fought with the Sri NORP armed forces against the NORP in GPE of GPE . In DATE GPE was expelled from the ORG after a dispute between him and his former deputy , PERSON ( also known as ORG ) . PERSON was later detained in GPE for immigration offences ; during this time the ORG was registered as a political party and , after elections in DATE , ORG became chief minister of GPE ( see ORG reports on GPE of DATE at annex C , p. CARDINAL and DATE at annex B , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE . He initially claimed to be visiting his brother but , when pressed , did not know his brother \u2019s address or phone number . When questioned further , he claimed asylum . He claimed to have formed a political party called ORG and to have stood as an independent candidate in the DATE provincial elections in GPE , LOC , in eastern GPE . In DATE , he had announced that he would publish a book giving details of human rights abuses of NORP in the district . He claimed that , on DATE , he was beaten up by CARDINAL unidentified men who warned him not to publish the book . He was later given a similar warning by telephone by the NORP . On DATE , at a branch meeting of the party , the applicant was attacked by an armed group who warned him to withdraw from the election or he would be killed . He attempted to report this incident to the police . On DATE , another group of armed men visited the party \u2019s office and made similar threats . The applicant believed these men belonged to the ORG group . A further attack took place on DATE when CARDINAL candidates from the applicant \u2019s party were attacked whilst putting up posters . DATE the applicant travelled to GPE and , the following day , he attended an anti - TMVP demonstration at which he was interviewed by ORG . He telephoned his home town and was told that , as a result of the interview , the Government and the ORG group were looking for him . He was warned not to return home . He nonetheless did so on DATE , and continued his political activities until DATE , DATE . His home was visited by armed men . Although he was not there at the time , his parents were given another warning . The applicant travelled to ORG ( also in LOC ) and then GPE . He fled to GPE using his GPE passport .", "CARDINAL . His asylum claim was refused by the Secretary of ORG on DATE . It was found not to be credible that , in his asylum interview , the applicant had failed to remember the full name of the man with whom he had founded ORG or the name of CARDINAL other party candidates . He had failed to show whether the armed groups who had threatened him were affiliated to a political party and it was speculative to consider that they were Government forces . There were inconsistencies between the applicant \u2019s account and the transcript of the interview with the ORG . For instance , he had claimed to have spoken about removing arms from the ORG group and made comments about fair elections , neither of which were in the transcript . This indicated he had fabricated his account that he was of interest to the ORG group and the Government . He had also failed to mention in the transcript who had assaulted the party \u2019s candidates and thus there was no evidence that he had accused the ORG group or the Government of being responsible for the attacks . He had also referred to himself in the broadcast as \u201c a candidate of ORG of CARDINAL \u201d yet stated in his asylum interview that he belonged to ORG . It was also incredible that he would have returned home after the broadcast and , despite his fear of the Government , he had left GPE on his own passport without any difficulties . He had , by his own admission , never been harmed by the ORG or the ORG group and had no further problems with the NORP despite having published his book . Finally , the Secretary of ORG considered that the documents produced by the applicant in support of his claim , including an election card and poster , and a recording and transcript of the ORG interview , did not assist him in any material way . The recording had not been independently corroborated and the transcript was incomplete .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the Secretary of ORG \u2019s refusal . His appeal was dismissed by the then ORG on DATE . It was accepted he had published the book as he had claimed and that this would have brought him to the attention of the ORG and the ORG . It was accepted that elections took place in eastern GPE on DATE and they had been marred by violence by paramilitary groups , including the ORG . It was surprising that the applicant had been unable to recall basic information as to his fellow candidates but it was accepted that the applicant had stood in those elections and the claims of harassment and attacks of the applicant and his party were consistent with the background evidence . The applicant \u2019s assumption that the armed men were part of the ORG group was entirely reasonable in the circumstances and it was credible that the ORG would have shown an interest in a rival party . The ORG was also satisfied that the applicant had given an interview at an anti - TMVP demonstration in GPE but it was not clear what he had said . It was further accepted that the applicant had been forced to flee as a result of the threats which had been made and the interview he had given . He would therefore be at risk in his home area . However , having considered this ORG \u2019s judgment in ORG . v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE , ORG concluded that the applicant would be safe in GPE where the ORG were not active . There was insufficient evidence that he would be wanted by the Sri Lankan authorities rather than the ORG ; there was little evidence of harassment of opposition groups by the ORG as shown by the fact that the demonstration at which the interview had been given had passed off relatively peacefully . The applicant was not on a wanted list nor was there any outstanding arrest warrant . He would be questioned at GPE airport on return but not detained or ill - treated .", "CARDINAL . An application for reconsideration of the determination was refused by a senior immigration judge on DATE , who found that , on the evidence before it , the ORG had been entitled to find as it did .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s brother arrived in GPE on DATE with a student visa which was valid until DATE . He claimed asylum in GPE in DATE on the basis that he was suspected of assisting the ORG by providing a vehicle to transport weapons . He stated that he had previously earned a living in GPE by hiring CARDINAL vehicles but had decided to study in GPE and had handed his vehicles and business interests to a family friend . He had no problems prior to leaving GPE but , in DATE , his parents had telephoned to say that the police had come looking for him . The police had shown his parents an arrest warrant and told them that the family friend had been arrested while carrying weapons . The Secretary of ORG refused the asylum claim inter alia because the brother had initially said that the family friend had been arrested because he had been carrying election propaganda but later said that it was because he had been carrying weapons .", "CARDINAL . The brother appealed to the First - tier ORG ) ( formerly ORG ) and produced a series of documents in support of his claim , including a letter from a GPE lawyer to the applicant \u2019s father and a copy of the arrest warrant with an LANGUAGE translation . Although the Secretary of ORG did not accept the authenticity of the documents ( arguing that forgeries were easily obtainable in GPE and that it was difficult to obtain a copy of one \u2019s own arrest warrant ) , attempts to verify their authenticity had not been successful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG allowed the brother \u2019s appeal . Although it had not been explained how the arrest warrant came into the possession of the family , the Secretary of ORG had not undertaken checks , had not appeared before the ORG and had not stated that the documents were forgeries . The arrest warrant was corroborated by the rest of the documents submitted by the brother , it was accepted it had been issued and further accepted that the police had visited the family home . Given the significance of an arrest warrant as a risk factor , the ORG concluded that there would be a real risk of ill - treatment on return .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant made further representations to the Secretary of ORG on DATE and submitted further objective information in support of his asylum claim , which showed that opponents of the ORG were at risk and that a number of NORP had been murdered . It appears that these representations were not received by the Secretary of ORG at the time .", "CARDINAL . Removal directions were set for the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE on DATE . On DATE , the applicant lodged an emergency application for judicial review . It appears that at this point the Secretary of ORG became aware of the representations . The removal directions were then cancelled .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG rejected the representations in a letter dated DATE . The Secretary of ORG found that , even if he were at risk from members of the ORG , the applicant could safely relocate to PERSON , but , in any event , the latest evidence showed that even a localised risk had been eradicated . A consideration of the risk factors set out in ORG , and endorsed in ORG , cited above , and ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , showed that there was no real risk of ill - treatment at the hands of the GPE authorities .", "CARDINAL . The judicial review application was refused by ORG on DATE . It was found that there was nothing in the judicial application to impugn the Secretary of ORG \u2019s initial decision to refuse asylum or the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . When removal directions were then set for the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE on DATE , the applicant made a second emergency application for judicial review to ORG . He relied on new evidence that he was of continuing interest to the GPE authorities , including a witness statement from his mother and a letter from a GPE lawyer which appended LANGUAGE translations of an arrest warrant for the applicant and CARDINAL court summonses containing the names of the applicant and QUANTITY other men .", "CARDINAL . Those documents have been provided to the ORG .", "The letter from the GPE lawyer , addressed to the applicant \u2019s former legal representatives and dated DATE , thanked the legal representatives for their instructions of DATE . The GPE lawyer stated that he contacted ORG , who advised him that an arrest warrant was issued in respect of the applicant on DATE . The letter gave the case reference number for the arrest warrant , stated that it was \u201c live \u201d and valid until executed . The letter states that service of the warrant was attempted on DATE .", "The first court summons from ORG is dated DATE . It gives the names of the applicant and CARDINAL other men , and the particulars of their offence as having connection with terrorists and aiding and abetting terrorists . The summons requires the applicant to appear before the court on DATE . The second court summons is dated CARDINAL DATE and orders his appearance on DATE .", "The arrest warrant is dated DATE and authorises the arrest of the applicant for the purposes of bringing him before the same court , ORG .", "On both court summonses , the name of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL other men is similar to the name of the applicant \u2019s brother , though the parties in their submissions to ORG ( see further below ) have confirmed that it is a different person . The parties have also confirmed that the summonses and warrant are different documents from the arrest warrant considered by the First - tier ORG ) in the appeal of the applicant \u2019s brother .", "In her statement , the applicant \u2019s mother said that CARDINAL police officers visited the family home on DATE and told her that the applicant was being sought for suspicious activities on behalf of the NORP and against the ORG . She was shown a document which stated that the police had an arrest warrant to this effect . The police then said that they would be back in DATE and warned her that her son would have to face terrible consequences if he failed to surrender .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG wrote to the applicant stating that the grounds which he relied on in the second judicial review application could reasonably have been raised in the previous judicial review application and she was not prepared to defer his removal unless a ORG injunction was obtained .", "CARDINAL . The second application for judicial review was refused on DATE . ORG found :", "\u201c The asylum claim before the Immigration Judge in DATE , and upheld , was a fear of persecution from the ORG . Then as late as CARDINAL September CARDINAL the judicial review was based on what was said to be a fresh claim \u2018 that as an opponent of the ORG he would at risk [ sic]\u2019 ... Now it is said that his fear is from the authorities , because there is an arrest warrant out for him and a statement from his mother that the police have been looking for him . Having given the matter close attention I am afraid I regard this simply as a last ditch attempt to prevent removal . It has no prospect of success . \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE , ORG refused permission to appeal , a single judge of that court stating that he was not persuaded that there was a realistic prospect of a successful appeal against the refusal of interim relief . The applicant has since informed this ORG that the ORG determination in respect of the applicant \u2019s brother was not placed before ORG or ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government proceeded with the applicant \u2019s removal from FAC airport on DATE but he was removed from the aircraft when he claimed to be experiencing chest pains . Removal directions were reset for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with this ORG and the same day the President of the ORG to which the application was allocated decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG and to indicate to the Government of GPE that the applicant should not be removed to GPE until DATE to enable further consideration of the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was requested to submit further information to the ORG , including a copy of the ORG determination in respect of his brother . This was sent by post DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Agent of the Government of the GPE informed the ORG that removal directions had been set for DATE . He further informed the ORG that , while the applicant \u2019s brother had been granted asylum , this had no bearing on the consideration of the applicant \u2019s case , which had been carefully considered on its own merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the ORG decided that Rule DATE should be applied until further notice , that notice of the application should be given to the respondent Government , and that they should be invited to submit written observations on the admissibility and merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . ORG determination in LP ( NORP area DATE Colombo \u2013 risk ? ) GPE [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE was considered by ORG in ORG . , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL . The headnote to the determination provided :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) NORP are not per se at risk of serious harm from the Sri NORP authorities in GPE . A number of factors may increase the risk , including but not limited to : a previous record as a suspected or actual ORG member ; a previous criminal record and/or outstanding arrest warrant ; bail jumping and/or escaping from custody ; having signed a confession or similar document ; having been asked by the security forces to become an informer ; the presence of scarring ; return from GPE or other centre of NORP fundraising ; illegal departure from GPE ; lack of an ORG card or other documentation ; having made an asylum claim abroad ; having relatives in the ORG . In every case , those factors and the weight to be ascribed to them , individually and cumulatively , must be considered in the light of the facts of each case but they are not intended to be a check list .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If a person is actively wanted by the police and/or named on a Watched or Wanted list held at FAC , they may be at risk of detention at the airport .", "( CARDINAL ) Otherwise , the majority of returning failed asylum seekers are processed relatively quickly and with no difficulty beyond some possible harassment .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP in GPE are at increased risk of being stopped at checkpoints , in a cordon and search operation , or of being the subject of a raid on a ORG where they are staying . In general , the risk again is no more than harassment and should not cause any lasting difficulty , but NORP who have recently returned to GPE and have not yet renewed their GPE identity documents will be subject to more investigation and the factors listed above may then come into play .", "( CARDINAL ) Returning NORP should be able to establish the fact of their recent return during the short period necessary for new identity documents to be procured .", "( CARDINAL ) A person who can not establish that he is at real risk of persecution in his home area is not a refugee ; but his appeal may succeed under LAW ORG , or he may be entitled to humanitarian protection if he can establish he would be at risk in the part of the country to which he will be returned ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . LP was reconsidered by the ORG in the light of ORG . in ORG ( NORP \u2013 LP updated ) GPE [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE . The ORG \u2019s conclusions were summarised in the headnote to the determination which , where relevant provides :", "\u201c a ) The risk categories identified in ORG ( ORG area \u2013 NORP - Colombo \u2013 risk ? ) GPE [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE and approved by ORG ) in ORG v GPE , ORG . CARDINAL , remain valid .", "b ) Events since the military defeat of the NORP in DATE have not aggravated the likely approach of the Sri NORP authorities to returned failed asylum seekers who are NORP ; if anything the level of interest in them has decreased . The principal focus of the authorities continues to be , not NORP from the north ( or east ) as such , but persons considered to be either NORP members , fighters or operatives or persons who have played an active role in the international procurement network responsible for financing the ORG and ensuring it was supplied with arms .", "c ) The records the GPE authorities keep on persons with some history of arrest and detention have become increasingly sophisticated ; their greater accuracy is likely to reduce substantially the risk that a person of no real interest to the authorities would be arrested or detained . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Immigration Act DATE provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of ORG . Paragraph CARDINAL of ORG provides as follows :", "\u201c When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused or withdrawn or treated as withdrawn under paragraph CARDINAL of these Rules and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending , the decision maker will consider any further submissions and , if rejected , will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim .

The submissions will only be significantly different if the content :", "( i ) had not already been considered ; and", "( ii ) taken together with the previously considered material , created a realistic prospect of success , notwithstanding its rejection . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the scrutiny of fresh asylum claims and the power of the courts to review such scrutiny , ORG in PERSON ( ORG ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ( paragraphs CARDINAL ) has held :", "\u201c Accordingly , a court when reviewing a decision of the Secretary of ORG as to whether a fresh claim exists must address the following matters . First , has the Secretary of ORG asked himself the correct question ? The question is not whether the Secretary of ORG himself thinks that the new claim is a good one or should succeed , but whether there is a realistic prospect of an adjudicator , applying the rule of anxious scrutiny , thinking that the applicant will be exposed to a real risk of persecution on return ... The Secretary of ORG of course can , and no doubt logically should , treat his own view of the merits as a starting - point for that enquiry ; but it is only a starting point in the consideration of a question that is distinctly different from the exercise of the Secretary of ORG making up his own mind . Second , in addressing that question , both in respect of the evaluation of the facts and in respect of the legal conclusions to be drawn from those facts , has the Secretary of ORG satisfied the requirement of anxious scrutiny ? If the court can not be satisfied that the answer to both of those questions is in the affirmative it will have to grant an application for review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision . \u201d", "Thus , an applicant making fresh representations must establish that they have a realistic prospect of success to establish a \u201c fresh claim \u201d which , even if then refused by the Secretary of ORG , will nonetheless generate a fresh right of appeal to be considered on the merits .", "CARDINAL . GPE Information Service report on GPE of DATE includes ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) the following excerpt from a letter from ORG in GPE dated DATE :", "\u201c Formally it is difficult for the accused to be able to obtain a copy of his / her own arrest warrant . When an arrest warrant is issued , a copy is kept on the legal file and the original is handed to the police . An accused can not apply for copies of the arrest warrant to the relevant court . However , in practice forged documents are easily obtainable throughout GPE .
