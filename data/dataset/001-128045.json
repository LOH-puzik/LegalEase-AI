In its leading ruling of DATE on a complaint lodged by PERSON , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c ... implementation of constitutional guarantees of judicial protection ... implies that a convicted person who has expressed a wish to take part in a court hearing may not be deprived of the opportunity to file objections and lodge petitions , acquaint himself with the position of [ other participants ] expressed in the court hearing and additional materials of the case , if any , and to provide explanations , including in relation to the prosecutor \u2019s opinion .", "... Those guarantees may be implemented not only by providing the convicted person with an opportunity to participate in the court hearing in person , but also in other ways . In particular , a convicted person may entrust his defence to a lawyer of his own choosing , and provide written replies to the arguments contained in the grounds of appeals , protests and submissions to the appeal court by other participants in the proceedings . What is significant in the constitutional context is that in the interests of justice a convicted person who has expressed a wish to take part in the court hearing should be provided with an effective opportunity to state his position regarding all aspects of the case and bring it to the attention of the court .", "... The challenged provision of the [ old ] CCrP ... does not prevent the appeal court , which is under an obligation to verify the lawfulness and validity of the judgment , from finding that the participation of a convicted person in the court hearing is indispensable and taking measures to ensure his presence at the hearing . The court may also examine the case in the absence of the convicted person if he has not expressed the wish to take part in the court hearing .", "At the same time , those provisions allow the appeal court to dismiss the convicted person \u2019s request to participate in the hearing and to take a final decision in the case without providing him with any other legal means for implementation of his rights ... This results in a deviation from the principle of equality of all persons before the law and the court and in the limitation of the constitutional rights to judicial protection , examination of the case by a tribunal established by law , and review of the judgment by a higher court ... Moreover , this breaches LAW , which guarantees that court proceedings will be adversarial and will respect equality of arms . Those guarantees imply that the prosecution and the defence should be provided with equal procedural opportunities to state their position during the examination of the case by the appeal court ... \u201d", "Taking the above considerations into account , ORG held that the challenged provisions of the old CCrP were incompatible with the LAW in so far as they allowed the appeal court , if it dismissed a convicted person \u2019s request to take part in the hearing , to take a final decision in the case without providing that person with an opportunity to acquaint himself with the materials of the court hearing and to state his position on the questions examined by the court .", "CARDINAL . In its further decisions on the complaints challenging the compatibility of the new ORG with the LAW , in particular of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of that Code , ORG further developed its position regarding the participation of convicted persons in the examination of their case by the appeal court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to examine on the merits a complaint lodged by Mr S. challenging the compatibility with LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the new CCrP in so far as that provision allowed the appeal court to examine his grounds of appeal in his absence , since he had applied to participate in the examination of his criminal case by the appeal court not in his initial grounds of appeal but in additional grounds of appeal which were submitted later . ORG held as follows :", "\u201c In accordance with the legal position expressed by ORG in its rulings of DATE , no . CARDINAL , DATE , no . CARDINAL and DATE , no . CARDINAL-\u041f , and decisions of DATE , no . CARDINAL-\u041e , DATE , no . CARDINAL and DATE , no . CARDINAL-\u041e , providing the parties with an effective opportunity to state their position regarding all aspects of the case is a necessary requirement of judicial protection and a fair trial . Depriving the convicted person of an opportunity to familiarise himself with all the materials of the case and to bring to the attention of the court arguments refuting the conclusions of the trial court , either by way of his personal presence at the appeal court hearing or by way of video link or any other way , would breach his right to judicial protection and the principle of equality of arms .", "LAW of the [ new ] ORG provides a convicted person with the right to apply for participation in the examination of his criminal case by the appeal court by indicating his wish to attend in his grounds of appeal . The provision \u2019s aim is to provide him with an opportunity to state his position on the case before the appeal court and shall not be regarded as limiting his right to judicial protection and other rights guaranteed by LAW . In addition , the provision does not deprive the convicted person of the right to apply for participation in the appeal hearing if he makes such a request not in his grounds of appeal , but in accordance with the procedure provided for by LAW of the [ new ] CCrP of GPE , which places an obligation on the court to take a lawful , reasoned and duly motivated decision on such a request ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court confirmed its interpretation of LAW of the [ new ] CCrP in its decision of DATE , by which it refused to examine on the merits a complaint lodged by Mr T. challenging the compatibility of that provision with the LAW . Citing its decision of DATE , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c ... a different interpretation of LAW of the [ new ] ORG would not only be contrary to Articles CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW of GPE and the above - cited legal position of ORG of GPE , but also , contrary to the general principle of equality guaranteed by LAW , it would unreasonably worsen the situation of convicted persons held in custody compared to that of the other participants of the criminal proceedings , including convicted persons who have not been deprived of their liberty , whose right to take part in the appeal court hearing is not limited ( under LAW [ new ] CCrP a convicted person or a person acquitted of all charges who appears before the court will always be entitled to take part in the hearing ) .", "Therefore , LAW of the [ new ] ORG , taken together with the provisions of LAW of that Code , does not prevent a convicted person from applying for participation in the examination of his criminal case by the appeal court after submitting his grounds of appeal . This implies that the court has an obligation to take a lawful , reasoned and duly motivated decision on such a request ... \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
