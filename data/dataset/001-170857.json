On DATE Mr PERSON , a well - known human rights lawyer , and PERSON , a journalist , were shot dead in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and PERSON decided to hold a commemoration \u201c picket \u201d ( \u201c \u043f\u0438\u043a\u0435\u0442 \u201d ) near the PERSON to ORG in LOC , GPE , on CARDINAL DATE . The location was symbolic , and was chosen by them to emphasise that , in their opinion , the murders of PERSON PERSON and PERSON were cases of politically motivated repression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and PERSON notified ORG date , time , place and purposes of the \u201c picket \u201d . The event was scheduled to take place from TIME on CARDINAL DATE , with CARDINAL people expected to take part .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a telegram and a letter to the applicant , refusing to approve the venue . The town administration noted that PERSON was a popular place of recreation and many families would be walking there with their small children on DATE , CARDINAL DATE . The \u201c picket \u201d might pose a danger to their health and life . They proposed that the organisers change the location and time of the event . They also warned the applicant and PERSON that they might be held liable under LAW for a breach of the established procedure for conducting public events . According to the Government , a copy of the Mayor \u2019s decree of DATE listing the locations in GPE suitable for public events was attached to the letter . The Government did not submit a copy of the letter or the decree .", "CARDINAL . Given that the location and date were important to them , and fearing that holding the event at the chosen location without the authorities\u2019 approval might result in arrests and administrative proceedings against the participants , the applicant and PERSON decided to cancel the CARDINAL - person \u201c picket \u201d they had planned . Instead , the applicant held a solo \u201c picket \u201d , for which no notification was required .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE before ORG . He complained that the decision had amounted to a ban on the event , because the authorities had not proposed any alternative venue or time for it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected his complaint . It found that in its decision of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON authorities had merely proposed that the applicant should change the location and time of the event , rather than imposing a ban on it . That decision had therefore not violated the applicant \u2019s rights . It had also been lawful . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well reasoned and justified .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is a gay rights activist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , together with PERSON and PERSON , notified the Prefect of GPE of GPE of their intention to hold a \u201c picket \u201d from TIME on CARDINAL DATE in front of the ORG \u2019s office on FAC , which CARDINAL people were expected to attend . The aim of the event was to call for the ORG \u2019s resignation \u201c in connection with his efforts to incite hatred and enmity towards various social groups , and his failure to comply with electoral laws \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prefect of GPE of GPE refused to approve the venue , noting that another public event was planned at the same location from TIME on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , PERSON and PERSON lodged a new notification proposing to hold the event at any time TIME . An official from the ORG \u2019s office stamped the notification with a seal that bore the following inscription in red : \u201c to be handed to the applicant personally \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE he went to the ORG \u2019s office to collect the decision . However , the official refused to hand over the decision , explaining that it had been dispatched by post . The applicant never received the letter and had to cancel the event .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the ORG \u2019s refusal to approve the venue before ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaints . It found that by his decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG had agreed to the holding of the \u201c picket \u201d on DATE from TIME That decision had been sent to the applicant by post . The letter had not been delivered because the applicant did not live at the indicated address . The applicant \u2019s argument that the stamp indicated that the decision was to be handed to him personally was unconvincing . As NORP law did not establish any procedure for notifying applicants of such decisions , the ORG \u2019s office had been entitled to choose any notification method , including sending the decision by post . The fact that the letter had not been delivered did not render the authorities\u2019 actions unlawful . Lastly , the court found that the applicant had not proved that the ORG \u2019s office had refused to give him the decision when he had gone to collect it , although there is no evidence in the judgment that the ORG \u2019s representative contested that matter .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He submitted , in particular , that the ORG \u2019s office had at first informed him that the decision would be handed over to him personally , but had then refused to give it to him . The letter containing that decision had not arrived at the local post office until DATE of the planned event . Even if he had received the letter , it would no longer have been possible to hold the event .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well reasoned and justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , together with PERSON and PERSON , notified the Prefect of LOC of GPE of their intention to hold a \u201c picket \u201d from TIME on CARDINAL DATE in FAC , with CARDINAL people expected to take part . The aims of the event were the same as those of the \u201c picket \u201d in LOC of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a deputy prefect of LOC of GPE informed the applicant that another public event was planned at the same location and time , and proposed that another venue be chosen .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , PERSON and PERSON stated their readiness to accept another venue for their event , and proposed CARDINAL alternative sites for the Prefect to choose from .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the deputy prefect refused to approve any of the locations proposed by the applicant , noting that the applicant , PERSON and Mr B. were the organisers of another \u201c picket \u201d at the same time in LOC of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged that refusal before ORG of GPE . He submitted , in particular , that the deputy prefect \u2019s finding that he was the organiser of another \u201c picket \u201d on DATE in LOC of GPE was incorrect , because the authorities had not agreed to that \u201c picket \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected his complaint . It found , in particular , that the proposal to change the location of the \u201c picket \u201d was lawful because a presentation of the new ORG catalogue had been planned in FAC at the same time . The refusal to agree to the \u201c picket \u201d at other venues had also been lawful because the applicant had submitted CARDINAL notifications in respect of \u201c pickets \u201d at CARDINAL different locations , in the LOC and Northern Administrative Districts , to be held at the same time . Although the applicant had indeed been informed by ORG that he could not hold a \u201c picket \u201d at the proposed location , he could still have held a \u201c picket \u201d at another venue in LOC . Had he done so , it would have been impossible for him to organise a \u201c picket \u201d to be held in LOC at the same time . The refusal to agree to the \u201c picket \u201d in LOC had therefore been well reasoned .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He submitted , in particular , that domestic law made no provision for a public event to be banned on the ground that CARDINAL notifications had been lodged by the same person . The refusal to approve the \u201c picket \u201d had therefore been unlawful . He had lodged CARDINAL notifications with the aim of proposing alternative venues for the event . If both of them had been approved , he would have chosen CARDINAL of the approved sites . He relied on LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well reasoned and justified .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL applicants are Mr ORG ( the first applicant ) and PERSON PERSON ( the second applicant ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants decided to commemorate the anniversary of the murder of Mr PERSON and PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , PERSON and PERSON notified ORG of their intention to hold a march and a meeting on DATE in the centre of GPE , which CARDINAL people were expected to attend . The aims of the march and the meeting were as follows :", "\u201c To commemorate the human rights lawyer PERSON , the journalist PERSON and other victims of ideological and political terror ;", "To protest against politically and ideologically motivated murders , against racism , ethnic and religious hatred , and against recourse to chauvinism and xenophobia in politics and social life . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second applicant intended to attend the march and the meeting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied that , in accordance with LAW , the notification had to be submitted no DATE and DATE before the intended public event . As the organisers had submitted their notification outside that time - limit , they were not allowed to hold the march and the meeting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE before ORG . They submitted that the date of the meeting and the march was very important for them because it was the anniversary of the murders . No other date would have the same impact . The time - limit for lodging a notification fell CARDINAL . However , because of the New Year and DATE , DATE from DATE were officially non - working days , so it was not possible to lodge a notification within the time - limit established by law . The applicants had accordingly lodged the notification on DATE , that is DATE working days before the intended march and meeting . Any other interpretation of the domestic law would mean that no public events could be held in the period from DATE . They also argued that ORG had not observed the DATE time - limit for a reply established by the domestic law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG complaints . It found that the decision of CARDINAL DATE had been lawful . The applicants had not observed the time - limit for lodging a notification established by domestic law and were not therefore entitled to hold the march and the meeting . Moreover , given that they had later been allowed to hold a \u201c picket \u201d on DATE , their freedom of assembly had not been violated .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . They reiterated their previous arguments and added that the \u201c picket \u201d approved by the authorities was not an adequate substitute for a meeting and a march . Firstly , the authorities had agreed to an event with CARDINAL people attending instead of CARDINAL . And secondly , and more importantly , the use of sound amplifying equipment was not allowed during a \u201c picket \u201d , which had prevented the organisers and participants from making public speeches .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well reasoned and justified .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL applicants are Mr ORG ( the first applicant ) , PERSON PERSON ( the second applicant ) and Mr ORG ( the third applicant ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and third applicants notified ORG of their intention to hold a march and a meeting on DATE . The aim was \u201c to protest against violations of the civil and social rights of the residents of GPE and LOC in the spheres of town planning , land distribution , environmental conditions , housing and communal services , and judicial protection \u201d . The march was scheduled to start at TIME at FAC , from where the participants were to march to FAC . The notification stated that the participants would cross FAC by the underground passage . A meeting would be held at FAC from TIME It was expected that CARDINAL people would take part in the march and the meeting . The second applicant intended to attend the meeting and the march .", "CARDINAL . ORG forwarded the notification to ORG , which concluded on DATE that the march was likely to cause traffic delays and disrupt public transport when it crossed FAC . It was therefore necessary to change the route of the march . ORG then forwarded the notification to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a deputy head of ORG proposed that the applicants should cancel the march and hold a meeting at FAC in order to \u201c avoid any interference with the normal functioning of the public utility services , the activities of commercial organisations , traffic or the interests of citizens not taking part in public events \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and third applicants asked ORG either to propose an alternative route for the march or to agree to hold the meeting in FAC , in which case they were ready to forgo the march . They argued that ORG had not advanced any reasons in support of their finding that the march and the meeting might interfere with traffic or the activities of commercial organisations . They also noted that CARDINAL meetings had recently been held in FAC and had not caused any disruption .", "CARDINAL . ORG replied that the march and the meeting in FAC had not been given official approval , and warned the applicants that measures would be taken to prevent them from holding the events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE before ORG of GPE . They submitted that ORG had not observed the statutory time - limit of DATE for giving a reply and had failed to propose an alternative venue for the march . The GPE authorities had not put forward weighty reasons for their proposal to cancel the march and change the venue of the meeting . Neither the march nor the meeting would have interfered with the normal life of the city if held at the location chosen by the applicants , because no blocking off of traffic would have been necessary . They reiterated that CARDINAL meetings had recently been held in FAC with official approval ; they had gone ahead without any trouble or disruption of normal life for residents . The applicants asked for an injunction for ORG to agree to the meeting and the march . They also requested that their complaint be examined before the planned meeting date .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the ORG complaint , sent by post , was received by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE CARDINAL people , including the applicants , gathered in FAC . The police issued a warning , through loudspeakers , that the meeting was unlawful and that the participants should disperse . The meeting was then dispersed by force by the police and many of those present were arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG complaints , finding that the decision of CARDINAL DATE had been lawful . The text of the judgment did not contain any reply to the ORG argument that ORG had not observed the statutory DATE for a reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of DATE on appeal and allowed the ORG complaints . It found that ORG had not examined whether there existed a factual basis for the finding that the meeting and the march planned by the applicants would interfere with the normal life of the city . ORG had not submitted any evidence in support of that finding . The decision of DATE had not therefore been well reasoned . At the same time , it was impossible to allow the request for an injunction to agree to the meeting and the march because the planned date had passed DATE .", "DATE . On DATE ORG lodged an application for supervisory review of the judgment of DATE . It argued that it had submitted evidence in support of the decision not to agree to the march and the meeting planned by the applicants , in the form of a letter from ORG dated DATE stating that the march might cause delays in public transport when it crossed FAC . He further argued that it would be difficult for CARDINAL participants to cross FAC by the underground passage , which was always crowded with passers - by and street vendors . An alternative venue for the meeting had been proposed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted in reply that the march had been scheduled during DATE , when vehicular and pedestrian traffic was insignificant . ORG by the underground passage would therefore not have caused any inconvenience to passers - by or street vendors or their clients , or caused delays in public transport . In any event , traffic in the centre of GPE was often blocked by the authorities to permit the staging of sports or cultural events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidium of ORG quashed the appeal judgment of DATE and upheld the judgment of DATE rejecting the ORG complaints . It found that ORG refusal to agree to the march and the meeting had been lawful and well reasoned . It would have been impossible for the participants in the march to cross FAC by the underground passage , which was always crowded with passers - by and street vendors . The participants would therefore have had to cross the road , thereby delaying public transport . To protect the interests of citizens who did not take part in public events , ORG had proposed an alternative venue for the meeting , at the same time requiring the organisers to cancel the march . That decision had not violated the applicants\u2019 rights .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , at the end of the hearing of CARDINAL DATE only the operative part of the judgment had been read out by the bailiffs . The reasoned judgment had never been read out publicly and had been sent to the applicants by post on DATE . The ORG account was disputed by the ORG , who submitted that the entire text of the judgment had been read out publicly at the end of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL applicants are PERSON ( the first applicant ) , PERSON PERSON ( the second applicant ) , PERSON ( the third applicant ) and PERSON PERSON ( the fourth applicant ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are gay human rights activists .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants notified ORG of their intention to hold a ORG march and a subsequent meeting on DATE , the anniversary of the start of the gay rights movement in GPE ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) on DATE . The march and the meeting were scheduled to take place in the centre of GPE , with CARDINAL people expected to attend . The aim was \u201c to draw the attention of society to the violations of the rights of homosexuals , and the attention of society and the authorities to the widespread discrimination that exists against homosexuals and to homophobia , fascism and xenophobia \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to allow the meeting and the march . It noted that the route chosen by the applicants was a busy road with many parked cars , and construction work was under way . The march might therefore obstruct road and pedestrian traffic and distract drivers , which might in turn cause road accidents . Moreover , another meeting had already been approved in the same place at the same time . Finally , the applicants\u2019 meeting was scheduled to take place in the vicinity of the ORG building . In accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW it was prohibited to hold public events in the vicinity of court buildings . ORG proposed that the applicants change the venue of their march and meeting , and warned them that if they failed to obtain the authorities\u2019 approval for another venue they would not be entitled to organise the planned events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants proposed CARDINAL alternative venues for the march and subsequent meeting . They also informed ORG of their readiness to abandon the march and simply hold a meeting , and proposed a location for the meeting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again refused to agree to the meeting and the march . It found that the venues chosen by the applicants were not suitable for the following reasons : CARDINAL of the locations was not large enough to accommodate CARDINAL people , and the participants would hinder access to a bus stop , a shop and a bicycle rental service . Moreover , \u201c Youth Day \u201d celebrations were planned in the nearby park . At another venue the march might obstruct the traffic and cause traffic jams on the road which government delegations and guests would be taking on DATE to attend the celebrations of the CARDINALth anniversary of the town of GPE . Moreover , the march might hinder ORG access to their homes or shops . Lastly , on DATE would be being celebrated by students on the nearby campus . The third location proposed by the applicants was not suitable either , because celebrations to mark the end of DATE would be held there too . ORG proposed that the applicants change the venue of the march and meeting .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was informed about that decision on TIME of CARDINAL DATE and received a copy of it on TIME DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants proposed CARDINAL new alternative venues to ORG , for either a march and a meeting or a meeting only .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to approve the meeting and the march for a third time . It found that the applicant \u2019s reply had been submitted outside the time - limit established by LAW . That section provided that a reply to the authorities\u2019 proposal to change the location of the event should be submitted DATE before the intended event . Having missed that deadline , the applicants were not entitled to hold the meeting and the march on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Despairing of obtaining official approval for a march and a meeting , on DATE the applicants notified ORG , Moskovskiy and ORG of GPE of their intention to hold a \u201c picket \u201d with the same aims on DATE . In GPE a location was chosen to accommodate CARDINAL participants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Petrogradskiy District Administration refused to agree to the \u201c picket \u201d because cultural and sports events were scheduled to be held at the location chosen by the applicants . Moreover , the applicants had not obtained the consent of the private sports complex in whose grounds the intended \u201c picket \u201d was to take place . ORG refused to agree to the \u201c picket \u201d because a rock festival and a circus inauguration event were scheduled to take place at the location chosen by the applicants . ORG did not allow the \u201c picket \u201d because a film was scheduled to be shot in that district DATE , including at the location selected by the applicants . Lastly , on DATE ORG also refused to agree to the \u201c picket \u201d because another ( unspecified ) event had already been approved at the same location and time as the applicants\u2019 event . ORG proposed that the applicants change the location or time of their \u201c picket \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , the youth wing of the progovernment party GPE , organised a meeting in support of \u201c family and traditional family values \u201d . That meeting was approved by the authorities and was held at one of the locations which , when proposed by the applicants for their ORG march , had been rejected as unsuitable by ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant challenged ORG decisions of CARDINAL and DATE before ORG of GPE . She complained that ORG had refused , for various reasons , to approve any of the venues proposed by the organisers for the march and the meeting . It was significant that the authorities alone were in possession of full and updated information about all construction work and other events planned in the city . That being so , the authorities themselves should have proposed a venue where the march and the meeting could take place . They had not , however , made any such proposal , confining their decisions to rejecting all the numerous locations proposed by the organisers . The first applicant also complained of discrimination on account of sexual orientation .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing was scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant submitted additional arguments in writing . She complained that ORG decision of DATE had been unlawful and had also not been well reasoned . She argued , firstly , that the applicants\u2019 reply to ORG proposal to change the venue had been submitted within the DATE timelimit established by LAW . To be precise , it had been lodged on DATE , DATE before the intended march , which was scheduled for DATE . Secondly , the applicants could not have replied earlier because they had not received ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , requiring them to change the venue , until DATE . The first applicant further submitted that the reasons advanced by ORG in its decisions of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE had not been sufficient . ORG had referred to certain inconveniences that might be caused by the march and the meeting , such as obstructing the traffic , or to other events planned in the city on DATE . However , under section CARDINAL of LAW it was the authorities\u2019 responsibility to take steps to ensure that public order was respected and that public events could proceed smoothly , including by regulating or blocking traffic . She also referred to ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL below ) , which held that neither logistical difficulties that might be encountered by the authorities , nor a certain level of disruption of the ordinary life of citizens , could serve as a valid reason for refusing to approve a public event .", "DATE . On DATE ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s complaints . It found that ORG had provided reasons for its decisions of CARDINAL and DATE refusing to agree to the meeting and the march . Domestic law did not impose an obligation on an authority refusing to approve a location or time for a public event to propose an alternative location or time . As to the decision of DATE , the court found that it had also been lawful as the first applicant had missed the deadline for replying to the proposal to change the venue . She had not proved that she had been notified belatedly of the decision of DATE ; the list of her incoming calls showing that she had indeed received a call from ORG late in the TIME of DATE could not serve as proof of the belated notification . Lastly , given that ORG had not banned the meeting and march planned by the first applicant , but had merely required her to change the venue , her freedom of assembly had not been breached .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE upheld the judgment on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well reasoned and justified .", "CARDINAL . On different dates in DATE , DATE and DATE the first applicant challenged the refusals of the authorities of the Petrogradskiy , ORG , Moskovskiy and ORG of GPE to allow the \u201c pickets \u201d , arguing that the refusals had not been substantiated by weighty reasons and that the district authorities had not proposed alternative venues for the \u201c pickets \u201d . She also complained of discrimination on account of sexual orientation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE held that the decision of DATE of ORG had been unlawful . It found that the other event to which ORG had referred in its decision was due to finish before the applicant \u2019s \u201c picket \u201d was due to begin . The authorities\u2019 refusal had not therefore been well reasoned . Further , relying on ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found that , when refusing to approve a venue chosen by the organisers , the district administration had an obligation to propose an alternative venue . No other venue had been proposed , however .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Petrogradskiy District Court of GPE held that ORG decision of DATE had been unlawful . It found that the reasons advanced by the district authorities for their refusal to allow the \u201c picket \u201d at the location and time chosen by the applicants had been valid . In particular , it had been established that on DATE the location in question was the meeting point for the departure of children to sports camps . An assembly in favour of homosexual rights \u201c would not have furthered the development of their morals \u201d . By contrast , the requirement to obtain the consent of the private sports complex in the grounds of which the intended \u201c picket \u201d was to take place had no basis in domestic law . Nor could concerns for public order and the safety of the participants serve as a valid reason for the refusal to allow the event , because it was the joint responsibility of the authorities and the organisers to guarantee public order and the safety of all involved . At the same time , the district authorities had not proposed an alternative location or time for the \u201c picket \u201d , which it was obliged to do pursuant to ORG decision of DATE . The failure to propose an alternative location or time had deprived the first applicant of any opportunity to have the event approved . Lastly , ORG noted that it was no longer possible to remedy the violation of the first applicant \u2019s rights because the planned date had DATE . On DATE GPE upheld that judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Moskovskiy District Court of GPE held that the decision of ORG of DATE had also been unlawful . Although the district authorities\u2019 refusal to approve the location and time of the \u201c picket \u201d chosen by the applicants had been well reasoned , the district authorities had not fulfilled their obligation to propose an alternative location or time for the event . The court ordered ORG to propose a suitable alternative location and time for the \u201c picket \u201d . On DATE GPE upheld that judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE held that the decision of CARDINAL DATE of ORG had also been unlawful . It found that the district authorities should have found out precisely at which locations the film shooting was scheduled to take place . Depending on that information , they should either have agreed to the \u201c picket \u201d being held at the location chosen by the applicants or have proposed an alternative location .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second , third and fourth applicants and PERSON notified ORG of their intention to hold a ORG march and a meeting on DATE , which CARDINAL people were expected to attend . The aim of the meeting and the march was \u201c to draw the attention of society and the authorities to the violations of the rights of gays , lesbians , bisexual and transgender people and to the need to introduce a statutory prohibition on discrimination on account of sexual orientation or gender identity \u201d .", "DATE . On DATE ORG refused to agree to the march and the meeting . They found that the events would hinder the passage of pedestrians and vehicles and might also distract drivers , causing road accidents . Moreover , a guided tour of the district for children was planned on DATE and the ORG meeting would disrupt it . The district authorities proposed another location for the meeting and the march , and informed the applicants that the area would be closed to traffic for their convenience .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants replied that the venue proposed by the district administration was unsuitable , because it was located in an industrial area among factories and warehouses and was difficult to reach . They proposed an alternative venue for the CARDINAL events , which they said was separated from the road by a QUANTITY - wide row of trees , which ruled out any risk of road accidents or hindrance to traffic . They would not be in the way of passers - by either , because there was a parallel pedestrian path which would remain free for passage . Lastly , the participants would cross the road at traffic lights , using a pedestrian crossing , which would make it unnecessary to close the area to traffic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again refused to approve the venue chosen by the applicants , pointing out that work to install a temporary amusement park would be going on there . They also reiterated their arguments concerning the obstruction of traffic and the risk of road accidents . The district administration insisted that the applicants should organise the march and the meeting at the location proposed in the letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants agreed to hold the meeting and the march at the location proposed by the district authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to allow the march and the meeting at that location . The reason given was that the nearby power station was expecting a delivery of spare parts for boilers on DATE . The authorities proposed that the applicants choose another location for the march and the meeting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third and fourth applicants challenged ORG decisions of CARDINAL , DATE before ORG of GPE . They submitted that the reasons given by the district authorities for refusing to allow the meeting and the march were not convincing . They also complained of discrimination on account of sexual orientation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the ORG complaints , finding that ORG decisions had not been well reasoned . It was the authorities\u2019 and the ORG joint responsibility to ensure public order and the safety of participants and passers - by during the meeting and march . In their letter of DATE the applicants had set out the measures they intended to take to avoid accidents and disruption to traffic . The district authorities had disregarded those arguments and insisted that the march should take place at a location of their choosing . However , before proposing that location the district authorities had not checked whether the location was suitable and available . As a result , when the applicants agreed to the location , the district authorities had refused to approve it , on the ground that it was unavailable . That refusal had been unlawful . The court ordered that the district administration give the meeting and the march planned by the applicants their approval .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE examined the case on appeal .

The aim of the meeting and march was the same as that of the events in LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to allow the meeting and the march , noting that along the route chosen by the applicants the pavement was narrow and the traffic heavy . The applicants\u2019 march might therefore obstruct traffic and pedestrians and distract drivers , causing accidents . The proposed meeting venue was not suitable either , because a rehearsal for DATE festivities would be taking place there on DATE . There was also a children \u2019s playground nearby . ORG proposed that the applicants should hold the march and the meeting in the village of ORG , in the suburbs of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants replied that the location proposed by ORG was unsuitable because it was located in a remote and sparsely populated village surrounded by a forest , QUANTITY from the city centre .

In particular , the police could have taken measures to control the traffic and thereby prevent road accidents . As to the Youth Day rehearsals , the motorbike parade and the anti - drug campaign , ORG could have proposed another time for the meeting and the march which would not have clashed with those events . The landscaping work had not been scheduled to last DATE , so it would have been possible to organise the meeting after it was finished . The applicants further argued that any assembly in a public place inevitably caused a certain level of disruption to ordinary life . The public authorities and the population had to show a degree of tolerance towards peaceful assemblies in crowded places , because otherwise it would be impossible to hold an assembly at a time and location where it would draw public attention to social or political issues . Lastly , they submitted that the venue proposed by ORG was unsuitable because it was located in a sparsely populated area in the middle of a forest . It was therefore not the right venue to draw the attention of society and the authorities to the violation of homosexuals\u2019 rights , because there would be no representatives of the authorities or the general public present . The applicants also complained of discrimination on account of sexual orientation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Smolnenskiy ORG rejected the ORG complaints . The court held that domestic law did not impose any obligation on the authorities to submit evidence in support of their finding that the location chosen by the organisers was unsuitable . The reasons advanced by the authorities for refusing to approve a location were subjective and therefore not amenable to judicial review . It was significant that ORG had not banned the march and the meeting planned by the applicants . The proposal for a change of location had not breached the applicants\u2019 rights . The applicants\u2019 argument that the venue proposed by ORG was not suitable was unfounded .", "CARDINAL .

The first , third and fourth applicants complained to ORG , claiming that the police had acted unlawfully and violated their freedom of assembly . In particular , the police were not entitled to limit the number of participants at the meeting . The venue near the PERSON monument could easily accommodate CARDINAL people and the town administration had itself previously organised public events there with CARDINAL participants . There was therefore no justification for limiting the number of participants to CARDINAL people . Fencing the area off with metal barriers , blocking it with police buses , diverting the passers - by to other roads , searching the participants and not letting some of them in , had all also been unlawful and unjustified . The security measures taken by the police had made the meeting invisible to the public and thereby deprived it of its purpose . The reference by the police to the risk of terrorist attacks was unsubstantiated . There was no evidence that such a risk was higher on DATE than on DATE . On DATE , for example , just DATE , an official public event had been held near the PERSON monument and the area had not been fenced off .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG complaints . It found that the number of participants had been determined by the applicants themselves and had then been approved by a final judgment . The police had merely enforced that judgment , acting in accordance with the writ of execution . The enclosing of the venue had been justified by security considerations . The court also found that the first and third applicants had no standing to complain to a court , as they had not been parties to the judicial proceedings which had ended with the judgment of DATE and had not been mentioned in the writ of execution . The fact that in the notification of DATE they were listed as organisers of the meeting of CARDINAL DATE was irrelevant .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG rejected the ORG complaints as unsubstantiated .
