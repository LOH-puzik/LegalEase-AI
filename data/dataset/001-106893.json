SWITZERLAND [Extracts]", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 11;Pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Giorgio Malinverni;Guido Raimondi;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as presented by the parties , can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant association was set up in GPE in DATE , under Articles CARDINAL et seq . of ORG . The name \u201c Rhino \u201d was an acronym for CARDINAL different NORP slogans , \u201c PERSON des habitants dans les Immeubles Non Occup\u00e9s \u201d ( Return of residents to vacant buildings ) , and \u201c LOC dans les Immeubles que PERSON \u201d ( \u201c Let \u2019s carry on living in the buildings we occupy \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . According to its constitution , the association pursued the following aims :", "\u201c The aim of the ORG shall be to provide its members with affordable and community - based housing , in accordance with the association - based tenancy system devised by the LAW project . In particular it shall foster management based on economic and ecological solutions .", "The Association shall endeavour to remove any buildings that it occupies from the real - estate market and from speculation .", "The ORG shall also have the aim of promoting voluntary housing schemes ; it shall establish the requisite contacts in order to inform and encourage other association - based projects .", "The Association shall foster the opening and maintaining on its premises of open areas for social or cultural activities . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL of the buildings that it occupied , the association also housed an inexpensive restaurant and occasionally organised various cultural events .", "CARDINAL . DATE most of the flats in the CARDINAL buildings subsequently occupied by the members of the association had remained empty , as their then owners were not intending to rent them out again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL individuals occupied CARDINAL flats in those CARDINAL buildings .", "CARDINAL . Following the occupation of their flats , the owners requested ORG of the GPE of GPE to order the eviction of the squatters , and CARDINAL orders to that effect were issued on DATE . However , the eviction was never carried out , notwithstanding a ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which invited the ORG d\u2019Etat ( cantonal government ) to enforce ORG orders . The cantonal authorities did not act upon that judgment , invoking a local policy of tolerating the presence of unlawful occupiers ( squatters ) provided the owners did not have a building or renovation permit . Confronted with a serious housing shortage in the GPE area , that policy was directed against the practice of owners who left property vacant for speculative gain and police assistance was thus denied when it would result in leaving the property vacant .", "CARDINAL . DATE the owners , who had given up seeking the ORG eviction , entered into various negotiations with the association with a view to selling it their properties . Attempts in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE to negotiate the sale of CARDINAL or CARDINAL buildings , or to agree on a long - term lease , were unsuccessful , as the amount offered by the association was insufficient for the owners .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the owners applied for building permits with a view to renovating the buildings . The applicant association and some of the squatters challenged the applications , but their various cases were declared inadmissible for lack of locus standi . The building permits were thus granted and entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the occupied buildings to be vacated as work was scheduled to begin on DATE . An appeal was lodged against the eviction order . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG for the GPE of GPE took the view , in substance , that the property owners had to bring proceedings as a priority before the civil courts to secure their rights , and that a law - enforcement measure would only be justified if the interests at stake and the seriousness of the damage incurred by them required immediate intervention that was impossible to obtain in a timely manner from the civil courts . The court further took the view that the owners had accepted the situation and had refrained from immediately exercising their right , such that the occupation was no longer causing a breach of public order .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the public - law appeals by the owners and confirmed in substance that the unlawful occupation no longer constituted a breach of public order , on account of the time that had elapsed and the negotiations conducted by the parties , and that the owners had to take their claims to the civil courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in parallel with the eviction proceedings , the owners of the occupied buildings requested ORG of the GPE of GPE to order the dissolution of the applicant association and the assignment of its assets to the ORG , invoking the fact that it pursued an unlawful aim , in the sense that it prevented them from exercising their rights as property owners .", "CARDINAL . ORG , in a judgment of DATE , ordered the ex nunc dissolution of the association .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal , ORG of GPE upheld the dissolution order on DATE but gave it an ex tunc effect , and the association was thus deemed never to have existed . It referred the case back to the court below for the appointment of a liquidator and a public body to receive the association \u2019s assets .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the association lodged a public - law appeal and an ordinary appeal with ORG , primarily seeking the setting - aside of ORG judgment and the dismissal of the dissolution action . On DATE , the owners of the buildings brought claims for possession before ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the decision of the court below by CARDINAL judgments given on DATE . In the judgment on the ordinary appeal , it took the following position on the complaint under LAW :", "\u201c CARDINAL As regards the aims actually pursued , the applicant association refers to the commentary by GPE ( n. CARDINAL on Articles CARDINAL of LAW ) , which provides that in the event of unlawful acts being committed by the decision - making bodies of an association in the pursuit of its lawful aim , it is under LAW , paragraphs CARDINAL , of LAW ( action for damages ) and not under LAW thereof ( dissolution of the association ) that action should in general be taken . The applicant , however , overlooks the fact that the present case precisely does not concern such a situation but rather a situation of compatibility between the acts of the association \u2019s decision - making bodies and its aims ( see the above - cited commentary , p. CARDINAL ) .", "Furthermore , the applicant association claims that the inhabitants have occupied the buildings at issue for a long time as a result of the tolerance of the authorities and the owners and that they should thus be regarded as having a tacitly - granted lease . That argument is , however , contradicted by the observations of ORG , which found , in a manner that binds ORG ( Article CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL ( c ) and Article CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL , of ORG ) , that the members of the applicant association have been occupying the buildings without authorisation and refuse to vacate them , resisting any eviction .", "CARDINAL Similarly , the applicant \u2019s view that the owners should have sought to fulfil their aim by another remedy ( action invoking the constitutional guarantee of the right to property , actions to establish property rights ) is irrelevant , since the dissolution of the applicant association , that is to say the primary occupier of the buildings according to the decision appealed against ( p. CARDINAL , point CARDINAL ) , is in any event a legally admissible means of putting an end to the occupation . The question whether there would be other means apart from that CARDINAL is unimportant in the present case .", "CARDINAL The applicant association further alleges that , in the present case , there has been no breach of an \u2018 LOC right , but possibly of a mere \u2018 subjective\u2019 right . However , it disregards the fact that property is also protected against an occupation such as that in issue here by rules of objective law ( LAW , LAW , Criminal Code , etc . ) . Moreover , the present case can not be compared with that cited by the applicant association \u2013 premises of a club built in breach of an obligation not to erect DATE since that had nothing to do with the aim of the association .", "CARDINAL Referring to PERSON ( PERSON , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , the applicant association further claims that to order the dissolution of an association whose activity is illegal , the illegality has to be permanent . The question whether this criterion is decisive may remain undecided , as in the case of the applicant association it is , in any event , satisfied .", "CARDINAL In this context , the applicant refers to other aims in its constitution and complains about the failure to apply to its case LAW on partial nullity . The question whether that provision ( in combination with LAW ) is in fact applicable to situations under LAW is a matter of debate in legal writings ( answered in the affirmative by GPE , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL I p. CARDINAL n. CARDINAL and PERSON bernois , n. CARDINAL on Articles PERCENT CARDINAL Civil Code ; and in the negative by ORG , PERSON b\u00e2lois , CARDINALrd edition , n. CARDINAL on LAW ; PERSON , ORG II/CARDINAL , CARDINALrd edition , n. CARDINAL ; PERSON , ORG , GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . ORG has settled the matter in the affirmative , at least for other legal entities ( ORG CARDINAL II CARDINAL concerning a foundation and ORG CARDINAL II CARDINAL concerning a cooperative entity ) . The question can , however , remain undecided in the present case . ORG examined this question and arrived at the conclusion that the applicant association \u2019s unlawful aim was predominant in comparison with its other constitutional aims , because the association had been set up above all with that aim in mind . The applicant association has not disputed this , but has merely asserted that its other aims are \u2018 essential\u2019 . Moreover , it does not claim that the conditions of LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW are met , in particular that the association would nevertheless have been constituted without the constitutional clause that is null and void ; it has simply claimed that it \u2018 could continue to operate\u2019 even in the absence of the constitutional aim that has been declared unlawful , but that is not decisive for the purposes of LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW .", "CARDINAL In this context , the applicant association further criticises , referring to GPE ( PERSON bernois , n. CARDINAL on Articles PERCENT CARDINAL Civil Code ) , the order for its dissolution ex tunc . Since it has , for DATE , interacted with other private persons , entered into contracts , conducted negotiations and acted before the courts , only a dissolution ex nunc would be appropriate .", "ORG quite rightly ordered its dissolution ex tunc , as the association has pursued its unlawful aim since its foundation ( see GPE , loc . cit . , n. CARDINAL ) . As to the consequences for the legal relations created in the meantime , it will be for the liquidator to decide .", "CARDINAL . The applicant association has , lastly , invoked a violation of LAW ( freedom of association ) , LAW ( restriction of fundamental rights ) and LAW ( freedom of association ) .", "CARDINAL Since the applicant complains of an improper application of federal law that , it also alleges , has breached one of its rights under the LAW or the LAW , the applicant is in fact invoking , as it has itself observed by referring to PERSON ( ORG civile , vol . DATE , p. CARDINAL n. CARDINAL ) , a violation of federal law . This complaint therefore falls within the context of the ordinary appeal .", "...", "CARDINAL Article CARDINAL ORG secures , in particular , everyone \u2019s right to freedom of assembly and freedom of association ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . The exercise of that right is , however , subject to restrictions , which , being prescribed by law , constitute measures that are necessary , in a NORP society , for national security or public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others ( paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence ) .", "ORG , based on a decisive statutory provision ( LAW ) , ordered the applicant association \u2019s dissolution on account of its unlawful constitutional aim ( breaching , among other things , the guarantee of the right to property under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW ) and on account of its unlawful activity ( occupation of property belonging to third parties ) . Those CARDINAL situations are not covered by the guarantee of the right to freedom of assembly and association ( Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , ORG ) , but fall within the admissible restrictions to that right ( LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , ORG ; see the judgment of ORG DATE in the case of PERSON ( ORG ) and Others against GPE , concerning the dissolution of a political party and the right to freedom of assembly and association ) . The fact that in the case of the dissolution of a political party it was necessary , as the applicant alleged , to adopt particular restraint or lay down strict demands is correct ( see judgment of CARDINAL DATE , cited above ; PERSON , ORG , GPE DATE , n. CARDINAL on Article CARDINAL ORG with references concerning the relationship with freedom of expression under Article CARDINAL ORG ) , but it is not decisive in the present case as the applicant association , in spite of a certain political component in its aim and the implementation thereof , is not a political party and , moreover , there is not a sufficiently close connection with freedom of expression \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the date on which the judgment was served , the Head of ORG of GPE invited the owners to explain the fact that they had not yet made use of their building permits . The owners replied that the work could not be carried out without evicting the squatters , which they had been trying to do for DATE without success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of the ORG ordered the owners to carry out the necessary work to remedy the state of degradation of the buildings and to ensure that they were sufficiently habitable and maintained . The work was to begin within DATE , failing which it would be undertaken by the authorities at the ORG expense . The owners repeated that the work could not be carried out without the buildings being evicted .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of the GPE of GPE appointed a liquidator , who took various measures , in particular the freezing of post - office and bank accounts , the termination of the contract of employment of the association \u2019s secretary and a request for the restitution of fees already paid to the lawyers of the applicant association .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the eviction proceedings were suspended by ORG because the occupiers , acting individually , undertook to recognise the existence of rent - based lease agreements between themselves and the owners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the owners recovered possession of their occupied properties , initiating CARDINAL simultaneous decisions : CARDINAL , an on - the - spot police check of the ORG identity , and the other , an order to begin the renovation work , addressed to the owners , which enabled them to recover possession with police assistance .", "CARDINAL . A number of occupiers appealed against the eviction decision to ORG for construction - related matters . Its decision to declare the appeals inadmissible was upheld by ORG and by ORG in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL of LAW of DATE govern legal entities . The relevant provisions for the present case read as follows :", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The governing bodies express the will of the legal entity .", "They bind the legal entity by their legal decisions and by other relevant actions .", "The governing officers are also personally liable for their wrongful acts . \u201d", "LAW of assets )", "\u201c On dissolution of a legal entity , and unless otherwise provided by law , the constitution , the founding charter or the governing bodies , the assets of a dissolved legal entity pass to the public body ( ORG , GPE , ORG ) to which the entity was affiliated according to its object .", "Such assets must be used as far as possible for their original purpose .", "Where a legal entity is dissolved on account of having an immoral or unlawful object , the assets pass to the public body even where otherwise provided . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
