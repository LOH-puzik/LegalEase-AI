The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in ORG at the GPE FAC in GPE .", "CARDINAL . It is to be noted that in the present case involving , as the applicant \u2019s previous application before the ORG , complaints of secret detention and torture to which the applicant was allegedly subjected during the extraordinary rendition operations by GPE authorities ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) the ORG is deprived of the possibility of obtaining any form of direct account of the events complained of from the applicant ( see PERSON ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "As in GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE and GPE v. GPE ( both cited above ) , in the present case the facts as adduced by the applicant were to a considerable extent a reconstruction of dates and other elements relevant to his rendition , detention and treatment in the GPE authorities\u2019 custody , based on various publicly available sources of information . The applicant \u2019s version of the facts as stated in his initial application of DATE evolved and partly changed during the proceedings before ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "The respondent Government contested the applicant \u2019s version of the facts on all accounts , maintaining that there was no evidence demonstrating that they had occurred in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In consequence , the facts of the case as rendered below ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) are based on the applicant \u2019s account supplemented by various items of evidence in the ORG \u2019s possession .", "CARDINAL . In the application and further written pleadings , the applicant \u2019s lawyers stressed that restrictions on information regarding the entirety of PERSON detention necessarily meant that the case presented a range of complex , unusual and at times unique characteristics that the ORG should be aware of in its consideration . In their view , several factors heightened the already significant challenges related to uncovering and presenting evidence in the case .", "First , the clandestine nature of the rendition operations coupled with a concerted cover - up intended to withhold or destroy any evidence relating to the rendition programme inherently limited the applicant \u2019s ability to produce evidence in his case .", "Second , the lack of any meaningful investigation by the NORP authorities , in whose hands much of the necessary information rested , impeded access to evidence and information .", "Third , they referred to what they called \u201c the unprecedented restrictions on communication \u201d between Mr PERSON , his counsel and the Court , which \u201c precluded the presentation of information or evidence directly from or in relation to the client \u201d . Only the applicant \u2019s GPE counsel with top - secret security clearance could meet with the applicant and all information obtained from him was presumptively classified . In consequence , counsel could not disclose to other members of the legal team or to the ORG any information obtained from the applicant or other classified sources without obtaining the declassification of that information by the GPE authorities .", "According to the applicant \u2019s lawyers , \u201c PERSON [ was ] a man deprived of his voice , barred from communicating with the outside world or with this Court and from presenting evidence in support of his case \u201d . For that reason , his story was therefore to be told and the case was presented on his behalf by reference principally to publicly available documentation ( see also PERSON ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the events preceding the applicant \u2019s secret detention in GPE , i.e. his capture in GPE , GPE on DATE and his initial detention from that date to CARDINAL DATE , in GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE the ORG held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the light of the above first - hand ORG documentary evidence and clear and convincing expert evidence , the ORG finds established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant , following his capture on DATE , was detained in the ORG detention facility in GPE from an unknown date following his capture to DATE , that Mr PERSON was also held in the same facility from DATE to DATE and that they were both moved together to \u2018 another ORG black ORG on DATE ( see also PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 MONEY ) . \u201d", "The experts , Senator PERSON and Mr GPE , heard by ORG at the factfinding hearing in GPE ( PERSON ) v.

NORP The DATE ORG relates the events concerning the applicant \u2019s capture and initial detention as follows :", "\u201c In DATE , NORP government authorities , working with the ORG , captured Qa\u2019ida facilitator PERSON in a raid during which PERSON suffered bullet wounds . At that time , PERSON was assessed by ORG officers in FAC , the office within the ORG with specific responsibility for PERSON , to possess detailed knowledge of NORP terrorist attack plans . However , as is described in greater detail in the full ORG , this assessment significantly overstated PERSON role in GPE and the information he was likely to possess .", "...", "In DATE , anticipating its eventual custody of PERSON , the ORG began considering options for his transfer to ORG custody and detention under the ORG . The ORG rejected GPE military custody [ REDACTED ] in large part because of the lack of security and the fact that PERSON would have to be declared to ORG ( ICRC ) . The ORG \u2019s concerns about custody at FAC , GPE , included the general lack of secrecy and the \u2018 possible loss of control to GPE military and/or FBI\u2019 . ...", "Over the course of DATE , the ORG settled on a detention site in Country [ REDACTED ] because of that country \u2019s [ REDACTED ] and the lack of GPE court jurisdiction . The only disadvantages identified by the ORG with detention in Country [ REDACTED ] were that it would not be a \u2018 ORG - controlled facility\u2019 and that \u2018 diplomatic / policy ORG would be required . As a[t ] DATE , ORG document acknowledged , the proposal to render PERSON to Country [ name REDACTED ] had not yet been broached with that country \u2019s officials . ...", "The decision to detain PERSON at a covert detention facility in Country [ REDACTED ] did not involve the input of ORG , ORG , the GPE ambassador , or the ORG chief of ORG . On DATE , an email from ORG Deputy ORG stated that \u2018 [ w]e will have to acknowledge certain gaps in our planning / preparations , but this is the option the ORG will lead with for ORG . TIME , the president approved moving forward with the plan to transfer PERSON to Country [ REDACTED ] . During the same Presidential Daily Brief ( PDB ) session , Secretary of ORG PERSON suggested exploring the option of putting PERSON on a ship ; however , ORG records do not indicate any further input from the principals . DATE , the CIA Station in Country obtained the approval of Country \u2019s [ REDACTED ] officials for the ORG detention site . ... Shortly thereafter , PERSON was rendered from GPE to Country [ REDACTED ] where he was held at the first ORG detention site , referred to in this summary as \u2018 DETENTION SITE GREEN\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report cited a ORG cable dated DATE relating the applicant \u2019s physical conditions of detention as follows :", "\u201c [ REDACTED ] a cable described PERSON cell as white with no natural lighting or windows , but with CARDINAL halogen lights pointed into the cell . An air conditioner was also in the room . A white curtain separated the interrogation room from the cell . The interrogation cell had CARDINAL padlocks . PERSON was also provided with CARDINAL of CARDINAL chairs that were rotated based on his level of cooperation ( CARDINAL described as more comfortable than the other ) . Security officers wore all black uniforms , including boots , gloves , balaclavas , and goggles to keep PERSON from identifying the officers , as well as to prevent PERSON \u2018 from seeing the security guards as individuals who he may attempt to establish a relationship or dialogue with\u2019 . The security officers communicated by hand signals when they were with PERSON and used hand - cuffs and leg shackles to maintain control . In addition , either loud rock music was played or noise generators were used to enhance PERSON \u2018 sense of ORG . PERSON was typically kept naked and sleep deprived . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report states that on DATE the ORG Headquarters informed the interrogation team at ORG that it had formal approval to apply the EITs , including waterboarding , against PERSON . After PERSON had been held in complete isolation for DATE , the most aggressive interrogation phase began \u201c at TIME \u201d . The report gives the following description of that particular interrogation session :", "\u201c Security personnel entered the cell , shackled and hooded PERSON , and removed his towel ( PERSON was then naked ) . Without asking any questions , the interrogators placed a rolled towel around his neck as a collar , and backed him up into the cell wall ( an interrogator later acknowledged the collar was used to slam PERSON against a concrete wall ) . The interrogators then removed the hood , performed an attention grab , and had PERSON watch while a large confinement box was brought into the cell and laid on the floor . A cable states PERSON \u2018 was unhooded and the large confinement box was carried into the interrogation room and paced [ sic ] on the floor so as to appear as a coffin\u2019 . The interrogators then demanded detailed and verifiable information on terrorist operations planned against GPE , including the names , phone numbers , email addresses , weapon caches , and safe houses of anyone involved . ORG records describe PERSON as appearing apprehensive . Each time PERSON denied having additional information , the interrogators would perform a facial slap or face grab . At TIME , PERSON was waterboarded for the first time . Over a CARDINAL - and - a half - hour period , PERSON coughed , vomited , and had \u2018 involuntary spasms of the torso and extremities\u2019 during waterboarding . Detention site personnel noted that \u2018 throughout the process [ PERSON ] was asked and given the opportunity to respond to questions about threats\u2019 to GPE , but PERSON continued to maintain that he did not have any additional information to provide . \u201d", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the ORG interrogators subjected PERSON to EITs on a near FAC - per - DATE basis .

When PERSON was left alone during this period , he was placed in a stress position , left on the waterboard with a cloth over his face , or locked in CARDINAL of CARDINAL confinement boxes .

Over the course of DATE \u2018 aggressive phase of interrogation\u2019 , PERSON spent a total of TIME ( DATE , TIME ) in the large ( coffin size ) confinement box and TIME in a small confinement box , which had a width of QUANTITY , a depth of QUANTITY , and a height of QUANTITY . The ORG interrogators told PERSON that the only way he would leave the facility was in the coffin - shaped confinement box .", "According to the DATE cables from FAC , PERSON frequently \u2018 cried\u2019 , \u2018 ORG , \u2018 pleaded\u2019 , and \u2018 whimpered\u2019 , but continued to deny that he had any additional information on current threats to , or operatives in , GPE .", "By DATE , DATE of the interrogation period , the interrogation team informed ORG that they had come to the \u2018 collective preliminary assessment\u2019 that it was unlikely PERSON \u2018 had actionable new information about current threats to GPE . On DATE , the interrogation team stated that it was \u2018 highly unlikely\u2019 that PERSON possessed the information they were seeking . ...", "[ REDACTED ] DETENTION SITE GREEN cables describe PERSON as \u2018 compliant\u2019 , informing ORG that when the interrogator \u2018 raised his eyebrow , without instructions\u2019 , PERSON \u2018 slowly walked on his own to the water table and sat down\u2019 . When the interrogator \u2018 snapped his fingers twice\u2019 , PERSON would lie flat on the waterboard . Despite the assessment of personnel at the detention site that PERSON was compliant , ORG stated that they continued to believe that PERSON was withholding threat information and instructed the ORG interrogators to continue using the ORG \u2019s enhanced interrogation techniques .", "[ REDACTED ] At times PERSON was described as \u2018 hysterical\u2019 and \u2018 distressed to the level that he was unable to effectively communicate\u2019 .

The events that took place DATE and DATE at the ORG detention facility code - named \u201c Quartz \u201d and located in GPE correspond to the events that the DATE ORG relates as occurring at \u201c ORG \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ; see also GPE v. GPE , cited above , LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that on DATE he had been transferred from GPE to a ORG detention facility at FAC . In DATE , in anticipation of ORG ruling in PERSON v. PERSON granting ORG detainees the right to legal counsel and habeas corpus review of their detention in a GPE federal court ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) , he had again been secretly transferred , this time to a facility in GPE , where he had been detained incommunicado for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In that regard , he relied on a DATE report by ORG stating that \u201c according to CARDINAL former GPE intelligence officials \u201d PERSON had been held in \u201c a secret prison in GPE \u201d . Another press report indicated that his detention in GPE had followed his detention in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of their investigations , research and various material in the public domain , the experts heard by ORG at the fact - finding hearing reconstructed the chronology of the applicant \u2019s transfers and identified the countries of his secret detention in the period from DATE to CARDINAL - CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the material in the ORG \u2019s possession the chronology of the applicant \u2019s detention can be described as follows .", "CARDINAL . In GPE ( PERSON ) the Court , in its findings as to the applicant \u2019s transfer out of GPE considered , among other things , the collation of data from multiple sources , including flight plan messages concerning the NCARDINALP flight circuit executed through GPE on DATE ( see PERSON ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Those data showed that NCARDINALP had travelled the following routes :", "Take - off Destination Date of flight", "CARDINAL . As noted above , the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s allegations as being unsupported by any evidence and , consequently , lacking any factual basis . They also challenged the credibility of the evidence relied on by the applicant and denied that GPE had any knowledge of , or complicity in , the operation of the ORG HVD Programme on its territory at the material time ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "The Government \u2019s conclusions on the facts and evidence were as follows .", "CARDINAL . The Government contested the evidential value of the material produced by the applicant . They stressed that most of that material had originated in various public sources whose credibility had not been verifiable . The Government would not play down the significance of publicly available information about the ORG \u2019s ORG ; indeed , in the ORG case ( cited above ) similar material on public record had been taken into account by the ORG .", "However , in contrast to the present case , that material had constituted merely a supplementary source for the ORG \u2019s findings . In ORG had relied first of all on the applicant \u2019s description of the circumstances , which had been very detailed and , secondly , on indirect evidence obtained during the international inquiries and the investigation in GPE . ORG had had at its disposal scientific evidence , such as a test of the applicant \u2019s hair follicles , geological records confirming the applicant \u2019s recollection or sketches of the layout of the prison in GPE that the applicant had drawn . Only in addition had the ORG relied on the material available in the public domain . In the present case , the applicant had built his case the other way round , starting from publicly available information and , in fact , also finishing with it as he had been unable to produce any other evidence .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s reliance on the case of ORG v. ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the Government saw little , if any , connection with his alleged detention in GPE . The case had concerned a commercial dispute between CARDINAL aviation companies , where the plaintiff , ORG , had submitted an invoice to ORG demanding payment for unused flight time for DATE between DATE and DATE . It did not appear that the companies had exclusively carried out rendition flights . The aircraft mentioned in the case - file differed from those appearing in the present case . The events that had given rise to the litigation had occurred prior to the flights to GPE , before DATE . Even if the witnesses in the PERSON case had given some fragmentary testimony to the effect that the flights contracted by ORG through the companies at the material time ( from DATE to DATE ) and performed by the Gulfstream IV aircraft could be used sometimes for the purposes of the rendition programme , this had nothing to do with the flights to and from GPE allegedly used for the applicant \u2019s rendition .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not dispute the fact that during the relevant period , as well as earlier , there had been a number of ORG - linked aircraft landings in GPE at Palanga and GPE airports . The circumstances relating to those landings had been thoroughly analysed in the course of the pre - trial investigation and no links between the impugned aircraft and the ORG rendition programme had been established . In particular , all persons who had been present at the time of arrivals or departures of the planes , including the airports\u2019 employees , officers of the ORG and the ORG had been questioned and all relevant documents had been obtained from the ORG . From the totality of that material the prosecutor had concluded that no detained persons had ever been brought into or taken from the territory of GPE . Furthermore , no link had been found between the flights in question and any detainees of the ORG in general and the Projects No . CARDINAL or No . CARDINAL in particular . The prosecuting authorities had established that despite the fact that on some occasions ORG and ORG inspections had not been carried out , it appeared from the documents provided by the ORG that in all instances the ORG officers had had access to the aircraft in accordance with ORG . It had also been established that the ORG officers , who had sought and obtained uninterrupted access to the airports\u2019 sectors at which the ORG aircraft had landed , had acted in a lawful manner and had not abused their office or exceeded the limits of their authority .", "CARDINAL . As regards the flights NCARDINALWH of CARDINAL DATE and ORG indicated by the applicant as those on which he had been brought into and taken out of GPE , the prosecution having investigated in detail both flights had established beyond any reasonable doubt that no ORG detainee ( including the applicant ) had been transported on them . The same applied to any other ORG - linked flights landings during the period in question .", "The evidence collected in the investigation had revealed the true purpose of the NCARDINALWH \u2019s and ORG \u2019s landings . In that connection , QUANTITY witnesses had been questioned and abundant documentary evidence had been obtained .", "CARDINAL . It had been established that the NCARDINALWH flight of CARDINAL DATE had arrived with , in the ORG \u2019s words , \u201c CARDINAL foreign citizens of CARDINAL ORG \u201d and CARDINAL crew members . Needless to say , the ORG added , the applicant had not been among them . All of them had gone through a State border control for passengers DATE and again TIME . Then the plane had left for GPE . The purpose of the landing had been a carriage of some specific cargo , which explained why the vehicle had been seen next to the plane and then leaving . The carriage of the cargo had been related to the activities of the ORG , and the nature of the activities explained why the ORG had asked to be provided with access to the plane .", "Likewise , the ORG flight of DATE had brought cargo into GPE and had not been involved in the transportation of the ORG detainees .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding the fact that there was no data in the pre - trial investigation as to the purpose of the cargo , on the basis of the whole body of material collected it might be concluded that \u201c some specific cargo \u201d could have been communications equipment necessary for the technical maintenance of the implementation of a joint project of the ORG and the partners . Due to the particular importance of certain cargo , the ORG would request direct access to planes . For this purpose , as confirmed by witnesses M , O and N , classified letters used to be written to the airport and the ORG .", "As regards the flight NCARDINALWH on DATE it might be concluded that CARDINAL persons , GPE citizens , had arrived at Palanga airport . As regards the cargo on the flight LOC DATE , it might be concluded that some equipment could have been carried on the flight at issue . It had been packed in boxes of not QUANTITY in length , which , as V confirmed , had been carried by CARDINAL persons . There was a record in the investigation file showing that the cargo could have been exported by the flight on DATE , as confirmed by officer O. According to the testimony of the witnesses , it might be concluded that the vehicles of partners used to enter and leave the airports escorted by the ORG officers . The officers used to escort them to the plane ; officer V had stated that he had been QUANTITY away from the plane .", "The investigation file included the ORG \u2019s requests submitted in respect of both flights ; both of them had been duly reasoned and indicated the purpose of the flights , which constituted a ORG secret . No customs control had been performed in either case , not because of the ORG \u2019s requests but due to legal regulations under which it had not been obligatory and could be performed on an occasional basis .", "CARDINAL . The ORG had asked the administration of the airport in both instances to allow their officials to access the airport in order to carry consignments and parcels from the airport to their final destination and nothing else . The ORG had never asked for a customs or State border control not to be carried out . It had not interfered in any way with the functions of ORG . According to testimonies of many ORG officials , these CARDINAL flights had not been exceptional and they were not the only ones where the ORG had asked for permission to have access to certain aircraft . In general , over DATE there had been an enormous number of flights of various ORG with military , official and non - official delegations . According to the testimony of the director of ORG , ORG had mostly been used for those landings since it received less flights than FAC .", "CARDINAL . All the ORG officials involved in the reception and transport of the cargo had been questioned by the prosecutors in that connection and had described in detail what the cargo looked like , where it had been transported , whether anyone else had been able to see it and why special supervision of the ORG had been needed . All of them had testified that it had been only boxes which had been unloaded first from the aircraft and then other boxes and some parcels which had been loaded into the aircraft . There had been many of them , all of the same size , definitely too small to place any person inside . The loading itself had been carried out openly and could be seen by the employees of the airport . The boxes brought by the aircraft had been carried by the ORG officials to ORG , but not to Project No . CARDINAL or Project No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . At the public hearing , answering the judges\u2019 questions as to the nature of the cargo , the ORG further explained that the cargo had contained \u201c special equipment that had been meant for a special investigation department DATE and that the purpose had been \u201c to equip this department and its personnel \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government maintained that the pre - trial investigation had established conclusively that no secret prison run by the ORG had existed in GPE .", "In particular , the applicant \u2019s allegation that a ORG secret detention facility had operated on the premises of ORG . CARDINAL and that ORG . CARDINAL had been designated for that purpose but not used as such had lacked any factual basis .", "CARDINAL . It was true that ORG . CARDINAL , which had been carried out in DATE by the ORG and the ORG and ORG , which had been implemented by the same partners in DATE , had involved the reconstruction and fitting - out of certain LOC . However , evidence gathered by the prosecutor had conclusively excluded the possibility of either of these LOC having been used as a prison for ORG detainees .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the pre - trial investigation numerous persons had been questioned \u2013 not only those who had participated directly in the construction works on ORG . CARDINAL , but also those responsible for its subsequent use .", "Having analysed all relevant evidence , the prosecutor \u2013 contrary to the statement made by the CNSD that \u201c conditions [ had been ] created for holding detainees \u201d \u2013 had concluded that this building had been used exclusively by the ORG officers and that it had been absolutely unsuitable for holding detainees due to its geographical location ( the city centre ) and the facilities on the LOC .", "In that regard , the ORG also underlined that the CNSD Findings had to be seen in the light of its competence and the nature of parliamentary inquiries performed by it . According to ORG ruling of CARDINAL DATE , \u201c the LAW [ was ] neither an institution of pre - trial investigation , nor a prosecutor \u2019s office , nor the court \u201d and therefore its conclusions were not \u201c binding on institutions of pre - trial investigation , the prosecutor \u2019s office or the court \u201d ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The LOC referred to as ORG . CARDINAL were situated in an auxiliary building in the yard next to the main building at FAC in GPE where the LOC of the ORG had been located at the material time . In DATE the auxiliary building had been in an emergency condition , and repair works had been needed . As all repair works had been documented , the documentation had been received and analysed by the prosecutor . The builders had confirmed that no wishes had been expressed by the ORG officers that the work be related to the detention of any persons .", "CARDINAL of the witnesses , who , at the relevant time , had been in charge of the administration of both Projects No . CARDINAL and No . CARDINAL , had described the purpose of the LOC in the building referred to as ORG . CARDINAL at PERSON for which they had been fitted out , though he had testified that the premises had never been used since DATE for that particular purpose . This purpose had been closely related with the structure and functions performed by the ORG , which in themselves constituted a ORG secret and therefore could not be declassified . Those statements had been corroborated by many other lower ORG officials and technical workers , who had testified that the LOC had never been used for any other purposes that were not related to the needs of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . As regards Project No . CARDINAL , ORG , based on witness testimony , had established that no special facilities suitable for holding detainees had ever been installed inside the building . In particular , there had been no premises fitted with bars or otherwise specifically adapted for detention purposes . Also , it had been established that access had been permanently controlled and the persons in charge of the building \u2019s security had confirmed that no detainees had ever been present there . Thus , having regard to all the relevant evidence , the prosecution , contrary to the CNSD \u2019s findings that the ORG officers had not always had the possibility of monitoring the arrival and departure of persons at ORG . CARDINAL , concluded that access to Project No . CARDINAL had been under permanent control , thus ruling out the possibility of bringing detainees into the building .", "CARDINAL . Project No . CARDINAL was located in GPE . The building had been acquired for the needs of the ORG in accordance with the requirements of national law and the repair work on the LOC had started in DATE . The work had been finished in DATE . All the ORG officials involved in this project ( Director General , Deputy Director General and other ORG officials of lower rank ) , had been questioned by the prosecutors . They had testified that the purpose of the LOC in question could not have \u2013 and in fact had not had \u2013 anything to do with the detention of any persons . All witnesses had spoken of classrooms , living and meeting rooms , as well as sports rooms . The ORG officials of lower rank had been in charge of the repair work on the LOC and the security of the building after its completion . Having been questioned several times , they had confirmed that no facilities suitable for holding detainees had ever been fitted in the building . The building had never been left without supervision of the ORG officials , who had testified that there had been no secret or closed zones inside it which would not be accessible to them . Also , in the ORG \u2019s view , the geographical location of the building had made it totally unsuitable for detention as it was situated in the village of ORG and surrounded by residential houses .", "CARDINAL . According to the Director General of the ORG at the relevant time , the building had been used at DATE to a very limited extent \u2013 several meetings took place there . As the ORG officials in charge of the building \u2019s security had testified , it had been used randomly and only for short - term meetings in which the ORG officials and their guests had participated . The visitors had been driven there exclusively by the authorised ORG officials . Thus , contrary to the findings of the CNSD , it had not been possible for any other persons save the ORG officials to use the building at their discretion . In DATE the surveillance of the building had been taken over by the ORG \u2019s section . At that time it had temporarily not been used at all but had remained open to the ORG employees . Since DATE the SSD training centre had occupied the building .", "CARDINAL . All documents related to the Projects No . CARDINAL and No . CARDINAL had been collected from the ORG , including material containing ORG secrets . Part of those documents , for instance the records of the on - site inspection of Projects No . CARDINAL and No . CARDINAL together with annexes comprising the photos of the buildings , LOC and their surroundings , had been declassified and submitted to ORG . The materials clearly showed that no prison could have been hosted on those LOC .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the prosecutor had found that both LOC had , at the relevant time , served other purposes , which had in no way been related to the holding or confinement of persons , although those purposes could not be declassified for the simple reason that the ORG \u2019s partner would have to consent to such disclosure .", "CARDINAL . At the public hearing , the ORG reiterated the above statements . They added that after analysing all the relevant circumstances it had been established that the flight NCARDINALWH on DATE and the flight GPE on DATE had been used for transporting a specialpurpose cargo and that cargo could not contain the applicant or any other person . It had been the connection equipment for the ORG providing them and their partners with technical services in order to implement their joint project . That explained why they had asked for direct access to the aircraft .", "As regards the alleged locations of the ORG prison , ORG . CARDINAL had been used for operational activities , ORG . CARDINAL had been used for intelligence activities . The facilities of Project No . CARDINAL had never been used for their original purpose and they had later been reconverted and used as the ORG \u2019s training centre .", "Replying to the judges\u2019 questions as to why the DATE SSD Resolution and DATE SSD Action Plan referring to the purpose of the premises to be selected had spoken of the \u201c extradition of secret intelligence collaborators \u201d , the ORG explained that this was due to the terminology used at that time DATE at present that term would correspond to \u201c exfiltration \u201d or \u201c extraction \u201d , meaning the relocation of special agents or secret agents into their normal life or natural environment .", "The added that , as regards the purposes served by the facilities , ORG . CARDINAL had been meant for special officers and their \u201c extraction \u201d , while ORG . CARDINAL had been the support centre for intelligence .", "CARDINAL . The Government argued that there had been no credible evidence confirming the applicant \u2019s presence on the territory of GPE . The present case was built on some leaked information which had appeared in media in DATE and which referred to the alleged existence of ORG secret detention facilities in GPE . That information had never been confirmed officially , either directly or indirectly .", "Moreover , the applicant \u2019s lawyers had referred to unknown \u201c public sources \u201d indicating that the applicant had been moved from GPE to GPE in DATE , that the NORP prison site had been closed in DATE and that its occupants had been transferred to GPE or other countries . In essence , the entire case rested on the routes of certain flights and their alleged links with the ORG . The applicant had described in detail the routes of NCARDINALWH on DATE and GPE on DATE , highlighting the stopovers of the first aircraft in GPE and the second one in GPE . He also referred to some invoices and contracts regarding those flights which , in his view , indicated their links with the ORG and the extraordinary rendition programme . Not a single direct or indirect piece of evidence had ever been produced that would reveal the slightest connection between the applicant and the flights in question .", "The Government said that in this regard they would appeal to pure common sense \u2013 the routes of the flights demonstrated nothing more than the fact that the aircraft had landed for a short while in GPE . Even if their links with the ORG were confirmed , this did not prove by itself GPE \u2019s involvement in the ORG , still less the applicant \u2019s secret detention on its territory .", "CARDINAL . The Government regretted the suffering sustained by the persons , including the applicant , detained under that programme . However , they could not but emphasise that while this might have occurred somewhere in LOC , it had not happened in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s submission , not a single high - level ORG politician or official had in any way admitted to knowing of or agreeing to the involvement of GPE in the ORG extraordinary rendition programme . It was true that the ORG officials had given some consideration to the possibility of having requests for assistance from the GPE authorities in the context of the war on terror but this possibility had proved to be purely theoretical because there had been no requests for the detention of any individuals .", "In that regard , the Government referred to the statements of the ORG officials and the ORG officers who had been questioned in the pre - trial investigation . They also relied on the letter of CARDINAL DATE written by PERSON , the former President of GPE , to the CNSD in which he had stated that he had never been informed of any ORG prisons in the country ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Nor had any other former President of the Republic had had any such knowledge . In the investigation the Heads of State had testified that they had not known about any transfer of any detainees and had not given their consent to the transportation of any persons held by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government said that they agreed with the ORG \u2019s conclusions in GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE that without the knowledge of the ORG authorities and their assistance , the ORG could not have been executed , and that the running of the ORG prisons would have been impossible in the countries concerned . However , as stated above , GPE had not had any knowledge of such activities on its territory . The fact that in DATE , as the applicant argued , there had been generalised knowledge of the ORG owing to findings of international inquiries and public reports disclosing the nature of the ORG secret scheme , was irrelevant since GPE had not been included in any of the inquiries and there had been no ORG prison in the country .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that the whole body of evidence from numerous sources , such as the international inquiries , recent research into the ORG rendition and secret detention operations , abundant aviation data confirming the ORG planes landings in GPE , declassified ORG documents , the DATE ORG and evidence from the experts heard by the ORG conclusively confirmed his allegations .", "In his submission , it was established beyond reasonable doubt that a ORG secret detention facility \u2013 referred to as \u201c Detention Site Violet \u201d in the DATE ORG \u2013 had operated in GPE in DATE and that he had been detained at that facility from CARDINAL or DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant said that the Government \u2019s objection to his reliance on public documents , reports and other material as evidence in this case was unfounded . ORG had on a number of occasions stated that it would freely evaluate all the evidence , and might draw \u201c such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions \u201d . The ORG routinely relied on public source evidence ; this was demonstrated , for instance , in GPE where the ORG had taken into account publicly available information of a similar nature and evidence from a range of other sources , including reports from ORG , ORG and the ICRC . It had also cited numerous media reports .", "Consequently , the ORG \u2019s objections to the nature of the evidence in the case was not based on the ORG \u2019s established approach to evidence . The ORG would take into account all available sources of evidence and determine whether , in the circumstances of cases such as this , taken together they were sufficient to give rise to \u201c strong and concordant inferences \u201d of ORG responsibility . In the applicant \u2019s view , the range of evidence submitted in his case considered as a whole more than satisfied the relevant test .", "CARDINAL . The applicant considered that the ORG \u2019s suggestion that the flights referenced in his submissions as being ORG rendition flights , even if chartered by the ORG , could have had other purposes or simply stopped at some places for technical reasons , lacked any support in the facts .", "While apparently plausible , this assertion had no merit in the context of the assembled data presented as evidence to the ORG . A large number of international and regional bodies , human rights organisations and respected and credible media outlets , which had acknowledged the evidence disclosing that rendition flights flew into and out of GPE , disagreed . For example , on DATE ORG , following its DATE visit to GPE , had issued a resolution noting \u201c new evidence provided by the ORG data showing that plane PERSON , alleged to have transported PERSON , [ had ] stop[ped ] in GPE on DATE on its way to GPE and GPE \u201d . It had also noted that analysis of the ORG data had revealed new information through flight plans connecting GPE to GPE , via a plane switch in GPE , GPE , on DATE , and GPE to GPE , via GPE , GPE , on DATE . This was mirrored in the findings and reports of other international organisations .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the accumulated material before the ORG it was evident that the planes passing through GPE in DATE had been chartered by ORG in the context and for the purpose of the rendition programme . A clear line of evidence connected these flights to GPE .", "To begin with , all the flights involved in rendition into and out of GPE had been chartered by a GPE company , ORG on behalf of ORG . This prime contract originated in DATE with another GPE company , ORG and ORG ( ORG ) , and was then inherited by ORG through its purchase of ORG in DATE . ORG initial contract with ORG had given rise to a succession of subcontracts , including the agreement with ORG of DATE and a similar agreement between ORG as authorised agent for ORG and plane operator ORG on DATE .", "These companies , along with various other plane operators including ORG ( operating NCARDINALWH ) and ORG ( operating GPE and GPE ) , had thereby established a method and pattern of doing business which had lasted DATE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE flights of GPE and ORG , travelling from the GPE to GPE via GPE , had been arranged under ORG \u2019s subcontract with ORG trading as ORG . These flights corresponded to the dates on which information indicated that the applicant had been transferred from GPE to GPE in DATE . The DATE flights of GPE and GPE had also been arranged under ORG \u2019s successor subcontract with ORG .", "Flights organised and billed by ORG and ORG had been the subject of civil litigation in GPE , concluding in DATE , between PERSON and ORG . During this litigation , both parties had made clear that the flights had been part of the rendition programme and that the contractual arrangements under which these flights were provided had been set up to facilitate that programme .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , all the flights connecting with GPE in DATE , as well as flight NCARDINALWH in DATE , exhibited a common pattern of behaviour designed for the sole purpose of disguising the true flight routes , the so - called \u201c dummy \u201d flight planning .", "Taking into account , on a cumulative basis , all the available evidence such as the contracts and invoices , the patterns of behaviour , the statements made in the litigation referred to above , the timing of the flights , and the overall context within which rendition flights had been shown to take place , there was a compelling basis on which to conclude that the sole purpose of the flights of NCARDINALWH , ORG , GPE and GPE had been to interconnect the ORG \u2019s various secret prison locations . In addition , these interconnections had been made at times when , according to authoritative news reports , prisoner transfers had been made between the respective countries .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , even if CARDINAL were to leave aside the entire significance of the above evidence , in the applicant \u2019s view a number of questions would remain . For instance , why , if these had been entirely innocent or \u201c technical \u201d stopovers had the ORG been prevented from inspecting the planes ? Why had the planes been cordoned off by the ORG ? Why had a vehicle been seen leaving one of the planes , and the airport , if this had merely been a \u201c technical \u201d stop ?", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s submission , the evidence before the ORG established beyond reasonable doubt , based on strong and concordant inferences of fact , that GPE had housed a ORG secret black - site , a site at which the applicant had been detained DATE and DATE . The DATE ORG had referred to a detention site codenamed \u201c PERSON \u201d , which multiple independent investigators had consistently and unequivocally identified as referring to GPE , as confirmed by the experts at the fact - finding hearing .", "The DATE ORG stated that ORG had specifically been developed to ensure that multiple detainees could be interrogated simultaneously , that the site had begun operating as a detention centre in DATE and that it had been closed down in DATE due to the lack of medical care for ailing detainees . The report \u2019s categorical findings corresponded to and confirmed the credibility of a host of other evidence available at a much earlier stage . This included flight data and contracts , information collected by ORG own ORG , the NORP prosecutor \u2019s own investigation file , the statements and findings of multiple additional inquiries at the regional and international level and the work of nongovernmental organisations , journalists and investigators .", "CARDINAL . At the fact - finding hearing ORG had heard evidence from the experts of the highest calibre who , having investigated and analysed the ORG HVD Programme for DATE , had confirmed that , consistent with a cyclical pattern of sudden site closures , GPE had undoubtedly set up a secret detention site in DATE following the closure of the site in GPE .", "GPE had become , as Mr GPE had described it , the hub for detention of high - value detainees at that point . It had been the experts\u2019 firm and consistent professional assessments as investigators , that the evidence had showed that PERSON had been among those detained in GPE . Senator PERSON had noted that if one had taken the trouble to reconstruct the story , one could only come to that conclusion . Mr GPE \u2019s work had definitively associated PERSON with GPE and Mr Black had found that the detention of PERSON in GPE had been beyond reasonable doubt .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL aspect of the evidence before the Court , considered in detail by the experts , included evidence from multiple sources that showed the landing of rendition flights in GPE on CARDINAL and DATE , having followed a circuitous route , from GPE via GPE , where the applicant was known to have been detained at the relevant time . Likewise it showed that on DATE another rendition flight departed from GPE , en route to GPE , where again it was known that the applicant had been detained in DATE . False flight plans had been filed for the NORP leg of these journeys , showing alternative destinations in accordance with standard modus operandi for rendition flights .", "The Government had argued that there was no evidence that these had been rendition flights . Yet the pattern these flights displayed , the paths they had taken , and the contracts and invoices , combined with other corresponding details , had led to them being consistently identified by investigators , parliamentary and other inquiries , and by the experts of the ORG , unequivocally as flights whose sole purpose had been extraordinary rendition . If any doubt remained about whether these had been rendition flights , it had been dispelled in the above - mentioned civil litigation between sub - contractors in GPE courts where the flight operators had themselves stated , in their pleadings , in clear and explicit terms that this contract had been for rendition flights carried out for ORG .", "CARDINAL . The dates and routes of these rendition flights and the periods of operation of Detention Site Violet corresponded with the conclusive evidence of the applicant \u2019s location prior to and after GPE . As the Court noted in GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , the applicant , after being captured in GPE , had been transferred to secret ORG detention in GPE , from there to GPE , and then on to a secret ORG site in LOC . Expert testimony had confirmed earlier reports that in DATE he had been moved out of LOC in anticipation of the NORP ORG ruling granting access to lawyers and habeas corpus review DATE and he had been transferred to GPE . As the experts had explained , the NORP site had closed in DATE , prompting the opening of the next site in the cycle , GPE , precisely when rendition flights had flown the route from GPE to GPE . In DATE , the NORP site itself had closed , prompting the transfer of the applicant , like all of the remaining ORG detainees , to GPE . It was from GPE that he had ultimately been transferred back to LOC in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the Government \u2019s explanations as to the \u201c special cargo \u201d and the purposes served by ORG . CARDINAL given at the public hearing , the applicant said these facts were entirely consistent with his statements and did not really provide any information that would counter his case . In particular , the transportation of the \u201c cargo \u201d was fully consistent with the expert testimony given by PERSON in GPE ( PERSON ) , stating that the high - value detainees had been treated as human cargo and that when they had been brought into a country they had not been registered \u2013 even if the passengers on the plane had been registered . Likewise , the Government \u2019s claim that ORG . CARDINAL had been for a special intelligence purpose was entirely consistent with the purpose of ORG and the applicant \u2019s submissions in that respect .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the applicant contended that multiple strands of corroborating evidence considered together , supportive of the first DATE media accounts citing ORG insiders , led to the irresistible conclusion that , as confirmed by the experts , GPE had hosted ORG . It had been set up by the NORP authorities and had been operated with their assistance by the ORG and the applicant had been detained at that site CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that multiple sources , including the DATE ORG , the CNSD Findings and press reports , mentioned high - level members of the ORG and intelligence agencies as having approved the establishment of the ORG sites . The DATE ORG made it clear that MONEY had been covertly transferred to show appreciation for the country \u2019s support for the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the applicant emphasised , for ORG responsibility to be engaged under the Convention it was not necessary for the highest level official of a ORG to have known and approved the setting up of the ORG secret \u201c black site \u201d in the country . It was sufficient for the relevant officials within the ORG to have approved and to have been responsible . In the applicant \u2019s view , there was compelling evidence that ORG had actively undertaken to facilitate and make possible his rendition to , and secret detention in , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant reiterated that there had been no plausible room for doubt as to GPE \u2019s knowledge of the nature of the secret detention system in DATE and DATE . This had been clear from the vast publicly available information , including extensive media coverage which had reverberated around the globe , including in GPE , detailing the secret detention programme , specifically identifying NORP \u201c black sites \u201d , the nature of the enhanced interrogation techniques , and identifying PERSON by name as one the missing \u201c ghost prisoners \u201d . ORG was already underway when the applicant had been detained in GPE . To suggest innocent ignorance on the part of the authorities as to what might have been going on in the secret site that they set up for the ORG by DATE simply beggared belief .", "CARDINAL . In addition , evidence showed that high - level officials had had specific and direct knowledge . For example , the former President had publicly admitted having been asked by the head of intelligence whether he would be willing to bring accused terrorists into the country unofficially . The head of intelligence in response had noted that he had enquired as to the President \u2019s position precisely on the basis that he had known what had been going on in the world .", "In another example , also from DATE , while the applicant was still detained in GPE , ORG attended a ORG meeting with PERSON ; PERSON testimony set out in GPE ( PERSON ) made it clear that all member States had known about the enhanced interrogation techniques . That had been clear from the records of the meeting .", "CARDINAL . As experts had testified , while not everyone would have known , just as in all other host countries , some certainly had known and had approved . It was beyond reasonable doubt that by DATE GPE had known of the real risk of violations on its territory and evidence demonstrated that the authorities had taken no measures to prevent , to monitor or even to enquire . The parliamentary inquiry concluded that it had been evident that the ORG had not sought to control the ORG \u2019s activities in the country and the premises placed at their disposal . It had not monitored or recorded cargoes brought in and out of the country , and it had not controlled the ORG \u2019s arrival and departure . This lack of oversight was confirmed by the prosecution file . The NORP authorities had not only failed to exercise due diligence to prevent violations but they had actively intervened to support and enable them . As the evidence showed , again including evidence from the prosecution file , the NORP officials had agreed to , purchased and helped to equip the ORG \u2019s secret sites . The NORP officials had provided vital logistics and support for the site , keeping local inquiries at bay . The NORP authorities had intervened to ensure that normal oversight of ORG flights had been lifted by the use of classified letters that had ensured that neither planes , nor passengers , nor cargo had been monitored or inspected . This had been true specifically of the rendition flights identified by the experts as bringing the ORG detainees into the country and taking them out again .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the knowledge of the GPE authorities\u2019 practices in respect of suspected terrorists attributable to any ORG to the Convention at the material time , AI / ICJ pointed to , among other things , the following facts that had been a matter of public knowledge .", "CARDINAL . They stressed at the outset that already on DATE , in an interview , the GPE Vice President PERSON had said that , in response to the attacks of DATE , the GPE intelligence agencies would operate on \u201c the dark side \u201d , and had agreed that GPE restrictions on working with \u201c those who [ had ] violated human rights \u201d would need to be lifted .", "AI warned in DATE that the GPE might exploit its existing rendition policy in the context of what it was calling the \u201c war on terror \u201d to avoid human rights protections . From DATE it became clear that ORG nationals outside the GPE suspected of involvement in international terrorism were at a real risk of secret transfer and arbitrary detention by GPE forces .", "CARDINAL . In that regard , AI / ICJ submitted that from DATE to DATE the GPE had transferred CARDINAL foreign nationals to FAC in LOC , GPE , with reports from the outset of ill - treatment during transfers , holding them without charge or trial or access to the courts , lawyers or relatives . By DATE , there were CARDINAL men held there .", "Cases of arbitrary detention and secret transfer continued to emerge during DATE . In DATE , alongside the case of PERSON , arrested in GPE and whose whereabouts after transfer to GPE custody remained unknown AI reported that \u201c the GPE authorities had transferred CARDINAL of people to countries where they [ might ] be subjected to interrogation tactics -including torture [ ... ] . In some cases , it [ was ] alleged that GPE intelligence agents [ had ] remained closely involved in the interrogation \u201d .", "Also , in DATE , ORG reported on a secret ORG facility at GPE , GPE , and the ORG \u2019s use of \u201c stress and duress \u201d techniques , including sleep deprivation , stress positions and hooding , and the use of renditions by the ORG . Thus , as early as DATE , any ORG was or should have been aware that there was substantial credible information in the public domain that the GPE was engaging in practices of enforced disappearance , arbitrary detention , secret detainee transfers , and torture or other ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE information continued to emerge . In DATE , for example , ORG reported that the ORG had been involved in the arrest in GPE of CARDINAL men and their rendition out of that country to an undisclosed location . In DATE , ORG reported that NORP national ORG , also known as NORP , was being interrogated in GPE custody in incommunicado detention at an undisclosed location after his arrest in GPE .", "In DATE , the ICRC issued a press release stating that \u201c [ PERSON and FAC , the ICRC [ was ] increasingly concerned about the fate of an unknown number of people captured as part of the socalled global war on terror and held in undisclosed locations \u201d . Furthermore , a DATE confidential report of the ICRC on Coalition abuses in GPE , leaked in DATE and published in the media at that time , found that detainees labelled by the GPE as \u201c high - value \u201d were at particular risk of torture and other ill - treatment and that \u201c high value detainees \u201d had been held for DATE in a facility at FAC in conditions that violated international law .", "In DATE , AI publicly denounced as torture the interrogation technique known as \u201c waterboarding \u201d reportedly used against PERSON , a \u201c high - value detainee \u201d who had by then been held in secret GPE detention for DATE following his arrest in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , ORG published a leaked DATE memorandum written in ORG . The memo advised , inter alia , that presidential powers or the doctrines of necessity or self - defence could override the criminal liability for torture under GPE law , and that a \u201c significant range of acts \u201d would not be punishable as they did not amount to torture . Another government memorandum leaked in DATE asserted that not applying LAW to \u201c captured terrorists and their sponsors \u201d would reduce the threat of domestic prosecution of GPE interrogators for war crimes .", "In DATE , a DATE memorandum signed by the GPE Secretary of ORG was declassified . It had authorized \u201c counterresistance \u201d techniques for use at ORG , including stress positions , sleep deprivation , sensory deprivation , stripping , hooding , exploitation of phobias , and prolonged isolation . A DATE ORG report on \u201c detainee interrogations in the global war on terrorism \u201d , declassified and published in DATE after an earlier draft of it was leaked , recommended the use of various techniques , including environmental manipulation , threat of rendition , isolation , sleep deprivation , removal of clothing , exploitation of phobias , prolonged standing , and hooding .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , AI published a CARDINAL-page report on GPE human rights violations in the \u201c war on terror \u201d , including case details of secret transfers of detainees , the alleged existence of secret GPE detention facilities , and torture and other ill - treatment . The numerous rendition cases listed included detailed allegations made by PERSON .", "In addition , in its DATE reports covering DATE , ORG made multiple references to human rights violations in the context of GPE counterterrorism operations , not only in the entries on the GPE , but also in a number of other country entries . Paper copies of these reports were widely distributed , including to media and governments . For example , copies of the reports were mailed at the time of their publication directly to the President , the Prime Minister , the Minister of the ORG and the Minister of ORG in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the AI / ICJ \u2019s submission , by DATE it was beyond reasonable doubt that the GPE was engaging in human rights violations against detainees , including holding individuals in secret custody at undisclosed locations , and that detainees labelled \u201c high - value \u201d were at particular risk as the GPE pursued intelligence on ORG and associated groups .", "Consequently , by DATE , any ORG agreeing to host a ORG \u201c black site \u201d on its territory would or should have known that such a site would be part of a programme that involved unlawful transfer , enforced disappearance , and torture or other ill- treatment . Further , any ORG would or should have known that any GPE assurances that a detainee previously subjected to the GPE programme would be treated in a manner consistent with international law , in the case of further transfer , lacked credibility . Any ORG would or should have known that even if not transferred to further undisclosed detention , the alternative for a \u201c highvalue \u201d detainee would be indefinite arbitrary detention without charge or committal for trial by military commission with the power to hand down death sentences .", "CARDINAL . The HFHR focused on their experience regarding GPE \u2019s involvement in the ORG extraordinary rendition programme . They produced a number of documents , including flight data , concerning CARDINAL landings of the ORG - rendition aircraft in GPE , CARDINAL of which had occurred at FAC DATE ( the date of the applicant \u2019s rendition to GPE ) and CARDINAL DATE ( the date of the applicant \u2019s rendition from GPE ) and CARDINAL landing of a plane from GPE in GPE en route to ORG that occurred on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The parties expressed opposing views on the standard and burden of proof to be applied in the present case .", "CARDINAL . The Government reiterated that there was no evidence that the facts complained of had taken place in GPE . In their view , the applicant \u2019s allegations could not be considered sufficiently convincing or established beyond reasonable doubt , as required by the ORG \u2019s case - law .", "In that regard , the Government referred to the standard of proof applied by ORG in GPE ( cited above ) , emphasising that the present case was substantially different in several aspects . In the first place , in the PERSON case the applicant himself had lodged the case and presented his statements ; his account had been supported by a large amount of indirect evidence obtained during the international inquiries and the investigation by the NORP authorities . As the ORG held , Mr ORG case had been \u201c a case of documented rendition \u201d . Secondly , there had been other relevant elements corroborating the applicant \u2019s story . Thirdly , the circumstances described by the applicant had been verified and confirmed by other international investigations concerning the applicant , to mention only the PERSON and PERSON . Lastly , the ORG had before it a written statement made by CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s top officials confirming the facts established in the course of the investigations and the applicant \u2019s consistent and coherent description of events . All this material taken together satisfied the ORG that there had been prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant \u2019s version of events , and , consequently , it found the applicant \u2019s allegations sufficiently convincing and established beyond reasonable doubt .", "In contrast , Mr PERSON had failed to produce such evidence and to make a credible claim either before the domestic authorities or before the Court . In view of the foregoing , the Government were confident that the burden of proof should not be shifted to them .", "CARDINAL . The Government further stressed that the applicant \u2019s allegations concerning rendition to and from GPE , and his secret detention and illtreatment in ORG secret facilities in GPE had been rejected in their entirety as unfounded following the pre - trial investigation carried out by ORG .", "Those proceedings followed the ORG inquiry . While it was true that the Seimas had come to conclusions that had left some doubt as to whether any ORG prisoners had been transported to and from the country and whether a ORG secret prison had operated on the premises of ORG . CARDINAL and Project No . CARDINAL , all such doubts had been dispelled in the criminal investigation .", "In that context , the ORG also drew the ORG \u2019s attention to the limited competence of the Seimas and the nature of its inquiry as defined in ORG ruling of CARDINAL DATE , holding that \u201c the LAW [ was ] neither an institution of pre - trial investigation under LAW , nor the prosecutor \u2019s office , nor the court \u201d and that \u201c the conclusions of the Seimas ... investigation ... may not be construed as legal qualification of the actions that [ it had ] investigated ... and of other circumstances ... elucidated by it \u201d . Consequently , the ORG findings had not been binding and remained subject to the verification in the prosecutor \u2019s investigation .", "CARDINAL . The Government attached particular importance to the prosecutor \u2019s conclusion that in the course of the pre - trial investigation no evidence concerning unlawful rendition by the ORG of any persons , including the applicant , to or from GPE had been obtained . That decision had been based on a wide range of evidence , including classified sources , conclusively refuting the applicant \u2019s version of the events . Those findings , made as they were on a solid evidential basis could not , therefore , be undermined by the mere flight data or other information available in the public domain .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the ORG asked the ORG to hold that there was no prima facie evidence in support of the applicant \u2019s version of events and that , accordingly , the burden of proof could not be shifted to them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that in his case against GPE , the ORG had acknowledged the undeniable evidential challenges that arose in a case of this nature , and how the facts of the case , and the nature of the allegations , conditioned the ORG \u2019s approach to evidence and proof .", "As regards the \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d standard , to which the Government referred , the ORG had long been clear that this did not have the meaning commonly associated with that term in criminal law and domestic systems . Proof might flow from the existence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences of presumptions of fact . The ORG must adopt an approach consistent with its purpose as a ORG . Where the events in issue lay wholly , or in large part , within the exclusive knowledge of the domestic authorities , strong presumptions of fact might arise . When prima facie evidence was presented , the burden of proof shifted to the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s view , the evidence in his case more than met the relevant standard of prima facie evidence and created , at a minimum , strong and concordant inferences of fact as to his secret detention on NORP soil . The ORG had failed to provide any satisfactory explanation in the face of overwhelming evidence that they had established a \u201c black site \u201d on their territory . Instead , they had engaged in a policy of denial and obfuscation , drawing categorical conclusions that there could not possibly have been detainees on NORP soil . These conclusions were plainly at odds with the evidence before the ORG . As the ORG in the NORP case had noted , given the nature of the case , the fact that there was no document identifying PERSON by name as a detainee on a specific flight or in a specific secret prison site was not surprising and could not determine the outcome in this case . As the evidence plainly showed and as all the CARDINAL experts had concluded , PERSON had been transferred to the NORP \u201c black site \u201d on the relevant dates .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and has consistently recognised that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first - instance tribunal of fact , where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case ( see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALXIII ( extracts ) ; GPE and Others v. GPE , nos .

GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In assessing evidence , the ORG has adopted the standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d . However , it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard . Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on the responsibility of ORG under the Convention . The specificity of its task under LAW to ensure the observance by GPE of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof . In the proceedings before the ORG , there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre - determined formulae for its assessment . It adopts the conclusions that are , in its view , supported by the free evaluation of all evidence , including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions .", "According to the ORG \u2019s established case - law , proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . Moreover , the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and , in this connection , the distribution of the burden of proof , are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts , the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake . ORG is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a ORG has violated fundamental rights ( see , among other examples , GPE v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no .

While it is for the applicant to make a prima facie case and adduce appropriate evidence , if the respondent Government in their response to his allegations fail to disclose crucial documents to enable the ORG to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred , strong inferences can be drawn ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL others , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE , with further references ; PERSON and Others v. GPE , no .

Furthermore , the Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio . According to the ORG \u2019s case - law under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention , where the events in issue lie wholly , or in large part , within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities , for instance as in the case of persons under their control in custody , strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention . The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation ( see PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no .

According to the ORG , the investigation , based on the testimony of witnesses who had been directly involved in the implementation of Project No . CARDINAL and Project No .

CARDINAL and Project No . CARDINAL had not been , and could not have been , used for holding detainees and that there had been no evidence of ORG detainees ever being held in the country . The sole purpose of the ORG planes landing was , in the ORG \u2019s words , the delivery of a \u201c special cargo \u201d , described as a \u201c connection \u201d or \u201c communication \u201d equipment providing the ORG and the ORG \u201c with technical services in order to implement their joint project \u201d .

As regards the latter argument , the ORG observes that it is true that , on account of the fact that the allegations of the ORG secret prison being run in GPE emerged only in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , GPE had not been included in any of the inquiries carried out by ORG and ORG in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .

However , the investigative work of the experts involved in the DATE ORG encompassed GPE \u2019s possible involvement in the ORG scheme of secret prisons .

The ORG delegation visit to GPE on DATE and the DATE ORG involved the issue of alleged ORG secret prisons .

It is also to be noted that since DATE , ORG , through ORG , has conducted an inquiry into allegations concerning GPE \u2019s complicity in the ORG extraordinary rendition scheme . As part of the inquiry , the ORG delegation visited GPE and carried out an inspection of ORG .

Furthermore , the conclusions of the pre - trial investigation relied on by the ORG and the ORG \u2019s explanation of the purpose of the ORG planes landing seem to have been contradicted by other evidence in the ORG \u2019s possession , including material available in the public domain and the PERSON testimony .", "To begin with , as regards the purpose of the ORG - linked planes landing in GPE at the material time , the extensive flight data produced by the applicant , including the data in the DATE Reprieve Briefing , and expert evidence show that in respect of CARDINAL out of CARDINAL planes that landed in and departed from GPE and Palanga airports during the period from DATE to DATE the ORG used its methodology of \u201c dummy \u201d flight planning , that is to say , a deliberate disguise of their true destinations by declaring in the flight plans the route that the planes did not , nor even intended to , fly ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . According to expert evidence obtained by ORG in GPE v. GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) v.

Witnesses questioned in the pre - trial investigation gave inconsistent indications as to where the plane arrived from . For instance , Witness BCARDINAL spoke of an \u201c unplanned aircraft from GPE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Witness BCARDINAL ( \u201c person B \u201d ) said that it had \u201c arrived from GPE without passengers \u201d and that it had \u201c arrived in GPE from GPE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG , for its part , informed the prosecutor that \u201c they could [ have ] confuse[d ] the code of GPE and GPE due to their similarity \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "( c ) According to the experts , a combination of \u201c dummy \u201d flight planning and aircraft switching methodologies was likewise used in connection with the ORG flight on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The Palanga airport records indicated that on that date the plane had arrived in GPE from GPE and that it had left for PERSON on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . However , as stated in the DATE Reprieve Briefing and confirmed by the experts at the fact - finding hearing , a false plan was filed for GPE , whereas the plane flew to GPE where it made connection with GPE , another ORG rendition plane . The DATE ORG also states that the documents relating to the planning of these CARDINAL trips showed complex attempts to disguise the fact that the purpose of the trips was to provide a connection between GPE and GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "In the ORG \u2019s view , the ORG \u2019s above repeated , deliberate recourse to the complex flight - disguising methodologies typical of rendition flights transporting detainees to \u201c black sites \u201d does not appear to be consistent with the stated purpose of the ORG - linked planes landing in GPE , which according to the Government had been merely the delivery of \u201c special cargo \u201d , described as \u201c communication \u201d or \u201c connection \u201d equipment \u201d , in the context of the routine intelligence cooperation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further observes that in respect of the above planes the authorities applied a distinct practice , which resembles the special procedure for landings of ORG aircraft in PERSON airport followed by the NORP authorities in DATE and found by ORG to have been one of the elements indicative of the ORG \u2019s complicity in the ORG HVD Programme ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "In particular , as in GPE , the planes were not subject to any customs or the border guard control . On DATE the ORG officer ORG was prevented from carrying out the PERSON plane inspection ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . In connection with the arrivals of the \u201c partners\u2019 \u201d and the ORG officers at the airports , classified letters asking for access to the aircraft were issued to the ORG at least on CARDINAL occasions \u2013 CARDINAL ex post facto , following the above incident with the ORG officer on DATE and CARDINAL in connection with the LOC landing in GPE on DATE . Also , the rendition planes landing involved special security procedures organised by the ORG \u2019s counterpart in GPE . As confirmed by the ORG officers questioned in the course of the pre - trial investigation , they used to escort \u201c the partners \u201d , that is to say , the ORG teams to and from GPE and Palanga airports . In that connection , the ORG asked the ORG to make security arrangements . In the airport , the ORG vehicles approached the aircraft , whereas the ORG \u2019s escorting vehicles remained at some distance ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . At the fact - finding hearing held in the present case the experts , Mr GPE and PERSON , confirmed categorically that DATE beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 a ORG secret detention facility had operated in GPE in the period indicated by the applicant . In the same categorical terms they identified GPE as a country hosting the ORG secret detention facility codenamed \u201c Detention Site Violet \u201d in the DATE ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . The DATE Reprieve Briefing , relying on research into the ORG rendition operations , the analysis of the public data regarding the ORG transfers and the unredacted parts of the report , likewise concluded that it had been established beyond reasonable doubt that CARDINAL of the facilities adapted by the ORG in GPE had been used to hold prisoners and that ORG had been located in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The experts and the PERSON gave the same time - frame DATE for the ORG \u2019s secret prison operation . The ORG stated that the opening of the site had been marked by the transfer of prisoners which could have been effected on either or both of CARDINAL ORG rendition aircraft \u2013 ORG , which landed in GPE on DATE , or PERSON , which landed in GPE on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "Both experts stated that the opening of the ORG \u201c black site \u201d in GPE had been prompted by the disagreements with the NORP authorities in the administering of a secret detention site used by the ORG in GPE , which had led to the transfer of the ORG detainees out of GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In that regard , Mr GPE referred to the \u201c cyclical nature \u201d of the ORG detention sites and explained that the ORG had included several junctures \u201c at which CARDINAL detention ORG ] abruptly and another open[ed ] in its place \u201d . In his view , \u201c DATE had been the critical juncture at which ORG detention operations overseas had been dramatically overhauled \u201d . In the light of the flight data of DATE , there were CARDINAL destinations for detainees being taken from GPE \u2013Romania and GPE .", "Mr GPE reached the \u201c incontrovertible conclusion \u201d that when the facility in GPE had been finally closed , the only possibility was that ORG in GPE then took the detainees from GPE in conjunction with ORG in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . He further stated that references in the DATE ORG had \u201c accorded completely with the timings , with the character and with the chronological progression of detention operations in respect of GPE \u201d . He referred to the report \u2019s sections stating that ORG had been created in a \u201c separate country \u201d from any of the other detention sites mentioned therein . This , in his view , had opened a new territory in the ORG and referred to a site that had endured beyond the life span of ORG in GPE which , according to report , was closed shortly after the ORG publication of CARDINAL DATE .", "In that connection , Mr GPE also testified that the CARDINAL projects in GPE aimed at providing support to the ORG detention operations , referred to in the ORG inquiry as ORG . CARDINAL and ORG . CARDINAL , corresponded to the description of CARDINAL facilities in the country hosting ORG . In particular , the report stated that by DATE the ORG had concluded that its completed but still unused holding cell in the country DATE by which it had meant ORG . DATE had been insufficient . It further stated that the ORG had thus sought to build a new expanded facility in the country . This corresponded precisely with the description of the provenance of Project No . CARDINAL as given in the CNSD Findings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr Black said that the report clearly indicated that ORG had operated from DATE . The site had been in a country where there had previously been another site that had never been used . This detail of there having been CARDINAL sites , CARDINAL never used and CARDINAL that had been used DATE corresponded accurately with the parliamentary inquiry \u2019s findings , stating that \u201c partners \u201d \u2013 the ORG \u2013 had equipped CARDINAL sites . His research established that flights went into and out of GPE precisely at the time that the prisoners were said to have been moved into and out of ORG . This corresponded with flights into and out of GPE in , firstly , DATE , then in DATE and lastly in DATE ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) .", "PERSON added that , taking into account the whole weight of various indicators , \u201c the only solution that ma[d]e any sense is that the solution that indeed the site in GPE [ had ] operated at the times that we [ had ] stated and [ had been ] serviced by the flights that we [ had ] stated \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In that context the ORG would also note that , as shown by the evidence referred to above , the DATE flights were followed by the landing on DATE of the plane PERSON , which , according to the experts , transferred ORG detainees , via a \u201c double - plane switch \u201d operation in GPE , from the ORG facility codenamed \u201c FAC \u201d in the DATE ORG and located in GPE . PERSON added that PERSON had been transferred from GPE to ORG in GPE on that plane ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The experts were not in complete agreement as to which DATE or DATE was the CARDINAL definitely marking the opening of the ORG \u201c black site \u201d in GPE .", "Mr GPE considered that it was more likely that the flight of ORG on CARDINAL DATE signified the opening of the \u201c black site \u201d , since it had landed in GPE and GPE was the airport physically associated with ORG , the location of the ORG facility . However , he did not rule out the possibility that another airfield , GPE , may have been used in conjunction with ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "PERSON , for his part , was categorical in stating that the transfer of detainees from GPE to GPE had been executed by the NCARDINALWH flight into GPE on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "However , the ORG does not find it indispensable to rule on which specific date the ORG site in GPE opened given that , according to the evidence before it , there were only these CARDINAL , closely situated , dates on which it could have happened .", "CARDINAL . As regards the date marking the end of Detention Site Violet \u2019s operation , both Mr GPE and PERSON stated that it had been closed as a result of medical issues experienced by ORG detainees , who had been refused medical treatment in the country , as described in the DATE ORG . The experts linked the closure to the rendition mission executed by the plane NCARDINALMA , which had landed in GPE on DATE . They stated that it had taken the ORG prisoners via GPE by means of an aircraft switching operation to another detention facility , which they unambiguously identified as \u201c ORG \u201d located in GPE . The DATE PERSON likewise stated that the above transfer had matched the closure of ORG . In that regard , it also referred to the passages in the DATE ORG , stating that the site had been closed as a result of lack of available medical care in the \u201c CARDINAL - character redacted \u201d DATE the redacted month could only be \u201c DATE \u201d or \u201c DATE \u201d on account of the length of the redaction ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the physical location of ORG , both Mr GPE and PERSON stated that , beyond reasonable doubt , it had been located in GPE , a neighbourhood of GPE , in the former horse - riding academy converted into a customised ORG detention facility , the construction of which had been supervised by the ORG \u201c afresh \u201d . PERSON , who in DATE had made several trips to ORG to interview local people , said it was clear from those interviews that the NORP had been there , had been fitting the site out , had been guarding the place and that vehicles with tinted windows had been coming and going ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the experts , on the analysis of the DATE ORG and recently declassified ORG material , also established that CARDINAL ORG prisoners were held at ORG and conclusively identified CARDINAL of them \u2013 PERSON , who was explicitly mentioned in the report in connection with medical issues experienced at that site , PERSON and the applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the DATE ORG includes several references to ORG . It clearly refers to CARDINAL detention facilities in the country hosting that site : CARDINAL completed but , \u201c by DATE \u201d , still unused and considered by the ORG as insufficient \u201c given the growing number of ORG detainees in the program and the ORG \u2019s interest in interrogating multiple detainees at the same detention site \u201d and CARDINAL \u201c expanded \u201d which the ORG \u201c sought to build \u201d . In that connection , the ORG offered some redacted sum of CARDINAL \u201c to \u2018 show appreciation\u2019 ... for the ... support \u201d for the ORG HVD Programme ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . That information is consistent with evidence from witnesses M , N , O and P , who were questioned in the criminal investigation . They confirmed that in DATE N and O had been assigned to assist their ORG partners in finding suitable premises for a joint project \u2013 an \u201c intelligence support centre\u201d\u2013 in respect of which the partners had \u201c used to cover all expenses \u201d . According to ORG , in DATE the \u201c partners \u201d had come and proposed to organise a joint operation , \u201c to establish the LOC in GPE for the protection of secret collaborators \u201d . Witness O said that the ORG partners had chosen the premises which had then become ORG . CARDINAL and that they had started to come in DATE , had carried out the work themselves and had brought material and the equipment in the containers ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE ORG further states that ORG \u201c opened in DATE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . This element corresponds to the dates of the landings of the rendition planes ORG and NCARDINALWH \u2013 CARDINAL and DATE . It also corresponds to the statement of ORG , who testified that ORG . CARDINAL had been \u201c established at DATE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The closure of ORG is mentioned in the report in a specific context and chronology , namely \u201c press stories \u201d , in particular the ORG publication of CARDINAL DATE that led to the closure of ORG and \u201c the ORG \u2019s inability to provide emergency medical care \u201d due to the refusal of the country hosting ORG to admit PERSON , CARDINAL of the ORG detainees , to a local hospital . This refusal , according to the report , resulted in the ORG \u2019s having sought assistance from third - party countries in providing medical care to him and \u201c CARDINAL other ORG detainees with acute ailments \u201d . In relation to the ORG publication , the report gives a fairly specific time - frame for the closure of ORG , which occurred \u201c shortly thereafter \u201d . However , ORG still operated in \u201c DATE \u201d . At that time \u201c the ORG was holding CARDINAL detainees in its CARDINAL remaining facilities , ORG ... and ORG \u201d . ORG was closed in DATE , in DATE whose name comprised CARDINAL characters which were redacted in the report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As noted in the DATE Reprieve Briefing , there are CARDINAL possibilities : the relevant DATE could be either \u201c DATE \u201d or \u201c DATE .", "CARDINAL . Considering the material referred to above as whole , the ORG is satisfied that there is prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant \u2019s allegation that the ORG secret detention site operated in GPE DATE and DATE . Accordingly , the burden of proof should shift to the respondent Government ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL and paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the Government have failed to demonstrate why the evidence referred to above can not serve to corroborate the applicant \u2019s allegations . Apart from their reliance on the conclusions of the criminal investigation of DATE and , in particular , the testimony of witnesses who , as the Government underlined , had all consistently denied that any transfers of ORG detainees had taken place or that a ORG had run a secret detention facility in GPE , they have not offered convincing reasons for the series and purpose of the ORG - associated aircraft landings at GPE and GPE DATE and DATE , the special procedures followed by the authorities in that connection and the actual purpose served by ORG . CARDINAL at the material time ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . The witness testimony obtained in the criminal investigation is the key evidence adduced by the ORG in support of their arguments ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . The ORG has not had the possibility of having access to full versions of the testimony since the relevant material was and still is classified . It has nevertheless been able to assess that evidence on the basis of a summary description produced by the Government ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "Having considered the material submitted , the ORG finds a number of elements that do not appear to be consistent with the version of events presented by the Government .", "CARDINAL . First , the Government asserted that both ORG . CARDINAL and No . CARDINAL were found to have been completely unsuitable for secret detention ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "The ORG does not find it necessary to analyse in detail the purposes actually served by ORG . CARDINAL or determine whether or not that facility was used , as the ORG argued at the oral hearing , for \u201c extraction \u201d or \u201c exfiltration \u201d of secret agents or otherwise , since in the present case it is not claimed that ORG detainees were held in that facility . It thus suffices for the ORG to take note of the CNSD \u2019s conclusion that in Project No . CARDINAL \u201c conditions were created for holding detainees in GPE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , as regards Project No . CARDINAL , the Government submitted that while the exact purpose served by the premises at the material time could not be revealed since it was classified , the witnesses had unequivocally confirmed that no premises suitable for detainees had been located there . Moreover , access to the premises had been under the permanent surveillance of the ORG and there had been no secret zones inaccessible to the ORG officers in the building . This excluded any possibility of unauthorised access or holding detainees in the LOC ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "However , the ORG notes that Witnesses N and O , the ORG officers assigned to assist the ORG partners , who escorted them to and from the airports and who were also responsible for supervision of the premises , said that they had not visited all the rooms . ORG said that he had not had access to the \u201c administration area \u201d . O was not given access to all the LOC . Moreover , the building was apparently not used for the purpose of the declared \u201c joint operation \u201d of an intelligence support centre . The only NORP intelligence personnel present in the building were the CARDINAL ORG officers M , N and O , who supervised the building on changing shifts even if nobody was there . Witness O stated that he had not known who had arrived at the LOC or \u201c with what they had been occupied with \u201d . Witness N \u201c was not aware of the contents of the operations \u201d that were carried out in Project No . CARDINAL . Witnesses N and O \u201c actively supervised \u201d the building until DATE but then the number of the ORG partners\u2019 visits decreased ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the ORG \u2019s explanation that the premises were acquired for the SSD \u2019s needs and used for \u201c short - term meetings \u201d with \u201c their guests \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the layout of CARDINAL of the buildings at ORG .

Also , no convincing explanation has been provided as to why ORG . CARDINAL , claimed to have been designated for an \u201c intelligence support centre \u201d and reconstructed with evidently considerable effort and expense on the part of the ORG had DATE according to the witnesses \u2013 been virtually unused by the ORG or their partners throughout DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government further argued that in the light of abundant evidence it had been established in the criminal investigation that the purpose of CARDINAL ORG - linked flights into GPE , alleged to have transported the applicant to and out of GPE , namely GPE and ORG , which had taken place on , respectively , CARDINAL DATE and DATE had been the delivery of a \u201c special cargo \u201d . The object of the delivery was \u201c special equipment for a special investigation department \u201d in a number of boxes , which had all been of the same size , QUANTITY long ( see paragraphs QUANTITY above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the witness statements relied on are not only partly inconsistent with each other but they also do not fully support the Government \u2019s account . Furthermore , the Government \u2019s account is at variance with evidence collected in the course of the parliamentary inquiry . In this regard , the ORG would refer to testimony given by the ORG officers involved in escorting \u201c cargo \u201d and the ORG partners to and from the NORP airports and to the CNSD Findings .", "CARDINAL . As regards the ORG \u2019s submission that the purpose of the flight PERSON which landed in GPE on DATE was the delivery of cargo containing the \u201c connection \u201d or \u201c communication \u201d equipment ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , the ORG notes that none of the witnesses heard in the criminal investigation referred to any \u201c delivery of cargo \u201d to GPE in relation to the plane in question ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and QUANTITY above ) . It further notes that the ORG \u2019s contention stands in contrast with the CNSD Findings , which in the light of the evidence gathered in the inquiry , established that \u201c no cargo was unloaded from it or onto it \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , as confirmed by the DATE ORG letter , \u201c CARDINAL GPE citizens arrived in GPE on that plane \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the statements made by witnesses V and O do not support the ORG \u2019s contention that the purpose of the flight GPE into GPE on DATE was likewise \u201c to deliver equipment \u201d for the NORP \u201c special investigation department \u201d . On the contrary , the CARDINAL escorting officers clearly related the loading of a \u201c cargo \u201d onto the ORG aircraft from the ORG partners\u2019 vehicles ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . This happened in the course of what was called an \u201c operation \u201d , which suggests that the activities involved in the aircraft landing and loading were not quite of a routine nature . As in respect of the other ORG aircraft landings referred to above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , the special procedure , without any customs or ORG control , had been applied .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the inconsistency of the ORG \u2019s version with the witness statements and the factual findings made by ORG and in the light of the documentary and expert evidence analysed in detail above , the Government \u2019s explanations as to the purposes served by the ORG rendition flights landing in GPE DATE and DATE and the facility Project No . CARDINAL can not be regarded as convincing .", "CARDINAL . In view of the foregoing and taking into account all the elements analysed in detail above , the ORG concludes that the Government have not produced any evidence capable of contradicting the applicant \u2019s allegations .", "In particular , they have not refuted the applicant \u2019s argument that the planes ORG , PERSON and PERSON that landed in GPE DATE and DATE served the purposes of the ORG rendition operations and the conclusions of the experts heard by the ORG , categorically stating that the aircraft in question were used by the ORG for transportation of prisoners into GPE . Nor have they refuted the applicant \u2019s assertion that the above rendition flights marked the opening and the closure of a ORG secret prison referred to in the DATE ORG as \u201c Detention Site Violet \u201d , which was conclusively confirmed by expert evidence to the effect that ORG was located in GPE and operated during the period indicated by the applicant ( see also and compare with GPE v.

In view of the foregoing , in order to ascertain whether or not it can be concluded that the applicant was detained at ORG in GPE at the relevant time , the ORG will take into account all the facts that have already been found established beyond reasonable doubt ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) and analyse all other material in its possession , including , in particular , the DATE ORG and expert evidence reconstructing the chronology of the applicant \u2019s rendition and detention in DATE ( see paragraphs QUANTITY , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As noted above , the facts of the present case form an integral part of a chain of events lasting from the applicant \u2019s capture on DATE to his transfer by the ORG into the custody of the GPE military authorities in FAC on DATE . Those events took place in multiple countries hosting the ORG secret detention facilities that operated under the ORG during that period . They involve a continuing sequence of the applicant \u2019s renditions from CARDINAL country to another , with the periods of his detention at each country \u2019s \u201c black site \u201d being marked by the movements of the ORG \u2019s rendition aircraft corresponding to locations within the network of secret prisons ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .

Nonetheless , the experts , following a comprehensive analysis of the entirety of the available documentary evidence concerning the ORG \u2019s extraordinary rendition operations at the material time , were able to conclude that he had been detained at that site on the basis of a number of other elements consistently demonstrating that there is no \u2013 and there could not be any DATE alternative account of the applicant \u2019s fate following his DATE rendition from GPE .", "The ORG would reiterate that the experts started by determining , beyond reasonable doubt , that GPE was the only place in which the applicant could have been detained in DATE and that , according to the rendition aircraft schedules at that time he could only have been transferred from there either to ORG in GPE or to ORG in GPE . On the basis of evidence indicating his absence from ORG in the relevant period , the one and only remaining destination of the applicant \u2019s transfer from GPE was Detention Site Violet . They further went on to infer information relevant for the applicant from unredacted passages of the report concerning other HVDs in ORG custody , PERSON , simultaneously being detained in the country hosting ORG . The experts correlated this information with the data relating to the ORG detainee transfers in the period of the operation of the NORP site , including the transfer from ORG on DATE and the transfer from ORG , via GPE and an aircraft switching operation , to ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG would refer , in particular , to the following statements made by the experts .", "Mr GPE stated that \u201c through an intimate familiarity with the chronology of [ the applicant \u2019s ] detention \u201d he had reached the conclusion that \u201c there [ was ] CARDINAL place he could have been in the early part of DATE and that that place was indeed GPE \u201d . He knew that \u201c the transfers out of GPE in DATE went to other active \u2018 black sites\u2019 that that CARDINAL of these was \u2018 Detention Site Black\u2019 in GPE , but that there was also another one in a separate country ... and ... this other country was GPE \u201d . He added that \u201c because [ the applicant ] did not arrive in GPE , \u2018 ORG \u201d \u2013 which he knew based on his \u201c years\u2019 long investigations into the operations of that site ... the only other destination to which he could have been transferred was the active site in GPE and this transfer took place in accordance with the flights ... in DATE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "PERSON testified that , based on the overall effect of the evidence , he was satisfied \u201c that beyond reasonable doubt PERSON was held in GPE starting from DATE \u201d . He said that while prima facie it was possible that the applicant , being in GPE in DATE , had been moved either to GPE or to GPE , there was evidence indicating , first , that he was not in GPE in or prior to DATE and , second , that he was in GPE in DATE ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . The experts attributed a different threshold of proof to their conclusions .", "Mr GPE stated that on the \u201c balance of probabilities \u201d , he believed it was established that the applicant had been secretly detained at ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) . He was nevertheless satisfied as to \u201c the presence of PERSON , respectively in DATE in GPE up to the point where the ORG detention [ facility ] [ had been ] cleared , thereafter on the territory of GPE in ORG coded as \u2018 PERSON and thereafter on the territory of GPE in FAC coded as \u2018 Brown\u2019 \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Also , he said that there was a \u201c categorical certainty \u201d that the applicant had been brought to GPE on one of the DATE flights from GPE to GPE \u2013 NCARDINALCL or NCARDINALWH \u2013 either on CARDINAL or on DATE and that \u201c beyond reasonable doubt he [ had been ] taken to GPE when he [ had ] left GPE \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "PERSON categorically stated that the applicant , beyond reasonable doubt , had been held in GPE from DATE and that he believed that the applicant had been \u201c flown into GPE on GPE on DATE and flown out of GPE on GPE and GPE on DATE \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG does not consider that this difference in terminology used by the experts has a direct and dispositive bearing on its own assessment of the evidence . It reiterates that , while in assessing evidence it applies \u201c the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt \u201d , that concept is independent from the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard . The ORG is not called upon to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability based on \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d or \u201c balance of probabilities \u201d standards as applied by the domestic courts but on the responsibility of the respondent ORG under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above , with references to the ORG \u2019s case - law ) .", "CARDINAL . Based on its free evaluation of all the material in its possession , the ORG considers that there is prima facie evidence corroborating the applicant \u2019s allegation as to his secret detention in GPE , at ORG , from CARDINAL or DATE to DATE . Consequently , the burden of proof should shift to the respondent Government .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the Government , apart from their above contention that there is no credible evidence confirming the applicant \u2019s detention in GPE , in particular in any border control records , and their general denial that any ORG secret detention facility had operated in the country , have not adduced any counter - evidence capable of refuting the experts\u2019 conclusions .", "Having regard to the very nature of the ORG secret detention scheme , the ORG \u2019s argument that there is no indication of the applicant \u2019s physical presence in GPE DATE which they sought to support by the fact that his name had not been found in the records of passengers on the flights in DATE CARDINAL-March DATE ( see paragraphs QUANTITY above ) \u2013 can not be upheld . In the ORG \u2019s view , it would be unacceptable if the ORG , having failed to comply with their obligation to register duly and in accordance with the domestic law all persons arriving on or departing from NORP territory on the ORG planes and having relinquished any border control in respect of the rendition aircraft ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , could take advantage of those omissions in the fact - finding procedure before the ORG . When allowing the ORG to operate a detention site on NORP soil the Government were , by pure virtue of LAW , required to secure the information necessary to identify detainees brought to the country ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below , with references to the ORG \u2019s case - law ) . The ORG can not accept that the Government \u2019s failure to do so should have adverse consequences for the applicant in its assessment of whether it has been adequately demonstrated by the ORG , against the strong prima facie case made by the applicant , that his detention in GPE did not take place .", "CARDINAL . In view of the foregoing , the ORG considers the applicant \u2019s allegations sufficiently convincing . For the same reasons as stated above in regard to the date marking the opening of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG does not find it indispensable to rule on which of the CARDINAL dates indicated by the applicant DATE or DATE and on which of the CARDINAL planes \u2013 ORG or NCARDINALWH \u2013 he was brought to GPE .", "Consequently , on the basis of strong , clear and concordant inferences as related above , the ORG finds it proven to the required standard of proof that :", "( a ) on DATE or DATE the applicant was transferred by the ORG to from GPE , GPE to GPE on board either the rendition plane ORG or the rendition plane PERSON ;", "( b ) from CARDINAL or DATE to DATE the applicant was detained in the ORG detention facility in GPE codenamed \u201c Detention Site Violet \u201d according to the DATE ORG ; and", "( c ) on DATE on board the rendition plane NCARDINALMA and via a subsequent aircraft - switching operation the applicant was transferred by the ORG out of GPE to another ORG detention facility , identified by the experts as being codenamed \u201c ORG \u201d according to the DATE ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that , as in GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE on account of the secrecy of the HVD Programme and restrictions on his communications with the ORG , he could not present specific evidence of what had happened to him in GPE . However , as the ORG found in the above case , at an absolute minimum detainees in ORG custody , whether in GPE or elsewhere , would have been subjected to the applicable standard conditions of detention at the relevant time , including solitary confinement , shackling , exposure to bright light , low and loud noise on a constant basis and the standard conditions of transfer , stripping , shaving , hooding , diapering and strapping down into painful crammed positions .", "The Government have not addressed this issue .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that , in contrast to treatment inflicted on the applicant during an early period of his secret detention , which is often documented in detail in various material ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , there is no evidence demonstrating any instances of similar acts at ORG . According to the DATE ORG , the applicant from his capture to his transfer to GPE military custody on DATE \u201c provided information \u201d , which resulted \u201c in CARDINAL disseminated intelligence reports \u201d . The fact that CARDINAL such reports were produced DATE indicates that he was continually interrogated or \u201c debriefed \u201d by the ORG during the entire period of his secret detention ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , in the light of the material in the ORG \u2019s possession , it does not appear that in GPE the applicant was subjected to the EITs in connection with interrogations ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "As regards recourse to harsh interrogation techniques at the relevant time , the DATE ORG states in general terms that in DATE the ORG temporarily suspended the use of the EITs . While their use was at some point resumed and they were apparently applied throughout the most part of DATE , such techniques were again temporarily suspended in DATE and in DATE . However , the applicant \u2019s name is not mentioned in that context ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the experts , it was not possible to pronounce categorically on specific interrogation techniques or other forms of treatment or ill - treatment practised on the applicant in GPE , as in DATE there was less information about the treatment of prisoners in the ORG than there had been in DATE . However , the ORG documents and the DATE ORG described the routine conditions of detention at \u201c black sites \u201d , which included such practices as sensory deprivation , sleep deprivation , denial or religious rights and incommunicado detention . Those conditions alone passed the threshold of treatment prohibited by LAW ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the ORG \u2019s establishment of the facts of the case , detailed rules governing conditions in which the ORG kept its prisoners leave no room for speculation as to the basic aspects of the situation in which the applicant found himself from CARDINAL or DATE to DATE . The ORG therefore finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was kept \u2013 as any other high - value detainee \u2013 in conditions described in ORG , which applied from DATE to all ORG detainees ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ; see also GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "While at this stage it is premature to characterise the treatment to which the applicant was subjected during his detention at ORG for the purposes of his complaint under the substantive limb of LAW , the ORG would point out that that regime included at least \u201c CARDINAL standard conditions of confinement \u201d . That meant blindfolding or hooding the detainees , designed to disorient them and keep from learning their location or the layout of the detention facility ; removal of hair upon arrival at the site ; incommunicado , solitary confinement ; continuous noise of high and varying intensity played at all times ; continuous light such that each cell was illuminated to about the same brightness as an office ; and use of leg shackles in all aspects of detainee management and movement ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government firmly denied that the ORG authorities had received any ORG request that would even vaguely imply the running of a secret detention facility on NORP territory . The prospects of receiving from the GPE authorities a request for assistance in the \u201c war on terror \u201d had been considered by the ORG on a purely theoretical basis . Moreover , in the criminal investigation all the Heads of ORG in office at the material time had consistently testified that they had not known about any detainees transfers and had not given their consent to the transportation of any persons held by the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the above contention does not seem to be supported by the CNSD Findings , which established that the ORG had received a request from the ORG \u201c to equip facilities in GPE suitable for holding detainees \u201d . In that connection , the CNSD referred to the testimony of the former Head of State , Mr Rolandas GPE who had confirmed that GPE had been asked for permission to bring into the country persons suspected of terrorism ; however , the information that he had received had not mentioned a detention centre or prison . The former Director General of the ORG , Mr PERSON testified that in DATE he had informed Mr GPE about a possibility of receiving a \u201c request to participate in the programme concerning the transportation of detainees \u201d after GPE \u2019s accession to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In that context , the ORG would refer to the DATE ORG , which states , in relation to ORG , that at the same time , that is \u201c by DATE \u201d , the ORG \u201c had concluded that its completed but still unused holding cell in Country ... [ had been ] insufficient \u201d and had \u201c sought to build a new , expanded detention facility in the country \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG would also note that GPE \u2019s accession to ORG took place on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The CNSD further established that , \u201c when carrying out the ORG partnership cooperation ORG . CARDINAL and ORG . CARDINAL , the ... heads of the ORG [ had ] not inform[ed ] any of the country \u2019s officials of the purposes and content of the said projects \u201d . On the basis of the material in its possession , it related that although Mr PERSON had received a negative answer from PERSON GPE in respect of the \u201c bringing into GPE of persons interrogated by the GPE \u201d , he had not asked either Mr GPE or acting Head of State , Mr PERSON , for \u201c political approval of activities under ORG .

Witness A , an important political post - holder at the relevant time , testified that Mr PERSON had addressed Mr GPE in connection with a \u201c temporary possibility to hold persons suspected of terrorism \u201d and received a negative answer ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Witness BCARDINAL , an another important political post - holder , confirmed that he had been addressed \u201c as regards the transportation and holding [ of ] people in GPE \u201d and that he had not approved the idea ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , referring to the availability of information of the establishment of the ORG clandestine detention sites , the DATE ORG clearly confirms that the \u201c political leaders of host countries were generally informed of their existence \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The report further confirms that an approval for the ORG detention facility corresponding to Project No . CARDINAL was received from the authorities . Although the relevant section specifying a person or authority is heavily redacted , it clearly states that \u201c the plan to construct the expanded facility was approved by the [ redacted ] of the Country \u201d \u2013 which , however , required \u201c complex mechanisms \u201d in order to provide an unspecified amount of CARDINAL to the country \u2019s authorities .

Also , the report refers to a certain official who , when he became aware of the facility , was described as \u201c shocked \u201d but \u201c nonetheless approved \u201d it ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the money paid by the ORG to the authorities , the ORG would note that the fact that such financial rewards were , as a matter of general policy and practice , offered to the authorities of countries hosting ORG \u201c black sites \u201d is confirmed in LAW DATE ORG . The conclusion states that \u201c to encourage governments to clandestinely host ORG detention sites , or to increase support for existing sites , the ORG provided MONEY in cash payments to foreign government officials \u201d and that \u201c the ORG encouraged ORG to construct \u2018 wish lists\u2019 of proposed financial assistance \u201d and \u201c to \u2018 think big\u2019 in terms of that assistance \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . It is undisputed and has been confirmed by the CNSD Findings and in the criminal investigation that ORG . CARDINAL and Project No . CARDINAL were implemented in cooperation with the ORG . Nor has it been contested that in the framework of that cooperation the ORG adapted the premises of ORG . CARDINAL according to the ORG \u2019s requests , assisted the ORG in acquiring the premises of ORG . CARDINAL and adapting and reconstructing the LOC for the ORG \u2019s needs ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The cooperation dated back to DATE and started from the adaptation of ORG . CARDINAL . Later , in DATE several officers of the ORG were assigned to assist the ORG in finding a suitable location for ORG . CARDINAL and purchasing the land and buildings in GPE . Both projects were fully financed by the ORG . Starting from DATE when ORG , according to ORG , was \u201c established \u201d , the ORG officers ensured the security and surveillance of the LOC ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In GPE v. GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE the fact that the national authorities had cooperated with the ORG in disguising the rendition aircraft \u2019s actual routes and validated incomplete or false flight plans in order to cover up the ORG \u2019s activities in the country was considered relevant for the ORG \u2019s assessment of the LOC knowledge of , and complicity in , the HVD Programme ( see GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The ORG will follow that approach in analysing the facts of the present case .", "CARDINAL . It has already been established that in respect of CARDINAL rendition flights \u2013 NCARDINALWH on DATE , NCARDINALWH on DATE and GPE on DATE the ORG used the methodology of \u201c dummy \u201d flight planning DATE an intentional disguise of flight plans for rendition aircraft applied by the air companies contracted by the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "As the ORG found in the judgments referred to above , the \u201c dummy \u201d flight planning , a deliberate effort to cover up the ORG flights into the country , required active cooperation on the part of the host countries through which the planes travelled . In addition to granting the ORG rendition aircraft overflight permissions , the national authorities navigated the planes through the country \u2019s airspace to undeclared destinations in contravention of international aviation regulations and issued false landing permits ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the fact that the NORP aviation authorities participated in the process demonstrated that GPE knowingly assisted in the ORG scheme disguising the rendition planes .", "CARDINAL . The Government acknowledged that the ORG planes on CARDINAL occasions had not been subject to the customs and ORG control , in connection with the delivery of a \u201c special cargo \u201d for the NORP services ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . To this end , the ORG addressed classified letters to the relevant authorities . The purpose was to obtain unrestricted access to the aircraft for the ORG and the ORG partners . As described by the witnesses questioned in the criminal investigation , the ORG teams were escorted to the area in the airport and drove in their vehicles to the aircraft , whereas the ORG officers escorting them remained in their vehicles at some distance . As noted above , that practice resembled the special procedure followed by the NORP authorities in respect of the ORG rendition planes landings in PERSON in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above , with references to GPE v. GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers , as it did in GPE v. GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , that the circumstances and conditions in which HVDs were routinely transferred by the ORG from rendition planes to the ORG \u201c black sites \u201d in the host countries should be taken into account in the context of the ORG authorities\u2019 alleged knowledge and complicity in the HVD Programme ( see GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "It follows from the ORG \u2019s findings in the above cases and the ORG material describing the routine procedure for transfers of detainees between the \u201c black sites \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) that for the duration of his transfer a HVD was \u201c securely shackled \u201d by his hands and feet , deprived of sight and sound by the use of blindfolds , earmuffs and a hood and that upon arrival at his destination was moved to the \u201c black site \u201d under the same conditions .", "CARDINAL . The ORG finds it inconceivable that the transportation of prisoners over land from the planes to the ORG detention site could , for all practical purposes , have been effected without at least minimal assistance by the host country \u2019s authorities , to mention only securing the area near and around the landing planes and providing conditions for a secret and safe transfer of passengers . Inevitably , the NORP personnel responsible for security arrangements , in particular the reception of the flights and on - land transit , must have witnessed at least some elements of the detainees\u2019 transfer to ORG , for instance the loading or unloading of blindfolded and shackled passengers from the planes ( see also GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "Consequently , the ORG concludes that the NORP authorities which received the ORG personnel in the airport could not have been unaware that the persons brought by them to GPE were the ORG prisoners .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also attaches importance to various material referring to ill - treatment and abuse of terrorist suspects captured and detained by GPE authorities in the \u201c war on terror \u201d , which was available in the public domain at the relevant time ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; GPE v.

NORP Before analysing that material , the ORG would refer to President PERSON \u2019s memorandum of DATE , stating that neither ORG nor ORG detainees qualified as prisoners of war under LAW and that LAW CARDINAL of LAW , did not apply to them ( see paragraph CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . The ORG Press Secretary announced that decision at the press conference on DATE . It was widely commented in the GPE and international media . That decision , however , included a disclaimer that even detainees \u201c not legally entitled \u201d to be treated humanely would be so treated , and also spoke of respecting the principles of LAW \u201c to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . Consequently , already at this very early stage of the \u201c war on terror \u201d it was well known that \u201c military necessity \u201d was a parameter for determining the treatment to be received by the captured terrorist suspects .", "CARDINAL . The ORG would further note that from DATE , when the ORG High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a statement relating to detention of ORG and ORG prisoners in ORG , strong concerns were expressed publicly as to the treatment of detainees , in particular the use of \u201c stress and duress \u201d methods of interrogations and arbitrary and incommunicado detention . From DATE the international governmental and non - governmental organisations regularly published reports and statements disclosing ill - treatment and abuse to which captured terrorist suspects were subjected in GPE custody in various places , for instance in ORG and the GPE military base in GPE . The material summarised above and cited in the AI / ICJ \u2019s amicus curiae brief include only some sources selected from a large amount of documents available in the public domain throughout the above period ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "Moreover , in the DATE PACE Resolution of DATE of which GPE , one of ORG member GPE , must have been aware \u2013 ORG of ORG was \u201c deeply concerned at the conditions of detention \u201d of captured \u201c unlawful combatants \u201d held in the custody of the GPE authorities ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . At the material time the ill - treatment , use of harsh interrogation measures , and arbitrary detention of ORG and ORG prisoners in GPE custody , as well as the existence of \u201c GPE overseas centres \u201d for interrogations was also often reported in the international media from DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . Following the ORG report on DATE , which disclosed the complicity of the \u201c LOC countries \u201d in the ORG and prompted the closure of \u201c black sites \u201d in LOC , as well as the ORG disclosure and the DATE HRW Statement naming GPE and GPE as ORG accomplices , there could be no doubt as what kind of activities had been carried out by the ORG in the countries concerned ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . At that time , ORG in GPE was still active .", "The issue of the ORG renditions and abusive detention and interrogation practices used against the captured terrorist suspects in their custody was also present , reported and discussed in the NORP media .

Furthermore , the experts , who in the course of their inquiries also had the benefit of contact with various sources , including confidential ones , unanimously and categorically stated that GPE not only ought to have known but actually did know of the nature and purposes of the ORG activities in the country .", "Senator PERSON stated that since the operation had been governed by the \u201c need - to - know \u201d secrecy principle , only those few people who had absolutely needed to know had known about it . As in other countries , there had been persons at the highest level of ORG who had had certain knowledge of what had been going on but even those who had come to know had not necessarily known all the details . Yet somebody had allowed the ORG to move about freely and have access to LOC where they had been allowed to do what they had wanted without any control whatsoever . He described the national authorities\u2019 conduct as complicity which had not been active ; the national authorities had not participated in the ORG interrogations ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "Mr GPE testified that the authorities of GPE had known about the existence of the detention facility and that through the highest levels of their government had approved and authorised its presence on their territory . In his view , they certainly should have known the purpose which the facility had served because its nature and purpose was part of a systematic practice , which had already been implemented by the ORG across multiple other countries and had been widely reported by the time the site in GPE had become active . There had been different degrees of knowledge in different sectors of GPE \u2019s authorities . At the operational level the details had been known to a very small number of trusted counterparts , primarily within the secret services . He added that he was not aware of any single instance of a ORG detention site having existed anywhere in the world without the express knowledge and authorisation of the host authorities ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "PERSON stated that it had been clear from the DATE ORG that the NORP officials had been aware of the ORG programme operating on their territory . He added that , as he could say from his accumulated knowledge of the ORG and close reading of the DATE ORG , some host country officials had always known that there had been prisoners held in the facilities . That did not imply that every single host country official had known but in GPE \u2019s case it was evident that at least some had known that the prisoners had been held on their territory and they had known that they had been receiving money to facilitate this ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG , as in previous similar cases , does not consider that the NORP authorities necessarily knew the details of what exactly went on inside the ORG secret facility or witnessed treatment or interrogations to which the ORG prisoners were subjected in GPE . As in other countries hosting clandestine prisons , the operation of the site was entirely in the hands of the ORG and the interrogations were exclusively the ORG \u2019s responsibility ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ; see also PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in the ORG \u2019s view , even if the NORP authorities did not have , or could not have had , complete knowledge of the ORG , the facts available to them through their contacts and cooperation with their ORG partners , taken together with extensive and widely available information on torture , ill - treatment , abuse and harsh interrogation measures inflicted on terrorist - suspects in GPE custody which in DATE circulated in the public domain , including the NORP press ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , enabled them to conjure up a reasonably accurate image of the ORG \u2019s activities and , more particularly , the treatment to which the ORG was likely to have subjected their prisoners in GPE .", "In that regard the ORG would reiterate that in GPE v. GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE it has found that already in DATE the public sources reported practices resorted to , or tolerated by , the GPE authorities that were manifestly contrary to the principles of the LAW . All the more so did the authorities , in DATE , have good reason to believe that a person detained under the ORG rendition and secret detention programme could be exposed to a serious risk of treatment contrary to those principles on their territory .", "It further observes that it is DATE as was the case in respect of GPE DATE inconceivable that the rendition aircraft could have crossed the country \u2019s airspace , landed atand departed from its airports , or that the ORG could have occupied the LOC offered by the national authorities and transported detainees there , without the ORG authorities being informed of or involved in the preparation and execution of the HVD Programme on their territory . Nor can it stand to reason that activities of such character and scale , possibly vital for the country \u2019s military and political interests , could have been undertaken on NORP territory without the NORP authorities\u2019 knowledge and without the necessary authorisation and assistance being given at the appropriate level of the ORG ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG accordingly finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that :", "( a ) the NORP authorities knew of the nature and purposes of the ORG \u2019s activities on its territory at the material time ;", "( b ) the NORP authorities , by approving the hosting of ORG , enabling the ORG to use its airspace and airports and to disguise the movements of rendition aircraft , providing logistics and services , securing the LOC for the ORG and transportation of the ORG teams with detainees on land , cooperated in the preparation and execution of the ORG rendition , secret detention and interrogation operations on its territory ; and", "( c ) NORP given their knowledge of the nature and purposes of the ORG \u2019s activities on their territory and their involvement in the execution of that programme , the NORP authorities knew that , by enabling the ORG to detain terrorist suspects \u2013 including the applicant \u2013 on their territory , they were exposing them to a serious risk of treatment contrary to the Convention ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "5", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
