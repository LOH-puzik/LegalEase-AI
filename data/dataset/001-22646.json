SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a federation of political parties which was founded on DATE and is based in LOC ( GPE ) . It was represented before the ORG by Mr F. Fern\u00e1ndez Camero and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "On DATE general elections to the legislative assembly of ORG took place . The applicant federation submitted various observations on the results issued by certain polling stations in the constituency of the island of GPE .", "On DATE the applicant federation lodged a complaint on the matter with ORG , which dismissed the complaint in a decision of DATE .", "On DATE the applicant federation lodged an ordinary appeal against that decision with ORG , which dismissed the appeal in a decision of DATE .", "On DATE ORG announced the names of the candidates who had been elected to the CARDINAL seats representing GPE in the regional legislative assembly . The applicant federation , which had obtained PERCENT of the valid votes cast in the GPE constituency , was not awarded any seats in the regional assembly . Nor was it awarded any seats in respect of the other constituencies of ORG , although it had obtained PERCENT of the valid votes cast in ORG as a whole .", "The applicant federation applied to ORG for judicial review of the election results , alleging that there had been irregularities and claiming CARDINAL additional votes , which it maintained had not been counted . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court dismissed the application . It stated , firstly , that it had no jurisdiction to rule on the applicant federation \u2019s objections concerning the thresholds for parliamentary representation ( barreras electorales ) laid down in FAC . Next , it examined the applicant federation \u2019s allegations of irregularities in the vote count and upheld the decisions which the electoral councils had taken to the federation \u2019s detriment . Thirdly , it added that the other alleged irregularities , which had not been sufficiently established , did not form a basis on which the elections could be declared void or the list of elected candidates amended in accordance with the applicant federation \u2019s wishes .", "The applicant federation lodged an appeal with ORG ( recurso de amparo ) on the basis of LAW . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the amparo appeal . It held :", "\u201c The application of statutory thresholds or exclusion clauses has been endorsed by this court \u2019s case - law as a means of refining the principle of proportionality , a \u2018 guiding imperative\u2019 that shapes , but does not predetermine , the decision - making freedom of a democratic legislature , with a view to avoiding the excessive and dysfunctional fragmentation of ORG , thereby facilitating governance and the work of the parliamentary bodies ... representing the various political forces ...", "Consequently , the imposition of an electoral threshold or barrier \u2013 that is to say , a requirement that a fixed percentage of the vote must be obtained for candidates to be eligible to take part in the distribution of seats in accordance with established models DATE can not be said to infringe the rights enshrined in LAW ( the right to participate in public affairs and the right of access to public posts on equal terms ) .", "Furthermore , the prior allocation , regardless of population size , of a set number of seats to each constituency of an electoral region , is not unconstitutional ... Quite apart from the \u2018 guiding imperative\u2019 referred to above , other constitutionally valid concerns , such as the need to ensure , for geographical or , indeed , demographic reasons , that all the territorial areas making up the electoral region are adequately represented , serve in themselves as justification for the electoral system in question . The system established by ORG , whereby the number of residents per seat must lie within specified limits in each of the constituencies , is in no way manifestly disproportionate or arbitrary .", "The appeal is therefore inadmissible and the reasons given for the application of electoral legislation in the judgment appealed against are sufficient from a constitutional standpoint . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Parliament ( ORG ) shall represent the NORP people and shall be composed of ORG and the ORG .", "CARDINAL .

In matters within the ORG \u2019s field of competence , ORG may endow all or some of ORG with powers to enact legislative provisions for themselves in accordance with the principles , bases and guidelines set out in national legislation . ...", "CARDINAL . The ORG may , by means of an institutional Act , transfer or delegate to the Autonomous Communities powers within its own sphere of competence that are , by their very nature , capable of being transferred or delegated . ... \u201d", "\u201c In the ORG approved by means of the procedure laid down in the foregoing Article , the institutional organisation of ORG shall be based on : a legislative assembly elected by universal suffrage according to a system of proportional representation that also ensures that the various geographical areas of the ORG are represented ; a ORG with executive and administrative functions ; and a President , who shall be elected by the assembly from among its members and appointed by the King , and who shall preside over ORG and act as the supreme representative of ORG and the ordinary representative of the ORG within the ORG . ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL .
