On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel asked ORG of GPE to release the applicant . She submitted , in particular , that he had been detained in GPE on the basis of the arrest warrant of DATE and had remained in custody for DATE . In GPE , his country of nationality , the criminal proceedings against him had been discontinued on the ground that no criminal offence had been committed . In any event , after CARDINAL years\u2019 investigation the investigators had gathered all the available evidence including statements by witnesses , and the applicant could not therefore interfere with the establishment of the truth . Finally , his release was necessary on medical grounds because his health had seriously deteriorated in detention .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE a deputy Prosecutor General of GPE authorised an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial until DATE , that is , for a total of DATE from the date of his initial detention in GPE .

For instance , the criminal - procedure laws do not provide for suspension of the renewed detention period pending examination of an application for supervisory review of the decision to refer the case back for additional investigation ... This means that the examination of final judgments , decisions or rulings by means of [ supervisory ] review does not suspend either the enforcement of the judgment or the [ additional ] pre - trial investigation if the case has been referred back for additional investigation [ by a court decision ] .", "... Accordingly , in the present case , [ the lodging of an application for supervisory review ] suspended not the detention period , but the additional investigation , as it is inconceivable that suspension of the detention period in such a case would be conducive to the implementation of a citizen \u2019s right to liberty and personal integrity enshrined in LAW .", "...
