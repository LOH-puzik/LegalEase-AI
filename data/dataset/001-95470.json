He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant and his wife PERSON , also a NORP national , lived in GPE where they operated their own company . They have QUANTITY children , PERSON born in DATE and NORP born on DATE . In DATE the applicant and C. separated , and DATE PERSON moved out of the marital home .", "On DATE C. \u2019s residence permit for GPE expired , she could now stay in GPE only up to DATE within a DATE period ; upon request dated DATE C. \u2019s right of residence was for humanitarian reasons prolonged once until DATE . On DATE C. registered as a resident in GPE , GPE , at her mother \u2019s address . With letter dated DATE the applicant terminated ORG \u2019s employment contract in view of her residence permit status in GPE .", "Since DATE C. repeatedly travelled to GPE with NORP for medical treatment and for visits . In particular , in DATE D. underwent surgery in GPE because of a kidney tumour . On DATE C. and NORP moved into their own flat in PERSON , but continued also to live in the former marital home in FAC , which had been assigned to C. by ORG decisions of DATE and DATE . From DATE C. stayed in GPE with NORP more often ; in DATE she moved her household and personal effects from Russe to Olpe .", "In DATE C. filed a divorce petition with ORG in Russe . In a hearing on DATE she informed the applicant and the court that NORP had a suspected kidney tumour which she wanted to have treated in GPE . The parties concluded a settlement , approved by the court , whereby the applicant agreed that C. assume custody of NORP until the end of the divorce proceedings , and that she could leave GPE with NORP at any time . At the same time contact rights for the applicant were set . In DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request that this settlement be modified , awarded C. also custody of A. and assigned the former marital home to her . In DATE this decision was modified by ORG to that effect that custody of A. was now awarded to the applicant . In DATE C. withdrew her divorce petition . Consequently , the proceedings were discontinued .", "The applicant then filed his own divorce petition and on DATE ORG , by way of temporary measure , awarded C. custody of NORP and the applicant custody of NORP until the end of the divorce proceedings . ORG also set contact rights for both parties with regard to the other child and assigned the former marital home to C. This decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a request for the return of NORP to GPE , or alternatively for contact rights , pursuant to the provisions of LAW ( hereafter \u201c LAW ) . On DATE the ORG appointed a guardian ad litem ( PERSON ) for NORP On DATE ORG submitted a report regarding NORP \u2019s social situation . On DATE , following CARDINAL oral hearings , in which ORG heard the applicant , C. , NORP and the guardian ad litem , it granted the applicant \u2019s request and ordered C. to return NORP to GPE . In its decision ORG mainly relied on a letter from ORG dealing primarily with a request of ORG under LAW in respect of DATE as well as on a corresponding private expert opinion submitted by the applicant . It argued that ORG had been awarded custody of NORP only as a temporary measure until the end of the divorce proceedings . Her custody right therefore had to be interpreted as limited to the territory of GPE . Consequently , ORG considered the removal of NORP to GPE wrongful under LAW because it violated the applicant \u2019s joint custody right in so far as a change of NORP \u2019s residence outside of GPE was concerned .", "C. appealed the decision . On DATE the ORG ordered the applicant to submit a certificate of illegality ( Widerrechtlichkeitsbescheinigung ) pursuant to LAW . By a letter dated DATE , submitted with an LANGUAGE translation , ORG stated that :", "\u201c ... the care for the child NORP is granted to the mother , in accordance with the usual residence of the child . The personal contact with the child [ A. ] ... \u2013 too . This contact has to be realized exactly in GPE . Subsequent changes of the enacted temporary measures , motivated eventually by a changed place of residence of the mother , do not reflect on the executive force of the court decision . ... \u201d", "On DATE , following an earlier oral hearing to which it had summoned NORP but had then refrained from hearing him because of his young age , ORG ordered C. to adhere to the contact regime set out by ORG but dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to return NORP to GPE . It found that , irrespective of whether NORP or NORP law was applicable , since ORG had sole custody of NORP his removal had not been in breach of any custody right of the applicant . It could be deduced neither from the NORP courts\u2019 decisions nor from the provisional character of those decisions that the right was limited to the territory of GPE . ORG was not convinced by the reasoning of ORG and the private expert opinion ; it found that their interpretation did not follow from the NORP courts\u2019 decisions or the relevant provisions of NORP law and was not substantiated by case - law or professional literature . It further found that while a certificate of wrongness was meant to facilitate the determination of whether there was a violation of a custody right it did not bind the court . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint . On DATE ORG refused to accept the constitutional complaint for examination , stating that it was inadmissible without giving further reasons .", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The objects of the present Convention are \u2013", "a ) to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any ORG ; and", "b ) to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of CARDINAL ORG are effectively respected in GPE . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where DATE", "a ) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person , an institution or any other body , either jointly or alone , under the law of the ORG in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention ; and", "b ) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised , either jointly or alone , or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention .", "The rights of custody mentioned in sub - paragraph a ) above , may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision , or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that ORG . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c For the purposes of this Convention \u2013", "a ) \" rights of custody \" shall include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and , in particular , the right to determine the child \u2019s place of residence ;", "b ) \" rights of access \" shall include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child \u2019s habitual residence . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting ORG may , prior to the making of an order for the return of the child , request that the applicant obtain from the authorities of the ORG of the habitual residence of the child a decision or other determination that the removal or retention was wrongful within the meaning of LAW , where such a decision or determination may be obtained in that ORG . ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
