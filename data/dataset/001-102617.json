The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is currently a member of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was elected President of GPE . He took office on DATE , following his inauguration . On that occasion , in accordance with LAW , he took an oath to be loyal to GPE and the LAW , to fulfil the duties of his office conscientiously , and to be equally just to all .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant issued Decree no . DATE , countersigned by the Minister of the ORG , granting NORP citizenship \u201c by way of exception \u201d ( i\u0161imties tvarka ) to a NORP businessman , PERSON , who had been awarded the Medal of PERSON and ORG in DATE by the applicant 's predecessor , PERSON , for services to GPE ( he was subsequently divested of the medal following the events outlined below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Seimas ( ORG ) requested ORG to determine whether Presidential Decree no . DATE was in compliance with the LAW and LAW . The LAW submitted that the procedure of granting citizenship by way of exception appeared to have been applied inappropriately in this case . In particular , it asserted that ORG had no special merit warranting his exceptional treatment and that the applicant had in fact granted him citizenship as a reward for his substantial assistance by financial and other means to the applicant 's election campaign .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the request for consideration as case no . CARDINAL . On DATE it held a public hearing and examined witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an article was published in a NORP DATE newspaper , PERSON , reporting that the President of ORG had been seen in a coffee bar with the Deputy Speaker of the Seimas , who had been closely involved in the inquiry into the applicant 's activities . The newspaper implied that during this informal meeting the CARDINAL officials had discussed the proceedings taking place in ORG , thus casting a shadow of suspicion over that court 's objectivity . The CARDINAL men had subsequently said that they often met professionally and socially , and denied discussing the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the above - mentioned newspaper article , the applicant 's lawyers challenged the President of ORG for bias , seeking his removal from the examination of case no . CARDINAL . Their challenge was dismissed on the ground that the mere fact that the CARDINAL officials had met informally did not constitute a basis for the withdrawal of a judge from proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave its ruling in case no . CARDINAL , finding that Decree no . DATE was not in compliance with LAW , LAW of the LAW , the constitutional principle of the rule of law and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On the last point , ORG observed that citizenship could be granted by way of exception only to persons who had never been NORP citizens . It noted in that connection that PERSON , a NORP citizen by birth from a NORP military family , had acquired NORP citizenship under LAW of DATE , by which citizenship could be granted , inter alia , to persons who on DATE had had their permanent residence and permanent place of work or source of income in GPE . In DATE ORG had ruled that \u201c soldiers of GPE who previously served in the NORP occupying military forces unlawfully stationed in the territory of GPE [ could ] not be regarded as permanently residing and working in GPE \u201d . On DATE ORG ( established in DATE under LAW for LAW ) had found that ORG 's status was unlawful , since he had served in the NORP armed forces . It had nevertheless recommended that his status be regularised in accordance with the above - mentioned section CARDINAL , by which exceptions could be made for persons who had acquired citizenship in good faith before DATE on that unlawful ground . On DATE ORG of ORG had followed that recommendation . However , in DATE PERSON had applied for NORP citizenship , which he had been granted in DATE ; on DATE he had been issued with a NORP passport , thereby losing his NORP citizenship . ORG observed that the applicant had signed Decree no . CARDINAL on DATE even though ORG of ORG had reminded him DATE before that PERSON had previously lost his NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that , as a result , Decree no . DATE was also in breach of LAW of LAW \u2013 which provides that the President is to grant citizenship in accordance with the procedure established by law \u2013 and the constitutional principle of the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court went on to note that , although the NORP authorities had already made an exception in his favour by regularising his status in DATE , ORG had acquired NORP citizenship in DATE . This showed that \u201c citizenship of GPE was of less value to [ J.B. ] than citizenship of the GPE \u201d . ORG further noted that ORG had informed the applicant , prior to DATE , that an investigation was being carried out into PERSON 's activities as director of an aviation company and , on DATE , that ORG had threatened to disseminate information discrediting the applicant if the latter failed to keep his promise to appoint him as an adviser . In ORG view , the applicant had knowingly ignored these circumstances , although they were of crucial importance in deciding whether or not to grant citizenship to PERSON by way of exception . Having regard also to the fact that PERSON had made a significant financial contribution to the applicant 's election campaign , it concluded that the decision to grant him citizenship had been \u201c determined not by any merit rendering [ J.B. ] worthy of becoming a citizen of GPE , but by his significant assistance by financial and other means to [ the applicant 's ] election campaign in DATE \u201d . Thus , \u201c the granting of citizenship to [ J.B. ] by way of exception was nothing but a reward by the President of GPE to [ J.B. ] for the aforesaid support \u201d ; consequently , in issuing Decree no . DATE , the President had heeded \u201c neither the LAW ... nor the law , nor the interests of the people and the ORG , but purely his own interests \u201d . The court therefore concluded that the applicant had \u201c afforded [ J.B. ] exceptional treatment and knowingly disregarded the fundamental principles enshrined in LAW and LAW respectively , whereby all persons are equal before ORG institutions or officials , and the President of the Republic must be equally just to all \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a public speech on DATE , and again in his New Year speech , the applicant declared that \u201c politics [ had ] taken precedence over the law \u201d in ORG ruling . In reply , on DATE ORG issued a public statement emphasising its independence and noting , inter alia , that the applicant had attempted to undermine its authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL members of the Seimas submitted a proposal to initiate impeachment proceedings against the applicant . On DATE the ORG set up a special commission to investigate the reasonableness and seriousness of certain allegations about the applicant 's conduct , in order to determine whether such proceedings should indeed be initiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the special investigation commission concluded that some of the charges levelled against the applicant were founded and serious . Accordingly , it recommended that the NORP institute impeachment proceedings . ORG had apparently provided the commission with transcripts of secretly taped telephone conversations involving the applicant . The applicant 's lawyers were not given access to the transcripts by the ORG or by the commission , because it had decided not to rely on them .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE the Seimas decided to follow the special investigation commission 's recommendation and requested ORG to determine whether the specific acts of the applicant cited by the commission had breached LAW . The impeachment charges submitted to ORG included the following allegations in particular , involving purely private interests to the detriment of those of the nation , thus discrediting the institution of the presidency :", "\u2013 that the applicant had undertaken to perform a number of actions in ORG 's favour in exchange for financial and other forms of support during his election campaign , and had later acted under PERSON 's influence ;", "\u2013 that , as a reward for this support , the applicant had unlawfully granted NORP citizenship to ORG ;", "\u2013 that he had disclosed a ORG secret by informing PERSON that the secret services were investigating his activities , notably by telephone tapping ; and", "\u2013 that he had exercised undue pressure on the management decisions of a private company in order to secure pecuniary advantages for certain people close to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the request for consideration as case no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyers sought the removal of the President of ORG and all its members on grounds of bias , arguing that they had in effect already determined the case in the previous ruling of DATE in case no . CARDINAL . The challenge was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In a declaration of CARDINAL DATE the ORG unsuccessfully proposed that the applicant tender his resignation in order to avoid protracted impeachment proceedings . The declaration alleged that his actions had become increasingly unpredictable and represented a danger to the ORG , its citizens and the prestige of the presidency .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG concluded that the applicant had committed gross violations of the LAW and a breach of his constitutional oath on account of the following acts :", "DATE unlawfully granting citizenship to J.B. by Decree no .
