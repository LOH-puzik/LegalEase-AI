NORP The applicant in the first application , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE . At the time he lodged his application he was a prisoner at FAC in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr F. Taaffe , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant in the second application , Mr PERSON , is also an NORP national , who was born in DATE . He too is detained in FAC . He was represented before ORG by Mr J. Cuddigan , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was convicted of murder on DATE and was sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , DATE . An appeal was unsuccessful . His situation was reviewed for the first time by ORG in DATE . The Minister for ORG , LAW ( now the Minister for ORG and ORG , hereafter \u201c the Minister \u201d ) decided that Mr PERSON should not be released at that time , and that his situation should not be considered again for a further DATE . ORG considered Mr PERSON \u2019s situation again in DATE , DATE and in DATE . In its last review of his case , ORG recommended to the Minister that an escalating programme of temporary release be put in place for Mr Lynch . The Minister accepted the recommendation and the programme has since commenced . According to the Government , it entails attendance DATE at a voluntary agency that works with offenders , and TIME releases per month .", "CARDINAL . Mr Whelan was convicted on DATE of the crimes of murder and attempted murder . He was sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , DATE and , on DATE he was also convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to a term of DATE to be served consecutive to the life sentence . The order of sentence was subsequently reversed by ORG . PERSON completed his first sentence in DATE , having benefitted from the standard remission of PERCENT of the total duration imposed at trial ( DATE ) . He then commenced his consecutive life sentence . His situation was reviewed by ORG in DATE with a second consideration due to take place in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL applicants later challenged their detention as contrary to the LAW in a number of respects and also to the LAW . Their challenge was rejected by ORG on DATE , and their appeal was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not accept that , by prescribing a mandatory life sentence for murder , the legislature had intruded into the domain of the judicial branch . It described murder as \u201c the ultimate crime against society as a whole \u201d , \u201c a crime which may have exceptional irrevocable consequences of a devastating nature for the family of the victim \u201d and a crime that \u201c by its very nature has always been considered at the highest level of gravity among all forms of homicide or other crimes against the person \u201d . It stated :", "\u201c For the reasons already indicated that crime has always and legitimately been considered to be CARDINAL of profound and exceptional gravity and , in the ORG \u2019s view , CARDINAL for which the ORG is entitled to impose generally a punishment of the highest level which the law permits . Given that it is an offence which is committed when , and only when , a person is unlawfully killed and that the person so doing intended to kill or cause serious injury it is one which can therefore properly be differentiated from all other crimes including manslaughter .", "The ORG is of the view that the learned trial judge was correct when she concluded \u201c ... there can be nothing offensive in the ORG promoting respect for life by concluding that any murder even at the lowest end of the scale , is so abhorrent an offensive to society that it merits a mandatory life sentence ... \u201d . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also rejected the argument that the mandatory life sentence was contrary to the principle of proportionality in sentencing . It stated :", "\u201c ...... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG then considered the argument that , in substance , a life sentence was not a determinate sanction because the actual duration of imprisonment was decided systematically by the Minister , and that in so doing he was guided by considerations of a preventive nature . It noted , firstly , that it had been affirmed many times in case law that preventative justice or detention forms no part of NORP law . A convicted person may not be sentenced by a court or detained by an executive order for a preventative or non - punitive purpose . It was a \u201c misconception that the punitive element of the life sentence terminates on temporary release \u201d ; \u201c even where the release is open - ended ... the released prisoner remains liable to arrest and return to imprisonment to continue serving the life sentence should he be in breach of the conditions \u201d . Temporary release was a privilege or a concession accorded at the discretion of the executive , not a right of a prisoner . ORG stated :", "\u201c In the ORG \u2019s view a life sentence imposed pursuant to s. CARDINAL of the Act of DATE is a sentence of a wholly punitive nature and does not incorporate any element of preventative detention .", "It is a sentence which subsists for the entire life of the person convicted of murder . That person may , by virtue of a discretionary power vested in the executive , be temporarily released under the provisions of the relevant legislation on humanitarian or other grounds but he or she always remains liable to imprisonment on foot of the life sentence should the period of temporary release be terminated for good and sufficient reason .", "It may be appropriate at this point to note that in the event of a prisoner \u2019s privilege of temporary release being withdrawn by virtue of a breach of the conditions of that release the Minister , or any person acting on his behalf , is bound to observe fair procedures before withdrawing the privilege of temporary release ... Should the Minister fail to observe such procedures or otherwise act in an unlawful , arbitrary or capricious manner in terminating the release for a breach of his conditions or otherwise , the prisoner may seek to have that decision set aside by way of judicial review before the courts .", "In all these circumstances the ORG does not consider that there is anything in the system of temporary release which affects the punitive nature or character of a life sentence imposed pursuant to s. CARDINAL . In particular a decision to grant discretionary temporary release does not constitute a termination let alone a determination of the sentence judicially imposed . Any release of a prisoner pursuant to the temporary release rules is , both in substance and form , the grant of a privilege in the exercise of an autonomous discretionary power vested in the executive exclusively in accordance with the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to reject the argument that because the Minister was required to have regard to , inter alia , the gravity of the offence and the risk posed by the prisoner to public safety , it made the process of temporary release akin to a sentencing exercise . Consideration of such matters did not mean that the Minister was exercising a judicial function and , in particular , it did not mean that a decision not to release because of a risk to safety converts the punitive sentence for murder into a preventative one . It stated :", "\u201c It is a necessary incident to the exercise of a purely executive discretion that the decision - maker would be bound to have , before directing a person \u2019s release on any of the possible grounds , have regard to a whole range of matters of which CARDINAL are specified in s. CARDINAL subs . CARDINAL of the Act of DATE . Inevitably CARDINAL of those considerations which ought to be taken into account in the making of any such decision are the gravity of the offence and the risk which the temporary release would pose to the public . A decision to grant temporary release even for a short period such as to permit a prisoner to attend a family funeral would necessarily involve a consideration of any potential risk that that would have for the safety of members of the public . Such a consideration is incidental to the discretionary power and its purpose . ... Refusing temporary release is a decision not to grant a privilege to which the prisoner has no right . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG next considered the applicants\u2019 arguments , based on LAW and on certain judgments of this ORG , that under NORP law a life sentence was in reality an indeterminate one , which in practice was determined by the Minister in the form of a grant of temporary release . This , it was argued , constituted executive interference in the judicial function of sentencing and was prone to arbitrariness . The court stated :", "\u201c The power of the executive , in this case the Minister , to release a prisoner ... is a distinct executive function and does not constitute a determination of what punishment a person should undergo as a consequence of his crime . It is in the form of an exercise of clemency or commutation and ( sic ) although it may bring to an end the period of incarceration , subject to conditions in the case of temporary release . As already pointed out the life sentence imposed by the ORG continues to exist notwithstanding any conditional release and he may be required to continue serving it if there are found to be good and sufficient reasons in accordance with law to withdraw the privilege of temporary release , or the period of release simply expires . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the distinction between these CARDINAL functions was recognized by this ORG in its judgment in GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ECHR DATE . Having cited several passages from the judgment , it stated :", "\u201c In its analysis ORG made a clear distinction between the imposition of a mandatory and punitive life sentence by a court and the exercise of an executive discretion to commute , remit or grant conditional release which gives the prisoner a de facto and de jure prospect of release at some point . It clearly did not consider that the existence of an executive discretion to grant conditional release or commutation to constitute the determination or imposition of a sentence by the executive .", "...", "Provided a causal connection remains between the detention and the punishment imposed by the court of trial , the sentence can not be considered arbitrary or in breach of Article CARDINAL ) . The discretionary power of the executive to grant conditional release on humanitarian or other grounds does not affect the lawfulness of the continued detention of a person as long as that detention is punitive by reason of its nexus with the sentence imposed following conviction . \u201d", "ORG held that on any objective analysis of the sentences currently being served by the CARDINAL applicants , their detention remained , de jure and de facto , in accordance with the punishment provided by law and ordered by the court of trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG then distinguished the legal situation in GPE from that which prevailed in GPE , the latter having been found in a number of judgments of this Court to be contrary to LAW . ORG noted that the sentencing regime in GPE which was under scrutiny in the judgments relied upon by the applicants was \u2018 radically different\u2019 to the sentencing regime in GPE . The sentencing regime which was found to be incompatible with the Convention featured a dual element \u2014 a punitive element identified as the \u2018 the LOC period and the subsequent preventative element . Once the prisoner had served the punitive element of the sentence , the nexus between the crime and its punishment was terminated . In ORG noted that the prisoner had been recalled after release even though he must have been regarded as having served the punitive element for his offence of murder . That being so , his detention after recall could not be justified as \u2018 punishment for the original murder\u2019 which led ORG to conclude that his detention on foot of the original mandatory life sentence violated LAW . That was , said ORG , in stark contrast to the longstanding position in NORP law .", "CARDINAL .
