The applicant lives in LOC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was a member of a hunting association , ORG , based in PERSON ( hereafter \u201c the association \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the association \u2019s executive board initiated internal proceedings against the applicant before its disciplinary commission . The executive board sought the applicant \u2019s suspension until the next session of the association \u2019s general meeting ( skup\u0161tina ) for reporting a member of the association to the police , falsely accusing him of the criminal offence of intimidation . The executive board argued that by doing so the applicant had committed a serious breach of his duties as a member , a disciplinary offence stipulated in the association \u2019s internal regulations .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the disciplinary commission dismissed the disciplinary action against the applicant . No appeals were lodged against that decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The executive board nevertheless referred the matter to the general meeting for re - examination , convening an extraordinary session .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the general meeting adopted , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , a resolution expelling the applicant from the association . He was informed that he could appeal against that decision and that any appeal would be examined at the general meeting \u2019s ( regular ) annual session .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , but the general meeting \u2019s resolution was upheld by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL following the adoption of another resolution at the DATE session held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The general meeting did not give any reasons for expelling the applicant in either of its resolutions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a civil action against the hunting association in ORG PERSON u GPE ) , whereby he asked the court to declare unlawful the general meeting \u2019s resolution of DATE and to reinstate him as a member . He relied on section DATE ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and argued that the decision to expel him had been adopted in breach of the procedure provided for in the association \u2019s statute and its internal regulations on disciplinary proceedings . In particular , he submitted that , in the absence of appeals against the disciplinary commission \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the general meeting could not have overridden that decision because under the association \u2019s statute that commission was the only body authorised to decide on the expulsion of a member .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s action inadmissible , on the grounds that the matter was outside the jurisdiction of the courts . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW suggests that legal protection by way of civil action in the county court could be sought only if ORG or the other relevant body of the association had failed to examine a member \u2019s report regarding irregularities in the implementation of the statute [ of the association ] , or had failed to correct such irregularities .", "Such a civil action would therefore be aimed at securing the implementation of the statute of the association , and thus would not provide for legal protection in the sense that a specific decision ... of the association could be declared unlawful .", "Under section CARDINAL of the defendant association \u2019s Statute [ GPE ] the disciplinary tribunal imposes disciplinary measures against members who have breached their duties stipulated in the statute . According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the defendant association \u2019s Rules on Disciplinary Proceedings and Disciplinary Liability of Members , a request for review may be lodged with ORG [ to contest ] ORG decision to expel [ a member ] . The time - limit for ORG to adopt a resolution on the request is not stipulated . ORG resolution is final .", "... since the plaintiff in his action does not seek [ legal ] protection envisaged in section DATE ) of LAW , but asks [ the court ] to declare unlawful the defendant \u2019s resolution to expel him , on which [ issue ] it is for ORG to make a final decision ... this case does not fall within the jurisdiction of the courts ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant then appealed against that decision to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance decision , reasoning as follows :", "\u201c The first - instance court was correct in declaring the action inadmissible , because the case does not fall within the jurisdiction of the courts ...", "In particular , pursuant to section DATE ) of LAW ... the conduct of associations is supervised by their members , and if a member finds irregularities in the implementation of the statute he or she is entitled to report it to the relevant body of the association designated in the statute or to ORG if there is no relevant body designated in the statute . Furthermore , if the written report is not examined at ORG or by the relevant body of the association designated in the statute within DATE of its submission , or if irregularities are not corrected , the member may bring a civil action in the county court within whose area of jurisdiction the registered office of the association is situated , with a view to protecting his or her rights as stipulated in the statute .", "The said provision ... governs jurisdiction of the courts regarding the right of the members of an association to supervise its conduct . That right does not entail the power to contest the lawfulness of a decision adopted in disciplinary proceedings against the plaintiff as a member , as correctly explained in the impugned [ first - instance ] decision .", "In this connection it should be taken into account that the case concerns membership of a ... voluntary organisation [ where ] members may under the internal rules regulate the protection of [ their ] membership rights . Therefore , the decision to expel a member does not fall within the jurisdiction of the courts under section DATE ) of LAW .", "The defendant association is not an entity vested with public authority , and the decisions it adopts are not administrative acts , which means that the plaintiff \u2019s action could not even be examined by ORG under the [ relevant provisions ] of LAW . That is also the opinion of ORG , as expressed in the case ORG .", "It follows that the county court was correct in deciding that courts have no jurisdiction to decide on the plaintiff \u2019s action ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
