The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , in the GPE region . She is a NORP citizen and belongs to the GPE ethnocultural minority .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , on an undisclosed date , ORG opened criminal proceedings against the applicant for fraud ; she was reproached in particular for the fraudulent appropriation of the sum of MONEY ( MONEY ) and the jewels of a certain PERSON On DATE , she was sentenced to trial in ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings , ORG heard the prosecution and defence witnesses , gathering documentary evidence and the conclusions of experts . The concerned party claimed that on DATE of the events in question , DATE , she was in GPE , a town QUANTITY from the victim \u2019s village , and that she had consulted a doctor because she had felt ill . She submitted a doctor \u2019s medical certificate and had her son \u2019s companion interviewed . In her defence speech , her lawyer emphasised that the police had not found significant amounts of money or jewellery at the applicant \u2019s home . She challenged the reliability of the identity parade carried out at the preliminary stages of investigation and drew the court \u2019s attention to the contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution \u2019s witnesses as to the age and the physical appearance of the applicant who had defrauded the victim . The lawyer insisted that the first of CARDINAL prosecution witnesses , a neighbour , had seen a woman of GPE origin approaching and speaking with the victim , but that she was not in a position to recognize the individual . In addition , during the identity parades and in the courtroom , the second witness , another neighbour , had stated that she was not sure whether the applicant was the woman who had defrauded the victim . As for the third of these witnesses , the counsel for the applicant noted that she was the granddaughter of the victim and invited the court not to grant credit to her statements . The lawyer admitted that the applicant had previously been sentenced for theft . However , her last conviction was DATE .", "CARDINAL . In her defence speech , the district prosecutor invited the court to recognize the applicant guilty of the alleged facts : she had been recognized by the victim and CARDINAL witnesses against her . The testimony of a third witness corroborated the conclusion that the concerned party had fraudulently taken the money and jewels of the victim . She invited the court not to grant credit to the evidence of the defence \u2019s witness , who was among those close to the applicant . In view of the preponderance of mitigating circumstances in the present case and of the applicant \u2019s state of health , the prosecutor argued in favour of a suspended conviction and a sentence close to the minimum provided for by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , consisting of a professional judge and of CARDINAL lay assessors ( \u0441\u044a\u0434\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 ) , pronounced its judgment in which it found the applicant guilty of defrauding PERSON and sentenced her to DATE of imprisonment . The reasons for the judgment were issued to the applicant in DATE and bore the signature of the professional judge who had presided over ORG trial . At the beginning of these reasons , among other personal information used to identify the applicant , such as her place and date of birth , her home address and her unique identification number , her GPE origin was also listed . In the fact - finding portion of the reasoning , the court found that the accused had entered the victim \u2019s home fraudulently , suggesting to her that her family had been struck by black magic which she could dispel . Taking advantage of PERSON \u2019s credulity , she took the money and jewellery that she then kept in her home . The court based these findings on the statements of the prosecution witnesses which it found to be consistent with the other evidence gathered . It did not retain the statements of the defence witness who had explained that the applicant had visited relatives in GPE in DATE and that she had consulted a doctor there . The court refused to take into account the medical certificate presented by the applicant : even if it was dated DATE , there was no date after its reference number , as is normally the case . Similarly , the doctor had affixed his stamp on the document , but it lacked the stamp of the hospital . The court found that the sentence should be CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment because of the balance between the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in this case . Among the aggravating circumstances , it mentioned the negative data on the applicant \u2019s personality , previous convictions , the absence of a stable job , the gravity of the alleged acts , the high amount of money taken by the applicant , and the operating mode thereof . The court held as a mitigating circumstance the advanced age of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused to suspend the execution of the DATE sentence for the following reasons :", "\u201c The decision to impose an effective sentence of imprisonment in this case arises from the legal obligation for the court ( LAW ) to determine whether suspension of the sentence \u2019s execution is compatible with the objectives of the penal sanction . The court considers that this is not the case in this case , especially as there is a feeling of impunity , especially among members of minority groups , for whom a conditional sentence is not a conviction ( this concerns general prevention ) . Moreover , this conclusion is equally valid with regard to special prevention \u2013 the execution of the sentence imposed will prevent [ the applicant ] from committing other criminal offenses and [ will enable her ] to correct her behaviour and to rehabilitate herself . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this judgment . She considered that the court based its findings on the statements of the prosecution \u2019s witnesses , who did not prove her implication in the acts alleged against her , and that the lower court refused to obtain evidence corroborating the defence \u2019s case . At her request , ORG questioned the doctor who issued the medical certificate , as well as the nurse who worked with him . Both confirmed that the applicant had come to the doctor \u2019s office on TIME for a matter of high blood pressure . The examination was finished after TIME . In her plea , the applicant \u2019s lawyer reiterated her arguments before the first - instance court concerning the credibility of the prosecution \u2019s witnesses\u2019 statements and the accountant \u2019s alibi ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and argued that the lower court had taken into account the applicant \u2019s ethnicity to justify its decision . She invited the regional court to acquit her client or to give her no more than a suspended sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG upheld the judgment of the first - instance court . It upheld again the statements of the prosecution \u2019s witnesses , which it considered consistent with the other evidence . It did not uphold the statements of the applicant \u2019s son \u2019s companion , believing that they were not sufficiently specific . It found that the applicant \u2019s allegation that she had , on DATE , consulted a doctor in GPE was well established . However , in the absence of any indication as to the exact time of the medical visit , the court found that , given the length of the consultation and the distance between the town of GPE and the victim \u2019s village , in theory as well as in practice , the interested party would have had the opportunity to go to PERSON \u2019s home at the time indicated by the witnesses , namely TIME on DATE . In its part on the appropriateness of suspending the execution of the sentence , the judgment of ORG reads as follows :", "\u201c The appeal court shares the reasons for the inapplicability of a suspended sentence with respect to PERSON . It agrees wholeheartedly with the opinion of the initial court that a possible suspension of execution could not contribute to the accomplishment of the objectives of general and specific prevention because , on one hand , it would have created a feeling of impunity , and on the other , it would not have prevented [ the applicant ] from resuming her wrongful behaviour , and the sentence would not have had a deterring effect on other members of society . \u201d", "This judgment was not subject to appeal in ordinary cassation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG provided for by LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , point CARDINAL of LAW . She claimed that her conviction was unfair , discriminatory , and contrary to domestic law and to international conventions ratified by GPE , including LAW . The applicant requested ORG to order the re - examination of the case or to potentially modify the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In her defence brief submitted to ORG , the applicant \u2019s counsel challenged in particular the courts\u2019 reasoning concerning sentencing and the refusal to suspend the execution of the sentence . It argued that the file contained no information which could lead to the conclusion that there was negative information on the applicant \u2019s personality . The applicant had received a pardon after her prior convictions , which obligated the courts to no longer consider her criminal record as an aggravating circumstance . Given the unemployment rate in the country and the age of the applicant , the lack of a stable job could not be considered as such a circumstance . As for the gravity of the events , this was part of the very characteristics of the penal infraction for which the conviction had been made , which prevented the courts from taking up the same argument for also arguing it as an aggravating circumstance . Moreover , according to the consistent legal precedents of the domestic courts , the amount of the money appropriated was not significant . The decision of the courts not to suspend the execution of the applicant \u2019s sentence was motivated by her membership with a minority ethnic group . The applicant \u2019s counsel argued that this same motivation demonstrated the bias of the court that had sentenced her client .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG found that the lower courts had correctly established the facts on the bases of the relevant evidence gathered during the criminal investigation and in court . They had correctly characterized the established events as fraud and determined the length of the sentence imposed by taking into account the seriousness of the events and the personality of the applicant in light of previous criminal infractions . ORG admitted that the formal conditions for a sentence suspension had been met , particularly in view of the fact that the applicant had been rehabilitated . However , it found that the conviction of an effective sentence was justified for the following reasons :", "\u201c It has been rightly admitted [ by the lower courts ] that the execution of the sentence was indispensable and justified from society \u2019s point of view . Thus , the accused will be deprived of the opportunity to resume her wrongful behaviour and [ the penal sanction ] will have a deterring effect on other members of society . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW proclaims the principle of equality of citizens before the law and prohibits any restriction of their rights or privileges based on , among others , race or ethnicity . LAW , paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( hereinafter the ORG ) , obligates the courts , the public prosecutor \u2019s department , and the bodies responsible for the criminal investigation to apply the law uniformly to all citizens .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , the court may suspend enforcement of the sentence of imprisonment imposed if the term of imprisonment does not exceed DATE , if the concerned party has not already been convicted to a term of imprisonment for a criminal offense prosecuted ex officio and if the court finds that the objectives of the penal sanction can be attained without the imposition of an effective penalty . The existence of a previous conviction does not preclude , in principle , the application of LAW , if the party in question has benefited from rehabilitation ( see , for example , ORG \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u041a\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u043d.\u0434. \u2116 GPE , NORP \u043d.\u043e. ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , the imposition of a criminal penalty has the following objectives : to correct the behaviour of the convicted person and encourage him or her to respect the laws and virtue ; to prevent the possibility for him or her to commit other criminal offenses ; to prevent criminal offenses by other members of society and encourage in them respect for the law and good virtues .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW ORG , the judgments of regional courts rendered in the appeal court , when they confirm the judgments of initial courts , are not susceptible to ordinary appeal .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , these judgments can be criticised for the same deficiencies which justify appeal in cassation ( non - observance of substantive or procedural legislation or imposition of an unfair penalty ) before ORG by the appeal provided by LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , point CARDINAL of the ORG . This plea , which the legislature regulated in the chapter of the ORG dedicated to the reopening of criminal proceedings , can be introduced by the sentenced person , through the court of first instance ( LAW , paragraph CARDINAL ) within DATE from the date of the judgment of the appeal court ( LAW , paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . If ORG finds any of the aforementioned breaches of substantive or procedural rules , it is bound to overturn the judgment of the lower court and may remit the case for reconsideration , terminate the criminal proceedings , acquit the person concerned or amend the judgment under appeal ( Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In view of Articles CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL and LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , point CARDINAL of the ORG , the public prosecutor is obligated to request the reopening of the criminal proceedings of a convicted person within DATE of the judgement of ORG finding a violation of the LAW , if the violation found is of particular importance for the outcome of the criminal proceedings .
