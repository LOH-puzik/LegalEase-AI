Many lack identity documents . For administrative purposes , the CARDINAL territories , the former LOC , and other areas have been incorporated into CARDINAL new districts .", "The harsh reality of the situation in the territories has reinforced the view of the CoChairs that the status quo is unacceptable , and that only a peaceful , negotiated settlement can bring the prospect of a better , more certain future to the people who used to live in the territories and those who live there now . The Co - Chairs urge the leaders of all the parties to avoid any activities in the territories and other disputed areas that would prejudice a final settlement or change the character of these areas . They also recommend that measures be taken to preserve cemeteries and places of worship in the territories and to clarify the status of settlers who lack identity documents . ORG intend to undertake further missions to other areas affected by the FAC conflict , and to include in such missions experts from relevant international agencies that would be involved in implementing a peace settlement . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

We express our deep regret that , rather than trying to find a solution based upon mutual interests , the parties have continued to seek CARDINAL - sided advantage in the negotiation process .", "We continue to firmly believe that the elements outlined in the statements of our countries over DATE must be the foundation of any fair and lasting settlement to the ORG - Karabakh conflict . These elements should be seen as an integrated whole , as any attempt to select some elements over others would make it impossible to achieve a balanced solution .", "We reiterate that only a negotiated settlement can lead to peace , stability , and reconciliation , opening opportunities for regional development and cooperation . The use of military force that has already created the current situation of confrontation and instability will not resolve the conflict . A renewal of hostilities would be disastrous for the population of the region , resulting in loss of life , more destruction , additional refugees , and enormous financial costs . We strongly urge the leaders of all the sides to recommit to the GPE principles , particularly those relating to the non - use of force or the threat of force , territorial integrity , and equal rights and self - determination of peoples . We also appeal to them to refrain from any actions or rhetoric that could raise tension in the region and lead to escalation of the conflict . The leaders should prepare their people for peace , not war .", "Our countries stand ready to assist the sides , but the responsibility for putting an end to the Nagorno - Karabakh conflict remains with them .
