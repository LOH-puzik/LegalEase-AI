He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of several offences and sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment . The court also ordered confiscation of the proceeds gained by the applicant from the offences ( \u201c the confiscation order \u201d ) .", "On DATE the then ORG of GPE partly quashed the lower court \u2019s decision since the statutory rules on time - barred prosecutions had been wrongly applied .", "On DATE ORG stayed the criminal proceedings against the applicant . It did so because the public prosecutor had withdrawn the charges as the prosecution had become time - barred . It also ordered restoration of the confiscated funds to the applicant ( \u201c the restoration order \u201d ) . This decision became final on DATE .", "On DATE ORG partly upheld a request by the applicant for enforcement of the restoration order . It ordered restoration of the confiscated funds , but refused to award interest because no provision for interest had been stipulated in the restoration order . The court also found that the confiscated funds had been transferred to GPE ( \u201c the Municipality \u201d ) and ultimately to the then ORG of the ORG . An appeal by the ORG was finally dismissed by a court decision of DATE . The confiscated funds were actually restored to the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant brought a civil action against the Municipality and the ORG claiming interest on the funds . He claimed interest for the period between the actual confiscation of the funds and their restoration .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim as premature . It established that on CARDINAL DATE the applicant had sought compensation for wrongful conviction before the then ORG for ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) only in respect of his earnings and other rights deriving from his employment , but that he had not claimed interest on the confiscated funds . On DATE the ORG upheld that decision .", "On DATE ORG allowed an appeal by the applicant on points of law and quashed the lower courts\u2019 decisions . It found that his claim should not be regarded as a request for compensation for wrongful conviction and that , accordingly , he had not been required to apply to the relevant Ministry .", "On DATE ORG ruled partly in favour of the applicant , allowing his claim only in respect of unpaid interest on the national - currency funds . It dismissed his claim for statutory interest on the foreign - currency funds . It further established that the foreign currency funds had actually been restored to the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG partly upheld the lower court \u2019s decision and remitted the dismissed part for reconsideration .", "On DATE ORG granted a request by the public prosecutor for the protection of legality ( \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430 ) and quashed the lower courts\u2019 decisions . It found that they had wrongly applied the national law by awarding double interest on the foreign currency funds .", "On DATE ORG , after having obtained an expert report , upheld the applicant \u2019s claim and ordered GPE to pay him interest on the confiscated funds .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to enforce that decision .

It found that they had incorrectly applied the civil - law rules on compensation instead of the provisions of LAW concerning wrongful convictions .", "On DATE ORG Instance dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim in respect of the Municipality and declared it inadmissible in respect of the State . The court found that the applicant had failed to submit his claim to the ORG and that , accordingly , he had not been entitled to claim compensation on that ground in the civil proceedings .", "On DATE ORG allowed an appeal by the applicant and remitted the case for re - examination .", "On DATE ORG Instance dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It found that ORG had not pardoned the applicant or overturned his conviction on the merits , but had quashed it solely because of the time bar . The court therefore concluded that the applicant had not been wrongly convicted and that , consequently , the ORG had not been liable to pay any damages .", "On DATE the ORG allowed an appeal by the applicant and ordered a retrial . It held that his claim should not be considered under the rules for wrongful conviction , but as a civil compensation claim .", "On DATE the President of ORG refused a request by the applicant for exclusion of the judge sitting in his case .", "On DATE ORG Instance dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It established that the applicant \u2019s compensation claim for interest in respect of his wrongful conviction had been submitted to the ORG out of time . It held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... the court finds that the applicant \u2019s compensation claim concerns unpaid interest on confiscated funds ... since the legal ground of that claim is the confiscation of the funds , as a security measure issued within the criminal proceedings , the case is to be analysed under the rules on compensation for wrongful conviction and detention ... Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , a plaintiff [ the applicant ] can claim compensation before the authorised ORG body and is entitled to receive compensation within DATE on which a decision staying the proceedings becomes final . In the instant case the decision of PERCENT , by which the criminal proceedings ... were stayed , was served on the applicant on DATE and became final on DATE . On DATE the plaintiff submitted his claim for unpaid interest on the confiscated funds to the ORG for ORG . On DATE the latter instructed the plaintiff to submit his claim to the court of competent jurisdiction . It transpires that the deadline for the plaintiff \u2019s claim was DATE . The application lodged on DATE was therefore time - barred ... \u201d", "The court further found that the funds had been confiscated in lawful judicial proceedings . ORG of GPE had neither pardoned the applicant nor found substantial procedural deficiencies . It had quashed the applicant \u2019s conviction merely because of the time bar . The court therefore went on to conclude that the ORG could not be held liable for damage sustained by the applicant . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant in which he had , inter alia , expressed doubts about the impartiality of the first - instance court judge .", "In DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG in which he restated his arguments that his claim should be considered under the civil - law rules on compensation .", "On DATE the public prosecutor submitted observations to ORG supporting in part the applicant \u2019s appeal related to his claim against the ORG . It stated that interest should be calculated as of DATE when the restoration order had become final until restoration actually occurred .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal by the applicant on points of law and upheld the lower courts\u2019 findings that the damage had derived from the criminal proceedings and that , accordingly , compensation should have been sought under the rules related to wrongful conviction . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
