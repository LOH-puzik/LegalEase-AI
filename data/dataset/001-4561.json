This decision was filed with the court \u2019s registry on DATE .", "", "Following the father 's appeal against these decisions , on DATE ORG acknowledged that the applicant had always taken care of her children , insofar as it had been possible for her , and that she was willing to co - operate in order to improve her children 's living conditions . It considered therefore that the best solution in the children \u2019s interests was to maintain the bonds of affection between the children and their mother .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL prohibits anybody from divulging any information concerning adopted persons , with the exception , according to the interpretation of the doctrine and jurisprudence , of cases where there is a concrete interest , legally protected , in having access to secret information . The court explained that such concrete interest must be proven to exist in respect of the adopted persons and must be invoked by their guardian or legal representative .
