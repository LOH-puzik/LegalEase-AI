On DATE he was convicted , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , by a naval court - martial of unlawfully and maliciously wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to the Offences Against the Person Act CARDINAL . He was sentenced to , inter alia , DATE imprisonment and to be dismissed from the service and reduced in rank . He was also ordered to pay ORG MONEY compensation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court - martial comprised a President ( a Captain of the Royal Navy ) , CARDINAL naval officers ( a Commander , CARDINAL Lieutenant Commanders and a Lieutenant ) and a Judge Advocate ( Commander PERSON ) . The Judge Advocate was a naval barrister who was working as the naval legal advisor to ORG ( the command responsible for the organisation and deployment of all ships at sea ) . His rank was lower than that of the President of the court - martial . The prosecution was conducted by a Lieutenant Commander of the staff of ORG . The applicant chose to be represented by a naval barrister . The defending and prosecuting officers were junior in rank to the Judge Advocate and the defending officer was senior in rank to the prosecuting officer .", "CARDINAL . At the beginning of the court - martial the Judge Advocate directed the members of the court - martial as follows :", "\u201c As Judge Advocate it 's my role to ensure that the trial is conducted in accordance with the law and I am here to advise and guide you . I will have no role in the finding on the facts . You must accept what I say on matters of law and procedures [ as ] being correct . If you have any questions of me during the trial ... they must be asked of me in open ORG in the presence of the accused , his friend and the prosecutor and any such questions should pass through you ... as President . That means ... that now that this trial has commenced , you and your court can have no direct communication with me except in open ORG and therefore if I seem to avoid you outside the environs of the ORG ... that 's the reasoning behind that and please do n't think I am being rude ...", "Now you and your colleagues may discuss the case when you are together and in private if you so wish , but my strong advice to you at this stage is to resist the temptation until you 've heard all the evidence and indeed my own summing up . You must be particularly rigorous in not discussing the case at all during adjournments in the trial when you could be overheard by others such as during lunch in the LOC room where a room has been set aside for you and particularly TIME since you must not be influenced by anything said to you or which you observe which is not evidence in the trial . I will warn you of this ... each time we adjourn and particularly when we adjourn at DATE proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to vary the court - martial 's verdict and sentence . In his advice to ORG , the Judge Advocate of the ORG commented that the trial had been \u201c well conducted by all concerned \u201d , that the main directions of law in the Judge Advocate 's summing up were \u201c impeccable \u201d and that any errors were , in any event , favourable to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a single judge of ORG rejected his appeal , as did the full court on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provides that any person subject to naval law who commits a civilian offence , whether in GPE or elsewhere , shall be guilty of an offence against that section .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW lists the punishments available to a court - martial following conviction and establishes , as a matter of law , the relative positions of each punishment in the hierarchy of punishments available ( the \u201c ORG \u201d to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . An allegation that a person subject to naval law has committed an offence must be reported to the CO of the accused . The ORG must investigate the charge after which the ORG may dismiss the charge , refer it to ORG or try the accused summarily .", "CARDINAL . ORG is a senior naval officer . Although he is not legally qualified , he is legally advised by a barrister . He must decide , in respect of cases referred to him by a ORG , whether to refer the matter back to that ORG to be dealt with summarily ( unless the accused has already elected trial by court - martial ) ; to refer the matter to ORG for a decision as to whether the accused should be prosecuted ; or to drop the charges . ORG decision is essentially a command decision , ORG being required to ask himself whether there are service reasons for prosecuting or not . Once ORG has taken this decision , he has no further involvement in the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP The role of prosecutor is performed by ORG . ORG is appointed by Her Majesty the Queen ( section CARDINALH of the DATE Act ) and is accountable to the Attorney - General for the performance of his prosecuting functions .", "CARDINAL . In almost all cases ( PERCENT of cases prosecuted in DATE and CARDINAL ) the Prosecuting ORG appoints barristers to prosecute cases from his own staff , which barristers work exclusively for ORG . On occasion , however , the Prosecuting ORG appoints prosecutors from a list of uniformed naval barristers who are eligible to act as prosecutors but who do not , in their general duties , work directly for ORG ( unlike in the army and air force where prosecutions are carried out exclusively by prosecutors on the staff of the relevant Prosecuting ORG ) . Such an officer may be working in a legal or non - legal post , but will always be outside the chain of command of the accused and will always be answerable for his duties as a prosecutor to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Naval barristers appointed to act as prosecutors are members of ORG and GPE and are consequently subject to the professional arrangements and ethical duties of LAW ( including a duty to act with independence and in the interests of justice ) . ORG and all acting prosecutors also apply the Code for Service Prosecutors which has been endorsed by the Attorney General and which sets out how their duties should be carried out .", "CARDINAL . Following the Higher ORG 's decision to refer a case to it , ORG has an absolute discretion , applying similar criteria as those applied in civilian cases by ORG , to decide whether or not to prosecute and , if so , to determine precisely what charges should be brought . ORG conducts the prosecution ( Part II , Schedule I to LAW ) , which is brought on behalf of the Crown .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is a civilian and a civil servant , working in \u201c one of the secretariats dealing with naval service discipline policy issues \u201d . The ORG is responsible for making the arrangements for courts - martial , including arranging venue and timing , ensuring that a Judge Advocate and any court officials required will be available , securing the attendance of witnesses and selecting members of the court . The ORG is appointed by ORG . Before commencement of the court - martial hearing , the power to dissolve it is vested in the responsible ORG .", "CARDINAL . Naval courts - martial consist of a President , CARDINAL serving naval officers of DATE military experience and a Judge Advocate ( since the entry into force of LAW CARDINAL - \u201c the DATE LAW warrant officers may also sit as members ) . The distinction made between district and general courts - martial in the army and air force does not exist in ORG . Contrary also to the position in the army and air force , ORG does not appoint , and has never appointed , Permanent Presidents of courts - martial ( \u201c PPCMs \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In ORG the role undertaken by the Judge Advocate General ( \u201c JAG \u201d ) for the army and air force is divided between CARDINAL appointments : the Judge Advocate of the Fleet ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) and the Chief Naval Judge Advocate ( \u201c CNJA \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is an experienced civilian lawyer . The current ORG has been a circuit judge since DATE . He was appointed as ORG in DATE by Her Majesty the Queen on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor , to whom the ORG is responsible . LAW of the DATE LAW provides :", "\u201c Nothing in this part of the Act shall prejudice the exercise by the [ ORG ] of his functions of considering and reporting on the proceedings of courts - martial and disciplinary courts , or any other of his functions in relation to such courts . \u201d", "The prime responsibility of the ORG is to review all naval courts - martial , save for those in which the accused pleads guilty , so as to be able to advise ORG whether or not they have been properly conducted according to law . If , in the opinion of the ORG , they have not been so conducted , he has the power to recommend to ORG that the conviction be quashed or that the finding of guilt or the sentence be altered .", "CARDINAL . The LAW , on the other hand , is a service appointment . He is appointed by the First Sea Lord ( Chief of Naval Staff ) on the advice of the Naval Secretary and must be a barrister of suitable experience and rank . Save for his judicial role , he is responsible to LOC ( Chief of Naval Personnel ) , who is the senior Admiral responsible for personnel policy . His judicial role is described as part of his \" ancillary duties \" for which he is solely responsible to the ORG .", "The LAW 's primary purpose is to be the principal advisor within ORG on all matters of law , including naval , criminal , employment , maritime and international law . His secondary purpose is to \u201c ensure that sufficient naval officers are trained as barristers and thereafter appropriately appointed to legal billets to provide the legal services required by commands , including headquarters \u201d . Among his \u201c principal \u201d tasks \u201d is to assist the ORG and consult with him on matters of law and legal policy , to select officers for legal training and to supervise their duties . Sitting as Judge Advocate at complex courts - martial and appointing barristers to sit as Judge Advocates are among his \u201c ancillary tasks \u201d ( section CARDINALB(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Any Judge Advocate sitting in a court - martial must have been qualified for DATE ( section CARDINALB(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act ) . In addition , as a matter of policy , reflected in the ORG 's terms of reference , ORG has for DATE appointed only serving officers as Judge Advocates . The reasons for this policy have been described by the current CNJA ( ORG PERSON ) as follows :", "\u201c ... because they understand the particular and unique way of life of ORG , gained through their own operational experience . They can advise and direct the court in terms which reflect their detailed knowledge of the ORG , and which therefore enhances the credibility of their role in the eyes of all the parties involved . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The manner of appointment of a naval Judge Advocate is also different to the process in the army and the ORG . The appointment process is known as \u201c ticketing \u201d , a process which involves both the LAW and the ORG . The ORG regularly assesses the experience and qualities of those who are appropriately qualified , using the same criteria for judicial qualities as are applied by the Lord Chancellor for civilian judicial appointments . He then consults with the ORG as to suitability for appointment . The ORG will have had an opportunity to assess the qualities of such candidates and their suitability for ticketing since his review of the court - martial proceedings may also involve an assessment of the qualities of the prosecuting and defending barristers . With the ORG 's agreement , the CNJA then writes to inform a successful candidate of his or her appointment or \u201c ticketing \u201d . Such an appointment is for an undefined period of time . A Judge Advocate , once ticketed , remains on the list until he or she leaves the service or voluntarily resigns from the list . No Judge Advocate has ever been removed from office , although some have voluntarily withdrawn because they have decided to concentrate on operational appointments within ORG . If the question ever arose , grounds for removal would be precisely the same as those for a civilian judge , and the decision would be taken by the ORG .", "Once \u201c ticketed \u201d , these officers gain experience by assisting at a court - martial with an experienced Judge Advocate . They then proceed to cases where they sit as Judge Advocate where the accused pleads guilty , so that sentencing is the only matter at issue . It is then for the LAW to assess when the Judge Advocate in question is ready to officiate in contested cases . At that point Judge Advocates are appointed to individual cases by the LAW , by his letter of appointment , but the practice is that there is no selection as the Judge Advocate is appointed by rota on a \u201c cab rank \u201d basis , the only criteria being that the Judge Advocate is not excluded by section CARDINALC(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL LAW . Accordingly , a list is kept by the ORG of \u201c ticketed \u201d Judges Advocates , and the name at the top of the list is appointed to the next court - martial . That Judge Advocate 's name then goes to the bottom of the list and such persons will not be appointed until his or her name rises to the top of the list again . Such ticketed barristers may be serving in either legal or non - legal appointments : those serving in legal appointments sit as Judge Advocates on average for DATE each year and those serving in non - legal appointments will normally sit for less .", "There are currently CARDINAL practising Judge Advocates CARDINAL of whom is serving in a ORG appointment and is not therefore reported on by his ORG superiors .", "CARDINAL . Judge Advocates are responsible solely to the ORG for the performance of their professional duties at courts - martial while in office . As noted above , the ORG reviews all contested courts - martial which result in a conviction . In advising ORG , the ORG will comment on the Judge Advocate 's handling of the proceedings and his summing up . He may also pass \u201c professional comments about the judicial performance to the CNJA \u201d . At the time of the applicant 's court - martial , there was a haphazard practice whereby the ORG might provide a Judge Advocate 's reporting officer , at that latter officer 's request , with a synopsis of the ORG 's comments on the Judge Advocate 's performance . The Judge Advocate who officiated at the applicant 's court - martial was not so reported upon and that practice has since ceased . The CNJA does not sit on any promotion board of any officer who has served as a Judge Advocate and has no control over or effect upon their promotion . Judge Advocates receive no additional or separate pay for duties in such office and their pay and promotion can not be affected by their performance or status as a Judge Advocate .", "ORG CARDINAL , which came into force after the present court - martial , provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It follows that Judge Advocates must be free from any supervision or restraint in order to carry out independently the duties required of them by law . In the conduct of their professional duties at courts - martial Judge Advocates are accountable , only in so far as the standard and performance of their duties is concerned , to the [ ORG ] .", "CARDINAL . The [ ORG ] is solely responsible for reporting on the professional performance of Judge Advocates in the conduct of their duties in court - martial trials . No other personal report , assessment or other document is to be prepared or used to determine whether an officer conducting Judge Advocate duties is qualified to be promoted , or is qualified or suited for particular appointments or training . Where Judge Advocates are appointed to general appointments , or whilst carrying out their general duties , nothing in this article shall prevent the appropriate reports being prepared on them concerning their conduct of those duties , for promotion , appointing or training purposes . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appointment of the members of the court - martial proceeds by way of a random selection : the ORG requests ships and establishments to nominate officers to serve as court - martial members . There was also a list of volunteers who had put their name forward as being available and prepared to sit as a court - martial member . ( Since the entry into force of the CARDINAL Act , the appointment of members has been by way of a random selection from a computer generated database of eligible personnel ) .", "Section CARDINALC(CARDINAL)(b ) of the DATE Act excludes from selection for courts - martial the CAOs , the COs of the accused , members of ORG , investigating officers and all other officers involved in inquiring into the charges concerned . Rule CARDINAL of the DATE Rules also excludes an officer serving under the command of ORG referring the case , ORG or the CAOs . The members of the court - martial are not legally qualified although most will have attended a previous court - martial as an observer . They will also have attended a Divisional Officer 's Course where they will have received instruction on summary trials and many will have attended the Junior Staff Course which includes a lecture on Naval Discipline .", "CARDINAL . The members of a court - martial remain subject to naval discipline in the general sense since they remain naval officers , but this is subject to their not being reported on in relation to the carrying out by them of their duties as members of the court - martial and , in particular , in relation to their judicial decision - making . Attempting to influence , or influencing , a member of a court - martial amounts to the common law offence of perverting the course of justice and/or to the offence of conduct to the prejudice of good order and naval discipline ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL .

They are also advised that , should they subsequently discover that they do know someone , they should advise the Judge Advocate .", "CARDINAL . At the outset of the court - martial , the names of the members of the court - martial ( of the Judge Advocate , the President and of the ordinary members ) are read out and an accused can object to any member of the court - martial .", "CARDINAL .

ORG is ORG which has delegated its functions to ORG ( also known as ORG ) which in turn has delegated that task to the Naval Secretary .", "CARDINAL . Contested cases resulting in a conviction are ( as noted above ) scrutinised by the ORG who provides written advice to ORG as to the safety of the conviction and the conduct of the trial . For guilty pleas resulting in conviction , legal advice is provided to ORG by a senior naval barrister who is himself an experienced Judge Advocate but who does not continue to practice as a Judge Advocate for the duration of his tenure as advisor to ORG , for reasons concerning his independence from the \u201c naval judiciary \u201d .

The sentencing considerations involve factors that are particular to the armed services , in respect of which their judgment and experience are entitled to great weight . A court should be reluctant to interfere with such courts - martial sentencing decisions , particularly where the [ JAG ] has reviewed the matter and has dismissed the petition in the terms in which he did here . The considerations particular to this sort of military offence relate to the significance of the offence for the maintenance of military discipline and efficiency , the need for deterrence , the significance of rank and the availability of other measures from dismissal to loss of rank and pay , which are in many ways not available or not paralleled in the civilian sphere . Indeed some of those factors would also be of particular weight when the [ ORG ] is dealing with offences which do have parallels in the civilian sphere , and would justify caution in interfering with courts - martial sentences ; even more so do they justify caution when dealing with offences which have no parallel in the civilian sphere . \u201d", "The case of NORP v. ORG ( judgment of the ORG of CARDINAL DATE ) concerned a re - trial following a decision of ORG .
