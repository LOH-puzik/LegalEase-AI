The applicants are represented before the Court by Mr PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In decision no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG granted the applicant company a concession to exploit part of a mineral water source near the village of ORG , which was state property , and authorised the Minister of ORG ( \u201c the Minister \u201d ) to sign the concession contract on behalf of the State , which was done on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in decision no . CARDINAL ORG granted another concession for a different part of the same mineral water source to the company Hisar-CARDINAL OOD . This decision was appealed against by another participant in the concession tender procedure , as a result of which , in a final judgment of DATE , ORG quashed it on the ground that , owing to its chemical properties , the mineral water from the source was unfit to serve the purposes of the future concession contract and that it could therefore not be fulfilled .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , as the properties of the water in the applicant company \u2019s concession were the same , it brought an action to have decision no . CARDINAL of ORG declared null and void . The action was granted in a final judgment of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the judgment of DATE , on DATE the applicant company brought an action against ORG seeking to have the concession contract of DATE declared null and void . It further claimed the expenses it had already incurred in connection with the fulfilment of the contract , including costs for equipment for exploiting the source , expenses for preserving and guarding the source , fees for taking part in the concession tender and marketing costs . In these proceedings the applicant company was legally represented .", "CARDINAL . At a court hearing of DATE the applicant company substituted the Minister as the defendant to its action , without specifying in what capacity the Minister was acting . At the same hearing ORG discontinued the proceedings as it found that the Minister could not be sued in her capacity as an administrative body .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed , arguing that the Minister was a party to the concession contract and that therefore she could be sued .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG found that the party to the concession contract was the ORG , represented by the Minister . Therefore , the Minister could be sued . It remitted the case to ORG to continue the proceedings by examining the merits of the action .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s action on the grounds that the Minister , as a State body , could not be sued . It found that the Minister was merely a representative of the ORG in the concession contract and not a party to it . The applicant company , however , had not directed its action against the Minister as a representative of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed , stating , inter alia , that the Minister was a party to the concession contract , and represented the ORG interest in connection with the rights and obligations under the contract .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment , declared the concession contract null and void and granted part of the compensation claim made by the applicant company . Although it mentioned that the ORG was party to the concession contract , it ordered the Minister to pay the awarded compensation .", "CARDINAL . It held that the ORG , represented by the Minister , was the party to the concession contract and that therefore the Minister did have capacity to take part in the proceedings to have the contract declared null and void .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister appealed , arguing that she did not have such capacity as she was not a party to the concession contract but only represented the ORG in signing it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company also appealed . It is not entirely clear from its submissions who it considered to be the proper defendant in the proceedings DATE on the one hand it argued that the Minister was party to the concession contract and on the other hand contended that the Minister was the proper defendant in the proceedings in her capacity as representative of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG and discontinued the proceedings . It found that ORG should not have examined the merits of the claim as it had not been directed against the proper defendant . The court held that the ORG was the concession - granting authority and party to the concession contract because concessions could be granted only in respect of objects belonging to the ORG . The court also found that the rules on representation under LAW were lex specialis and overrode those on representation under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , and that therefore the ORG was represented by the Minister of ORG and not by the ministers under LAW and CARDINAL of the CCP ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This , however , did not mean that the Minister was a party to the concession contract . The Minister could be sued in proceedings related to concession contracts only in her capacity as representative of the ORG . As regards the case at hand , the court considered that neither in its initial statement of claim , nor throughout the proceedings did the applicant company specify that its action was directed against the Minister as a representative of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed before the extended panel of ORG , which , in a decision of DATE , declared the appeal inadmissible as lodged against a final judgment which was not subject to further appeal .", "CARDINAL . The Concessions Act DATE provided that a concession was a special right to use and exploit objects owned exclusively by the ORG ( section CARDINAL ) . In section CARDINAL it provided that ORG adopted decisions to grant concessions . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the same LAW , in such decisions ORG appointed the minister who would organise the concession tender procedure . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the same Act provided that ORG was to adopt a decision in which it determined the concession holder . In this decision ORG also had to authorise the minister appointed under section CARDINAL to sign the concession contract on behalf of the ORG .", "CARDINAL .

LAW ) of the ORG provided that in the event that the concession holder failed to fulfil his obligations under the contract , ORG could authorise the minister appointed under section CARDINAL of LAW to terminate the contract .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , upon termination of the concession contract the concession holder was entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred under that contract .", "CARDINAL . The new Concessions Act , in force from DATE , which is more detailed than LAW , contains similar provisions in respect of the signing , control of the implementation , and termination of concession contracts . An amendment to LAW of DATE introduced section ORG , which provides that in actions concerning the implementation and the termination of concession contracts the ORG is represented by the minister authorised to sign the concession contract and to represent the granting authority in matters connected with the contract \u2019s implementation .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL of the ORG provided that while proceedings were pending before the first - instance court , the plaintiff could join a new defendant or could substitute the initial defendant with a new defendant .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG , the ORG was represented by ORG in court proceedings , and by the Minister of ORG in court proceedings in which ORG property was concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Article CARDINAL of the ORG was amended to include a new paragraph CARDINAL clarifying that , in actions concerning the implementation and termination of concession contracts , the ORG is represented by the minister authorised to sign the concession contract and to represent the granting authority in matters connected with the contract \u2019s implementation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
