The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant \u2019s wife , PERSON , gave birth to a daughter , A.", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant and ORG divorced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LOC childcare and guardianship authority ( hereafter \u201c the childcare authority \u201d ) determined that A. would reside with the applicant during even DATE and with her mother , ORG , during DATE . In DATE and DATE was to live with the applicant for DATE of his choice per month .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant discovered several bruises on A. \u2019s body . Suspecting that she had been beaten and sexually abused by ORG \u2019s new partner , he refused to return PERSON to ORG", "CARDINAL . During DATE lived with the applicant and her paternal grandmother . On several occasions the applicant allowed N. to visit A. in his presence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to the police and to the LOC investigation committee that his daughter PERSON had been beaten and sexually abused by ORG partner . The investigation committee opened a pre - investigation inquiry .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant and LOC both applied to ORG of PERSON for a residence order in respect of A.", "CARDINAL . On DATE was questioned by an investigator in the presence of a psychologist , in the framework of the pre - investigation inquiry . A. stated that she wanted to live with the applicant because he was nice , whereas her mother and her mother \u2019s new partner had treated her badly . She was again questioned by the investigator in the presence of a psychologist on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , and confirmed her previous statements .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG granted ORG \u2019s application for a residence order and refused the applicant \u2019s similar application . The court found that both parents had taken an equal share in DATE upbringing . They both had sufficient financial means and their standard of living was equally satisfactory . However , taking into account ORG \u2019s gender and age , it was preferable for her to be brought up by her mother . A child under the age of twelve could be separated from the mother only in exceptional circumstances . No such circumstances had been established in the present case . N. was employed and had sufficient income . There was no evidence of negligence or mistreatment on her part . A. \u2019s bruises could have been sustained as a result of a fall or in the course of a game , and were insufficient to prove mistreatment . A criminal inquiry into the allegations of mistreatment was still pending . The court - appointed expert psychologist \u2019s finding that A. was emotionally closer to her father and paternal grandmother than to her mother could not be taken into account in the absence of established evidence of mistreatment by the mother . The court concluded that it was therefore in A. \u2019s best interests to live with her mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the childcare authority noted that A. wished to live with her father . An inspection of the applicant \u2019s flat had revealed that he had created all the appropriate conditions for A. \u2019s normal development . The childcare authority therefore found that A. should reside with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE on appeal . It found that ORG had failed to consider the childcare authority \u2019s findings and opinion and had therefore committed a serious breach of the procedure prescribed by law . However , given that the childcare authority \u2019s opinion was advisory rather than binding on the court , the failure to consider that opinion did not warrant reconsideration of the judgment , which was correct in substance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the LOC investigation committee opened criminal proceedings into the alleged mistreatment and sexual abuse of A.", "CARDINAL . As the applicant continued to retain PERSON , ORG applied to ORG for an injunction requiring the applicant to return PERSON to her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed ORG \u2019s application . It found that the applicant had refused to comply with the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , upheld on appeal . It ordered that , in compliance with that judgment , the applicant should return PERSON to ORG On DATE ORG of GPE upheld that judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant applied for a second time to FAC for a residence order in respect of A. At the same time he applied for a restriction of ORG \u2019s parental authority over A.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application and confirmed its previous order to the effect that A. should live with her mother , citing the same reasons as in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The court found no reasons to restrict ORG \u2019s parental authority over A. On DATE ORG upheld that judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE N. kidnapped A. from the applicant . She has since prevented the applicant from seeing his daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE was again questioned by the investigator in the presence of a psychologist . She said that she liked living with her mother and that her mother was treating her well .", "CARDINAL . On DATE was examined by a panel of psychologists appointed by the investigator in the framework of the criminal proceedings . They found that A. was not suffering from any learning difficulties or disorders . However , owing to her age , level of development and susceptibility to external influence , she was unable to give reliable evidence about her relationships with her mother , her father or her mother \u2019s new partner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the LOC investigation committee discontinued the criminal proceedings , finding that there was no evidence of mistreatment or sexual abuse and that the bruises could have been caused by DATE . According to the experts , ORG \u2019s statements that her mother \u2019s partner had treated her badly were unreliable . The witnesses had been unable to provide any information confirming the applicant \u2019s allegations of child abuse .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for a third time to FAC for a residence order in respect of A. He also asked that ORG be deprived of parental authority over A.", "CARDINAL . While those proceedings were pending , ORG lodged an application with ORG , contesting the applicant \u2019s paternity of PERSON She requested that his name be deleted from A. \u2019s birth certificate and that A. \u2019s family name and patronymic be changed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a DNA paternity test established that the applicant was not A. \u2019s biological father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed ORG \u2019s claims . It found that the applicant was not A. \u2019s biological father and terminated his parental status in respect of her . It ordered that the applicant \u2019s name be deleted from ORG \u2019s birth certificate and that A. \u2019s family name and patronymic be changed to a family name and a patronymic not connected with the applicant . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld that judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s application for a residence order and an order to deprive N. of parental authority over A. The court reasoned that as the applicant was not A. \u2019s biological father , he had no standing under domestic law to lodge civil actions concerning parental authority over A. or A. \u2019s residence arrangements . The applicant was absent from the hearing because he was ill .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that decision on appeal . According to the applicant , he had not been informed of the date of the hearing . Nor was he informed about the appeal decision until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG refused to refer a cassation appeal lodged by the applicant to the presidium of that court for examination , finding that no significant violations of substantive or procedural law had influenced the outcome of the proceedings . It noted , in particular , that there was proof in the case file that a letter had been sent to the applicant on DATE informing him of the date of the appeal hearing . Information about the hearing date had also been published on the court \u2019s official website . The applicant had therefore been duly informed of the date of the appeal hearing ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
