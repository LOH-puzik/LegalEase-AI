MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE .", "She is represented before the ORG by Professor PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "The applicant , who is illiterate , was the tenant of ORG", "On DATE ORG requested ORG ( \u201c the Board \u201d ) to grant her a re - possession order on the ground that the applicant had failed to pay rent . The applicant had been put on notice by ORG that she was in arrears of rent in letters dated DATE and DATE , the latter letter containing a warning that legal proceedings might be issued against her if she continued to fail to pay her rent .", "The applicant was notified that she must appear before ORG on DATE at TIME for a hearing on her landlady \u2019s request for re - possession of her home .", "The applicant failed to attend the hearing . ORG did appear and gave evidence in support of her application for re - possession . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be evicted , being satisfied that she had been duly served with notice of the date of the hearing and of the nature of the summons served on her . An eviction warrant was issued on DATE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG , seeking a declaration that her right to a fair hearing had been breached and , in consequence , that the ORG \u2019s decision ordering her eviction was void . The applicant contended in particular that she could neither read nor write and that when she received the summons to appear before the ORG she did not understand its contents . On that account the applicant maintained that she was not in a position to contest her landlady \u2019s claim .", "In its judgment of DATE the ORG ruled against the applicant . The court found that ORG \u2019s application to ORG was served on the applicant on DATE as evidenced by the fact that the applicant signed \u201c the relative postal pink card . \u201d However , she tore up the application , believing it to be a letter from the tax authorities . In the ORG \u2019s opinion :", "\u201c ... the applicant acted unwisely when she tore up official documents not knowing what they referred to . ... It was her choice to remain ignorant of the contents ... since it was within her power to find out what the contents were . Her behaviour was not one in good faith . ... If the ORG gives its approval to the maxim that says where ignorance is bliss it is folly to be wise , then everyone would act stupid in order to avoid paying his due . \u201d", "ORG also gave weight to the fact that the applicant had been warned that her landlady might take legal proceedings against her and for that reason she should have been more cautious when she received official documents .", "The applicant appealed to ORG . She contended inter alia that the court documents sent to her through the post contained nothing to indicate their importance or how she was to proceed .", "On DATE ORG upheld the decision of FAC . The court found that the applicant was highly irresponsible with respect to official documents she received . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that the summons should have been hand delivered by a court official given that postal service of court documents was a universally recognised method of service . The court found that the applicant capriciously chose not to inform herself of the nature of the document she received by seeking the advice of a third party . It concluded that :", "\u201c It is difficult to imagine an appeal which is more frivolous or vexatious than this one . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
