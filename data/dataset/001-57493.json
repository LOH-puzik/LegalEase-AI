Mr. PERSON and his wife Mrs. PERSON were born in GPE in DATE and DATE respectively . They are both NORP citizens and retired .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , Mr. PERSON was appointed Director of the recently - created ORG . Consequently , the applicants , after selling their home in GPE , moved with their family and furniture to GPE . Initially , they occupied a house owned by GPE . However , in DATE , Mr. PERSON bought a plot of land on GPE , on which , after obtaining the requisite planning permission , he built a house , called \" Whiteknights \" . He and his family took occupation of this house on DATE .", "The property 's rateable value was \u00a3 MONEY , of which \u00a3 MONEY was attributable to the house itself . It was then , and still is , \" controlled housing \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , the applicants did not require a licence to occupy the house , since they had \" residence qualifications \" by virtue of ORG ) ( GPE ) DATE ( \" LAW \" ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after Mr. PERSON had resigned from his post in ORG , the applicants and their family left GPE and Mr. PERSON took up employment with ORG ( ORG ) . Thereafter , and until he retired in DATE , he worked overseas for various development Agencies on the basis of temporary contracts .", "CARDINAL . From DATE , \" Whiteknights \" was let either to persons with the necessary \" residence qualifications \" or under a licence from ORG ( \" ORG \" ) in accordance with LAW and its subsequent amendments ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . During this period , the applicants corresponded periodically with ORG from various addresses , inter alia , to inquire as to the operation of LAW in the event of their selling the property .", "In DATE , Mr. PERSON transferred ownership of the house to his wife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG wrote to Mrs. PERSON advising her of the current tenant 's intention to leave \" Whiteknights \" and enquiring who would be the next tenant . By letter of DATE , Mrs. PERSON informed ORG that she and her husband proposed to return to GPE . The ORG replied , on DATE , that the applicants were not entitled to occupy their house unless they were granted a licence under LAW Law DATE ( LAW Housing Law CARDINAL \" - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "\" Whiteknights \" was empty after the departure of the last - mentioned tenant on DATE . It appears that neither ORG nor the applicants received any request to let the house after DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicants returned to GPE from GPE and they lived temporarily with Mrs. PERSON 's mother in GPE .", "On DATE , Mrs. PERSON wrote to ORG advising it that she and her husband intended to return to \" Whiteknights \" to retire . She added that she was currently seeking a teaching post in GPE . Furthermore , the house required various repairs , some of which the applicants proposed to carry out themselves . Accordingly , in addition to seeking a long - term occupation licence , Mrs. PERSON also requested a temporary licence , until DATE , so that this work could be carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. and Mrs. PERSON went back to GPE and re - occupied \" Whiteknights \" . On DATE , Mrs. PERSON , having received no reply from ORG , wrote again to it repeating her request and stating that she and her husband had returned to GPE .", "ORG replied on DATE , informing Mrs. PERSON that , after having been considered at a meeting on DATE , her application for a long - term licence to occupy \" Whiteknights \" had been rejected in the light of the \" present adverse housing situation \" . The reply also stated : firstly , that the applicants had at no time been granted a licence to occupy this house ; secondly , that even assuming that Mrs. PERSON took up employment considered essential to the community ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicants would not be permitted to stay in their property after her retirement , because she was too old to complete a minimum of DATE in such employment , as required by the Housing Law DATE .", "No reference was made in the letter to the request for a temporary licence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a representative of ORG visited the applicants and furnished them with an official form of application for a temporary licence . They lodged the application DATE , but it was refused by decision of ORG on DATE . Notification of the refusal was given to Mrs. PERSON on DATE , and was accompanied by the reasons therefor , namely :", "- that Mrs. PERSON had failed to adduce evidence showing that she would be employed in a position essential to the community ;", "- that \" Whiteknights \" was likely to be sought after by persons fulfilling the residential qualifications which the applicants lacked ;", "- that in the \" present adverse housing situation \" , ORG was unable in principle to justify granting a licence to the applicants .", "Mrs. PERSON was also informed of her right to appeal from this decision to ORG , under LAW of the Housing Law CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Finally , she was notified that , unless she and her husband could show good reasons to the contrary , ORG would refer their occupation of \" Whiteknights \" to ORG with a view to prosecution if they did not vacate the house within DATE .", "CARDINAL . In their reply of DATE , the applicants repeated their request for a temporary licence at least until DATE , in order to complete the necessary repairs to the property and to put it on the market for sale . They claimed that they had not been \" occupying \" the house , within the meaning of the Housing Law DATE . They maintained that the PERSON could not reasonably prevent them from carrying out the repairs necessitated by the fact that the property had been let for DATE , and that the PERSON allowed them to take the steps required to sell the property , steps which precluded anyone else from occupying it in the meantime . The applicants also contended that they had not been informed until DATE that they required a licence to live in \" Whiteknights \" ; in particular , they had not been notified of the entry into force on DATE of ORG Law DATE ( \" LAW \" ) , which contained new provisions under which they ceased to have \" residence qualifications \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . That letter was considered at a meeting of ORG on DATE . A reply was sent to Mrs. PERSON on DATE , confirming that she had not been notified before DATE of the change in the law or of the need to obtain a licence . ORG also agreed that , if the applicants vacated \" Whiteknights \" by DATE , it would take no action in respect of their unlawful occupation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mrs. PERSON requested a further extension , until DATE , of the applicants ' permission to stay , since the property had not yet been sold . This request was refused on DATE and Mrs. PERSON was so informed on DATE . Furthermore , the applicants were given DATE to leave the house , on pain of prosecution .", "On DATE , Mr. and Mrs. PERSON met the President of ORG and sought , inter alia , permission to remain in their property for DATE , in order to effect the sale . On this occasion , they raised the question of compensation for their loss of residence rights .", "ORG wrote to the applicants on DATE , reporting that their application had been reconsidered on DATE and refused . They were informed that proceedings would accordingly be instituted against them for unlawful occupation , unless they vacated \" Whiteknights \" by DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr. and Mrs. PERSON consulted an advocate in DATE and , on DATE , instructed him to appeal to ORG against all ORG decisions . Such appeals could only be lodged by an advocate of ORG , but the applicants ' advocate failed to file them within the statutory time - limit ( DATE ) .", "However , on DATE he requested ORG to take no action against the applicants until he had had a further opportunity of advising them . On DATE , he submitted on their behalf a fresh application for a licence to occupy \" Whiteknights \" until DATE , in order to effect its sale . In its reply of CARDINAL DATE , ORG stated that :", "\" On DATE ORG noted the contents of your letter but resolved with regret that as [ the applicants ] took occupation without [ a ] licence and have been given an adequate time to vacate the LOC , it is unable to justify withholding action in this matter . The documents in the case have been referred to ORG . \"", "On DATE , the ORG notified the advocate that the further licence application had been refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the advocate notified ORG , the police and the prosecuting authorities that the applicants intended to appeal . However , on DATE the police visited the applicants at \" Whiteknights \" and asked them to make a statement but they refused to do so unless their advocate was present . By letter of DATE to the chief of police , they explained that an appeal was being lodged . They were nevertheless summoned to appear in court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants discovered that the appeal to ORG had not yet been lodged and addressed a complaint to ORG of the Guernsey Bar against their advocate . He finally filed an appeal - in the name of Mrs. PERSON and directed against ORG decisions of CARDINAL May , DATE and CARDINAL DATE refusing the licences - on DATE at TIME This appeal sought the grant of either an unrestricted licence or , alternatively , permission to occupy \" Whiteknights \" until DATE , and alleged that the decisions in question were an unreasonable exercise of ORG discretion and were ultra vires . The appeal was accepted by ORG for examination , although it had been lodged out of time .", "CARDINAL . Later on DATE , the applicants appeared , in accordance with the summons , before ORG . They asked for an adjournment on the ground that Mrs. PERSON 's appeal went to the heart of the question whether their occupation of \" Whiteknights \" was unlawful or not . However , the adjournment was refused on the insistence of the Law Officer .", "The applicants cases were dealt with separately , the charges against Mr. PERSON being taken first . He was convicted of occupying \" Whiteknights \" without a licence and fined . Mrs. PERSON 's trial was adjourned twice and then suspended sine die , the court having taken into account , inter alia , Mrs. PERSON 's appeal to ORG and the fact that Mr. PERSON had appealed against his conviction .", "CARDINAL . The applicants finally sold \" Whiteknights \" on DATE for a price of \u00a3 MONEY , which in their view was less than its actual value .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , which was composed of a President and PERSON , dismissed Mrs. PERSON 's appeal , unanimously as regards ORG decisions of DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) and by a majority of CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL as regards the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . By virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Housing Law DATE , this judgment was final and conclusive .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON 's appeal against his conviction was heard and dismissed by ORG on DATE . Before and during the hearing , Mr. PERSON challenged the accuracy of the transcript of the first - instance proceedings and asked for leave to hear the original tape . This request was refused , but the PERSON of the ORG listened to the tape during a recess and pronounced the transcript accurate .", "Mr. PERSON also alleged that ORG was inherently biased because , with the exception of CARDINAL NORP , its composition was the same as when it had determined his wife 's appeal against the decisions of ORG . He further maintained that the composition of ORG , as such , was archaic .", "CARDINAL . The complaint which the applicants lodged with ORG on DATE against their advocate for delay in filing the appeals against ORG decisions was found to be substantiated on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG is a dependency of FAC . It has its own legislative assembly , courts of law and administrative and fiscal systems , which are separate from those of GPE and GPE .", "The legislative assembly is ORG , which has CARDINAL members and is presided over by the ORG or Deputy Bailiff , both of whom are appointed by the Sovereign . The GPE legislate for the LOC by way of \" Laws \" or , in some circumstances , by way of Ordinances ; the former require approval by Her ORG before they can take effect . Although ORG has power to legislate for GPE , it would be contrary to constitutional convention for it do so in respect of matters domestic to the island , such as LAW .", "ORG is a court of unlimited jurisdiction which sits either at first instance or on appeal . It is composed of the Bailiff , the Deputy Bailiff or a Lieutenant Bailiff , as President , together with CARDINAL PERSON appointed by GPE . The Magistrate 's Court has summary jurisdiction in criminal matters and jurisdiction up to a limited amount in civil suits .", "CARDINAL . Following the liberation of LOC DATE after the Second World War , the return of many families and the influx of a large number of new residents created acute housing problems , which were followed by considerable increases in property prices . To meet this situation , the LOC enacted ORG Provisions)(Guernsey ) Law DATE ( LAW Housing Law CARDINAL \" ) , which came into force on DATE . The PERSON limited the right to reside in GPE without a licence to persons having \" residence qualifications \" , that is persons who had been ordinarily resident there at some time DATE and DATE . The system of housing control introduced by this law has been modified from time to time to meet changing circumstances pertaining in the island .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , this PERSON was replaced by LAW , which replaced the above - mentioned final qualifying date of DATE by DATE . Thus , persons , like the applicants , who had been ordinarily resident in GPE on or before that date had \" residence qualifications \" and were permitted to live there without a licence .", "The new PERSON also freed from control all houses of a \" rateable value \" ( for the purposes of local taxation ) in excess of \u00a3 CARDINAL per annum . Such properties , known as \" open market houses \" , could be occupied by anyone , without any restrictions . Houses with a lower rateable value , on the other hand , fell into the category of \" controlled housing \" and could be occupied only by persons having either \" residence qualifications \" or a licence granted by ORG for the particular house .", "CARDINAL . The Housing Law DATE was amended on matters of detail in DATE and DATE ( with regard to furnished accommodation ) and in DATE , when ORG ) ( Guernsey ) Law DATE raised the minimum rateable value for \" open market houses \" to \u00a3 CARDINAL . This was later reduced , by ORG ( Rateable Value ) Ordinance , to \u00a3 MONEY .", "ORG and LAW consolidated all the previous legislation in this area .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , a significant number of people who had \" residence qualifications \" under LAW DATE but had subsequently left GPE , sought to return to the island . On DATE , there entered into force the Housing Law DATE , which added a further requirement as regards \" residence qualifications \" : to possess these the person concerned should not only have been ordinarily resident in GPE at some time DATE and DATE but also in occupation of a dwelling on DATE or be the spouse or child of someone so resident . The PERSON , however , included a saving provision in favour of anyone in lawful occupation of controlled LOC on DATE , but solely as regards those LOC . The applicants therefore ceased to possess \" residence qualifications \" entitling them to occupy \" Whiteknights \" without a licence , since they were not resident in GPE on the relevant date .", "As regards the grant of licences to persons without \" residence qualifications \" to occupy controlled houses , the Housing Law DATE gave ORG discretionary powers which were limited by the enumeration of factors to be considered in deciding particular cases . Furthermore , the PERSON provided for appeals from ORG decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Housing Law DATE , which was originally enacted for DATE , was extended until DATE . On DATE , it was replaced by the Housing Law DATE . This statute preserved the basic distinction between \" open market houses \" , available to all , and \" controlled housing \" for which \" residence qualifications \" or a licence were required . The categories of persons having \" residence qualifications \" were set out in section CARDINAL of the PERSON . It altered the basis of determining \" residence qualifications \" by allowing them also to be acquired by a certain period of lawful , licensed , residence in controlled housing and not only by residence on DATE ( section DATE ) ) . At the same time , certain provisions were designed to preserve existing rights ; in particular , \" residence qualifications \" continued to be possessed by persons who had been both ordinarily resident in GPE at some time DATE and DATE and in occupation of a dwelling on DATE ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(h ) ) . Since the applicants did not possess \" residence qualifications \" , they needed a licence from ORG .", "As far as the granting of a licence was concerned ( section CARDINAL ) , section CARDINAL of the Housing Law DATE enumerated the factors to be taken into account by ORG , including , inter alia :", "( a ) whether the person concerned was engaged in employment considered essential to the community ( sub - section CARDINAL ( a ) - \" essential licence \" holder ) ;", "( b ) whether the number of dwellings similar to that for which application was made and available for occupation was sufficient to meet the housing requirements of persons possessing \" residence qualifications \" ( sub - section CARDINAL(b ) ) .", "However , ORG could , in the exercise of its discretion , take into account \" such other factors as [ it ] may , from time to time , deem necessary or expedient \" ( sub - section CARDINAL ) . According to the Government , prolonged ownership was a factor which ORG took into account in this connection , but it was not given substantial weight in the absence of other special features . The fact that an applicant had formerly possessed \" residence qualifications \" under an earlier law was also a factor to which ORG would have regard but more weight would be attached to the time that the applicant had actually spent in GPE .", "Section CARDINAL of the PERSON provided for an appeal to ORG against the refusal of a licence on the grounds that the decisions of ORG were ultra vires or constituted an unreasonable exercise of its powers .", "Section CARDINAL defined the offence of unlawful occupation as follows :", "\" Any person", "( a ) who occupies or causes or permits any other person to occupy a dwelling in contravention of any of the provisions of this PERSON ; or", "( b ) who contravenes any condition of a housing licence ;", "shall be guilty of an offence and liable , on conviction , to a fine not exceeding QUANTITY , and , in the case of a continuing offence , to a further fine not exceeding QUANTITY for DATE during which the offence continues after conviction . \"", "CARDINAL .
