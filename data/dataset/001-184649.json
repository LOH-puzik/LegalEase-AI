On DATE a criminal medical negligence case was opened against the relevant doctors of the hospital , in which the applicant was granted victim status .", "CARDINAL . The experts of the forensic bureau who had participated in the panel examination ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were questioned as part of the investigation . The majority confirmed the earlier findings , stating that the therapeutic treatment had been adequate , but an assessment of the delay in surgery was the exclusive competence of a surgeon on the panel . The latter reiterated the findings of the report that the surgery had been delayed in view of several previously registered relapses of bleeding . He added however that this might not have made any difference to the fatal outcome .", "CARDINAL . The head of the expert panel further stated that a conclusive finding on the exact cause of death could not be reached without a forensic examination of the body .", "CARDINAL .

He noted that despite the closure of the investigation , the family \u2019s resistance to allow an exhumation of the body to determine the precise cause of death , and the inability to establish criminal responsibility on the part of the doctors in question , the conclusion of the panel of experts that a medical error had been committed in the course of ORG treatment called for \u201c the implementation of adequate measures to prevent similar violations . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a claim with ORG against the hospital , its medical staff and ORG of the ORG . She argued that her son \u2019s death had been caused by medical negligence , namely incorrect and delayed treatment of his gastroduodenal bleeding .", "CARDINAL . DATE , at the request of ORG , ORG of ORG ( \u201c the inspectorate \u201d ) implemented an inspection of the hospital in connection with PERSON \u2019s death , which was carried out by a panel of experts . They reached the following conclusions ( \u201c the second report \u201d ) :", "\u201c The institution is carrying out medical practice without a licence in the following fields : cardiology , plastic and reconstructive surgery , proctology , urology , paediatrics , epidemiology , clinical transfusion and expert assessments of temporary incapacitation .", "In relation to patient PERSON , non - licensed activity was carried out in the following fields : cardiology and clinical transfusion .", "Out of the CARDINAL doctors who took part in patient ORG treatment , the invited specialists ... in endoscopy and ophthalmology do not hold a licence to practise medicine . A neurosurgeon ( currently dismissed from the post ) and an intensive care specialist are practising medicine independently despite being ... junior doctors . The doctor ... working as a transfusion specialist is a certified paediatrician ...", "... [ I]t is evident that the surgery , the sole purpose of which was to definitively determine the cause of bleeding and stop it , was carried out too late . It is difficult to determine whether the scope of the surgery was adequate , as it is impossible to determine the exact location of the ulcer ( there is no forensic pathology examination report concerning the body and the CARDINAL endoscopy specialists reached different conclusions concerning the ulcer \u2019s location ) .", "It is also worth mentioning that a pathomorphological analysis of the material obtained during the surgery was not carried out ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . An undated study of the relevant medical files , ordered by the inspectorate from a professor of surgery at the Tbilisi State Medical University ( \u201c the third report \u201d ) noted the difficulty of making categorical claims in the absence of an autopsy of the body . It nevertheless pointed to a lack of adequate supervision by a surgeon , despite the relapses of abdominal bleeding , inadequacies in the choice of treatment , and a lack of appropriate diagnostic measures for the timely detection and possibly even aversion of the otherwise risky surgery . Stressing that it was conventional treatment methods that had been insufficiently explored , the report continued to note that it would be incorrect to make a categorical assertion , such as in the first report , as regards the medical error in relation to the delay in the otherwise high - risk surgery .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date CARDINAL experts of the forensic bureau gave statements to the court and confirmed the findings of the first report that a medical error had been committed in terms of the delay in surgery . They further indicated that the cause of PERSON \u2019s death , according to the medical records , was gastroduodenal bleeding which could have been averted by timely and adequate medical treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , relying on the expert reports and the medical documentation available in the case files , ORG ruled in favour of the applicant . It concluded that the doctors of the hospital had been responsible for a medical error resulting in the patient \u2019s death . It further noted that the participation in the patient \u2019s treatment of doctors not holding the appropriate medical licences reinforced the conclusion that he had not been offered adequate medical care . The court took the decision of the hospital director of DATE dismissing the neurosurgeon in charge of ORG \u2019s treatment and reprimanding CARDINAL intensive care specialists and a surgeon ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as acknowledgment that medical negligence had been committed in the course of ORG treatment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was awarded CARDINAL NORP laris ( GEL , PERCENT ( ORG ) ) in respect of pecuniary damage . Relying on section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) the court also awarded non - pecuniary damages in the amount of GEL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . As the contract concerning ORG treatment had only been concluded with the hospital , the latter was found to be the only appropriate respondent and was accordingly ordered to pay the corresponding amount . Both the applicant and the hospital appealed , disagreeing with the court \u2019s assessment of the facts and the scope of the award .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s reasoning . It noted as follows :", "\u201c Based on an analysis of the evidence before it , the appellate court concludes that in the course of PERSON treatment in [ the hospital ] the medical negligence of the medical staff ( insufficient attention towards the patient , misdiagnosis ) caused harm to a person \u2019s health and eventually caused the patient \u2019s ... death . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appellate court continued to note that :", "\u201c In addition to establishing that harm was caused to a person \u2019s health as a result of the medical negligence of the [ hospital ] staff , it can also be established from the case files that [ the hospital ] was carrying out unlicensed activities in a number of medical fields and at the same time some of the medical staff did not have authorisation to practise medicine independently , in violation of the requirements of the [ relevant legislation ] ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG of Appeal further found the hospital to be the only appropriate respondent to pay the damages in respect of the medical negligence of the doctors . As regards who should be held responsible for the hospital and its doctors operating without the necessary licences , it was noted that :", "\u201c ORG of the ORG can not be held responsible in the present case ... for [ the hospital ] operating in certain medical fields without the requisite licences considering that , in accordance with LAW , the issuance of such licences is [ the exclusive competence ] of ORG of GPE .", "Accordingly , the claim for ... pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages with respect to ORG of the ORG is groundless . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appellate court upheld the lower court \u2019s award of nonpecuniary damages and increased the amount of pecuniary damages to GEL MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed , disagreeing with the court \u2019s assessment of the facts and the scope of the award .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a decision without holding an oral hearing . Referring to the evidence available in the case files , the court found that despite the fact that the exact cause of death could not be determined without an exhumation of the body , the case files confirmed that gastroduodenal bleeding was the cause of death and that a medical error had been committed in terms of the surgery and an incorrect assessment of the various data .", "CARDINAL . ORG further upheld the lower courts\u2019 findings that the hospital had been carrying out unlicensed medical activities and noted as follows :", "\u201c It is confirmed ... that [ the hospital ] was carrying out unlicensed medical activities in the following fields : cardiology , plastic and reconstructive surgery , proctology , urology , paediatrics , epidemiology , clinical transfusion and expert assessments of temporary incapacitation . Unlicensed medical activities performed in respect of PERSON were in the following fields : cardiology and clinical transfusion . Of the medical staff invited to treat ... PERSON ... the endoscopy specialist and ... an ophthalmologist did not have a certificate [ authorising them ] to practise medicine . [ Those ] appointed as junior doctors ... the neurosurgeon ( currently dismissed ) and ... the intensive care specialist were practising medicine independently . The doctor ... certified as a paediatrician was working as a transfusion specialist . ORG upholds the views of the appellate court that this gave rise to a violation of ... LAW and ... LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that ORG of GPE was the entity responsible for issuing licences to medical institutions and that the applicable legislation did now allow medical institutions and individual doctors to practise medicine without requisite licences ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . It did not elaborate on whether responsibility could be attributed to the respondent ORG of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The award of pecuniary damages in the amount of GEL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) was upheld .", "CARDINAL . As regards the question of non - pecuniary damages , ORG found that domestic law did not entitle the applicant to receive an award for non - pecuniary damage for the death of her son . In particular , it observed as follows :", "\u201c Under LAW , harm caused to a person \u2019s health during his or her treatment at a medical institution ( a result of surgery or misdiagnosis etc . ) shall be compensated on a general basis . In accordance with LAW , monetary compensation for non - pecuniary damage may be requested only in the cases expressly provided for by law , in the form of reasonable and fair compensation . LAW does not define moral ( non - pecuniary ) damage ... Under LAW , not all types of moral harm ( mental suffering ) shall be compensated , even if there is no doubt as to its existence , only those for which compensation is expressly provided for by law ... Accordingly , in accordance with the practice of ORG of GPE , non - pecuniary damage resulting from the infringement of the right to life of a person \u2019s husband , child or other relative shall not be compensated as it is not expressly provided for by law ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG disagreed with the lower court \u2019s interpretation that the right to claim non - pecuniary damages under section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW also applied to the death of a relative , and noted that that right was strictly personal . ORG therefore rejected the applicant \u2019s claim for non - pecuniary damages , noting that :", "\u201c It is undisputed that a parent is subjected to moral pain as a result of the death of a young child , but it shall not be compensated considering that it is not expressly provided for by the law in force . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
