As a result ' GPE has become an instrument for brainwashing and the manipulation of public opinion , \u0430 mouthpiece of the ruling party . We protest against these totalitarian actions , which infringe the rights of television viewers , radio listeners and the freedom of the press as a whole . Breaches of democratic principles of this kind are dangerous , because they destabilise the political situation within our country . We express our solidarity with the actions of the demonstrators , aimed against the forced russification and deliberate destruction of the democratic system . We demand the abolition of censorship within ORG Teleradio - Moldova and respect for the people 's right to accurate , reliable and impartial information . We demand that the authorities respect the democratic and pro - NORP policy which the people of this country have chosen . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

DATE , during the recording of the TIME news bulletin , the fourth applicant , PERSON , refused to read from the script which he had been given which omitted any mention of the protests outside the FAC headquarters . The news crew began to broadcast a report about the demonstrations but , after TIME , the bulletin was interrupted and replaced with a documentary film . Military personnel were summoned to the studio . PERSON was not permitted to present the NORP language news bulletin at TIME , because of her involvement in the protests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a group of ORG staff decided to go on a \u201c go - slow \u201d strike and ORG was elected for that purpose . ORG sent ORG 's President and the Government a list of demands , including the abolition of censorship , and the editors and news - casters decided to start producing uncensored news bulletins . A group of CARDINAL demonstrators gathered outside the FAC building .", "CARDINAL . That TIME ( DATE ) , the President of GPE came to TRM and met with representatives of ORG . He stated that he was also opposed to censorship . However , he rejected a demand to offer the opposition TIME of air - time , on the ground that the demonstrations in FAC were illegal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the fourth applicant , PERSON , included in the script of the TIME news bulletin an item about the response of ORG to certain declarations of the President of GPE and also an interview with the leader of ORG , PERSON PERSON . The Head of the News Section deleted these paragraphs from the script . During the programme , which was broadcast live , PERSON made allegations of censorship and held the redacted script up to camera . Immediately , the Section Head ordered the technician to cut the sound .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG created a special ORG to elaborate a \u201c strategy for improving the work of [ TRM ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following the events of DATE , the first applicant , PERSON , who had formerly read the news in NORP every evening , was permitted to present it only CARDINAL or two evenings a week . On DATE , on the ground that she had made a mistake while reading the news , she was demoted from the position of editor and senior news - reader to that of a junior reporter and was no longer permitted to present the bulletin .", "CARDINAL . She brought employment proceedings against ORG and on DATE ORG held in her favour , ordering FAC to reinstate her in her previous position of news - reader . TRM did not , however , comply with the judgment and PERSON never got her former job back . She was not given enough work as a reporter and was allegedly subjected to harassment and censorship , to the point where she was no longer able to earn a living and had to resign on DATE . She then worked for a press agency and for another television company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the fourth applicant , PERSON , was subjected to a disciplinary sanction in the form of a severe warning ( \u201c mustrare aspr\u0103 \u201d ) for having departed from the authorised script of the news bulletin on his own initiative . In addition , he was demoted from his position of news - reader and deprived of the right to present any news programmes .", "CARDINAL . NORP He brought proceedings against FAC and , on DATE , ORG annulled the disciplinary sanction on the ground that Mr Rusnac did not appear to have breached any contractual obligation by departing from the script . It rejected his claim to be reinstated as news - reader , however , since it found that he had no contractual right to this position which he had filled on the basis of an oral agreement only . On DATE TRM withdraw the disciplinary sanction in compliance with ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . DATE ORG ( \u201c ACC \u201d : see paragraph CARDINAL below ) organised a series of meetings with managers and staff at TRM to discuss the issue of censorship and other problems facing the company . On DATE the ORG published its conclusions , as follows :", "\u201c Both the company 's administration and the staff expressed their interest and desire to find a rapid solution to the conflict , which had given rise to demands and the creation of a strike committee .", "The discussions centred on CARDINAL general themes :", "the politicised nature of ORG and the events that had occurred within [ TRM ] ;", "social and administrative issues , with emphasis on the staff 's unrealised creative potential .", "A long series of events led up to the strike . There had been a very high turnover of senior managers in the company 's central administration and departments , which had serious ramifications . Contrary to their contracts of employment , certain journalists and assistant directors stopped complying with instructions relating to the preparation and broadcasting of programmes , which led to a slipping of established standards and disregard for the rules and requirements of broadcasting . The political bias of certain television journalists is shown by the fact that a group of them immediately gave their support to the demonstrations at FAC organised by the parliamentary opposition party . Taking advantage of the situation this created , the journalists not only improperly breached professional procedures but also did their bit to aggravate the situation in the company by dividing the staff into CARDINAL camps : ' us ' and ' them ' .", "... Disciplinary sanctions , including the withdrawal of the presenter 's licence , were imposed on the journalists who had violated broadcasting procedures . The biased statements of members of ORG were rejected by the majority of ORG staff . This led to the creation of ORG , which has no fewer members than ORG .", "ORG action was not supported by ORG . The members of ORG presented demands not only to the company 's administration and the Government but also to ORG , without informing ORG .", "With regard to the notions of ' censorship ' and ' application of censorship ' in the creative process , there was an attempt to qualify as ' censorship ' the basic requirements imposed by the duty to comply with the obligations of service . At the same time the notions of both ' external ' and ' internal ' censorship were broached .", "In fact , they have tried to use the existence of censorship to justify their own poor quality work and lack of professionalism . Journalists have failed properly to perform the tasks which senior management , with the aim of producing impartial programmes , have entrusted to them . The basic requirements of professionalism are interpreted as a form of diktat or censorship . Nonetheless , it can not be ruled out that certain directors attempted to conduct their own live broadcasting in favour of the party line of the parliamentary majority . Attempts by representatives of ORG power to influence the message conveyed by programmes still persist , although the ORG does not have any concrete examples of this . It is easy to understand that this form of improper influence has led to protests on the part of creative staff . This is typical of television .", "Thus , ' political censorship ' has been defined as a lack of professionalism on the part of certain directors regarding the organisation of the creative process . ' Political censorship ' has evolved into ' intellectual censorship ' .", "It has also been observed that the company 's administration does not forbid the use of the words PERSON , NORP , LANGUAGE language , NORP history , or totalitarian regime in a historical context ; however , it does not allow their use in reports about current events . The demands of the members of ORG have been given air - time . ...", "ORG 's Statute was subjected to the scrutiny of ORG before being adopted by the Government . However , certain ORG and provisions have not yet been reflected in ORG 's creative activity or in the relations between management and staff . The proposals to change ORG into a public institution are aspirational and do not have a financial basis . ...", "So , the ORG , having examined the state of affairs in the ORG - owned company ORG , considers that", "The permanent practice of changing directors and the exertion of pressure on creative staff , which is interpreted as the application of censorship , are incompatible with the activity of the creative workforce .", "The Statute of the ORG - owned company ORG and the possible creation in the future of public posts in television and radio broadcasting should be publicly examined .", "The provisions of the Statute must be strictly complied with by the company , whose responsibility it is to set up a collegial ORG .", "The definitive decision regarding the provision of powerful equipment and funding , including remuneration , should be taken by ORG and the Government .", "The Statute and composition of ORG , and the instructions for preparing and launching programmes must be re - examined . Provision must be made for permanent review of the legislation pertaining to the audiovisual sector and with full responsibility .", "The procedures for the training and reorientation of staff must be revised , and training programmes organised in studios abroad . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

This appendix is based on ORG documents as well as on information available from a variety of other sources , including international and non - governmental organisations . Its purpose is to give an overview of the complex and diverse situation in ORG member states and to identify areas where national audiovisual or media policies , as well as legal , institutional or financial frameworks for public service broadcasting resulting from these policies , may need to be re - examined to become better aligned with ORG .", "Legal framework", "CARDINAL . According to Recommendation No . R ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL , the legal framework governing public service broadcasting organisations should clearly stipulate their independence . The general provisions in Part I of the appendix to that recommendation highlight a number of issues requiring appropriate regulations in order to guarantee that independence . Specific reference is made to the need to regulate the responsibility and supervision of public service broadcasting organisations and of their statutory organs , and to the requirement that there be no form of undue interference in the form of censorship and a priori control of their activities .", "CARDINAL . Almost all ORG member states have established legal frameworks governing public service broadcasting , in a few cases with a clear constitutional basis . The latter reflects the understanding that the legal basis of public service broadcasting should be subject to broad consensus .", "Many of those legal frameworks can be regarded as meeting ORG , in particular to the extent that they declare the editorial independence and institutional autonomy of public service broadcasting organisations and set out rules for the establishment , membership and operation of their governing and supervisory bodies . Some of those regulatory frameworks and the manner in which they are applied in practice are fully consistent with ORG on the subject and , on occasion , can even be characterised as exemplary .", "CARDINAL . By contrast , in a number of ORG member states , legal frameworks for public service broadcasting organisations are unclear or incomplete . In some cases , the applicable regulations are not capable of guaranteeing editorial independence and institutional autonomy of public service broadcasters , whether as a result of the tenor of substantive provisions or of the weakness or absence of mechanisms designed to ensure their application .", "Reportedly , in some cases , while relevant provisions may be adequate , they are disregarded in practice , leaving public service broadcasting organisation under the effective control of the government or political bodies or formations , serving the interests of those bodies rather than society at large .", "On occasion , the provisions relating to governing or supervisory bodies ( as , for example , regarding the selection , appointment and termination of appointment of members ) entail a risk of interference . In this connection , complaints have been voiced to the effect that proposed or actual changes to the regulatory framework in a few member states curtail the independence of public service broadcasters ' governing and/or supervisory bodies .", "Public service remit", "CARDINAL . Resolution No . CARDINAL on the future of public service broadcasting , adopted at the CARDINALth European Ministerial Conference on Mass Media Policy ( Prague , DATE ) , summarises the main missions of public service broadcasters . In this context , it should be recalled that Recommendation Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL on measures to promote the democratic and social contribution of digital broadcasting states that ' public service broadcasting should preserve its special social remit , including a basic general service that offers news , educational , cultural and entertainment programmes aimed at different categories of the public ' .", "Further , the above - mentioned Resolution No . CARDINAL includes an undertaking ' to define clearly , in accordance with appropriate arrangements in domestic law and practice and in respect for their international obligations , the role , missions and responsibilities of public service broadcasters and to ensure their editorial independence against political and economic interference ' .", "In the media context , a genuine public service presupposes the independence of the organisations entrusted with the delivery of that service . It also involves the ability , in terms of legal provisions and material possibilities , to adapt to changing circumstances . This close link between public service remit and independence is the guiding principle behind Recommendation No . R(CARDINAL)CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In practically all ORG member states , the relevant legal frameworks address the question of public service remit .", "While there is great diversity in the approach followed ( for example , as to the degree of detail provided , reflecting each country 's broadcasting strategy and policies , as well as the cultural , economic or political context , mostly by defining it in a clear and comprehensive manner ) , the determination of the remit of public service broadcasting organisations can on the whole be regarded as satisfactory . In some cases , the public service broadcasting organisations ' purpose is particularly well defined , both in terms of immediate aims and the manner in which those aims should be achieved , as well as envisaged future developments ( for example , in view of the new information and communication technologies ( ITCs ) ) .", "CARDINAL . By contrast , in some member states , the remit of public service media is unclear or difficult to apply . This has not paved the way to offering quality services of public interest ( for example , balanced / impartial news programmes ; education and learning ; investigative journalism ; ensuring pluralism and diversity in the media ; minority and local / community programmes ; offering quality entertainment ; and promoting creativity ) which have traditionally distinguished public service broadcasting organisations from commercial ones .", "There has been criticism that , in certain countries , the distinction between public service and commercial broadcasting has become increasingly blurred , leading to what is called ' programme convergence ' , to the detriment of the quality of the programmes offered by the former . While it is important for public service broadcasters to offer entertainment programmes and to seek to reach wide audiences , the distinctiveness of public service content as a whole , vis - \u00e0 - vis commercial output , must also be ensured . Moreover , on occasion , the public service broadcasters are not provided with the legal means or the material resources necessary for the adequate implementation of the public service entrusted to them . This situation can result in poor quality programmes or lead to over - reliance on mass - appeal and revenue - generating programmes , which is not in keeping with the public service remit .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that , in those countries where the situations described in the foregoing paragraph prevail , either there is little knowledge both among professionals and within society at large of the particular mission of public service broadcasters and understanding of the characteristics of public media , or proper performance of the public service mission is prevented by extraneous circumstances . In some of those countries , there would also seem to be a lack of experience as regards public service broadcasting , leading to widespread indifference regarding its role in a NORP society or a lack of confidence that genuine public service in the audiovisual area will be established and safeguarded .", "Remedying these shortcomings , restoring or enhancing the legitimacy of public service broadcasting and , more particularly , raising awareness of and promoting the importance of such a service based on ORG standards is essential . The role of public authorities in this respect should not be underestimated .", "CARDINAL . As already indicated , in some member states , public service broadcasting organisations ' legal framework specifically permits them to adapt in light of developments ( for example , new communication technologies ) . In several member states , while this is not specifically foreseen in the legal framework , nothing prevents them from offering the public service entrusted to them using new formats or platforms . Progress in this area is to be welcomed . In other cases , however , existing provisions do not allow or are interpreted as an obstacle for such development .", "Editorial independence", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of ORG stipulates that ' everyone has the right to freedom of expression . This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority ... ' . In its case law , ORG has repeatedly underlined the importance of this right with regard to freedom of the media and editorial independence .", "CARDINAL . ORG has developed further standards reinforcing freedom of the media and editorial independence .", "In its LAW on freedom of expression and information , adopted on DATE , ORG underlined the objective to ensure the absence of any arbitrary controls or constraints on participants in the information process , on media content or on the transmission and dissemination of information . Further , at the CARDINALth European Ministerial Conference on Mass Media Policy , Council of Europe member states undertook to guarantee the independence of public service broadcasters against political and economic interference . These commitments and objectives have been reiterated in a number of other ORG documents , and are also at the origin of Recommendation No . R(CARDINAL)CARDINAL .", "More particularly , in Part I , Recommendation No . R ( CARDINAL)CARDINAL stipulates that the legal framework governing public service broadcasting organisations should provide for their editorial independence , offers guidance designed to facilitate the guarantee of editorial independence and proscribes interference in the form of censorship or control of their activities .", "CARDINAL . As already indicated , the legal frameworks in many ORG member states make provision for the editorial independence of public service broadcasting organisations .", "In practice , in a majority of member states , public service broadcasters enjoy editorial independence and institutional autonomy . It is generally acknowledged that , in those member states , interference with editorial independence would be met with a strong reaction from the public service broadcasting organisations concerned , as well as by other media , civil society and the public in general . In several member states , legal mechanisms have been set up to deal with such situations should they occur .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in other cases , some public service broadcasting organisations reportedly face interference and pressure . Such allegations concern close ties between public service broadcasters and government , politicians or public or private entities , or the undue influence of such bodies or persons on public service broadcasting organisations , which compromise editorial independence . The situation during electoral periods and campaigns is often highlighted ; it is alleged that , during such periods , leverage over public broadcasters is used to ensure favourable coverage .", "CARDINAL . In some ORG member states , the process of transformation of state broadcasting organisations into genuine public service broadcasters has been slow or still is under way and has , on occasion , been more formal than real . In some countries , the influence of governments and politicians on broadcasting regulators or the broadcasting sector in general has been identified as the key impediment to building and ensuring a diverse , impartial and pluralistic broadcasting landscape . The undue influence of private actors has also on occasion been reported .", "CARDINAL . It might be added that , in some member states , there is a lack of tradition concerning self - regulation or co - regulation , the adoption of and compliance with editorial standards , and a general culture of objectivity and professionalism . Ethical codes and internal guidelines , which can greatly contribute to the independent functioning of public service broadcasters , have not yet been adopted in all member states experiencing the problems outlined above .", "Funding", "CARDINAL . The question of resources available to public service broadcasting organisations is at the crux of the issue of their independence and their ability to fulfil their remit . This explains the undertakings made at the CARDINALth European Ministerial Conference on Mass Media Policy ' to guarantee public service broadcasters secure and appropriate means necessary for the fulfilment of their missions ' and ' to maintain and , where necessary , establish an appropriate and secure funding framework which guarantees public service broadcasting organisations the means necessary to accomplish their missions ' , as well as the attention paid to the matter in Recommendation No . R(CARDINAL)CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In some ORG member states , public service broadcasting organisations receive appropriate funding , be it in the form of direct contributions from the state , licence fees , income - generating activities or a combination of these sources .", "Whichever approach is adopted , it can be implemented with due respect for the market . It is generally agreed that care should be taken so that funding of public service broadcasters does not affect competition on the audiovisual market to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest . That said , excessive reliance on income - generating activities , which is often caused by a lack of public funding , can have a negative impact on programming and , in consequence , on the fulfilment of the public service remit entrusted to the organisations concerned .", "It is often advanced that there is some degree of correlation between the resources available to public service broadcasting organisations and the quality of the services rendered by them . However , the satisfactory delivery of public service and sound management can also be regarded as contributing to attracting adequate resources .", "CARDINAL . Reportedly , in other ORG member states , there is no appropriate , secure and transparent funding framework guaranteeing public service broadcasting organisations the means necessary to accomplish their remit . On occasion , funding commitments and mechanisms often represent mere statements of intention , without efforts being made to implement them in practice .", "Concerns are also frequently expressed as regards the threat to the continuity of the activities of public service broadcasting organisations due to uncertainty of both short- and longer - term funding ( for example , as a result of lack of consultation on state contributions , difficulties arising from the fee collection system , failure to adjust contributions of licence fees in view of inflation ) or exposure to pressure from authorities with financial decision - making power and the resulting threat to editorial independence and institutional autonomy . In order to avoid such risks , especially in cases where public funding comes from the state budget , appropriate safeguards should be put in place .", "Employee protection", "CARDINAL . The relevance of staff policy matters has also been recognised in Recommendation No . R(CARDINAL)CARDINAL , which contains some references to recruitment and non - discrimination , associative activities and the right to engage in industrial action , and the requirement that staff be free from influence from outside the public service broadcasting organisation concerned .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that these criteria are met in many ORG member states , and that employee protection standards are generally respected .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , reportedly , in a number of ORG member states , such standards are not yet well - established , particularly where the media are concerned . This situation renders media professionals more exposed to political and economic influence and pressure and less committed to professional standards .", "Complaints are sometimes made of discrimination or dismissal of journalists resulting from pressure brought to bear on management by outside persons or bodies , and allegations have been made to the effect that , in certain countries , under cover of the process of transformation of state broadcasting organisations into public service broadcasters , journalists who are thought to be too controversial or inquisitive have been dismissed .", "Concern has also been expressed in respect of proposals to give responsibility for the management of staff issues in public service broadcasters or regulatory bodies to the government .", "ORG , transparency and accountability", "CARDINAL . Due to its very nature , public service broadcasting should be accountable to society at large , both because it exists to serve the public in general and because , in most cases , it is financed at least partly from public resources ( for example , state contributions ) or from broadcasting fees , paid by the intended beneficiaries of the service . According to Resolution No . CARDINAL adopted at the CARDINALth European Ministerial Conference on Mass Media Policy , ' public service broadcasters must be directly accountable to the public . To that end , public service broadcasters should regularly publish information on their activities and develop procedures for allowing viewers and listeners to comment on the way in which they carry out their missions ' .", "It goes without saying that accountability is also desirable as regards the sound management of the resources available to public service broadcasting organisations .", "CARDINAL . NORP In most ORG member states , public service broadcasting organisations are relatively open and transparent .", "Noteworthy examples of good practice as regards accountability concern some public service broadcasting organisations that engage very actively in seeking audience feedback with a view to assessing their own performance and review , when necessary , the services provided by them .", "Many public service broadcasters publish relevant information on a regular basis , some being subject to statutory obligations to publishing DATE reports or submit such reports to parliament . This allows for desirable public scrutiny .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in some cases , there is insufficient openness , transparency and accountability vis - \u00e0 - vis society at large as to how public service broadcasting organisations implement their mission and use the ( public ) resources available to them .

Moreover , ORG has recognised that in certain circumstances the LAW may impose a positive obligation on a state to prevent , regulate or limit interferences by a private person or body with freedom of expression . Genuine , effective exercise of the freedom of expression and information does not depend merely on the ORG 's duty not to interfere , but may also require positive measures to help to stimulate or to protect and defend the freedom of expression .

Mr PERSON 's second analysis , dated DATE ( ATCM ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) , was concerned primarily with the proposals for the composition of ORG 's governing body , the \u201c ORG \u201d .

In conditions of extreme politicisation of public life , can political appointees really be relied upon NOT to represent the political views and interests of those who appointed them ?", "Because the risk that they will do precisely that is very high , preference should , we believe , be given to the first model .", "Of course , despite all the legal precautions , no - one can control who individual members of the ORG will want to listen to and whose views they will want to follow .

It is not clear whether this means that GPE should suspend its operations and stop broadcasting in the interim period or not . This is certainly suggested by the provision that its entire staff is to be dismissed , but perhaps there is a plan to continue broadcasting nonetheless .", "The execution of this plan would be very disruptive for ORG and its audiences . At the same time , it is not clear what substantive purpose this would serve . As we will argue below , there is nothing in the draft amendments which makes this indispensable from a legal point of view . Moreover , it appears that the liquidation will not be complete , since there is no provision for the appointment of a new ORG , nor of a new President . If the governing bodies of the organisation remain , there is no real liquidation , only mass dismissal of the staff under the guise of liquidation . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Overview", "GPE was the first country of the ORG to embark on a process towards the establishment of ORG [ public service broadcasting ] . It is also currently the only one of the CARDINAL countries to have transformed its ORG broadcasting company , ORG ( TRM ) , into a ORG [ public service broadcasting organisation ] . Yet while ORG exists in theory , in practice the new broadcasting company remains only nominally independent from government control , and output continues to be heavily biased in favour of the existing regime . Overall , it fails to provide viewers and listeners with accurate and objective information and a plurality of views and opinions . The consolidation of a genuine ORG structure will depend on the ability and will of the authorities to fully implement the newly - adopted provisions , as well as on the success of civil society 's campaigning efforts .", "In DATE , ORG adopted the Law on Amending and Supplementing Law No.CARDINAL-XV on ORG TeleRadio - Moldova ( LAW ) , which modified a previous law passed in DATE ( ORG ) following recommendations from ORG . A later controversial amendment to the PERSON , adopted in DATE , provided for the liquidation of ORG , enabling its reincarnation as ORG , as well as the replacement of its entire staff ( LAW ) .", "For a prolonged period of time it remained unclear how the re - staffing would be carried out , and generally journalists and human rights organisations were not provided with essential information as to the mechanisms that would be employed to implement these measures . In addition , the initial debates which led to the adoption of LAW in its first reading were held in an atmosphere of virtual secrecy . At this stage the company 's staff was utterly unaware of the fact that a law on ORG was being debated in ORG .", "Similarly , the process by which LAW was adopted did not provide for sufficient opportunity for public consultation , despite the significant public importance of a law of this nature . The draft was submitted to ORG by CARDINAL MPs on DATE , and adopted in its first reading almost immediately ; it then passed its second reading DATE . Some local NGOs and international organisations , such as ORG , acted very rapidly in providing recommendations on the draft . Other groups simply did not have the time to participate in this process .", "Despite the changes , ORG is still under the influence of the authorities . In addition , the quality of programmes has been quite low since the transformation . There is a need for additional funding , to train the employees and raise the standards of professional journalism .", "Another worrying fact is that there has been a progressive decrease in the diversity of media outlets . ' ORG , the media organisation that founded ORG , which until recently re - broadcast ORG - as well as having some programmes of its own , including NORP news - , was deprived of its licence in DATE . The licence was , instead , given to a newly - established , unknown television station , which allegedly has close links to President PERSON . The decision to deprive ORG of its licence was reached very speedily ; there was even a special edition of ORG announcing it , to avoid a wait of DATE for the decision to come into effect . This development is even more worrying as the old GPE ORT displayed virtually no criticism of the authorities , and frequently its portrayal of the authorities was positive . GPE ORG was one of the main television channels in GPE , together with ORG and private ORG . With ORG and ORG heavily pro - governmental , the new development is likely to dramatically reduce the ( already limited ) diversity of the NORP broadcast scene .", "The breakaway region of GPE in eastern GPE still does not have ORG and its ORG television is under the authorities ' control .", "CARDINAL . The Legislation", "According to LAW , ORG is ' functionally autonomous and editorially independent ' and ensures ' in the spirit of plurality of opinions , the exercise of the right to timely , truthful and full communication of information ' . LAW lists the organisation 's objective , which includes : ensuring the free access of society to information ; reflecting objectively and fully all aspects of the social - political , economic and cultural life of the country ; and realising the right of the individual to free expression .", "The ORG also provides for the establishment of an ORG ( the ORG ) to monitor the implementation of the provisions of the law and its by - laws . According to the law , the ORG is composed of CARDINAL members chosen from \u201c known personalities in the areas of culture , science , education , mass media and from other representatives of civil society , appointed for a term of DATE ; CARDINAL ORG members are appointed by the President , CARDINAL by the government and CARDINAL by the ORG , with the rest appointed by ORG , the staff of ORG , trade unions , media development organisations and representatives of cultural and minority groups ( LAW ) .", "The ORG , through a special parliamentary commission ( constituted on the basis of proportional representation of the political parties ) has the right to investigate the company 's activities when the ORG fails to exercise in an appropriate manner its supervisory function .", "While de jure the ORG is independent of government control , concerns remains as to how independent it is in practice , given that a proportion of its members are chosen directly by the President and the authorities . Dependency certainly appeared to be the case when PERSON , a young businessman with little media experience but close to the ruling ORG , was appointed as Chairman of ORG by ORG in DATE .", "There has also been criticism that despite the nominal inclusion of ' representatives of civil society ' in the makeup of the ORG , civil society groups are not adequately involved in supervising the activities of ORG . The members representing trade unions and army veterans reportedly follow the governmental line , whilst those who are independent and wish to serve the public are a minority within ORG .", "CARDINAL . Bias on TRM", "As a ORG , ORG has an obligation to provide accurate and objective news and current affairs coverage , as well as a pluralistic range of voices and opinions . This is enshrined in LAW of LAW , which states that \u201c [ CARDINAL news programs ... shall have an impartial , independent and truthful character . Commentary shall be separated from news . \u201d", "However , the monitoring of ORG 's output by various civil society organisations has revealed that , in practice , this is not the case . The gap between theory and practice appears to be due to interference of the State in the activities of ORG Government officials have reportedly been giving instructions over the telephone to ORG 's director . Allegedly the situation deteriorated in DATE , when ORG won a parliamentary majority . Journalists complained vociferously about the ORG 's lack of independence through mass demonstrations , involving QUANTITY , in DATE . In ORG others v. GPE , PERSON and other high - profile journalists submitted to ORG a case against GPE alleging violation of their right to free expression through cases of wide - spread censorship on the ORG broadcaster in DATE and DATE . Moreover , in DATE , a member of ORG stated that a great deal of pressure was regularly placed on the ORG 's members by the authorities .", "News reporting remains inadequate and is overtly biased in favour of the ruling ORG . In addition , the President appears often in the news , more than the government . The opposition is very seldom portrayed , and often in a negative manner . There is very little time dedicated to social issues . The news is often superficial : while there are frequent discussions on GPE , there are is hardly any information on issues that may portray the government in a negative light . Civil society figures also have limited access to FAC and stories often lack multiple , diverse sources . In addition , life in GPE is reflected selectively through the viewpoint of those in power .", "The situation worsens during elections campaigns . In the period leading up to local elections held on DATE , monitoring of television station ORG and ORG , which are both part of ORG , revealed that coverage was neither fair nor balanced : not only was coverage on GPE CARDINAL and ORG biased in favour of ORG , but it also attacked the non - NORP candidate standing for the post of mayor of GPE .", "A similar pattern was observed during the campaign period for parliamentary elections held on DATE , and further local elections held in DATE . During this period , opposition parties such as ORG and the ORG ' ORG criticised news coverage on ORG for being overtly biased in favour of the ruling ORG , and media monitoring revealed that news coverage of events within GPE was overwhelmingly positive ; most reports relating to the campaign focused on the achievements of ruling party officials , and were positive or neutral , while reports relating to opposition parties were on the whole negative ; and opposition candidates received far less coverage than candidates of the ruling ORG . The time allocated for debates was insufficient . The questions by some of the moderators seemed to guide the discussions in a certain direction .", "ORG ( APEL ) , in monitoring carried out DATE , noted that news reports were overwhelmingly ' rosy ' and non - conflictual , presenting a uniquely positive image of events within GPE , and with little coverage of more contentious social issues such as unemployment and poverty . Events in the capital GPE also received excessive coverage , while events in the rest of the country remained underreported .", "PERSON stated that ' professional and moral ' standards within the organisation are routinely ignored , with journalists failing to verify information provided by government sources , limiting the role that ORG can play in contributing to informed debate and critical thought .", "These findings were dismissed by PERSON , director of ORG , who accused their authors of incompetence , and suggested that they desired to profit from a negative portrayal of FAC . ORG also maintained that the limited coverage of opposition parties was due to the fact that they ' do not take part in any events , and they generally do nothing to be observed . '", "CARDINAL . The Transformation", "Since its re - establishment as a ORG , ORG has been dealing with disputes between journalists and management , as a result of LAW DATE . Article CARDINAL of this law states that ' the government shall liquidate the ORG company ORG ' ( paragraph CARDINAL ) and that the ' employees of the ORG company ORG shall be discharged ' ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Hence , the law aims at liquidating the ' old ' FAC and establishing a ' new ' institution , including through the replacement of staff .", "At the time of its enactment , the law was criticised by the opposition ORG and ORG , as well as by civil society groups , who have accused the government of introducing the law in order to dismiss ' uncomfortable ' journalists and replace them with loyal ones . The amendments also gave rise to complaints from company employees , trade union committees and public organisations , which considered the action to liquidate the organisation unlawful .", "Upon the announcement of the results of the re - staffing process , made on DATE , public protests were launched by ORG journalists . Violent clashes with the police occurred on CARDINAL separate occasions , on CARDINAL and DATE . ORG of ORG PACE ) linked the violence of police against protesters with the death of protester PERSON .", "On DATE , CARDINAL employees were also prevented from entering the premises of ORG . The person responsible for TIME news was suspended . He later stated that there had been an order not to broadcast the DATE 's events by the chairman of ORG . A wildlife documentary featuring elephants was reportedly broadcast in lieu of DATE .", "Journalists ' protests continued outside the ORG building and ORG from DATE through DATE . The protests were led by ORG ( ORG ) , an organisation set up to represent TRM journalists , and culminated with the submission of a case against GPE to ORG others v. GPE .", "PERSON and other ORG journalists maintained the authorities prevented them from entering the FAC premises to preclude their exercise of their right to free expression .", "The ORG employees requested an investigation of police violence towards the protesters in DATE by ORG , but were informed that the protests that started on DATE were contrary to national legislation and that the actions of the police were therefore legal . Instead , those who protested as of DATE in front of the ORG building were sued by the police for ' active participation in meetings organised without authorisation ' , under article CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Minority programmes", "LAW states that the objectives of ORG include ' to reflect the interests of all social strata and to propagate democratic values ' The law provides that a percentage of programmes should be in minority languages , although no further details on the languages in question are provided .", "ORG broadcasts programmes in NORP , PERSON , NORP , GPE , NORP , LANGUAGE , LANGUAGE and PERSON language . The division of broadcasting by language is PERCENT LANGUAGE , PERCENT NORP and PERCENT other languages . Linguistic diversity does not appear to be an issue in GPE , given the influence of LANGUAGE language and culture , which means that GPE was never insular . Minority programmes are prepared by a special department , where a number of minority representatives are also employed . Many NORP - speakers , however , believe that they effectively experience discrimination , as the majority of programmes of the NORP broadcast media as a whole are in the ( non - official ) LANGUAGE language .", "CARDINAL . Funding", "The public broadcaster is primarily financed through ORG funds , with some revenues from advertising , although ORG has less advertising than some private channels . In the process towards the adoption of LAW in DATE , the possibility of including provisions on fees was discussed . Such provisions were incorporated in the draft law compiled by civil society . However , the President criticised the NGOs ' draft exactly for its inclusion of fees , on the grounds that ORG could not afford to pay them . Many other politicians followed suit . In general , given GPE 's dire economic situation , there is little desire to pay ORG fees , and little understanding of the important role the introduction of fees would have in enhancing ORG 's independence .", "Since the establishment of ORG , ORG has prepared CARDINAL DATE budgets , which were sent to ORG for approval .
