At the hearing held on DATE , by which the proceedings terminated , [ the applicants\u2019 ] representative sought reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings based on an itemised claim which he was supposed to submit . However , there is no such itemised claim in the case file , and the reimbursement of costs was not sought earlier , while certain procedural actions were being taken . This is the reason why the costs of the proceedings could not be reimbursed to [ the applicants ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants challenged the judgment of ORG by lodging a constitutional complaint before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) .
