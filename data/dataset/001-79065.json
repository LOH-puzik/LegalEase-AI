THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen born in DATE and resident in GPE - le - Street . He is represented by ORG , solicitors practising in GPE - le - Street .", "In DATE , QUANTITY girls at the applicant \u2019s school alleged that he had committed indecent assaults on them . The applicant then aged DATE was suspended from school pending investigation .", "On DATE , the school informed the police of the allegations .", "DATE and DATE , the police interviewed the CARDINAL complainants .", "On DATE , the applicant was summoned to the police station . He was arrested on suspicion of indecent assault and caution . The police interviewed him in the absence of a legal representative but with his stepfather present . The police had asked whether they wanted a solicitor present but they stated that they did not . The applicant admitted to \u201c horseplay \u201d and actions amounting to indecent assault in respect of QUANTITY girls . The applicant was released pending further assessment of the case .", "On DATE , the applicant attended the police station where Acting Inspector PERSON informed him that the police had decided to deal with him by way of a warning under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE . The Inspector did not ask the applicant if he consented to the warning and the applicant was duly warned regarding the allegations of all CARDINAL complainants . Neither the applicant nor his stepfather were advised by the police that a consequence of the warning was that the applicant would be required to sign onto ORG , which warning was required by paragraph CARDINAL of the guidance issued by the Secretary of ORG .", "On DATE , NORP refused to sign the register .", "On DATE , the applicant issued an application for judicial review of the decision to warn him under section CARDINAL , complaining effectively that he had been subject to a public declaration of guilt by an administrative process to which he had not consented .", "On DATE , Mr Justice PERSON refused his application .", "On DATE , ORG upheld his appeal and granted permission . The case was joined with the case \u201c U \u201d . Issues were raised , inter alia , under LAW , DATE and DATE of the Convention .", "On DATE , following a hearing , ORG held that the imposition of the warning without informed consent or a waiver amounted to a prima facie breach of LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention . Lord Justice PERSON found the admissions made by NORP had been reliable and not made in response to any inducement and the police were entitled to rely on them for the purposes of applying the section CARDINAL scheme . As regards the failure of the police to obtain the applicant \u2019s informed consent to a warning , he did not consider that this rendered the decision to administer the warning unlawful under domestic law as the scheme under LAW did not require the young offender \u2019s consent . However , as regarded LAW , he found that the Secretary of ORG was right to concede that Article CARDINAL was engaged and that the police would have been entitled to decide not to prosecute and discontinue the proceedings . In the applicant \u2019s case though , he was required to subject himself to a procedure which had the effect of publicly pronouncing his guilt of the offence of indecent assault . That was the consequence of the final warning being recorded on ORG ( ORG ) and available to all those with access to it . This prima facie infringed Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL . The procedures for cautions and warnings did not have to breach LAW , being a sensible means of ensuring resources were not wasted and seeking to prevent youth re - offending . It was possible for a mechanism to be provided by which a person waived his right to have his case dealt with by a court ; this required informed consent and there was nothing in LAW requiring the police to proceed without the consent of the offender . The appropriate practice was to ensure that , before a reprimand or warning was administered , the offender and his parent , carer or appropriate adult should be told of the consequences and asked whether or not they consented to that course being taken . As there had been no informed consent in this case , there had been a breach of LAW and the decision had to be quashed .", "The ORG certified CARDINAL points of general public importance to be referred to ORG .", "On DATE , ORG overturned the ORG judgment . Lord PERSON found that there was nothing in the LAW which envisaged that the consent of the young offender be obtained and concluded that the only reasonable inference was that ORG had intended to dispense with such need for consent . He expressed doubt that LAW had been engaged , considering that arrest was not sufficient and that the applicant had neither been charged nor informed that criminal proceedings were likely . On the assumption that there had been a criminal charge , he thought that it was inescapable that it ceased to exist when a firm decision was taken by the police not to prosecute . The warning procedure did not involve any penal or punitive element . Further , the record on the ORG was far from a public announcement or declaration of guilt , access being limited to a relatively small number of police , prison and probation officers and agencies fulfilling public functions . Access to ORG Register was similarly controlled and in neither case did members of the public have access . Thus , he was of the clear opinion that the warning did not involve the determination of a criminal charge and his fair trial rights were not engaged . He did not consider that the scheme infringed LAW on the Rights of the Child ( DATE ) .", "Without dissenting , PERSON and Lord PERSON expressed concern that the decision was inconsistent with children \u2019s rights under international law . PERSON thought that the system imposed consequences that could be explained away individually as preventative but cumulatively had seriously modified a child \u2019s legal status . She found , however , no public pronouncement of guilt and no determination of a criminal charge .", "ORG DATE sets out the overall aim of the youth justice system to prevent offending and re - offending by children and young persons , inter alia , by diverting them from their offending behaviour before entering the court system . It replaced the system of cautions for children and young persons with a structured approach . Depending on the seriousness of the offence , a reprimand is normally given for a first offence and a final warning for a second offence ; thereafter the young offender should generally be charged . Following a final warning , the police have a duty to refer the young offender to a youth offending team in order to determine whether or not to provide an intervention programme . Neither a caution nor a reprimand / warning can be given unless the offender has admitted the relevant offence(s ) .", "The critical difference between the informal system of cautions and the system of warnings was that a caution can only be given if the offender gives his informed consent to being cautioned . Neither the DATE Act nor the guidance issued by the Secretary of ORG makes any provision for consent .", "Section CARDINAL provides , as regards reprimands and warnings :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Subsections ( CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) below apply where-", "( a ) a constable has evidence that a child or young person ( \u201c the offender \u201d ) has committed an offence ;", "( b ) the constable considers that the evidence is such that , if the offender were prosecuted for the offence , there would be a realistic prospect of his being convicted ;", "( c ) the offender admits to the constable that he committed the offence ;", "( d ) the offender has not previously been convicted of an offence ; and", "( e ) the constable is satisfied that it would not be in the public interest for the offender to be prosecuted .", "( CARDINAL ) Subject to subsection ( CARDINAL ) below , a constable may reprimand the offender if the offender has not previously been reprimanded or warned .", "( CARDINAL ) The constable may warn the offender if-", "( a ) the offender has not been previously warned ; or", "( b ) where the offender has previously been warned , the offence was committed DATE after DATE warning and the constable considers the offence to be not so serious as to require a charge to be brought ; but no person may be warned under paragraph ( b ) more than once .", "( CARDINAL ) Where the offender has not been previously reprimanded , the constable shall warn rather than reprimand the offender if he considers the offence to be so serious as to require a warning .", "( CARDINAL ) The constable shall \u2013(a ) where the offender is under DATE , give any reprimand or warning in the presence of an appropriate adult ...", "Section CARDINAL provides for the effects of reprimands and warnings , inter alia that where an offender has been warned the constable shall refer the person to a youth offending team who should assess them and arrange as appropriate for them to participate in a rehabilitation programme .", "Where a child or young person has been warned or reprimanded in respect of an offence covered by the sexual offenders\u2019 legislation , they become subject to the notification requirements .
