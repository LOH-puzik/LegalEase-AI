NORP did not comply with this decision , although on DATE she paid HUF CARDINAL .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's petition for review .", "In its reasoning , ORG recapitulated the reasons for the first and second instance decisions as follows :", "\u201c In the criminal proceedings [ instituted by the applicant against the mother , see below ] the police obtained the opinions of expert psychologists on the child and the parties . In the course of these examinations the child recounted , in concrete terms , what she had experienced in the defendant 's environment , which made her feel hurt or ignored .", "Expert psychologist PERSON concluded from the explorations that the stress \u201c caused by the parents ' conflict had , since DATE , overwhelmed the child . The stress , however , did not cause any neurotic distortion , as her psychological defence mechanisms worked well . For this reason she opted for the mother 's less strained environment and rejected her father 's environment . She did everything she could to prevent the conflicts between her parents and to escape , in general , from any conflict , which caused emotional stress . However , those conflicts , which she was unable to digest , would affect the development of her personality disadvantageously and suppress the frustration , which her separation from her relatives caused . Her negative attitude towards her father 's family would change if she did not fear being taken out of her present environment , with which she increasingly identifies herself , and if she could determine on her own how often and where to meet her father . \u201d", "Expert psychologist PERSON concluded that the emotional relationship between the father and the girl had deteriorated to such a degree that the girl almost seemed to keep fleeing from her father . The situation would be much better if the child did not perceive it as a constraint to maintain contact with her father . She also concluded that , between the mother and the girl , a good mother - child relationship had developed from the very beginning and that this prime and privileged relationship remained DATE on . The expert emphasised that the child 's healthy development would be endangered if \u2013 by disregarding this very close mother - child relationship and the child 's emotions \u2013 she were forced back into an environment where she did not like to live because she felt neglected .", "According to the statements of the parties , no fundamental change had occurred in their relationship since the termination of the proceedings instituted in DATE . The defendant continued receiving the family allowance in respect of the child and the maintenance payment deducted from the plaintiff 's salary and , according to him , he used these sums to cover the costs of the litigation . He in no way contributed to the maintenance of the child ; he did not even give her a single present .", "On the basis of the above facts , the first instance court dismissed the plaintiff 's renewed claim . According to the reasoning of the court , the defendant 's personality and circumstances made him fit to bring up the child . Assessing the circumstances , the court found that a change in placement would not serve the interests of the child , who had completely taken over the plaintiff 's argumentation and whose environment , in which she had been enveloped since DATE , was therefore unsuitable to preserve her respect and love for the other parent . Since that time the plaintiff , whether intentionally or not , had contributed to the alienation of the child from the defendant and \u2013 in direct opposition to the previous court decision \u2013 she had continued to keep the child with her . The court held that the child could not , on account of her age and situation , be regarded as a person having full capacity to make sound judgments ; it stressed that the parties had in vain claimed that they had acted in the child 's interests ; the child was in fact the victim of the parents ' struggle for and over her , and it was to be feared that this situation would cause her serious mental damage .", "By its final decision , the second instance court modified the first instance decision and placed the child with the mother . As from DATE , it transferred the obligation to pay maintenance to the defendant and regulated contact between the defendant and the child in the usual way .", "In its reasoning , the appellate court agreed with the findings of the first instance court as to the negative evaluation of the plaintiff 's unlawful conduct and declared this conduct to be contrary to the long - term interests of the child . At the same time , it observed that \u201c there was no possibility \u201d to enforce the previous court decision ; enforcement against the will of the CARDINAL-year - old girl was hopeless . Although the situation was imputable to the plaintiff , the relationship between the child and the father had , even in the latter 's opinion , deteriorated to such a degree that the change of placement would not serve the interests of the child or reduce her negative emotions towards her father . If she were placed with her mother , there could be some hope that , after some time , she might realise and appreciate her father 's affection for her . \u201d", "ORG reasons for upholding the second instance decision were as follows :", "\u201c The petition for review is well - founded to the extent that the impossibility to enforce the previous court decision must not have any bearing on the decision on the merits of the case , i.e. on the statutory evaluation of the aspects to be taken into account when deciding on the question of placement : unenforceability in itself can not result in the alteration of the placement .", "However , the fact that , at the date of the delivery of the final decision , the child had already passed the age of CARDINAL amounts to a substantial difference in the circumstances , as opposed to the earlier situation .", "Section CARDINAL of the Act on Family Law provides \u2013 in accordance with LAW ( done at GPE on DATE ) , incorporated into NORP law by Act no . CARDINAL of DATE that if a child has reached the age of DATE , no decision concerning his / her placement shall be taken without his / her consent , except when the placement chosen by the child endangers his / her development . Therefore , section GPE , which provides the possibility of changing the placement in the interests of the child , must be interpreted in conjunction with section CARDINAL ; accordingly , the child 's placement as s / he wishes would not run counter to his / her interests unless it would put him / her in danger . Consequently , the court had to examine whether the girl 's placement with her mother , which has been ordered by the court after considering the child 's firm and express wish , would endanger her physical , mental or moral development .", "The first instance court based itself on the fact that the plaintiff had unlawfully kept the child since DATE . The court found that , with the passage of time , the mother 's influence , directed against the defendant , had been decisive in turning the child against the father and in completely detaching her from the other parent emotionally . In the court 's view , her placement with the plaintiff would endanger the child 's future development , despite her objective and subjective fitness for the child 's upbringing .", "This position , however , attributes unrealistic and excessive significance to the plaintiff 's harmful influence in the flow of events , and disregards the concurring findings of [ CARDINAL ] expert psychologists , as laid down in their [ respective ] opinions of DATE and DATE , which were corroborated by other findings of fact .", "Both the opinions of the appointed experts and the statements of the child demonstrate that , after the defendant had established a new relationship , the child became alienated primarily from her environment , i.e. her foster mother and grandmother ; since her early childhood , she has adopted defence mechanisms in order to resist the distressing impact of her parents ' conflict and , after her accident in DATE , she chose her mother 's care . The defendant , however , was not attentive to this temporary wish of the child ; he tried to enforce his rights through coercive measures , as a result of which the parents ' conflict appeared to the child as an oppressive experience , with which she could not cope .", "ORG agrees with the reasoning of the appellate court in that , after the child 's recovery , the plaintiff should have prepared her psychologically for her return to the defendant and that she should have provided the emotional stability and support needed by the child within the framework of regular contact . Instead , the plaintiff did not comply with her obligations flowing from the final decision and , by leaving the decision partly to the child , she actively contributed to the failure of the child 's return to the defendant and the maintenance of undisturbed contact . This conduct amounts to influencing the child , has led to the alienation of the child from her father and is , therefore , imputable to the plaintiff .", "However , as to whether this extremely embittered situation has been brought about by the plaintiff alone , which amounted to endangering the healthy development of the now DATE child , the lower courts took a CARDINAL - sided and , therefore , incorrect position by overemphasising certain factors while disregarding others .", "According to the elements of the case file , the contact between the father and the child had already loosened prior to the child 's accident in DATE . This was the result of the change which had taken place in the defendant 's environment ; the defendant 's new family created an atmosphere which made the child realise their malice and criticism towards her beloved mother . This attitude severely distressed the then DATE child and caused her to feel isolated . In this situation her accident and subsequent longing for motherly care was the turning point , which resulted in her resistance to adapting herself to the defendant 's family .", "It is also a fact that the defendant is fond of his child and that he is able to ensure the objective conditions of her placement . However , in his present family , the emotional harmony between him and the now adolescent child , which was referred to as a decisive factor when her placement was decided , is missing . Being emotionally reserved and inflexible , as pointed out by all the expert opinions , the defendant tried to substitute this missing harmony by firmness , rationally planned official procedures and coercive measures . This , however , further deteriorated his relationship with the child \u2013 who , because of her age , has been more vulnerable \u2013 and provoked resistance in her .", "It follows that the plaintiff 's influence on the child has not in itself led to the present situation , which is undoubtedly unfavourable for the child . Rather , her influence has only been CARDINAL factor in the above - mentioned circumstances ; therefore , it can not be argued that the child 's placement with the plaintiff \u2013 which the child has consistently chosen and which meets the objective conditions of placement \u2013 would endanger the child 's future development . In the absence of such danger , the final decision is in compliance with section CARDINAL of the Act on Family Law and does not contradict section ORG ) It is , therefore , not unlawful . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant initiated criminal proceedings against NORP charging her with unlawfully changing a minor 's placement .", "On DATE the applicant brought further charges against NORP accusing her of the offences of endangering a minor and failure to pay maintenance .", "On DATE the GPE XIV / ORG preferred a bill of indictment against ORG charging her with having unlawfully changed a minor 's placement .", "On DATE expert psychologist PERSON , who was appointed by the criminal court , examined K.", "On DATE the Pest Central District Court convicted GPE of having unlawfully changed a minor 's placement , but refrained from imposing a sentence pending DATE .", "On DATE expert psychologist PERSON examined K. and her parents .", "On DATE ORG preferred a bill of indictment charging GPE with endangering a minor .", "On DATE ORG quashed GPE 's conviction of DATE for procedural shortcomings and remitted the case to the first criminal instance .", "On DATE the Pest Central District Court joined the CARDINAL criminal proceedings . In the ensuing proceedings , ORG found the opinions of GPE and GPE incomplete and contradictory . Consequently , it appointed an expert psychiatrist , PERSON , to examine the child , which she did on DATE .", "On DATE the court heard all CARDINAL experts .", "On DATE the Pest Central District Court convicted GPE of the offences of ' endangering a minor ' and ' unlawfully changing a minor 's placement ' . In its reasoning , of the altogether CARDINAL opinions \u2013 which included that of GPE , prepared in the civil case in DATE the court accepted the latter , along with that of PERSON , as completed and amended orally .", "The court noted that , according to the earliest assessment made by GPE , the then CARDINAL - and - a - half - year - old PERSON , instinctively frank , had displayed rough traces of her mother 's influence :", "\u201c At that time , the girl expresses her feelings to the expert openly ; she almost takes pride in the advantages , from which she benefits on the part of the better - off mother and her new family , in contrast with the severe and puritan fatherly environment ... \u201d", "The court also noted the conclusion of the latest expert opinion of DATE , prepared by PERSON , according to which it could not be established that PERSON 's estrangement from her father was the consequence of the mother 's influence . For the court , this held true only for the teenage girl , whose personality had inevitably changed :", "\u201c The girl 's very intense emotional link to her mother has grown into a strong symbiosis , an alliance of interests , which , for the court , has camouflaged the actual state of mind of the DATE personality .", "The CARDINAL opinions are exact and authentic , but momentary , records of CARDINAL and the same person , against different backgrounds . Common elements are the attachment to the mother and the rejection of the father . Then [ in DATE , ] the [ mother 's ] manipulation predominantly underlay this [ choice ] ; by now [ DATE , ] this background has changed ; and it is the sovereign and final decision of the teenage girl , who has grown into a ' competent person ' , to live with her mother . Moreover , both experts agreed that the litigation and , in particular , the child 's involvement therein , is very harmful for the child and constitutes mental abuse in itself , which the parent actually taking care of the child is significantly more likely to exert than the other parent , who has been almost completely isolated from her . \u201d", "GPE was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , execution being suspended for DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
