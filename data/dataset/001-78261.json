POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s car was seized by the police in connection with criminal proceedings instituted against him on charges of alleged forgery of the car \u2019s registration numbers .", "On DATE the applicant was acquitted of the charges , the court having found , in the light of expert opinions , that there were no grounds on which to find that the car \u2019s registration numbers had ever been tampered with .", "In DATE the car was returned to the applicant . Having established that the car \u2019s condition had deteriorated during the period when it had been seized by the police , he lodged a compensation claim against the prosecuting authorities who had dealt with his case . The applicant claimed ORG CARDINAL [ ORG CARDINAL ] as compensation . The statement of claim read as follows :", "\u201c The defendant ORG seized the car concerned in the present case ( ... ) owned by the applicant .", "Evidence : The seizure orders of CARDINAL and DATE .", "The plaintiff twice requested the defendant to lift the unlawful seizure order , which was eventually done on DATE on the strength of an order of ORG of DATE given in the pursuance of the enforcement of the final judgment of that court of DATE .", "Evidence : The summonses of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ; judgment of ORG ( ... ) and the order of DATE .", "As a result of the plaintiff having been deprived of the use of the car and its having been parked on an open car - park for DATE , the car was irreparably damaged which reduced its value by ORG . A detailed description of the damage is to be found in the attached expert opinion of DATE , Ref . No . CARDINAL . \u201d", "The applicant attached CARDINAL expert opinions to his statement of claim : the opinion Ref . No . CARDINAL and another one , from which it appeared that the car \u2019s market value had diminished , from DATE to DATE , from ORG ( appr . CARDINAL ORG ) to LAW ( appr . CARDINAL ORG ) .", "The defendant ORG , represented by the prosecutor \u2019s office , in its pleadings requested that the action be dismissed in its entirety . It argued , inter alia , that before the seizure the car had already been parked for DATE in conditions similar to those at the car - park where it had been parked after the seizure . No description of the car \u2019s condition at the date of the seizure had been prepared , which called into question the plaintiff \u2019s conclusion that the car had been damaged after that date .", "On DATE ORG dismissed his action . The written grounds of the judgment , insofar as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c On DATE police officers of the GPE police station seized a car owned by the plaintiff . ( ... ) they established that the registration number on the car \u2019s chassis had been tampered with . By a decision of the same date investigations were instituted . Minutes of the seizure were drawn up without providing a detailed description of the car \u2019s technical condition .", "On DATE the prosecutor of PERSON confirmed the seizure , finding , in the light of available evidence , that it was justified . ( ... ) Subsequently , by a decision of DATE ( ... ) the car was declared to be material evidence in the case and it was put in a supervised car - park . ( ... ) On DATE ORG admitted evidence from an expert opinion . Subsequently , ORG of the Silesian Police examined the car and submitted , on DATE , its opinion . It transpired therefrom that the car had its original numbers . [ However ] a part of the car \u2019s bodywork on which these numbers were fixed had characteristics indicating that it had been placed on the car after it had been produced .", "As a result of these findings , on CARDINAL DATE ORG filed a bill of indictment against the plaintiff , charging him with an offence punishable under LAW in that the original numbers had been tampered with in such a way that a part of the bodywork had been taken off a car of the same make and fixed to the applicant \u2019s car .", "During the criminal proceedings ORG in GPE gave an opinion ORG of DATE in which it established that the car in question had its original identification numbers and that there were no indications that these had been tampered with .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG acquitted the applicant of the charge and ordered that the seized car be returned to him . No appeal had been lodged against this judgment . By a decision of DATE the enforcement of this judgment was ordered and on DATE the applicant collected the keys of the car .", "( ... ) the plaintiff claimed compensation for , in his opinion , unjustified and unlawful seizure of the car , for the fact that he could not use it and for the reduction in the car \u2019s value caused by the fact that it had been parked in an open car - park . He referred to LAW . ( ... )", "The liability of the ORG for damage caused by its agents is governed by LAW . The prosecutor , LAW of this provision , is a ORG agent . ( ... ) ORG is to be liable for damage caused by a ORG official in the course of carrying out the duties entrusted to him or her if he or she was at fault for the actions or omissions concerned and when a normal causal link can be established between such acts or omissions and the damage sustained .", "The fault of the ORG official is a necessary condition for the ORG \u2019s liability in tort to arise . If such a liability is to arise , the ORG agent must be at fault for his acts , which also means that his or her conduct must be wrongful . The wrongfulness of the agent \u2019s conduct is to be understood in such a way that it is at variance with the legal order , i.e. in breach of applicable provisions of law and also contrary to universally accepted principles of community life . For the assessment of the fault of the ORG agent LAW , which obliges the debtor to act with due diligence , is also relevant .", "Hence , in the present case for a finding of the ORG \u2019s liability it is necessary to establish that the conduct of the agent concerned , i.e. the prosecutor of the GPE prosecuting office , was wrongful and that he was at fault .", "In the court \u2019s opinion , there are no grounds on which such a finding can be made . The actions of the prosecutor were taken pursuant to valid provisions of procedural law . He had recourse to his competences laid down by law . It can not be said that his conduct was unlawful , either when he confirmed the seizure of the car , or when he filed the bill of indictment against the plaintiff with the court . The prosecutor undertook these steps on the basis of the material obtained in the case , including the expert opinion prepared during the investigations . His conduct can not be deemed to have been wrongful .", "Not every acquittal of an accused must necessarily lead to the liability of the ORG for the acts of the prosecutor involved in the case . For such liability to arise it is necessary to make a finding of the agent \u2019s fault . The fact that certain decisions given in the proceedings are erroneous because , for instance , the agent erred in the assessment of facts , does not by itself give rise to liability . It must be taken into consideration that the expert opinion prepared during the judicial proceedings in the present case fundamentally differed from the opinion prepared for the purposes of the investigations . There are no grounds on which to find that the prosecutor failed to act diligently in the conduct of the case .", "As regards the conditions in which the car was stored during the time of seizure , it has to be noted that it was effected in compliance with applicable provisions . The car had been parked in a supervised car - park . The plaintiff has failed to show that during that time his car was damaged , or to establish what was the car \u2019s technical condition at the date of its seizure . In particular , he failed to show that the damage resulted from any wrongful conduct on the part of ORG agents .", "Consequently , his action had to be dismissed . \u201d", "The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal . The court first recalled the background of the proceedings . It summarised the applicant \u2019s appeal in the following way :", "\u201c In his appeal the plaintiff argued that the first - instance judgment was in breach of LAW as well as of LAW . ( ... ) He argued that it was not open to any doubt , in the light of legal writing and case - law , including that of ORG , that when damage was caused by a public official , the fact that damage occurred was sufficient for civil liability to arise \u2013 see the judgment of ORG . In his submission , the arguments advanced by the first - instance court concerning fault , due diligence and unlawfulness were in breach of the LAW and amounted to a clumsy polemic . \u201d", "The grounds for the judgment further read :", "\u201c The plaintiff \u2019s appeal can not be allowed .", "The opinion of ORG that Article CARDINAL of LAW constitutes the legal basis for the plaintiff \u2019s claim must be shared ; however , it can not be interpreted without LAW being taken into account .", "Article CARDINAL of the PERSON reads as follows : ( See Relevant domestic law ) . Its analysis must lead to a conclusion that the civil liability of the ORG agent is dependent on provisions of law having been breached and is independent of the agent \u2019s fault . In the light of LAW , [ an interpretation used by civil courts before the judgment of ORG made the agent \u2019s fault a constitutive requirement for the ORG \u2019s liability to arise ] is inadmissible .", "The LAW in its LAW clearly indicates that the organs of the ORG are obliged not to act in breach of law ; consequently , the liability of the ORG is independent of the fault of the agent . In the opinion of ORG the objective unlawfulness of the acts of public officials is a sufficient premise for the liability of the ORG to arise .", "ORG is in disagreement with the opinion expressed by ORG that the fault of the ORG agent was material for the finding of the ORG \u2019s liability . However , it transpires from the findings made by that court that the prosecutor had been acting in compliance with applicable procedural provisions . When acting [ during the criminal procedure ] he had been making use of his competences . He had been acting within limits as defined by law and had not breached it , which excludes the ORG \u2019s liability .", "Consequently , the appeal had to be dismissed . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of the LAW reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone shall have the right to ownership , other property rights and the right of succession .", "CARDINAL . Everyone , on an equal basis , shall receive legal protection regarding ownership , other property rights and the right of succession .", "CARDINAL . The right of ownership may only be limited by means of a statute and only to the extent that it does not violate the substance of such right . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW reads :", "\u201c Everyone shall have the right to compensation for any harm done to him by any action of an organ of public authority which is contrary to law . \u201d", "Articles CARDINAL et seq . of ORG ( ORG cywilny ) of DATE provide for the ORG \u2019s liability in tort . In the version applicable until DATE , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The State Treasury shall be liable for damage caused by a ORG official in the course of carrying out the duties entrusted to him . \u201d", "According to the old case - law of ORG , a plaintiff seeking damages under LAW had to show that the act in question was unlawful and that the ORG agent had committed a fault ( ORG judgments : No . I PR CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL , unpublished , No . I CR CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , unpublished and No . I CR CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL , unpublished ) .", "Under the former LAW , if damage was caused by the ORG official as a result of his / her giving a decision or other official act , ORG was liable only if the giving of the said decision amounted to an infringement of laws punishable under criminal law or under any disciplinary regulations , and if the fault of the perpetrator had been confirmed by a judgment of a criminal court or of a competent disciplinary authority , or was otherwise recognised by a superior authority .", "On DATE the Law of CARDINAL DATE on amendments to LAW and other statutes ( LOC o zmianie ustawy \u2013 ORG cywilny oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw ) ( \u201c the DATE Amendment \u201d ) entered into force .

They alleged , in particular , that those provisions were incompatible with LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW insofar as they guaranteed access to court and a right to compensation for damage caused by acts of public authorities .", "In its judgment the ORG held that LAW was compatible with LAW in so far as it provided that ORG was liable for damage caused by the unlawful action of a ORG official carried out in the course of performing his duties . It further held that even though LAW was compatible with LAW , it was contrary to LAW since it made the award of compensation for such damage dependent on the personal culpability of the ORG official concerned , established in criminal or disciplinary proceedings . This restriction on access to a court , in the opinion of ORG , put excessive obstacles in the way of an individual \u2019s right to have damage caused by actions of public authorities compensated .", "On DATE , the date on which ORG judgment took effect , LAW was repealed .", "Pursuant to LAW , objects to be used as evidence in a criminal case or for the purposes of securing the payment of fines , can be seized by the police or by the prosecuting authorities ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
