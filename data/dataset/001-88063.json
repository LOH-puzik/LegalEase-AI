On DATE the applicant newspaper published an article about ORG . The article was not based on investigations by the newspaper \u2019s reporters but merely quoted an anonymous letter it had allegedly received from a group of GPE parents . The letter criticised the situation in the school , in particular , overcrowding and a lack of proper facilities for children . It alleged that the school \u2019s principal used the school \u2019s funds for inappropriate purposes , spending money on decorating his office and building a separate bathroom for himself , launching a school newspaper which only published articles related to relationships and sex . It also alleged he had received bribes of MONEY for enrolling children in the school and that the authors of the letter had been afraid to sign for fear of reprisal against their children .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the principal and the editorial staff of the school newspaper asked ORG to publish a reply to the article of CARDINAL DATE ; however , their request was rejected . They finally managed to have their reply published in another newspaper called ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In their reply they expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that Flux had failed to seek their side of the story before publishing an anonymous letter , and said that the manner in which Flux had acted had been contrary to journalistic ethics . In their view , the fact that Flux had published an anonymous letter without even visiting the school or conducting any form of investigation showed that its aim was purely sensationalism . It was true that the school was overcrowded , but that was a result of its popularity . Had the journalist from Flux visited the school , she would have noted that it was not only the principal \u2019s office that had been renovated , but many other parts of the school . As to the issue of bribes , it was far too serious an accusation to be published without any supporting evidence . The editorial staff of the school newspaper stressed that the anonymous letter had misinformed the readers by only citing certain articles and overlooking many others concerning such matters as sport , cultural events and school events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant newspaper reacted to the reply published in ORG by publishing a new article which NORP inter alia :", "\u201c The first people to visit us , were , to our surprise , not the [ principal ] , but the \u2018 creation team\u2019 of the school newspaper ... headed by the teacher PERSON They had prepared a so called \u2018 reply\u2019 to the article [ of CARDINAL DATE ] . In reality a scrap of paper attacking our editorial staff , full of ironic comments such as \u2018 ORG , the newspaper which pretends to write the ORG . We have nothing against this school newspaper , which started to give us marks for behaviour . We tried to explain to our as yet too young colleagues , in a friendly way , of course , that since ORG had pledged to publish the [ anonymous ] letter in full , it could not change its content . We were merely reproducing a point of view which had the right to exist . We simply did not care about other details , such as the quality of the school newspaper or the IQ of its editors .", "Maybe the \u2018 reply\u2019 from the editors of the Spiru Haret newspaper , would have been published by ORG if its tone had been measured and shown at least a little respect for a newspaper [ ORG ] from which their school newspaper still has a lot to learn . Not to mention that the \u2018 ORG who came to our office were arrogant and spoke down to us from a great height . We had the impression that these \u2018 editors\u2019 were from ORG or at least from ORG . Incidentally , we later found out that the chief of the \u2018 GPE , PERSON is the partner of the school principal , but we readily overlooked this delicate detail .", "...", "When we agreed to publish the letter from the group of parents , we were not intent on sensationalism , as was insinuated by the principal in his reply . Everybody knows that the situation in our schools is far from satisfactory . Nobody is surprised by this anymore . PERSON is not the first school we have written about , nor will it be the last ....", "We published the letter in the hope that the principal would descend from his lofty perch and understand that there also are dissatisfied parents . Many people complained to us that the principal was a spiteful person . Just to prove the point , after the publication of our article , he convened a meeting of the GPE association at which he demanded the names of the persons who had written the letter . He also demanded that the association write a letter critical of our newspaper ....", "Obviously , the most serious problem is that of the bribes , which , according to the cynics among us , are not causing the principal any loss of sleep . We have been accused of libelling him without any proof . However , it was not we who accused him , but the parents . And we are sure that we will be able to bring witnesses to the court . We will find people willing to overcome their fear ...", "We will now refer to a person who called us [ after the publication of the article of CARDINAL DATE ] . His name is PERSON and he is a former university colleague of the principal of PERSON . Before moving to PERSON , he lived in GPE . After coming to PERSON , he had to find a school for his daughter . He approached his former colleague , who hinted that he had to pay not only with fond memories of their student years but also with cash . PERSON refused and told the principal that he had no money . After a lengthy period in which he was fobbed off with promises , PERSON gave up the idea of enrolling his daughter in PERSON .", "\u2018 The official reason given by the principal was that we lived in another part of the city . I was surprised to learn that a friend of my daughter , who lived in the same neighbourhood , had told my daughter that her father had paid the principal MONEY . Now she is a student at PERSON while my daughter is at another school , where no money is required\u2019 , said PERSON .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the principal brought civil proceedings for defamation against the applicant newspaper , arguing that many statements in the above article were defamatory of him .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the applicant newspaper called CARDINAL witnesses , including PERSON , who testified that bribes were taken for the enrolment of children in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment for the principal , after finding the allegations of bribery to be untrue and defamatory . It concluded that the statements of the CARDINAL witnesses called by the applicant newspaper were not sufficient to overturn the presumption of innocence enjoyed by the principal . It ordered the newspaper to issue an apology within DATE and to pay the principal CARDINAL Moldovan Lei ( ORG ) ( the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) at the time ) . As to the witnesses called by the newspaper , it stated :", "\u201c The court has no reason not to believe the witnesses PERSON , GPE and ORG However , in order to be able to declare publicly that someone is accepting bribes , there is a need for a criminal - court decision finding that person guilty of bribery . Since there is no such finding against [ the principal ] , he can not be accused of bribery . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant newspaper and the principal appealed against this judgment . The applicant newspaper contested the finding that the statement concerning bribery was defamatory , arguing that it had not directly accused the principal of bribe - taking , but had brought to the attention of the public the well - known phenomenon of bribe - taking in schools . The principal claimed that the statement concerning bribery was not the only defamatory statement in the article . On DATE both appeals were dismissed by ORG , which found the applicant newspaper \u2019s submissions ill - founded . As to the principal \u2019s appeal , it stated that being a public figure , he had to be more tolerant to criticism .", "CARDINAL . The applicant newspaper lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG , arguing again , inter alia , that the purpose of the article was not to accuse the principal of taking bribes but simply to make public the rumours to that effect . It submitted that the circulation of such rumours had been confirmed by witnesses . PERSON the newspaper for the lack of a criminal court judgment against the principal was disproportionate and unnecessary in a democratic society . Moreover , the newspaper had simply disseminated statements made by third parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed its appeal .", "CARDINAL .
