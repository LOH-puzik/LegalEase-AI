NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agents , first PERSON , and then PERSON and Ms A. PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s grandfather owned several plots of agricultural land in the area surrounding GPE measuring QUANTITY in total , which were expropriated DATE for urban development .", "CARDINAL . Following the enactment of restitution legislation in GPE in DATE , on DATE the applicant \u2019s father applied to have the expropriation revoked . The request , initially addressed to the local agricultural land commission , was forwarded to the mayor of GPE on DATE , as it was decided that the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) applied to the case . After the time - limit for assessing whether the land should be returned elapsed without any decision being made , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s father sought judicial review of the mayor \u2019s tacit refusal .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG overturned the mayor \u2019s refusal in part by revoking the expropriation in so far as it concerned QUANTITY of land and returning the land in question to the applicant \u2019s father . ORG judgment was subject to supervisory review ( \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0430 ) . Following a request by the mayor of GPE , on DATE the judgment was quashed by ORG and the case remitted to the lower court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after re - examining the case , ORG once again revoked the expropriation of the land and returned it to the applicant \u2019s father on the grounds that no construction works had yet taken place and that it was sufficient in size to form an independent plot . It did not comment on any rights to that land by third parties such as ORG and ET PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . No appeal was lodged against the above - mentioned judgment and on DATE it became final . On CARDINAL DATE the mayor of ORG applied to ORG to have the judicial proceedings reopened , referring to newly discovered evidence , but on DATE the application was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date prior to CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s father paid back MONEY ( ORG ) to the municipality , representing the monetary compensation received at the time of expropriation . At that time , because of inflation and the depreciation of NORP currency , the sum repaid equalled MONEY ( ORG ) . At the same time the applicant \u2019s father requested to have the plot of land marked as his in the relevant cadastral plans , which was necessary in order to obtain possession , but this was refused as it was established that third parties asserted competing rights to the same property ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . Following expropriation , the plot of land at issue formed part of ORG \u2019s industrial zone and a plant , storehouses and accompanying infrastructure were constructed on it . In DATE the land was allocated for use by a ORG enterprise , which in DATE was transformed into a limited liability company and then in DATE into a joint - stock company named ORG ( \u201c PERSON More \u201d ) , the shares of which were owned entirely by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON More put QUANTITY of the land it owned up for sale . On DATE the land was sold to ET PERSON ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , a sole trader . It appears that this land was situated entirely within the boundaries of the larger QUANTITY plot which had been the subject of the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s restitution claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s father brought a rei vindicatio action against ORG and PERSON . He based his claim on ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , arguing that he owned the QUANTITY plot of land which PERSON had bought from ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon a request by PERSON , to which the applicant \u2019s father consented , the proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of related litigation between the CARDINAL defendants regarding ownership of the disputed land . The proceedings were resumed in DATE , but were again briefly stayed pending the outcome of the application by the mayor of GPE for restitution proceedings to be reopened ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . After the rei vindicatio proceedings were resumed , in their respective judgments of CARDINAL May and CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG disallowed the claim . While the proceedings were under way , the applicant \u2019s father died and the applicant and her mother joined the proceedings as his heirs . They subsequently lodged an appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment and remitted the case on the grounds that the lower courts had failed to take into account ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following a fresh examination of the case , on DATE ORG once again dismissed the rei vindicatio claim . It found that PERSON More and PERSON were not bound by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE as they had not participated in the earlier proceedings and had only in the present proceedings had an opportunity to make their own claims . It further noted that a decision given in restitution proceedings could not prejudice the interests of third parties ; third parties who had in the meantime acquired property from the ORG could always oppose their rights to the former owner claiming restitution .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the urban development projects for which the land had been expropriated had been completed , which was sufficient ground to refuse restitution . Furthermore , by the time the restitution legislation had entered into force , the land had already become the property of ORG , as a result of its transformation into a limited liability company , whereas the legislation had only applied to property owned by the ORG or municipalities when it entered into force . In addition , the land had been lawfully acquired by PERSON in DATE . Accordingly , the applicant \u2019s father , succeeded by the applicant and her mother , could not have acquired any rights of ownership as a result of ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the applicant and her mother , on DATE the above - mentioned judgment was upheld by ORG , which reiterated that in DATE PERSON had validly acquired ownership of the disputed plot . It held further that the rei vindicatio action was in fact time - barred because the applicant \u2019s father had not complied with the DATE time - limit provided for in paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional and concluding provisions of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE during the course of these proceedings the applicant \u2019s mother died , leaving the applicant as her sole heir .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has not been informed of what happened to the remainder of the plot of land measuring QUANTITY following ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .

Although not expressly stipulated in LAW , according to settled judicial practice restitution was only possible where the property taken had remained ORG or municipally - owned .

The scope of that review was discussed in an ORG of DATE of ORG , which noted that a third party claiming rights to a restituted property was not bound by a decision given under LAW and could dispute all preconditions for restitution as provided for under LAW , as this was its sole means by which to defend its rights ( ORG CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043d\u0430 ORG \u043f\u043e \u0442. \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. ) .", "CARDINAL .
