As to the suspicion that the applicant was guilty of a breach of fiduciary duty , ORG found that mismanagement of the funds concerned had not been proved , as the funds disposed of assets of a considerable value .

During the investigation proceedings ORG may discontinue the criminal proceedings if they concern an offence for which it is not mandatory to impose a sentence of DATE imprisonment ( PERSON ) , if the defendant \u2019s guilt would be of a minor nature and if there was no public interest in criminal prosecution . The court which has jurisdiction to open the main proceedings must consent to discontinuing the proceedings unless they concern offences which are not subject to an increased minimum penalty and the consequences ensuing from the offence are minor .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , ORG may discontinue criminal proceedings concerning offences for which the regular minimum penalty is DATE imprisonment at the investigation stage with the defendant \u2019s consent , if the latter complies with certain conditions . These conditions must be suitable to remove the public interest in criminal prosecution and may not be in conflict with the severity of the defendant \u2019s guilt . Such conditions notably entail the payment of a sum of money to a non - profit - making organisation or to the ORG . The court which has jurisdiction to open the main proceedings must consent under certain circumstances . If the indictment has already been preferred with that court , the latter may discontinue the proceedings under the conditions set out in LAW with the consent of both ORG and the defendant ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that ORG may dispense with prosecuting an offence if the penalty in which the prosecution might result is not particularly significant compared to a penalty which has been imposed with binding effect upon the defendant for another offence or which he has to expect for another offence . It may also dispense with prosecuting an offence if a judgment in respect of that offence is not to be expected within a reasonable time and if the penalty which has been imposed on the defendant with binding effect or which he has to expect for another offence appears sufficient to have an influence on the offender and to defend the legal order . Pursuant to LAW , the court may provisionally discontinue proceedings upon the request of ORG at any stage if charges have already been preferred . If the proceedings have been discontinued provisionally on account of a penalty which was to be expected for another offence , the proceedings may be resumed , unless barred by limitation in the meantime , within DATE after the judgment delivered in respect of the other offence has become final ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW authorises ORG to limit prosecution to certain parts of an offence or certain breaches of the law if , in particular , other separable parts of the offence or other breaches of the law committed by the same act are not particularly significant for the penalty to be expected . The court may order such limitation with the consent of ORG at any stage of the proceedings after the bill of indictment has been filed ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The court may reintroduce into the proceedings those parts of the offence or breaches of the law which have not been considered at any stage of the proceedings ( Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW ORG discontinues the criminal investigation proceedings if investigations show that there are not sufficient reasons to prefer an indictment .

Pursuant to section CARDINAL of that Act , a defendant is notably entitled to compensation for damage incurred by certain specified measures of criminal prosecution if he is acquitted , if the proceedings against him are discontinued or if the court refuses to open the main proceedings against him .

Pursuant to LAW , taken in conjunction with LAW , an individual has the right to be compensated by the ORG for any damage arising from a breach of official duty committed by a public servant . These provisions are also applicable to a breach of duty in giving judgment on an action if the breach consists of a refusal to discharge a function or a delay in performing it contrary to professional duty .", "CARDINAL . Damages are afforded to the individual concerned in accordance with Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW . By LAW , in the version in force until DATE and applicable to damage caused up to that date , compensation for non - pecuniary damage can be awarded only if it is provided for by law . In this connection , LAW CARDINAL of LAW , in force until DATE , provided for non - pecuniary compensation only in the event of physical injury , damage caused to someone \u2019s health or deprivation of liberty . According to the established case - law of ORG , a claim for non - pecuniary damage can , moreover , arise in case of a serious violation of a person \u2019s personality rights ( ORG ) which can not be compensated for in another manner ( see , inter alia , ORG , no .

According to the settled case - law of ORG , LAW , read in conjunction with the principle of the rule of law as enshrined in LAW of LAW , guarantees the right to expeditious criminal proceedings ( see , inter alia , that court \u2019s judgment of DATE , no .

As the legislator did not lay down any rules on the consequences of a violation of the right to expeditious proceedings , the criminal courts and the prosecution authorities are , as a rule , called upon to draw the necessary conclusions from undue delay in the proceedings . They may discontinue the proceedings pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINALa of the Code of Criminal Procedure , limit criminal prosecution pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINALa of LAW , terminate the proceedings either by dispensing with a penalty or by a warning with sentence reserved ( PERSON ) or take the length of the proceedings into account as a mitigating factor when fixing the penalty ( see ORG , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , no .

In exceptional cases , in which the delay in the proceedings was particularly serious and had led to a particular burden for the person concerned and in which the said options provided by the criminal law and the law on criminal procedure were insufficient , the proceedings may be discontinued because of a constitutional impediment to the proceedings ( see ORG , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , no .
