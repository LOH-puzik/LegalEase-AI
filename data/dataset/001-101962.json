In this decision , following the filing of CARDINAL constitutional complaints challenging the constitutionality of the status of assessors , ORG decided to draw the attention of the PERSON ( the lower ORG ) to the need to consider a bill on the system of appointing persons who exercise judicial powers . It noted that both ORG and the ORG had shared the main arguments of the claimants as to the unconstitutionality . ORG noted that the possible finding of unconstitutionality in respect of the provisions governing the status of assessors could have far - reaching consequences for the whole system of the administration of justice , having regard to the number of assessors adjudicating in the district courts .", "CARDINAL .

Both complainants alleged that various provisions of the DATE Act which govern the position of assessors were incompatible , inter alia , with LAW , providing for the right to have one 's case examined by an impartial and independent court .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court heard the case as a full court ( CARDINAL judges ) . In the first part of the operative part it held that :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Law of DATE on ORG was incompatible with LAW . \u201d", "It found that the vesting of judicial powers in assessors by the Minister of ORG ( representing the executive ) was unconstitutional since the assessors did not enjoy the necessary guarantees of independence which were required of judges . As a preliminary point ORG considered that the constitutional requirements of independence were equally relevant for all courts , regardless of their level and scope of jurisdiction . It noted that the lack of independence of the first - instance court would amount to a breach of LAW even when the second - instance court examining an appeal complied with the requirements of independence .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court gave , inter alia , the following reasons :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ( ... ) Since DATE LAW explicitly refers to the content of LAW , being one of the sources of international law binding on our ORG , it should be added that ORG does not interpret the concept of \u201c a tribunal \u201d used in the LAW in the formalistic manner and accepts that \u201c a tribunal may be composed fully or partly of persons who are not professional judges \u201d ( ORG GPE , judgment of DATE , no . CARDINAL , and PERSON and Others v. the GPE , judgment of DATE ) . ( ... )", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the text of the statute , while adjudicating an assessor shall be independent and subject only to the LAW and statutes ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . However , ... , such regulation of itself is only a declaration , not ensuring the real and effective independence required by the LAW , unless the independence is supplemented by concrete guarantees , namely particular legal regulations related to effective securing of the observance of the particular elements of the concept of independence . ( ... )", "CARDINAL . The issue of independence from the Minister of ORG should be seen from the angle of the assessor 's appointment , the vesting of judicial powers in an assessor and his or her dismissal . In respect of the appointment , and in particular the vesting of judicial powers , the statute does not precisely specify the time frame in which such appointment should be made . Considered from the functional point of view , independence does not have to mean appointment for life or appointment until retirement age , but it must mean a certain level of stability in employment and in the exercise of judicial powers . It should be indicated here that the GPE case - law underlines precisely that if judges or persons exercising judicial powers are not appointed for life , they could be appointed for a certain term of office , and that they must benefit from a certain stability and must not be dependent on any authority ( judgment of the ORG of DATE in the case of ORG v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL ) . It may be indicated here that in attempting to define more closely a certain minimum period which would guarantee professional stability ORG found DATE to be sufficient ( judgment of the ORG of DATE in the case of ORG and Fell v. the GPE , ORG . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and DATE , and the judgment of the ORG of CARDINAL DATE in the case of Sramek v. GPE , no . CARDINAL ) . The regulation of the assessor 's status does not contain such guarantees , since there is no minimum period for which such a person is employed and no minimum period for which an assessor is vested with judicial powers . It is undoubtedly a situation which gives rise to significant misgivings as to its compliance with the principle of independence . In this respect the situation would have looked unambiguous if the statute had expressly determined the period for which an assessor was appointed and the period for which the judicial powers were vested . The existing regulation , implying discretion of the minister and the board of judges of the regional court ( ... ) thus amounts to CARDINAL - sided dependence of the assessor 's professional status on those organs .", "( ... )", "CARDINAL . NORP The principal argument indicative of the unconstitutionality of the vesting of judicial powers in an assessor is the admissibility of his or her dismissal , including even during the period in which an assessor exercises judicial powers . Even assuming the constitutional admissibility of the institution of temporarily vesting those powers in an assessor within the jurisdictional and temporal limits specified by a statute , then a rudimentary aspect of the principle of independence which must be adhered to also in this case requires that it should be possible to remove an assessor from office only in the same way as judges may be so removed or even only in some of those cases . The existing regulation , firstly , does not contain a proviso that the dismissal of an assessor ( CARDINAL who has been vested with judicial powers ) is allowed only as an exception to the rule . Secondly , the statute does not precisely set out the factual circumstances serving as justification for dismissal from the office . Thirdly , a decision on dismissal is taken by the Minister of ORG and not by a court . It follows that , regardless of whether dismissal from the office of assessor may be reviewed by a court , the essential requirements of independence from non - judicial authorities stemming from LAW are not met . The obligation [ to secure ] the approval of the board of judges of a regional court is not a pertinent circumstance , since this body is not a court but an organ of court administration , and moreover its approval is also of a discretionary character as there are no specific legal norms which indicate whether or not a dismissal is justified in a given situation . Consequently , there are no substantive guarantees and no adequate procedural guarantees which would indicate that the assessor 's dismissal on the ground of the content of his / her rulings is excluded . ( ... ) \u201d", "ORG also found that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The protection of the arbiter 's internal independence from outside , including political , pressures is particularly difficult when \u2013 as in the case of assessors \u2013 it is the Minister of ORG \u2013 a political appointee and a member of the executive \u2013 who has influence over their promotion and career . ( ... ) \u201d", "Furthermore , ORG found that an assessor was also dependent on a board of judges of the regional court since that body was competent to approve the vesting of judicial powers in him or her and to dismiss him or her . It also played a consultative role in the procedure for an assessor 's nomination for the position of district court judge . In addition , LAW did not prohibit assessors from being members of political parties .", "CARDINAL . In the second part of the operative part of the judgment ORG held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The provision mentioned in the first part of the operative part of the judgment ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) will lose its binding force DATE after the promulgation of the judgment in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The acts of the assessors referred to in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Act shall not be subject to a challenge on the basis of LAW . \u201d", "ORG ordered that the unconstitutional provision should be repealed DATE after the promulgation of the judgment . Its decision was motivated by the fact that assessors constituted PERCENT of the judicial personnel in the district courts and that their immediate removal would seriously undermine the administration of justice . During the DATE period it was constitutionally admissible for the assessors to continue adjudicating . That period was also necessary for ORG to enact new legislation dealing with the matter .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having regard to the constitutional importance of the finality of rulings , considered the consequences of its judgment for the validity of rulings given in the past by the assessors . It held that there was no possibility of reopening the proceedings in respect of such rulings under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the consequences of its judgment , ORG observed , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Ruling on the unconstitutionality of CARDINAL of LAW , ORG did not exclude the possibility of the existence of assessors as an institution . However , it questioned its normative framework , having regard to the vesting of judicial powers in assessors ( by the Minister of ORG , a representative of the executive ) to carry out the constitutional function of the administration of justice without also [ securing ] the constitutionally required guarantees of independence which judges enjoy . Nor should the judgment of ORG be understood as ruling out , in principle , the possibility to allow adjudication by persons other than judges within the meaning of LAW . In this respect also international standards binding on GPE indicate many possible types of solutions [ which are ] compatible with the rule of law . Those standards should be used by the legislator when considering a solution [ to the problem ] . In any case solutions to be considered should be such as to guarantee real separation between the judiciary and the other powers ( LAW ) , to loosen the bond between the assessors and the Minister of Justice [ and ] to ensure the influence of ORG on the professional career of a judge in spe . Without prejudging the future normative regulation of the institution of assessors , the present judgment of ORG should be understood as a negative constitutional assessment of the currently existing normative model of this institution . ( ... )", "CARDINAL In the present judgment the unconstitutionality concerns the institutional provisions [ who may exercise judicial powers ] . ( ... ) Thus , the question arises as to the relationship between the unconstitutionality of the said institutional provisions and the validity of the judgments given by the assessors . It should be underlined that the judgments DATE given [ by assessors ] during the period in which , in the light of the thenexisting constitutional standard , the vesting of judicial powers in the assessors was not challenged \u2013 can not be questioned . In particular , it would be an error to look for any analogy with a situation in which a ruling was given by a body which was incompetent or ( ... ) incorrectly composed . It was only the ruling of ORG which , ratione imperii , rebutted the presumption of constitutionality of the impugned norm [ section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ] . And in order to remove any doubts as to the legal significance of the rulings given so far by the assessors , ORG included in the operative part a suitable finding ( part II ( CARDINAL ) of the operative part ) . ( ... )", "CARDINAL The finality of rulings is itself a constitutional value . ( ... ) Thus , in every case the undermining of the finality of rulings has to be subject to the careful balancing of the values . This means that the judgments given by assessors in the period when the constitutionality of vesting judicial powers in them was not challenged can not be automatically questioned . ( ... ) On the one hand the duly implemented right to a court rules out staffing the independent court with judges who do not possess the guarantees of independence , which is determinative of the finding of unconstitutionality in the present case ; on the other hand , were it allowed to challenge the final judgments given by assessors in the period when the possibility of vesting judicial powers in them was not questioned , this would lead to the weakening of the right to a court and undermine the stability of the law and legal certainty . ( ... ) The protection of the finality of rulings is constitutionally embedded in LAW , which talks about the functioning of the public authorities ( courts in this case ) on the basis of , and within the limits of , the law . Thus , the final rulings are backed by the constitutional presumption stemming from this provision . It may be rebutted \u2013 when the ruling itself departs from the constitutional standard ( the unconstitutionality concerning substantive law or procedure applied in concreto when giving a final ruling ) . However , it would be disproportionate to undermine final rulings on the basis of the finding of pro futuro unconstitutionality which concerns the composition of a body giving those rulings , which acted in accordance with LAW at the time of giving them .", "( ... )", "CARDINAL In the present case the unconstitutionality concerns the institutional provisions , and thus a relationship between a concrete ruling and the unconstitutional norm is much more tenuous than in the case of unconstitutionality of a substantive or procedural provision applied in an individual case . ( ... )", "In ORG view it is not , however , possible that the relationship between the unconstitutional institutional provision ( as in the present case ) and the final ruling justifies the reopening of an individual ruling pursuant to LAW . The unconstitutionality of the rule determining who may be vested with the exercise of judicial powers does not have to mean that the content of the ruling or the procedure applied in reaching it is unconstitutional . ( ... ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG enacted the PERSON on ORG and ORG ( LAW Szkole S\u0105downictwa i GPE ) , which entered into force on DATE . The law establishes a comprehensive and centralised institution responsible for training judges and prosecutors .", "In response to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON on ORG abolished the institution of judicial assessors as provided for by LAW DATE on ORG ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . Furthermore , it specifically provided that as from CARDINAL DATE assessors ceased to be authorised to exercise judicial powers ( section DATE ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . In the above judgment ORG considered the relationship between its jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the ORG . It observed as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ( ... ) , ORG draws attention to the fact that the control exercised by ORG ) does not as such relate to the assessment of norms of the legal system of a State where the events considered as breaches of human rights occurred . [ Its control ] concerns concrete facts of breaches of human rights in the activities of public authorities in respect of concrete persons . In principle it is not a control of the provisions ( norms ) which constitute the legal order of the ORG , but an examination of a situation concerning potential individual breaches of human rights and freedoms laid down in the LAW . The control exercised in an individual case may occasionally indicate that the domestic legal order also contains norms which , as applied , led in concreto to a breach of human rights in the case examined by the ORG . This does not automatically amount to the disqualification of a norm in so far as its constitutionality is concerned .", "The jurisdiction of ORG in the constitutional complaint proceedings extends to controlling the constitutionality of legal norms in accordance with the principle adopted in LAW : \u201c In accordance with principles specified by statute , everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed shall have the right to appeal to ORG for a judgment on the conformity with LAW of a statute or other normative act on the basis of which a court or administrative authority has issued a final decision on his freedoms or rights or his obligations as specified in LAW . \u201d", "The duty to consider the effects of a relevant judgment of the ORG in the activities of the domestic authorities of the ORG obliges ORG to take into account \u2013 in the framework of its control of the constitutionality of norms \u2013 the standards elaborated by the ORG , with a view to eliminating possible conflicts between them . However , ORG does not examine whether the impugned provisions were correctly applied in individual cases , as this comes within the jurisdiction of the ordinary and administrative courts . Nor does [ ORG ] , in the proceedings initiated by a constitutional complaint , examine the compatibility of the reviewed norms with the international agreements . ( ... ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . LAW provides for the possibility of reopening the proceedings following a judgment of ORG . It reads as follows :", "\u201c The proceedings shall be reopened for the benefit of the accused when such a need results from a decision ( rozstrzygni\u0119cie ) of an international body acting on the basis of an international agreement ratified by GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants argued that the assessor who had heard their case in the first - instance court had not been \u201c an independent tribunal \u201d within the meaning of LAW . LAW reads , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him , everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill - founded within the meaning of LAW of the Convention . It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds . It must therefore be declared admissible .", "CARDINAL . The applicants argued that they had been deprived of a fair trial on account of the lack of independence of the trial court . They contended that the relevant legislation on the status of assessors had not met the standard of \u201c independent tribunal \u201d required under LAW . They supported this contention by the findings of ORG in its judgment of DATE and the case - law of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , persons exercising judicial powers had to benefit from certain stability and could not be dependent on any authority , while the regulation concerning assessors fell short of those guarantees . Secondly , the DATE Act was deficient as regards the possibility of an assessor 's dismissal . The guarantee of an \u201c independent tribunal \u201d required that an assessor should be able to be removed from office only in the same way as judges . However , the legislation provided for decisions concerning the dismissal of assessors to be taken by the Minister of ORG and not by a court . Thus , an assessor was not protected against the influence of the executive . Thirdly , as regards the perception of an assessor 's independence , the applicants asserted that the administration of justice had to be carried out in an independent and impartial manner . They underlined in this connection that their own negative perception of the assessor 's independence was of importance . This had been reinforced by the mistakes made by the assessor in the proceedings against the applicants . Lastly , the applicants submitted that the appellate court had not cured the lack of independence of the trial court . The appellate court , referring to ORG judgment , had simply held that the applicants ' misgivings about the trial court 's composition had been unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The Government underlined the importance of the principle of subsidiarity . They observed that ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE had ruled that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act was not in conformity with LAW . Subsequently , the ORG amended the relevant law and as of CARDINAL DATE the office of assessor ceased to exist in the NORP legal system . The ORG argued that since the source of the alleged violation had already been identified in ORG judgment , there was no need for the ORG to deal with the problem of the independence of assessors .", "CARDINAL . The Government commented on the comparison of the level of protection of judicial independence in the ORG and LAW . They maintained that up until DATE the ORG and ORG had interpreted the requirements of independence and impartiality in a similar manner . In that period , ORG had to a large extent been inspired by the ORG 's decisions and , in consequence , the NORP standard had in principle reflected the Convention standard .", "CARDINAL . However , ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE brought about a fundamental change in this area . It set the constitutional guarantees on a level significantly higher than that existing and accepted before . The ORG argued that it seemed virtually impossible for anyone but a professional judge to meet those standards , even though ORG had not excluded the possibility of justice being administered by \u201c persons with a status similar to that of judges , officially provided with guarantees of independence in adjudicating \u201d . In reaction to the judgment , ORG abolished the institution of assessors and decided against introducing any other , similar institution , being aware that in the light of the new standards the task would be virtually impossible .", "CARDINAL . They emphasised that prior to ORG judgment , assessors had been universally considered as an institution that fulfilled the constitutional criteria of independence and impartiality . The situation had changed significantly only after ORG \u201c signal decision \u201d ( postanowienie sygnalizacyjne ) in which it indicated the need to remedy a legal deficiency in connection with the examination of case no . ORG DATE . Thus , ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE should be assessed in this context as introducing a key modification of the manner of construing previously accepted institutions of the legal system .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the ORG argued that there were further reasons which rendered ORG judgment irrelevant to the outcome of the present case . Firstly , the ORG laid down a certain minimum standard to be met , while LAW , as the supreme act of domestic law , set out not a minimum but a maximum standard . In consequence , it could be possible for a measure that satisfied the Convention standard to be inconsistent with the constitutional standard . Secondly , ORG review concerned a single , coherent legal system rather that CARDINAL of different systems , so it was possible to develop the standard further . ORG , on the other hand , had to take into account differences between various NORP legal systems and could not set too detailed and far - reaching directives in its judgments . Thirdly , ORG review was a formal review of the conformity of lower ranking provisions with the LAW and , in principle , its jurisdiction did not extend to the issue of the application of a given provision in concreto . In contrast , the subject - matter of the ORG 's review was not the legal provision itself but the substantive content of the regulation and the effects it produced in an individual case . In conclusion , the ORG noted that the constitutional standard of independence as laid down in ORG judgment was stricter than that enshrined in LAW . Furthermore , ORG judgment did not determine that a court in which an assessor adjudicated lacked independence within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the office of an assessor differed from that of a judge . The former had been primarily devised as an intermediate stage between the judicial traineeship and the office of a judge . This resulted in a natural differentiation regarding the appointment procedure , tenure , possibility of dismissal and remuneration , yet the key element was to establish whether the level of safeguards provided for assessors was sufficient under LAW .", "The Government claimed that if the independence of an assessor were to be considered from CARDINAL perspectives , namely the positive one ( the assessor 's subordination in administering justice only to legal norms and their own beliefs ) and the negative one ( third parties ' inability to persuade them to decide the case in a given way ) then it could be considered that in reality assessors were independent in respect of their adjudicatory role , even though they were not equipped with all the constitutional guarantees . In addition , there were many arguments related to the case - law of the ORG which required that the independence of an assessor be assessed in a different way than that expressed in ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . The Government analysed in detail the provisions of the DATE Act regulating the status of assessors and , in particular , those related to the exercise of judicial powers by them . In their view , those regulations , which in many respects extended rules applicable to judges to assessors , fulfilled the standard of judicial independence defined in LAW .", "They emphasised that the constitutional guarantees of independence of the courts and professional judges ( Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the LAW ) had materially influenced the status of assessors . An assessor vested with judicial powers was a member of the community of judges and , following the common practice , was treated accordingly . In consequence , any attempt to undermine the actual independence of assessors had to be interpreted in the context of the guarantees enjoyed by judges . In practice , it meant that assessors had been required to comply with those very standards . The judicial community , particularly interested in maintaining the constitutional guarantees of independence and impartiality , had always exerted an extremely strong influence on assessors . The ORG further referred to the fact that both society and the legal community had considered assessors independent and equal to professional judges . They also pointed to the existence of institutions similar to that of the assessor in a number of NORP countries ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the possibility of dismissing an assessor provided for in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Act , the ORG argued that this power of the Minister of ORG had not been unrestrained since the necessary condition for dismissal was the prior consent of the board of ORG . That mechanism effectively protected an assessor against the threat of unjustified dismissal by the executive , thereby eliminating the possibility of pressure being brought by the Minister . The Government , basing themselves on the official statistics , emphasised that the Minister of ORG had never exercised the power to dismiss an assessor . Accordingly , the above arrangement had been in compliance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Government asserted that in the present case there had been no reason to consider that the assessor who had adjudicated in the case had not been objective . The applicants had tried from the outset of the proceedings to exclude all the judges , and they had subsequently done the same in respect of the assessor , using ORG judgment as a pretext . The Government claimed that in their appeal the applicants had not challenged the fact that their case had been decided by an assessor , but they had alleged a lack of impartiality on her part . This had been motivated by the negative outcome of the trial . The applicants had referred to the \u201c assessor \u201d as an institution rather than to the particular assessor only after the delivery of ORG judgment on the sideline of their appeal . Above all , the applicants had been unable to show that the assessor had not been independent .", "CARDINAL . The Government lastly drew the ORG 's attention to the fact that if all decisions issued by assessors were to be generally challenged by the ORG , it would undoubtedly cause legal chaos . Assessors constituted PERCENT of the judges adjudicating in ORG and in DATE alone CARDINAL cases were brought before those courts . Were the Court to find a violation in this and other similar cases , it would affect CARDINAL of judicial decisions given in DATE . Such a finding would create a breach of the principle of protection of the citizens ' trust in the ORG and its law . It would further undermine the need to protect the stability of the national legal system , as well as the Convention rights of other participants in those proceedings . Assessors had decided the majority of civil and criminal cases heard in the first instance before ORG . In most of the cases the effects of the decision made could not be reversed , for example where time spent in detention on remand had been credited towards the sentence , an inheritance had been accepted and disposed of , and so on .", "CARDINAL . Independently of the above arguments , the Government highlighted the negative effect a judgment finding a violation of the Convention in the present case would have . In their view , ORG judgment constituted a pretext for submitting the application to the ORG as , prior to its delivery , the independence of assessors had not been called into question . The finding of a violation by the ORG would create a chilling effect , discouraging ORG from further elevating any constitutional standard . The ORG should not suffer any negative consequences for elevating the standards of protection of individual rights . The chilling effect would probably affect not only ORG but also similar judicial authorities in other NORP countries .", "CARDINAL . The Government , referring to the ORG 's case - law , submitted that objections regarding the independence and impartiality of the first - instance court could not be upheld where the case had been examined by the court of second instance fully satisfying , as in the present case , the requirements of LAW . They acknowledged that the right to an independent and impartial court guaranteed in the LAW was of a substantive nature . Accordingly , since the assessment was carried out in respect of the result , the legal test was whether a final decision in the proceedings had been rendered by a court satisfying the requirements of independence .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the ORG submitted that the first - instance court , composed of an assessor , which dealt with the applicants ' case had been independent as required by LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recalls that in determining whether a body can be considered as \u201c independent DATE notably of the executive and of the parties to the case \u2013 regard must be had , inter alia , to the manner of appointment of its members and the duration of their term of office , the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence ( see ORG and PERSON v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; PERSON GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ; GPE v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Reports CARDINALIV ; PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALII ; and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . Furthermore , the irremovability of judges by the executive during their term of office must in general be considered as a corollary of their independence and thus included in the guarantees of LAW ( see ORG and Fell , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) . What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public ( see , amongst many other authorities , GPE v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL , and PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ... ) . ORG further recalls that the requisite guarantees of independence NORP apply not only to a \u201c tribunal \u201d within the meaning of LAW , but also extend to LOC \u201c the judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial NORP power \u201d referred to in LAW ( see PERSON v. the GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINALX ) .", "CARDINAL . Although the notion of the separation of powers between the political organs of government and the judiciary has assumed growing importance in the ORG 's case - law ( see GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINAL-IV ) , neither LAW nor any other provision of LAW to comply with any theoretical constitutional concepts regarding the permissible limits of the powers ' interaction ( see GPE and Others v. the GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . ORG , ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALVI , and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALXIII ) . The question is always whether , in a given case , the requirements of the Convention are met and in the present case the ORG has to determine whether the assessor B.R .- G. who tried the applicants in the first - instance court had the required \u201c appearance \u201d of independence ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALII ) .", "CARDINAL . Assessors were appointed by the Minister of ORG provided that they met a number of specific conditions stipulated in the CARDINAL Act ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The Minister could confer on an assessor the authority to exercise judicial power in a district court , subject to approval by the board of judges of a regional court and for a period not exceeding four years ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Act the Minister could remove an assessor , including those who were vested with judicial powers . However , the Minister had no unfettered discretion as to removal since he had to secure the approval of the board of judges of a regional court .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the status of assessors in its leading judgment of DATE . It held that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , providing that the Minister of ORG could confer the exercise of judicial powers on assessors , fell short of constitutional requirements because assessors did not enjoy the necessary guarantees of independence , notably vis - \u00e0 - vis the Minister . The ORG notes that in its analysis of the question of the independence of assessors ORG referred to the GPE case - law and observed that LAW was modelled on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that appointment of judges by the executive is permissible , provided that appointees are free from influence or pressure when carrying out their adjudicatory role ( see PERSON and Fell , cited above , \u00a7 DATE , and LOC v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . It notes that the principal reason for ORG finding was related to the Minister 's power to remove an assessor who exercised judicial powers , and the lack of adequate substantive and procedural safeguards against the discretionary exercise of that power ( see paragraph CARDINAL above , point CARDINAL of the judgment ) . LAW did not specify what factual grounds could serve as the basis for removal of an assessor and provided for the decision on removal to be taken by the Minister and not by a court . The lack of the requisite guarantees prompted ORG to note that the removal of an assessor based on the content of his rulings was not excluded .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG found , contrary to what was asserted by the Government , that the requirement to secure the approval of the board of judges was not a sufficient safeguard . The ORG 's statistics indicating that the Minister of ORG never exercised the power to remove an assessor do not , in the ORG 's view , invalidate the reasons for the finding of unconstitutionality . In addition , ORG was critical of the fact that LAW did not contain sufficient guarantees as regards the assessors ' term of office . The regulation did not specify a minimum period for which an assessor was employed and for which he was vested with judicial powers .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that it is in the first place for the domestic authorities , notably the courts , to interpret and apply the domestic law and to decide on issues of constitutionality ( see , among many other authorities , Former King of GPE and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINALXII , and PERSON and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALVI ) . The ORG notes that ORG findings were made in the context of an abstract review of the constitutionality of statutory provisions but , mindful of the principle of subsidiarity , considers that they may be applied to the facts of the present case , having regard to the similarity between the constitutional and the Convention requirements in so far as judicial independence is concerned and the reliance of ORG on the relevant jurisprudence of the ORG . The ORG argued that ORG judgment did not determine that an assessor lacked independence within the meaning of LAW . However , the ORG observes that in constitutional complaint proceedings ORG has no jurisdiction to review the compatibility of legislation with international agreements , including LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The important consideration for this Court is that ORG found that the manner in which GPE had legislated for the status of assessors was deficient since it lacked the guarantees of independence required under LAW , guarantees which are substantively identical to those under LAW . It would be justified for the ORG to reach a contrary conclusion only if it was satisfied that the national court had misinterpreted or misapplied the LAW provision or the ORG 's jurisprudence under that provision or reached a conclusion which was manifestly unreasonable ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL in fine , ORG DATE ... ) . The ORG observes that in some earlier cases it had due regard to rulings of ORG in which the latter declared domestic legislation unconstitutional and/or incompatible with LAW see , inter alia , in respect of the Bug river claims , PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ; rent - control legislation and LAW No . CARDINAL , ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no .

( extracts ) ; and regulation of prisoners ' visiting rights and LAW , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG underlines that ORG set aside the regulatory framework governing the institution of assessors as laid down in LAW . It further stresses that ORG did not exclude the possibility that assessors or similar officers could exercise judicial powers provided they had the requisite guarantees of independence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above , point CARDINAL of the judgment ) . ORG , referring to international standards , pointed to the variety of possible solutions for allowing adjudication by persons other than judges . In this connection , the ORG notes that its task in the present case is not to rule in abstracto on the compatibility with LAW institution of assessors or other similar officers which exist in certain Member States of ORG , but to examine the manner in which GPE regulated the status of assessors .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the foregoing , the ORG considers that the assessor B.R .- G. lacked the independence required by LAW , the reason being that she could have been removed by the Minister of Justice at any time during her term of office and that there were no adequate guarantees protecting her against the arbitrary exercise of that power by the Minister ( see , by contrast , PERSON v. GPE , no . ORG decision of DATE , in which the relevant NORP regulation provided that dismissal of probationary judges was susceptible to judicial review ) . It is not necessary to consider other aspects of the status of assessors since their removability by the executive is sufficient to vitiate the independence of ORG which was composed of the assessor PERSON", "CARDINAL . It remains to be determined whether the failing in question was rectified on appeal by ORG . This court was composed of a professional judge with tenure and was thus \u201c an independent tribunal \u201d as required LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention . The possibility certainly exists that a higher or the highest court might , in some circumstances , make reparation for defects that took place in the first - instance proceedings ( see FAC , cited above , \u00a7 DATE , and GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . ORG , ORG CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXIII ) . In this connection the ORG notes that ORG considered that review by the second - instance court could not remedy the initial defect as regards the lack of independence . In the present case , ORG did not have the power to quash the judgment on the ground that ORG had been composed of the assessor since the assessors vested with judicial powers were \u2013 in accordance with the DATE LAW authorised to hear cases in firstinstance courts . In any event , the applicants raised the issue of the lack of independence of the assessor in their appeal . However , ORG dismissed their objections as unfounded . The ORG observes that for the purposes of ORG judgment , any appeal based on the unconstitutional status of assessors was bound to fail as the impugned provisions of the DATE Act remained legally binding for DATE following the promulgation of the judgment . In those circumstances the ORG finds that ORG did not remedy the defect in question ( see , PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE , and PERSON v. the GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the foregoing , the ORG finds that ORG was not independent within the meaning of LAW . There has accordingly been a violation of this provision .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the domestic law provides for a possibility of reopening of criminal proceedings when such a need results from a judgment of the Court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , in light of the reasons underlying the finding of a violation in the present case and having regard to the principle of legal certainty as expounded in ORG judgment and its own case - law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the ORG considers that in the present case there are no grounds which would require it to direct the reopening of the applicants ' case ( see , mutatis mutandis , ORG v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . The ORG would not exclude that it might take a different approach in a case where , for example , the circumstances of a particular case give rise to legitimate grounds for believing that the Minister had or could reasonably be taken to have an interest in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also complained under LAW ( c ) of the LAW about the ORG refusal to admit a representative of a civil society organisation to the proceedings . Relying on LAW , they alleged that their conviction amounted to discrimination on the ground of their social origin .", "CARDINAL . However , in the light of all the material in its possession , and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence , the ORG finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the ORG or its Protocols . It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill - founded and must be rejected in accordance with LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto , and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made , the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants claimed CARDINAL ( ORG ) each in respect of nonpecuniary damage . They submitted , inter alia , that their case had been examined by an assessor and not by a judge .", "CARDINAL . The Government argued that the claim was grossly excessive .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that in the particular circumstances of the instant case the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for any nonpecuniary damage which may have been sustained by the applicants . It refers in this connection to its conclusions set out in paragraph CARDINAL above regarding reopening .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recalls that in the specific context of cases against GPE concerning the independence and impartiality of the national security courts , the ORG has indicated in certain judgments that , in principle , the most appropriate form of redress would be for the applicant to be given a retrial without delay if he or she so requested ( see , among other authorities , Gen\u00e7el v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . ORG adopted a similar stance in cases against other Contracting Parties where the finding of a breach of LAW was related to the lack of independence or impartiality of the domestic courts ( see , PERSON Club v. GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALIX , and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . ORG has endorsed the general approach adopted in those cases ( see , GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIV ) and has extended it to cases where a conviction followed proceedings that entailed breaches of the requirements of LAW ( see , PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALII ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , it is only exceptionally that a violation , by its very nature , does not leave any real choice as to the measures required to remedy it ( see , PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALII ) . In the present case , the ORG notes that the judgment of ORG identified a structural dysfunction and called for a legislative response . Such response was given by the ORG which removed the structural dysfunction as of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG is of the opinion that in this particular context the finding of a violation need not necessarily entail the respondent ORG 's obligation to reopen all proceedings in which assessors participated at the first - instance level . In this regard , the ORG notes that ORG devoted a substantial part of its judgment to the constitutional importance of the principle of the finality of rulings . In particular , it observed that it would be disproportionate and contrary to legal certainty to allow challenges to final rulings given by assessors in the period when the manner of conferring judicial powers on them had not been constitutionally questioned . Further , it emphasised that the finding of unconstitutionality concerned institutional provisions , that is , provisions regulating the composition of the bodies which gave final rulings . ORG considered that the finding of unconstitutionality in respect of such provisions was not determinative of unconstitutionality in respect of the content of a final ruling given by an assessor or the procedure employed to reach it ( see paragraph CARDINAL above in fine ) . Consequently , ORG held in the operative part of the judgment that its ruling could not serve as a basis for the reopening of cases decided in the past by assessors ( or with their participation ) . This ruling was even extended to CARDINAL claimants who successfully challenged the provisions regulating the status of assessors before ORG , thus depriving them of the so - called \u201c right of privilege \u201d ( przywilej korzy\u015bci ) .", "CARDINAL . In this context , the ORG recalls its case - law according to which the principle of legal certainty , which is necessarily inherent in the law of the LAW , may dispense GPE from questioning legal acts or situations that antedate judgments of the ORG declaring domestic legislation incompatible with the LAW . The same considerations apply where a constitutional court annuls domestic legislation as being unconstitutional ( see ORG v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . DATE ) . Moreover , it has also been accepted , in view of the principle of legal certainty , that a constitutional court may set a time - limit for the legislator to enact new legislation with the effect that an unconstitutional provision remains applicable for a transitional period ( see GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . Referring to ORG decision not to allow the reopening of the cases decided in the past by assessors on the ground that it would undermine the principle of legal certainty , the ORG does not consider this interpretation to have been arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable . Indeed , the ORG in its jurisprudence has underlined the significance of the principle of legal certainty in the context of final judicial rulings ( see , mutatis mutandis , ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the domestic law provides for a possibility of reopening of criminal proceedings when such a need results from a judgment of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , having regard to the foregoing , the ORG reiterates its conclusion that in the instant case the reopening of the applicants ' case is not called for ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG would further observe that in the view of ORG the constitutional deficiency identified in its judgment required the intervention of the legislator to bring the status of assessors into line with LAW , but there was no automatic correlation between that deficiency and the validity of each and every ruling given previously by assessors in individual cases . To that end FAC ruled that the unconstitutional provision should be repealed DATE after the promulgation of its judgment . It is noteworthy that the constitutional and Convention deficiency regarding the status of assessors was remedied by the domestic authorities \u2013 which decided to abolish the office of assessor altogether \u2013 within the time - frame allotted by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Having regard to the above , it may be noted that the authorities of the respondent ORG took the requisite remedial measures in order to address and remedy the deficiency underlying the present case .", "DATE . The applicants also claimed ORG CARDINAL in legal costs . Their representative claimed to have worked TIME on the case with an TIME rate of LAW . No receipts or invoices were provided in support of the sum claimed .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that any award should be limited to those costs which were actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the applicant received EUR CARDINAL by way of legal aid from ORG . According to the ORG 's case - law , an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum . In the absence of any evidence to support the applicants ' claim as to costs and expenses , no award is made under this head . The ORG observes that in light of the reasons underlying the finding of a violation in the present case and the fact that the authorities took adequate measures to address the deficiency at issue , the ORG considers that there is no justification for awarding legal costs under LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
