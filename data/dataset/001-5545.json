Circumstances of the case", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "I.", "In DATE the applicant was charged with murder ( committed in DATE ) , sexual intercourse with a minor ( committed in DATE ) and assault , and reckless driving and driving while intoxicated ( committed in DATE ) . The examination concluded that the applicant had not been in possession of his senses at the time of the crimes of which he was accused . As long as he remained ill he had to be considered very dangerous to others . Agreeing with this finding , ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4kint\u00f6hallitus , medicinalstyrelsen ) in DATE ordered the applicant to undergo compulsory psychiatric treatment in pursuance of Section CARDINALa , subsection CARDINAL , and LAW on the Mentally Ill ( mielisairaslaki , sinnessjuklag MONEY ) . In DATE the applicant was found guilty of the aforementioned offences but was not sentenced , given his mental state at the time of committing them . In DATE he was placed under guardianship .", "Following the entry into force of the DATE LAW ( mielenterveyslaki , mentalv\u00e5rdslag DATE ) in DATE , compulsory care shall be reviewed at maximum interval of DATE . Any prolongation order must be confirmed by the competent county administrative court ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tt ) . In so far as this is immediately relevant to the present application , the applicant \u2019s care has been extended as follows .", "On DATE the Senior Physician responsible for the applicant \u2019s treatment considered that he was still in need of compulsory psychiatric care and ordered its prolongation . The Deputy to the Senior Physician had found that the applicant continued to suffer from a psychosis ( schizo - affectiva ) and a personality disturbance . In DATE and DATE he had been convicted of deprivation of liberty and rape . In DATE he had been convicted of a continued offence comprising deprivation of liberty , rape and assault . In addition , he had , in DATE , raped his then CARDINAL-year - old sister - in - law who had become pregnant . On CARDINAL DATE he had murdered his wife by stabbing her CARDINAL times while she had been holding their DATE son in her arms .", "The applicant objected to the prolongation order and requested , inter alia , that his mental state be examined \u201c impartially \u201d in a \u201c civil hospital \u201d . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a further examination of his mental state and confirmed the prolongation order , having regard to the reasons stated by ORG and his deputy . The applicant appealed further , considering that his compulsory care was not justified and seeking damages from the ORG . On DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) declined to examine the applicant \u2019s claims for damages and upheld ORG decision . No oral hearing was held at either court level .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s compulsory care was again prolonged by the Senior Physician . His order was confirmed by ORG on DATE . The applicant did not appeal .", "On DATE the Senior Physician prolonged the applicant \u2019s compulsory care in the light of the Deputy \u2019s opinion of DATE which was very similar to the CARDINAL issued in DATE . On DATE ORG confirmed this prolongation order . It noted , inter alia , the opinion of ORG , the terms of his decision , the information in the applicant \u2019s patient records regarding his state of health . The court concluded that the applicant remained mentally ill . His discharge would significantly aggravate that illness and seriously jeopardise the health and safety of himself and others . The other means of treating his illness had remained inapplicable or insufficient .", "The applicant appealed and also requested that he be transferred to another mental hospital . ORG obtained opinions from the Chief Physician of the hospital and the Senior Physician responsible for the applicant \u2019s treatment . In his rejoinder to those opinions the applicant requested a new and complete examination of his mental state . On DATE ORG declined to examine the applicant \u2019s requests and dismissed his appeal , thus confirming ORG decision . No oral hearing was held at either court level .", "On DATE the Senior Physician again prolonged the applicant \u2019s compulsory care . In her opinion the Deputy to the Senior Physician had found that the applicant continued to suffer from the aforementioned psychosis and personality disturbance . Should he be discharged , there would exist a very high risk that he would commit heinous violent offences . The Deputy again made reference to various crimes which the applicant had committed . On DATE ORG confirmed the above prolongation order . Similar prolongation orders were issued on DATE and CARDINAL DATE as well as on DATE , and subsequently confirmed by ORG .", "During a certain period starting in DATE the applicant was apparently placed in a closed ward .", "According to an official extract from ORG ( rikosrekisteri , straffregistret ) , the applicant has been found guilty of the crimes mentioned below .", "Judgment of DATE :", "Deliberate refusal to perform military service , committed in DATE .", "( The applicant was sentenced to conditional imprisonment . )", "Judgment of DATE ( upheld on appeal in DATE ) :", "CARDINAL .

Relevant domestic law and practice", "Under section CARDINAL of LAW a person can be ordered to undergo compulsory care in a psychiatric hospital if he or she is diagnosed as mentally ill ; if he or she needs treatment for a mental illness which , if not treated , would become considerably aggravated or severely endanger his or her health or safety or the health or safety of others ; and if all other mental health services are inapplicable or inadequate .", "According to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , a patient \u2019s right to self - determination may be limited and coercive means may be used only to the extent necessary for the treatment of his or her illness , for his or her safety or for the safety of others . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the Deputy Chancellor of ORG ( valtioneuvoston apulaisoikeuskansleri , statsr\u00e5dets justitiekanslersadjoint ) ad interim found that the restriction of telephone calls to a patient in a mental hospital could not be held to have been in clear violation of LAW , subsection CARDINAL . The Deputy Chancellor nevertheless drew the competent ORG \u2019s attention to the requirement that restrictions of fundamental rights should be sufficiently detailed . On this point the legislation should therefore be amended . An application lodged under the Convention in respect of the restriction in question was eventually settled ( no . ORG ; see \u201c The Law \u201d below ) .", "According to the DATE LAW ( laki potilaan asemasta ja oikeuksista , lag om patientens st\u00e4llning och r\u00e4ttigheter DATE ) , patient records shall be kept confidential .

The Deputy Ombudsman noted that the hospital had not abolished this practice despite her earlier decision of CARDINAL DATE in which she had reached the same conclusion . Prior to that decision she had heard ORG ( tietosuojavaltuutettu , dataombudsmannen ) , who had reached the same conclusion .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW stipulates , inter alia , that the keeper of personal data files shall ensure that the personal integrity , interests and rights of anyone registered in such a file are not unduly encroached upon . LAW , subsection CARDINAL , requires that only information of relevance to the purpose of the file shall be included . In her CARDINAL decisions the Deputy Ombudsman underlined that an assessment should be made in respect of each patient as to the necessity of including and retaining photographs . Photographs should only appear in his or her records if the specific care needs of the patient so warranted . LAW did not allow for the inclusion of photographs in patient records in the interests of the security of other patients , staff or society as a whole .", "The keeper of a personal file shall speedily correct , delete or supplement information on file which is incorrect , unnecessary , incomplete or outdated and provided such information evidently jeopardises the protection of the integrity or the interests or rights of the person in question . If the file - keeper refuses a request to the above effect it shall provide a reasoned certificate thereof ( section CARDINAL ) . At the request of the registered person ORG may order the file - keeper to take the requested action ( section DATE ) . If this order is not complied with or if ORG decides not to take action , the registered person may bring the matter before ORG ( tietosuojalautakunta , datasekretessn\u00e4mnden ) , whose decision may be appealed to ORG ( sections CARDINAL and DATE ) .", "According to the LAW of DATE ( NORP hallitusmuoto , NORP f\u00f6r GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , as in force up to DATE , anyone who has suffered an infringement of his rights , or damage , through an illegal act or negligence on the part of a civil servant , is entitled to demand that the civil servant be convicted and held liable for damages , or to report him for the purpose of having charges brought against him ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . A similar provision appears in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . LAW ( \u201c Basic rights and liberties \u201d ) of LAW was amended by Act no . CARDINAL which entered into force on CARDINAL DATE .
