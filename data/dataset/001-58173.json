He is an officer in the NORP navy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Maillard caused to be entered in the complaints register of the fleet escort ship D\u2019Estr\u00e9es the following application for reconsideration of his assessment for DATE :", "\u201c \u2026", "I \u2026 learnt that at senior level and at supreme level my marks had been significantly reduced : for the criterion \u2018 standard of service\u2019 the mark had been lowered from CARDINAL to CARDINAL and for the criterion \u2018 promotion\u2019 from B to C+ , the whole being accompanied by the following written appraisal : \u2018 Is not up to the level that should be achieved by a second in ORG ( or , within a word or CARDINAL , a very similar expression ) . To this day I have been given no explanation of this reduction in marks or of what prompted such a statement .", "I consider that this appraisal is excessively severe , unjust and personally offensive . I would refer in this connection to the appraisal made by Commander PERSON , the assessor at immediate - superior level , to the smooth running of the ship during the period on which my assessment was based and to the responsibility I bear under the rules for that smooth running , and , lastly , to the good performance of the D\u2019Estr\u00e9es during the general inspections of DATE and DATE , attested by the messages of congratulations sent by the admiral commanding the LOC fleet on those occasions .", "Furthermore , the appraisal calls in question the wisdom of the decisions of those of my superiors who on CARDINAL occasions saw fit to appoint me to a second - in - command post and the appraisals made by the various commanding officers who assessed me as their second in command .", "I accordingly have the honour to request that", "( CARDINAL ) the sentence \u2018 Is not up to the level that should be achieved by a second in ORG should be deleted . It is an appraisal made not of the standard of my performance which is meant to be the subject of the assessment , but of my person , in a manner which casts a slur on my honour as it is offensive ;", "( CARDINAL ) the criteria CARDINAL , DATE ( standard of service and promotion ) and consequently DATE and CARDINAL ( promotion and \u2018 ORG at supreme level ) should be raised in consequence , given the implied meaning of the sentence complained of in regard to the level of my service and my promotion potential ; and", "( CARDINAL ) once my marks at senior and supreme level have been reassessed , given the effect that my DATE assessment may have under the current rules , on the introductory memorandum submitted by ORG for the competitive examination for entry to ORG , it should be considered whether that reassessment is not such as to justify reconsideration of my failing that examination . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Chief of Staff dismissed the complaint . In a letter of DATE he informed the Commander - in - Chief for the LOC of the fact and requested that the applicant should be notified of it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having still not received any reply , the applicant had sent his complaint to the Minister of Defence ; it was dismissed in a decision taken by the Minister on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE Mr Maillard applied to the ORG d\u2019Etat for judicial review of those CARDINAL decisions . He filed supplementary pleadings on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The marks and appraisals shall be compulsorily communicated to the service personnel DATE . When the assessment is made , the chief shall make known to each of his subordinates his appraisal of each individual \u2019s performance\u2019 . The same PERSON provides in LAW that implementing provisions shall be laid down in decrees adopted after consultation of the ORG d\u2019Etat . Similarly , under LAW , the special rules governing professional service personnel must be laid down in a decree adopted after consultation of the ORG d\u2019Etat .", "\u2026 Mr Maillard \u2019s assessment for DATE was drawn up according to the procedure of assessment at several successive levels of authority and to an assessment scale laid down in the ministerial directive of CARDINAL DATE concerning the assessment of naval officers . That directive laid down new general rules which govern the implementation of the PERSON and which could therefore only have been lawfully laid down by a decree adopted after consultation of the PERSON d\u2019Etat . It follows that the impugned decision containing Mr Maillard \u2019s assessment for DATE , together with the ORG decisions whereby the ORG Chief of Staff and thereafter the Minister of Defence refused to revise the assessment , decisions made under rules issued by an authority lacking the necessary competence , are unlawful \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG Chief of Staff decided to remove the impugned assessment from the applicant \u2019s personal file , to draw up and add to that file a new assessment for DATE identical with the first one and to refuse the application for retrospective adjustment of career . On the latter point the Chief of Staff considered that \u201c the development of [ the applicant \u2019s ] career [ had ] not been affected by the formal irregularity impugned by the PERSON d\u2019Etat , an irregularity which [ had ] not , in particular , had the consequence of placing this senior officer in circumstances different from those in which the other officers competing with him [ found ] or [ might ] have found themselves \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Mr Maillard complained to ORG of the ORG d\u2019Etat about the difficulties he considered he was encountering in having the judgment of DATE executed .", "On DATE the Deputy General Rapporteur replied that the administrative authorities had in fact drawn the appropriate conclusions from the judgment setting aside the first assessment for DATE and that if he wished to challenge the lawfulness of the decision of CARDINAL DATE on its merits , he would have to apply to ORG of the ORG d\u2019Etat .", "CARDINAL .

That decree did not come into force until DATE .", "It appears from the evidence that while Mr Maillard \u2019s new assessment for DATE was drawn up according to the procedure of assessment at several successive levels provided for in LAW of DATE on the assessment of service personnel , that decree was not applicable to assessments drawn up for DATE . Moreover , no other provision of service regulations provided for the implementation of such a procedure for DATE . The applicant is accordingly justified in seeking to have his assessment for DATE quashed . Furthermore , the administrative authorities could not lawfully refuse him retrospective adjustment of his career without undertaking a fresh review of his position and his merit . \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s other claims were dismissed .", "CARDINAL .

The hearing took place on DATE , and in a judgment of DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat quashed the assessment of CARDINAL DATE on the following grounds :", "\u201c \u2026", "In a decision of DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat , acting in its judicial capacity , quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE whereby Mr Maillard \u2019s assessment for DATE was determined , on the ground that the assessment had been drawn up according to the procedure of assessment at several successive levels and to an assessment scheme , both of which ( the procedure and the scheme ) had been laid down in a ministerial directive of CARDINAL DATE , setting out general rules , which by sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Law of DATE , as amended , must be enacted in a decree adopted after consultation of the ORG d\u2019Etat . In a decision of DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat , acting in its judicial capacity , quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE whereby Mr Maillard \u2019s assessment for DATE was redetermined , on the ground that the assessment had been drawn up according to the procedure for assessment at several successive levels which was provided for in LAW of DATE on the assessment of service personnel , although that decree was not applicable to assessments drawn up for DATE and there was no provision in general regulations for the implementation of such a procedure for DATE . Following the quashing of those decisions , it was for the Minister of Defence to take the necessary measures to ensure that Mr Maillard was retrospectively assessed for DATE under the rules then applicable . In the absence of a decree adopted after consultation of the ORG d\u2019Etat as provided in LAW DATE , as amended , it was for the commanding officer of the D\u2019Estr\u00e9es in DATE , the ship on which Mr Maillard performed the duties of second - in - command , to make that assessment and , if appropriate , for the assessed officer to appeal to a higher authority . Only if it had been impossible to carry out that exercise for factual or legal reasons could the administrative authority have lawfully reviewed Mr Maillard \u2019s performance for DATE in the sole light of all the information in his file which concerned the assessment period .", "\u2026 [ W]ithout ascertaining whether it was possible to have PERSON assessment carried out afresh by the commanding officer of the D\u2019Estr\u00e9es in DATE , ORG , instead of making a fresh assessment of the qualities of the assessed officer for the period in question , did no more than reproduce in full the quashed assessments which had been drawn up by means of a procedure entailing several successive levels of authority , a procedure that had been censured in the aforementioned decisions of the ORG d\u2019Etat . The impugned decision of CARDINAL DATE was accordingly unlawful and must be quashed , without its being necessary to order discovery of the [ report of the ] inquiry by commanding officers as sought by Mr Maillard . \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s other claims were dismissed .", "CARDINAL .
