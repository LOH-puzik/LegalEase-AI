De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing in a criminal case concerning a largescale fraud and generating considerable media interest was held before FAC . Advocate PERSON , representing CARDINAL accused ( DATE ) submitted to the court a power of attorney authorising another advocate , Ms GPE who also represented LANGUAGE , to replace him for the purposes of representing his other CARDINAL clients . The court accepted that document without any comment .", "CARDINAL . During the same hearing a heated exchange broke out between lawyers representing various defendants as to the possibility of a conflict of interest between various clients of lawyers involved in the case , including between ORG CARDINAL clients PERSON and GPE on the one hand and A.M.D. , represented by advocate GPE , on the other . During that exchange advocate PERSON declared that he would not represent A.M.D. any longer .", "The court expressed the view that it was too early at that stage of the proceedings to determine whether there was any conflict of interest between the accused which would have prevented the same lawyers from representing them . The courts admonished the lawyers several times for allowing the debate to get out of hand and for their inappropriate conduct in the courtroom .", "CARDINAL . On DATE informed his clients PERSON and GPE on the phone that he would not be able to attend the hearing scheduled for DATE . He referred to the authorisation he had given to Ms GPE on DATE to replace him for the purposes of that hearing . He also informed PERSON accordingly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held the hearing . Advocate PERSON was absent . Advocate PERSON informed the court that he had informed her that he had authorised her to replace him for the purposes of that hearing and referred to the authorisation submitted to the case file at the hearing of DATE .", "Subsequently , the court declared , having regard to the testimony given by LANGUAGE at the previous hearing , that there was a conflict of interest between LOC and LOC and that , accordingly , they could not be represented by the same lawyer .", "The court adjourned the hearing having regard to the fact that advocate PERSON was to represent both her client A.M.D. and PERSON on the basis of the authorisation given to her by advocate PERSON on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , a newspaper published in GPE , published an article written by the applicant and entitled \u201c A Lawyer \u2019s Nonchalance ? \u201d", "The applicant alleged that ORG , the advocate representing the accused in a major criminal case pending before FAC , had failed to meet his professional obligations and act diligently by failing to attend the hearing held on DATE .", "The relevant part of the text read :", "\u201c ( ... ) \u2018 it is the absence of the defence lawyer which is a ORG explained the presiding judge , ORG", "Advocate PERSON failed to attend the hearing and did not justify his absence . He only asked another advocate to tell the court that he could not attend the hearing and requested that advocate ( DATE before the hearing ) to replace him . The court could not accept that replacement , because the interests of the defendants represented by ORG and by that advocate were in conflict . The court could not but adjourn the hearing .", "Advocate PERSON was well aware of that conflict . Other defence lawyers in that case had drawn his attention to it . It is difficult not to see his absence as disrespect towards the court , the prosecutor ( ... ) , the parties who reside in GPE . He is , after all , supposed to know how to justify an absence before a court .", "\u2018 I am baffled by the attitude of the defence lawyer\u2019 said judge ORG", "The court informed the local ORG about the lawyer \u2019s conduct . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After the hearing , advocate ORG first requested the newspaper to publish a rectification , within the meaning of LAW , arguing that the conflict of interest between his clients and the client of PERSON had been officially acknowledged only on DATE . Hence , he could not reasonably have been expected to know that his absence on that date would entail the adjournment of the proceedings . He argued that at the hearing held on DATE there had been an exchange between the lawyers involved in the case as to the possibility of a conflict arising between the various defendants , including between his CARDINAL clients and PERSON , represented by PERSON However , on that date the court had only expressed the view that it was inappropriate to have that argument in the courtroom . No finding in respect of the conflict of interest had been made on that date . In any event , he had stepped down as LOC \u2019s defence lawyer .", "CARDINAL . NORP The newspaper refused to publish a rectification within the meaning of the DATE LAW . On DATE it merely published the advocate \u2019s letter under the heading \u201c Letters \u201d , accompanied by the applicant \u2019s unfavourable comment , essentially reiterating the allegation of negligence on his part . The applicant wrote that ORG had informed his clients by phone on DATE that he had given PERSON his authorisation to act on his behalf in their defence . It was further stated that his clients had been unaware that he would be absent on DATE . \u201c [ t]his is what they told me \u201d \u2013 the applicant concluded .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the advocate sued the newspaper , the applicant and the editorinchief of PERSON for breach of his personal rights within the meaning of Articles DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing in that case held on DATE ORG heard as witnesses PERSON and GPE , the claimant \u2019s clients and defendants in the criminal case . PERSON stated that the claimant had known as early as DATE that he would not be able to attend the hearing scheduled for DATE and that he had therefore authorised PERSON to replace him . The criminal judge had accepted that authorisation without objections . A.D. made a similar statement . He added that after the hearing of DATE he had briefly talked with a journalist in the court \u2019s corridor and that he had not told her that he had not been informed about the advocate \u2019s absence prior to that hearing .", "CARDINAL . The court had regard to the article published by the applicant on DATE and to her comments on the claimant \u2019s letter published on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , to the correspondence between the claimant and the defendant editor - in - chief , to the minutes of the hearings held on CARDINAL and DATE and to the parties\u2019 statements .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance judgment was given on DATE . ORG first recounted the exchange of views between the lawyers during the hearing held in the criminal case on DATE as to the possible conflict of interest between their clients . It noted the criminal court \u2019s statement , recorded in TIME of that hearing , that there had been no basis at that time to find that a conflict of interest had indeed existed . It further found that on DATE the lawyer had informed his clients and PERSON on the phone that he would not be able to attend the hearing scheduled for DATE . On DATE the criminal court had made an official declaration , again recorded in the minutes , that a conflict existed between the interests of A.M.D. and PERSON and that they could therefore not be represented by the same lawyer , and adjourned the hearing until DATE .", "The civil court noted that in her CARDINAL articles the applicant had accused the claimant of unprofessional conduct . She had made an untrue statement to the effect that the claimant \u2019s clients had not known before the hearing of DATE that the claimant would not attend it . The articles had been widely discussed in local legal circles and had had a negative impact on the claimant \u2019s situation . Some of his clients had lost their trust in him .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the evidence before it had demonstrated that the applicant \u2019s allegation that LOC and GPE had been informed of the claimant \u2019s absence only at the hearing of DATE was untrue . The claimant had already known about his absence on DATE . It was shown by the fact that on that date he had authorised another lawyer to act on his behalf in the defence of his clients . They had already been aware of it on that date . The criminal court had accepted this authorisation for Ms GPE to act without comments or objections . On that date no finding had been made by that court that there had been a conflict of interest between the clients represented by the claimant and those represented by Ms GPE In these circumstances , the claimant had had no reason to expect that his absence on DATE would disturb the conduct of the proceedings . Consequently , his non - attendance on DATE could not be seen as unjustified or his conduct regarded as nonchalant or disrespectful .", "CARDINAL . The court was of the view that the articles concerned had breached the claimant \u2019s personal rights . The applicant had alleged that he had failed to attend the hearing and to justify his absence and that the hearing on DATE had had to be adjourned because of his conduct .", "The court noted that under LAW the press enjoyed freedom of expression . That freedom was not absolute ; it could be restricted in certain circumstances . In particular , the press was obliged to respect the rights of other persons . LAW obliged journalists to show diligence and integrity in gathering materials and publishing articles , because press publications could potentially harm individuals in a manner much more powerful than any other means of defamation .", "CARDINAL . The court was of the view that the applicant should have contacted the claimant before the publication of the article on DATE and ask for his comments . She had failed to do so .", "CARDINAL . The article published by the applicant had lacked objectivity , contained undeserved criticism of the claimant and had been sensationalist rather than aimed at informing readers about the criminal case in a balanced manner . In particular , its title was particularly sensationalist . The newspaper had a wide readership in the region and therefore the impact of the article on public opinion was likely to have been significant and seriously detrimental to the claimant \u2019s interests . Hence it was necessary to impose on the defendants an obligation to publish an apology and a rectification .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court further imposed on the defendants an obligation to pay , jointly , MONEY ( ORG ) to a charity . It observed that that amount was significant enough to have an impact on the publisher , but not high enough to be seen as seriously detrimental to his financial position .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , submitting that she had fulfilled her journalistic duties in reporting the case . Her view that the advocate had failed to act diligently in the representation of his clients had been well - founded and the firstinstance court had wrongly established the facts of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the contested judgment , essentially sharing the conclusions of the lower court .", "CARDINAL . It observed that the right to freedom of expression guaranteed both by the LAW and the ORG could be restricted in a NORP society for the purposes of the protection of individual rights such as dignity or personal rights within the meaning of LAW and in compliance with the principle of proportionality enshrined in LAW . Where the exercise of the freedom of expression collided with the protection of the reputations of individuals , such a conflict had to be resolved with due regard being had to the case - law of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the applicant \u2019s article published on DATE concerned the conduct of a criminal case generating considerable interest among the general public . However , that did not imply that an interference with the claimant \u2019s personal rights had been necessary . Judicial reporting had to be objective and strict priority had to be given to information , with due regard to the facts recorded by way of court records , which could be considered reliable ; not to the reporter \u2019s opinions and views . In the light of this principle , nothing justified the title \u201c A Lawyer \u2019s Nonchalance ? \u201d , referring to the lawyer who had been named in the article . Moreover , the text had contained untrue information to the effect that the court had made clear its intention to complain about the lawyer \u2019s conduct to ORG . It had not been shown that the court had indeed made such a declaration or even suggested that it intended to do so . The ORG s intention to annoy the claimant and to undermine his professional reputation and integrity for the purposes of making the text more attractive or sensational could not be open to any doubt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Freedom to express opinions , and to acquire and disseminate information shall be ensured to everyone .", "CARDINAL . Preventive censorship of means of social communication and licensing of the press shall be prohibited . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions concerning the correction of information in the press and other media are contained in LAW ( Prawo prasowe ) of DATE .", "Section CARDINAL provides , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c At the request of a natural or legal person or other organisational entity , the editor - in - chief of the relevant DATE or magazine is under an obligation to publish , free of charge :", "CARDINAL . a factually based ( rzeczowe i odnosz\u0105ce si\u0119 do fakt\u00f3w ) rectification of untrue or inaccurate statements ,", "CARDINAL . a factually based ( rzeczow\u0105 ) reply to any statement which might infringe an individual \u2019s personal rights \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE the Civil Code contains a non - exhaustive list of the rights known as \u201c personal rights \u201d ( dobra osobiste ) . This provision states :", "\u201c The personal rights of an individual , such as , in particular , health , liberty , reputation ( cze\u015b\u0107 ) , freedom of conscience , name or pseudonym , image , secrecy of correspondence , inviolability of the home , scientific or artistic work , [ as well as ] inventions and improvements shall be protected by the civil law regardless of the protection laid down in other legal provisions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides for ways of redressing infringements of personal rights . Under that provision , a person facing a risk of an infringement of his or her rights may demand that the prospective perpetrator refrain from the wrongful activity , unless it is not unlawful . Where an infringement has taken place , the person affected may , inter alia , request that the wrongdoer make a relevant statement in an appropriate form , or claim just satisfaction from him / her . If an infringement of a personal right causes financial loss , the person concerned may seek damages .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , a person whose personal rights have been infringed may seek compensation . That provision , in its relevant part , reads :", "\u201c The court may grant an adequate sum as pecuniary compensation for non - material damage ( krzywda ) caused to anyone whose personal rights have been infringed .
