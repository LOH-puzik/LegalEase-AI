The applicant , born in DATE , is the mother of CARDINAL children , who are CARDINAL - brothers . Her older son , born in DATE , was taken into permanent public care by the authorities in DATE and placed with the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather . Her younger son , X , was born in DATE . The applicant has been diagnosed as having a hyperkinetic disorder and has had a history with psychiatric treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after receiving notifications from the authorities and a private individual regarding the applicant \u2019s inability to take care of X , the municipal child welfare authorities decided to place him in emergency foster care . On DATE , that decision was upheld by ORG ( fylkesnemnda for barnevern og sosiale saker ) .", "CARDINAL . The emergency placement was followed up by the child welfare authorities with a petition of DATE to ORG for a public care order . The authorities requested that X be placed in a foster home and that the applicant be granted supervised access rights . Concerning the question of where he should be placed , the authorities essentially stated that the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather had previously been approved as foster parents for the applicant \u2019s older son ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , the ability to cooperate was necessary for those wanting to be foster parents and there had been some conflict between the applicant \u2019s mother and the authorities . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather were considered to be relatively old ( having been born in DATE and DATE , respectively ) to serve as foster parents to a small child , and the applicant \u2019s mother had recently been ill . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s mother had not made visiting the applicant \u2019s younger son her priority . In these circumstances , it would not be in GPE \u2019s best interest to be placed with his maternal grandmother and her husband DATE the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather .", "CARDINAL . The applicant objected to the request for an order of public care in respect of her younger son PERSON and maintained that , if such an order be granted , he should be placed with her mother and stepfather . In her view , the child welfare authorities had not properly evaluated that possibility . Her mother \u2019s alleged inability to cooperate had in fact merely been a question of disagreement . The applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather had been aware of the applicant \u2019s difficulties and had helped her . They had also been approved as foster parents to the older son , who had developed well and had positive references from his kindergarten . Their age was not in itself of importance , given that other circumstances were in favour of their acting as his foster parents . To place GPE with them would be more stable and less stigmatising than an external placement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing the parties and CARDINAL witnesses , ORG granted the request for an order of public care . It decided that X should remain in the home in which he had already been placed as an emergency measure .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning regarding the issue of the choice of foster home , ORG firstly noted that it was accepted that the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather had been generally approved as foster parents in connection with the care order in respect of the older son in DATE , but that this issue had to be assessed in view of the current situation , taking into account the best interest of the younger son X. On the specific question as to whether it would be in his best interest to be placed with them , ORG stated the following :", "\u201c ORG sees that there are many positive sides to a placement within the family network , which justifies that such a placement be considered . ORG considers that the grandmother and her husband in many respects are well suited as foster parents for [ X ] . [ According to ] the grandmother , they have been asked whether they [ are willing to ] adopt [ the older son ] . Placing [ X ] with his maternal grandmother and her husband would mean that [ the CARDINAL sons ] would grow up together .", "As ORG has previously mentioned , [ X ] may be inherently vulnerable . This is reinforced by the fact that the ORG finds that it can not be ruled out that the boy may have attention - related difficulties . Reference is made to the emergency foster mother \u2019s description of the boy \u2019s restlessness . In addition to the mother \u2019s diagnosis and her considerable difficulties , it has emerged that her brother has also been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ORG ) and has considerable difficulties . This means that there is a risk of the boy having the same type of difficulties .", "ORG has referred to problems concerning cooperation between the maternal grandmother and agencies such as ORG and health workers . ORG in [ the municipality ] has also reported difficulties regarding cooperation . On the basis of the statements of ORG and the [ younger son \u2019s ] health visitor , the ORG finds that there have been challenges as regards their cooperation with the grandmother . However , the ORG finds no grounds for concluding that these problems have been as serious as they might have initially seemed , and the grandmother \u2019s explanations are to a certain extent plausible . ORG nonetheless finds reason to conclude that there have been some difficulties regarding cooperation .", "The grandmother has seen that [ the applicant ] has not been capable of caring for [ the older son ] , and she has also been concerned about [ the applicant ] \u2019s ability to look after [ X ] . In her statement to ORG , she still seemed to be uncertain about [ the applicant ] \u2019s ability to care for the boy . She nevertheless largely left [ the applicant ] and the child to themselves shortly after the birth while they were staying with her . ORG further remarks that the grandmother had not arranged with ORG in [ the municipality ] that [ the applicant ] and [ X ] were to move in with her and [ the applicant \u2019s older son ] . [ The applicant ] moved out of her mother \u2019s house , together with [ X ] after a short period , even though the grandmother realises that [ the applicant ] faces challenges as regards running a home . ORG has noted that the grandmother has not attended the contact sessions and thus not seen [ X ] since he was placed in care .", "The grandmother and her husband are relatively old to be foster parents to such young children . [ The applicant ] \u2019s mother was born in DATE and her husband in DATE . ORG considers it likely that [ X ] \u2019s placement in care will be long - term . Although age alone is not decisive in relation to the choice of foster home , it is a factor in the assessment . The maternal grandmother and her husband already have a foster child who is DATE , and it will require a lot of energy on their part to have another foster child ... who is also younger than the one they [ already ] have . Taking care of [ X ] could also affect the situation of [ the older son ] , who they already have care of and must look after .", "ORG has found that its doubts about placing [ X ] with his grandmother and her husband are so serious that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages . The reason is the uncertainty relating to the boy \u2019s vulnerability and the strain that another foster child would entail , regardless of whether or not this child has special needs , the grandmother \u2019s and her husband \u2019s age and certain difficulties regarding cooperation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the above , the ORG arrived at the conclusion that X should not be placed with his grandmother and her husband . On DATE X was transferred from the emergency home to a foster home .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to the local ORG ( tingrett ) , which held an oral hearing from CARDINAL until DATE . In accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the court \u2019s bench comprised CARDINAL professional judge , CARDINAL psychologist and CARDINAL lay person . It heard CARDINAL witnesses in addition to the parties . The applicant was present , was represented by counsel , and gave testimony .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG upheld ORG decision in full .", "CARDINAL . With respect to the applicant \u2019s caring skills and PERSON \u2019s care needs , ORG reiterated the findings of ORG and the court - appointed expert . It concluded that there were beyond doubt serious deficiencies in the applicant \u2019s DATE care of and personal contact with X , and that it was necessary to place him in public care .", "CARDINAL . Turning next to the question of whether he could be placed with the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather , ORG observed that they had been approved as foster parents when the applicant \u2019s older son had been placed with them in DATE . It further noted that there were advantages to a child moving to a foster home comprising family members . X would in that case be placed within the family network . It had moreover been documented that the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather might well be suitable foster parents for him . Furthermore , it would be an advantage that the CARDINAL sons would be allowed to grow up together .", "CARDINAL . ORG nonetheless found that , in this case , there were no grounds for deciding that the applicant \u2019s younger son should be placed in foster care with his maternal grandmother and her husband . In addition to referring to the ORG \u2019s assessment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court quoted excerpts from the court - appointed expert , PERSON , a specialist in psychology .", "CARDINAL . The expert did not recommend the placement of X with the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather . In the report she stated , inter alia :", "\u201c Several factors have emerged that may have a bearing on the assessment of whether [ X ] \u2019s grandparents can be his foster parents :", "Firstly , the grandparents\u2019 age has been taken into account in the assessment . The undersigned does not see this as a decisive factor .", "Furthermore , it has been emphasised that [ X ] \u2019s step - grandfather has himself mentioned that he is getting older , and that this may be perceived as an expression of doubt on his part . This has not had a decisive bearing on the undersigned \u2019s assessment , either . The child \u2019s step - grandfather comes across as an honest , responsible and reflective man who would be an excellent foster father for [ X ] , even though he expresses some doubts himself .", "In addition , it has also been suggested that ORG has had difficulties in cooperating with the foster mother in respect of [ the applicant \u2019s older son ] . To the undersigned , these so - called \u2018 cooperation difficulties\u2019 seem to be nothing more than disagreements / challenges that the parties are capable of handling and working out . That is how the challenges are described by both the representative of ORG in [ the municipality ] and the grandmother herself . It must also be added that [ the applicant ] \u2019s mother and stepfather cooperated with the undersigned in an impeccable manner during the investigation . They have had many difficult challenges over DATE , and it would almost be strange if there had been no \u2018 friction\u2019 during all this time . This has therefore not had any bearing on the undersigned \u2019s assessment of the question of [ X ] \u2019s foster home placement .", "What has been important to the undersigned \u2019s assessment of this question , however , is , first of all , that [ the applicant ] has very different emotional ties to her CARDINAL sons ... , in the sense that she seems to have renounced her role as mother of the [ older son ] , while she must still be expected to make an effort to have as much contact as possible with [ X ] . This will necessarily be a problem for both boys if they are to live in the same foster home .", "Furthermore , there is good reason to believe that , if [ X ] is placed in foster care with [ the applicant ] \u2019s parents , this situation will ... represent an opportunity for the contact between mother and child to constantly increase in scope , and thus be a hindrance to [ X ] in his development of a good attachment to his foster home . For the undersigned , this concern is based , not least , on the fact that [ X ] \u2019s grandmother has clearly expressed to the undersigned that she primarily wants to be a mother to [ the applicant ] .", "However , the argument in favour of letting [ X ] \u2019s grandmother and step - grandfather be his foster parents is of course the fact that [ he ] will then get to grow up together with his ( CARDINAL ) brother . The undersigned is nonetheless of the view that this can not carry more weight than the concerns mentioned above .", "This means that placing [ X ] in foster care with his grandparents is not recommended . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Expert PERSON had upheld these assessments in her report during the main hearing , but also stated that there were \u201c dilemmas \u201d if the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather were to be chosen as foster parents . ORG shared the expert \u2019s concerns . Moreover , it pointed out that the CARDINAL children had different needs and challenges . Although the older brother , according to the information received , was happy in his foster home with the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather , PERSON , despite his young age , had experienced QUANTITY broken relationships \u2013 firstly with his biological mother and then with his emergency foster mother . He had now formed an attachment with his new foster mother after he had moved into his latest foster home in DATE . There would be a risk of \u201c contact injury \u201d ( kontaktskade ) \u2013 that is to say a serious impairment to his ability to form attachments \u2013 if he were to experience another broken relationship . From the foster mother \u2019s testimony it was clear that he was developing well in the foster home and that he was happy and thriving . ORG moreover emphasised the challenges associated with having CARDINAL small boys of pre - school age living with people of the age of the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather . In addition , there was the issue of the applicant \u2019s very different respective emotional relationships with the QUANTITY boys , which also entailed special challenges , particularly if X were to be placed in foster care in the same home as that of his older brother . Overall , ORG agreed with ORG and the court - appointed expert that the applicant \u2019s mother and stepfather should not be the foster parents of the applicant \u2019s younger son .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against ORG judgment in so far as it concerned the choice of foster home . ORG ( lagmannsrett ) refused leave to appeal on DATE , and on DATE ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts ankeutvalg ) rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
