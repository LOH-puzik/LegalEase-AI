She had been a teacher and he ran the NORP coffee house in ORG , owned by his brother . He had had no personal enemies or debts . Nor had he been involved in any vendetta .", "CARDINAL . Mr \u015een became politically active DATE , helping to create ORG and ORG in DATE . The DEP withdrew from the DATE local elections due to the intimidation of its members ( threats , detention and murders ) .", "CARDINAL . Her husband had been a leading member of DEP and , when he stood as a candidate for the post of the Mayor of GPE in DATE , he was threatened by the Gendarmes Station Commander of that constituency ( who may have been called Sergeant - Major PERSON ) , and regularly picked up by the police for questioning . He was so intimidated that he resorted to carrying a licensed gun and rarely went out alone . He was taken to the police station many times and harassed . He sold the gun eventually as he was detained several times at TIME with a view to ascertaining whether the gun had been involved in incidents . However , this was just part of the harassment to which he was subjected .", "CARDINAL . DATE before he was abducted , PERSON told his wife that he was being followed by hit - men , men who were not his previous surveillance officers . He had been alerted to this possibility by an acquaintance who had been detained and interrogated about PERSON , and about whom the interrogators had said that Mr \u015een would be \u201c done away with \u201d . Some QUANTITY people had been killed in the recent past by unknown perpetrators because of their DEP affiliation and/or membership of ORG . These hit men were not recognised by PERSON , who had known most of the local policemen . They were of medium height and able - bodied , carrying radios and guns . PERSON had understood her husband to mean that they were contra - guerrillas operating under ORG authority , as confirmed in the later GPE report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was informed of her husband \u2019s abduction TIME after its occurrence by PERSON , CARDINAL of the caf\u00e9 \u2019s employees . PERSON told her that CARDINAL strangers had been in the caf\u00e9 for tea . They seemed tense , made a telephone call and left . Then a ORG SLX car ( registration number CARDINAL ORG ) stopped in front of the caf\u00e9 , blocking the door . Of the CARDINAL unknown people in the vehicle , CARDINAL stayed in the driver \u2019s seat with the engine running , another , carrying a gun and a radio , waited at the door . That man was well dressed and middle - aged . CARDINAL others , casually dressed , strong looking and with apparent special training , walked towards PERSON , who looked rather like PERSON , and then moved on to Mr \u015een , who identified himself . The CARDINAL flashed identity cards at the people in the caf\u00e9 . The armed man at the door spoke into his radio , \u201c OK , Sir , we \u2019ve got him \u201d , and then said to PERSON , \u201c You \u2019re coming with us to police headquarters . We have business with you . \u201d Mr \u015een tried to ask questions but was dragged towards the door by the CARDINAL men , holding him under his armpits . He was put in the back of the car , which drove off immediately . Despite the shock and panic of the people in the caf\u00e9 , they managed to note down the registration number of the car .", "CARDINAL . These matters were discussed over and over again in DATE with PERSON , ORG , ORG and PERSON because PERSON wanted to learn as much as possible about the details of the incident . It was during such discussions with others that she learnt that another car , with CARDINAL other plain - clothed people in it , drove off behind the first . She had not talked to Abit PERSON , who had also witnessed the events , as she did not know him .", "CARDINAL . The people in the caf\u00e9 had said that the abductors had been policemen because of the gun , the radio , the identity cards they had shown everyone and what they had said . However , the caf\u00e9 witnesses were taken from their homes in DATE , at TIME , for interrogation , and statements were demanded of them . This had intimidated them .", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately after PERSON call , PERSON called ORG and ORG . They said that they had not taken him into custody and had no information about him . They confirmed that they would investigate . She tried contacting the Mayor , a Member of ORG , a delegation from GPE and DEP members , for them to make inquiries about her husband \u2019s fate .", "CARDINAL . PERSON inquiries with the PERSON , PERSON and ORG proved fruitless . Travelling had been difficult at the time because of roadblocks and identity checks , through which only the security forces could pass easily . She nevertheless went to ORG after she had been told by a lawyer called PERSON that the car number plate was a forged one used by ORG . ORG there was not helpful . He referred to a DEP Member of ORG who had been killed and added , \u201c What can I tell you ? What can I do ? \u201d She was advised to go home and wait .", "CARDINAL . She then met a DEP member called ORG who told her that the Gaziantep branch of the DEP had telephoned to say that she should return home immediately . On her arrival , she was told that the body of her husband was in the morgue at the ORG hospital . The Gaziantep DEP and the newspaper \u201c PERSON \u201d had been telephoned by a well - spoken NORP lady who had provided this information . Mr \u015een \u2019s relatives were called and PERSON met her sister - in - law and father - in - law at the hospital , where a crowd had gathered , cordoned off by the police .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was not informed of the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the body . Subsequently , ORG , Mr ORG , informed her that the body had been found by the gendarmerie in the rural area of GPE , in GPE . The body was unidentifiable , as it had no personal belongings or identity card on it , until the inner pocket of the suit , which the corpse was wearing , was ripped open to disclose PERSON name , written by his tailor on the lining . However , PERSON said that the suit had not been tailor - made , but had been a ready - to - wear purchase from a shop . She did not recall the gendarmes mentioning this matter to her . She therefore insisted on further information as to how her husband \u2019s body had been identified . She was told that her husband \u2019s belongings were to be kept for the investigation . A ring and watch were returned to her father - in - law in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The sight of her husband \u2019s body was horrible : the right side of his head had been smashed ; his right eye was not in place ; his right hand fingers and arm appeared broken , and there was a hole through his throat with no blood around it . She saw CARDINAL bullet wound . She insisted on having a copy of the autopsy report , which she was not given until long after the burial , and which did not correspond to her observations ( such as its description of CARDINAL other bullet wounds to the face ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON told ORG that her husband had been tortured , and insisted that a murder investigation be conducted . However , ORG would not listen to her and no statement or information was sought from her . As she persisted in visiting the ORG regularly , a statement was taken from DATE on DATE . However , no progress whatsoever was made in the investigation , even DATE .", "CARDINAL . After her husband had been killed , her house was put under constant surveillance , all visitors being recorded , and many asked by the policemen on duty why they were visiting such terrorists . Her DATE daughter had been stopped as she was leaving school and asked by plain - clothed policemen whether her mother used her as a courier and what kind of papers she was carrying . She was so scared by this and the idea that she might be killed like her father , that she stopped attending school .", "CARDINAL . PERSON received threatening telephone calls at that time . The caller said that he was a contra - guerrilla and that she would be killed too . She changed the locks on the doors to her home as her husband had had his house keys on him when he had been abducted . She and her daughter were away on CARDINAL DATE when special policemen unsuccessfully tried to enter the house , according to the employees of the bakery situated on the ground floor of her building . The police then went to the house of PERSON friends where her daughter was staying and asked why they had taken in a terrorist \u2019s daughter . The father of that family was placed in custody for DATE and interrogated about his relationship with the \u015een family .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was warned not to go home as there was a purple civilian car waiting at the corner of the street and that she would be taken away . Since then she has not returned home even to recuperate her belongings or souvenirs of her husband . Out of the same concerns , she was living separately from her daughter .", "CARDINAL . She was taken into custody on DATE in ORG and interrogated for DATE about her alleged membership of the ORG ( ORG ) ( see her other application to ORG GPE , no . PERSON , judgment of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr \u015een was an elderly gentleman , born in DATE . He was the father of the deceased PERSON . His son had not told him of his fears for his life prior to his abduction , nor of the difficulties he had faced as a politician . He had had no enemies whatsoever . Everyone liked him .", "CARDINAL . Mr \u015een was informed TIME after the event that his son had been seized by policemen the TIME before . He intuitively knew that he was dead . He went to ORG . His daughter - in - law had gone to ORG in search of her husband . In ORG he heard from Gaziantep that his son had been killed .", "CARDINAL . Mr \u015een went to ORG to identify the body . He did not meet PERSON there . He could not bear to look at his son \u2019s tortured corpse , but noticed that an eye was missing , apparently caused by a bullet wound , and that he had a fractured finger . His son \u2019s clothing was bloodstained . Apparently he had been killed by the police , perhaps because of his candidacy for Mayor .", "CARDINAL . The police ordered him to remove the body , but he did not do so until DATE . A great crowd gathered . They took the body back to the village and buried it . There were police and gendarmes everywhere on alert , who behaved disrespectfully . PERSON was at the funeral .", "CARDINAL . DATE he was called to appear before the Prosecutor and Judge to receive his son \u2019s personal possessions . He took the watch and ring but not the clothes which were soaked in blood . The only inquiry made later was by FAC , Sergeant - Major PERSON , about ORG stay with him for DATE , which dates the gendarmes deliberately recorded wrongly .", "CARDINAL . Mr \u015een was born in DATE . He was no relation to the deceased PERSON and did not know him .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the witness was stopped at a police roadblock at the exit from ORG , where everyone \u2019s identity was checked . One could not leave ORG without going through this checkpoint . He was also given a body search and asked why he was carrying a copy of the newspaper \u201c FAC \u201d . He alleged that , because of his surname and the possession of the newspaper , he was taken into a field by CARDINAL officers and tortured with beatings for TIME . In view of this experience , he could understand how PERSON had died .", "CARDINAL . Mr Aktaran was born in DATE and was ORG at ORG DATE after the events , from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The investigation into the death of PERSON was opened by ORG , PERSON . The file was subsequently transferred to him . It contained witness statements taken by the police , PERSON statement to the Prosecutor and the autopsy report , but provided no serious leads as to the perpetrator of the crime . There was no ballistic expertise of the bullet found in Mr \u015een \u2019s body or of the empty cartridge found near his corpse . No evidence had been taken from police witnesses because none had been identified as being implicated in the death . The suggestion that Mr \u015een had been involved in vendettas was not taken up as it had no serious basis .", "CARDINAL . On receiving the file , the witness found lacking an inquiry into the registration number of the car in which Mr \u015een had been abducted \u2013 a honey - coloured vehicle with a registration containing the letters ORG , ORG or ORG . This inquiry revealed that either the car had had false number plates or that the witnesses had been mistaken about the registration number . He did not seek other information following the evidence of the eyewitness PERSON as to a green car with the number CARDINAL PVC CARDINAL PVD CARDINAL . He was unaware of any significant discrepancies in the overall evidence on this or other points .", "CARDINAL . Mr Aktaran considered that he and his colleague had conducted a satisfactory investigation in the circumstances . Prosecutors do not need to take further evidence from people whose statements have already been taken by the police . At the outset he had been open - minded about the applicant \u2019s allegation that the security forces might have been involved in the incident . However , there had been nothing in the various statements taken to suggest that an inquiry into any particular officers was required . He placed a permanent search warrant on the file , so that the investigation would remain open for DATE should new evidence appear .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was born in DATE and at the material time was working as a reporter for the LOC office of the \u201c PERSON \u201d newspaper . He had been acquainted with PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In a general operation against the \u201c PERSON \u201d newspaper on DATE , the witness was taken into custody and held for DATE . On DATE of his interrogation , the name of PERSON was mentioned with a threat \u201c to finish him off \u201d or \u201c do him in \u201d along with CARDINAL other named persons . Mr \u015een \u2019s name was cursed . The witness thought that the remarks were intended to be passed on to Mr \u015een . He later informed Mr \u015een of this threat and advised him to take care .", "CARDINAL . The next time he saw PERSON was at the morgue . His newspaper had been telephoned with the news by a well - spoken NORP lady . He had taken the call himself . When he saw the corpse , of which he took photographs , he remarked the strange position of the wrists , which looked fractured . He did not see the injured side of the face which was turned parallel to the table . No autopsy had been performed on the body at that stage .", "CARDINAL . On returning home from the morgue , he received an anonymous telephone call also threatening him with death .", "CARDINAL . Mr Kelleci accompanied PERSON and a delegation to the Governor \u2019s office on DATE . Afterwards , the witness saw ORG , Chief of Police H\u00fcseyin \u00c7apk\u0131n and the Deputy Governor . They stated that PERSON death was possibly linked to gambling debts and had not been perpetrated by the ORG . He told them of the death threat he had personally received but it was not taken seriously . They persisted with the gambling debt theory and assured him that PERSON murderer would be found .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was born in DATE and was a tailor by profession in Gaziantep , as well as the Chairman and NORP of ORG at the material time . He knew PERSON from their common political activities . In DATE there had been many killings by unknown perpetrators which , together with the bombing of the ORG \u2019s headquarters in GPE , led to their withdrawal from the imminent elections .", "CARDINAL . Mr \u015een came to his shop DATE before his abduction and offered to repair his car . When driving it away , the witness noticed that Mr \u015een was being followed by a white police car , a ORG . This had happened to him too . The occupants were obviously plain - clothed policemen , whom he could identify if he saw them again . All ORG members were under great pressure at that time . Even after the ORG \u2019s withdrawal from the elections , it continued : he was taken into custody at TIME on DATE , DATE after Mr \u015een \u2019s abduction , and challenged about disseminating propaganda for ORG instead .", "CARDINAL . On the drive into custody , he was told that PERSON had \u201c changed worlds \u201d , and that he would be \u201c sent to the place where he is \u201d . He had understood the remarks to mean that PERSON was dead and that he would be killed too . ( He had not heard of the recovery of PERSON corpse at that stage , so he was not too sure . ) Panicking , the witness claimed to have made certain telephone calls before he had been taken from his house , including a call to the normal police . He was then punched and , before the car left town , it turned round and deposited him at the police anti - terrorism department , QUANTITY from his house .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was held in police custody for DATE . The custody records indicating a shorter period were incorrect . He was interrogated under torture . Mr \u015een was not mentioned but PERSON was told that his ORG was \u201c finished in ORG \u201d . He was subsequently remanded in custody for DATE , accused of being , inter alia , a member of , and aiding and abetting , the ORG . On release , these charges were dropped and a remaining charge of possessing a gun without a licence was still pending .", "CARDINAL . Dr Erkol was born in DATE . She had worked as an expert in forensic medicine and as a lecturer at ORG since DATE .", "CARDINAL . Dr Erkol performed the autopsy on PERSON , whose identity was unknown at that time , as was that of his killer . Given the frequent blood feuds in the area , she suspected that the murder was another of that kind . She was struck by the fact that the victim had been blindfolded . PERSON , an unspecialised physician , assisted her at the autopsy . ORG , PERSON , whom the witness described as a meticulous and responsible professional , attended the procedure .", "CARDINAL . The body , fully clothed , was inspected on site and photographed by PERSON and the Prosecutor . It was then taken to the hospital for examination . The bloodstains on the victim \u2019s jacket indicated that he had been shot whilst clothed and still alive . The clothes were removed at the morgue . PERSON had been told prior to the autopsy , and then saw herself , that the name of PERSON had been written in biro on the inside pocket of the jacket , but that was insufficient evidence of identity . She did not follow the local news , so had not heard about Mr \u015een \u2019s abduction . It was not her responsibility to identify the corpse .", "CARDINAL . The body was X - rayed to verify the placement of any bullets still lodged in it . The X - rays were not kept . There were CARDINAL bullet wounds to the head , CARDINAL bullet having remained lodged in the chest . They had caused extensive fracturing , brain damage and haemorrhaging , resulting in death , TIME before the autopsy . It would appear that Mr \u015een had been killed TIME after his last meal . It was not possible to be more precise about the time of death given the limited facilities available in Gaziantep . The bullet which had entered and exited the skull had torn the victim \u2019s eye out . Neither the arms nor fingers had been fractured , but their distorted position would have been due to the onset of rigor mortis .", "DATE . The remaining bullet would have been kept . It was probably of a wide calibre \u2013 CARDINAL mm \u2013 fired from a short - barrelled gun , within a QUANTITY range of the body . A ballistic analysis could prove valuable only if linked to a suspect weapon and a comparative study .", "CARDINAL . The body showed no trace of ill - treatment . In the absence of any obvious external signs or allegations of torture , no examination of the internal organs was conducted . However , the body had begun to decompose , presenting signs of post - mortem discolouring , distortion through rigor mortis , and , with the bullet injuries and autopsy incisions , was a very ugly sight . An untrained person might understandably misconstrue these elements as evidence of ill - treatment . Moreover , the body was not washed down after the autopsy , so it may have looked even bloodier . Washing was for the hoca , a religious leader on duty at the morgue , or the family to perform . The hole in the throat seen by PERSON would have been an autopsy incision .", "CARDINAL . People can not enter the morgue without the ORG \u2019s authorisation , other than perhaps a very close relative who might be allowed to view the body by the hoca . She could not tell from the poor photocopy of the photograph taken by the journalist , PERSON , purportedly of PERSON corpse in the morgue , whether that photograph had been taken before or after the autopsy . However , judging by the position of CARDINAL of the hands in the photograph , it was probable it had been taken before the autopsy had been conducted .", "CARDINAL . It transpired that the photographs provided by the Government at this point in the hearing , and in respect of which the witness noted several contradictions with the autopsy findings , were not of Mr \u015een \u2019s corpse .", "CARDINAL . Mr G\u00fcd\u00fcl was born in DATE and was the official chauffeur for the law courts . He also accompanied the Prosecutor at autopsies .", "CARDINAL . In the present case he had driven the Prosecutor to where the body had been found . It was on the road construction site but accessible by car , albeit very dusty because of the nearby sand quarries and frequent heavy lorry traffic . There were gendarmes at the scene , as well as a finger print expert , a clerk and a doctor . The Prosecutor made a record which included the position of the body . This procedure took TIME . The body was lying on its back , clothed . There was a yellow , car - polishing cloth over its eyes . There was blood on the ground which had come from the back of the head . The body was transported by ambulance to ORG morgue as an on - site autopsy was not possible . There had been no discussion as to its identity .", "CARDINAL . He was sure that no one saw the corpse at the morgue other than the officials concerned . He described the same X - ray , medical procedures and findings as PERSON , having been present throughout . He did not recall the name of PERSON being inscribed inside his jacket . He had had no idea who the individual was . That was a police matter . For him it was just an ordinary incident . He did not recall being present when PERSON father arrived at the morgue to identify the corpse , although his signature had been on the relevant document . The circumstances had been very distressing at the time .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was born in DATE and was a farmer by profession . He had been working on the road construction site , obtaining materials from the quarry using explosives . He had had a fright after CARDINAL particular detonation when he spotted a corpse QUANTITY away from him , which , without approaching it , he reported to FAC . He signed a statement to that effect at the station . The place where the body was found was accessible by car but was frequented mostly by lorries . He had been working with PERSON at the time .", "DATE . Mr GPE was born in DATE and was a ORG - commissioned Officer . At the material time he was Station Commander at the \u015eehitarif Sub - station which was attached to LOC in Gaziantep . His superior was ORG , ORG .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE had been at his station when PERSON and PERSON reported the presence of a corpse on the GPE highway construction site . He took statements from them and then went with a unit of his men to the location . There they found the clothed body of a man , DATE , lying on his back , with firearm wounds to his head and face . He checked the throat artery , confirming death , cordoned off the area and notified his superiors . Although there appeared to be CARDINAL bullet wounds , CARDINAL cartridge was found , despite a thorough search of the immediate vicinity . He had no idea of the time of death or how long the body had been there . The person in charge of the criminal laboratory at ORG took photographs . These would still be in the gendarmes\u2019 files if they had not been sent to ORG .", "CARDINAL . DATE he typed up a report from his notes about the corpse , which had not been identified as no identity papers had been found , although Mr \u015een \u2019s name had been written on the jacket . The Prosecutor must have been shown that . He had not been aware of PERSON missing person report DATE . His station had not been informed of that . The abduction had taken place in ORG and his station would not have been informed unless directly asked to make inquiries . He presumed that his superiors had conducted the necessary inquiries after he had told them about the name in the jacket .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE sent the empty cartridge case , together with the person \u2019s ring and watch and the documents he had prepared , to ORG DATE . The blindfold was also transmitted . It had the name and number of a petrol station on it , about which inquiries were made by his superior officer . No analysis was carried out of the soil near the corpse for the fibres of other clothes or the like . He could not recall whether casts were made of the footprints near the body .", "CARDINAL . The body \u2019s location had been accessible by car . The area consisted of compacted earth on which there were footprints . Only the site workers frequented the area and the body had been well hidden from view . There were no vehicle tracks within CARDINAL perimeter of the corpse .", "CARDINAL . He did not recall whether there had been checkpoints in place on DATE the body was found . Subsequently , he interviewed local villagers and site workers in an unsuccessful effort to gather information about the incident .

Later however he did make unofficial background inquiries into PERSON allegation of official involvement , particularly concerning police employees , but he found no evidence to support her claims . He thus rejected this theory . He made no contact himself with PERSON , the caf\u00e9 employees or any ORG members . Statements were taken by his subordinates about the murder . The police also took statements , possibly because of the abduction offence which had occurred within their jurisdiction . No records were drawn up of inquiries which proved fruitless .
