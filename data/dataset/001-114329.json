On DATE , the applicant \u2019s legal advisers argued a plea in bar of trial on the grounds of TIME lodged . Both TIME were refused by Lord PERSON sitting in ORG . However , he granted leave to appeal and the applicant duly lodged a note of appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his written opinion on the disposal of the minutes , Lord PERSON discussed the extent of the media publicity in the applicant \u2019s case . He noted that a very considerable degree of attention had been devoted in the media to the discovery of the body parts , particularly by newspapers in widespread circulation in GPE . The applicant had been identified as a prime suspect well before a warrant had been sought for his arrest . His sexual character had been described in prejudicial terms . Analogous previous convictions had been disclosed , as was the fact that the applicant had been cleared on appeal of a previous murder on what was described as a technicality . Photographs of the applicant , including a photograph in which he appeared in handcuffs , were published . As to the nature and extent of the coverage , Lord PERSON noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... It can not be in doubt that the coverage of the story in certain newspapers in the period immediately after the disappearance of PERSON was extremely prejudicial to , and damning of , the [ applicant ] . In respect of some of the stories , it could hardly have been more so . However , the character and extent of this coverage did appear to diminish significantly after the initial period of DATE , although it by no means disappeared . This may have had something to do with the provisions of ORG DATE , which only comes into effect once criminal proceedings have started . An order made under that Act was pronounced in respect of the present indictment on DATE , restricting the reporting of details of the case , and that order appears to have been observed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge turned to consider the case - law of this ORG and of the domestic courts . He accepted that adverse media or press publicity generally carried the serious risk of compromising or prejudicing the fairness of the hearing . In circumstances where the nature and extent of pre - trial publicity were such that it would be impossible for the trial judge to secure a fair hearing by means of appropriate directions to the jury , the court would require the proceedings against the accused to be discharged . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the present case I have no doubt that the test which the [ applicant ] has to satisfy has not been met . While there must be a potential risk that a jury will have been prejudiced against the [ applicant ] as a consequence of the publicity at the time it was published , and to a certain extent thereafter , I am satisfied that this risk is of a sort that is capable of being managed by the presiding judge during any trial . It is true that there has been an extensive degree of sensational coverage of this case . That is perhaps to be expected in view of the nature of the offence . It may be suggested that it is entirely unsatisfactory that newspapers can state openly that the [ applicant ] is guilty of the offence of murder , that he has previous convictions for analogous offences and that in effect he can be linked to serial killers and similar unsolved offences . However , this sort of reporting is not illegal and can not be until criminal proceedings start against any accused . While therefore the impact of the prejudice from the media coverage may well have been severe during DATE , I am satisfied that it has diminished considerably with the passage of time . It is now DATE since the discovery of the body of PERSON . Although the media coverage was extensive and sensational , it was CARDINAL story in many covered by the same kind of approach in the newspapers concerned . Further , while the details of the disappearance and death of PERSON and the discovery of his remains will no doubt remain in the minds of many , I was not persuaded by the [ applicant \u2019s ] submissions that the link between the murder and the [ applicant ] has achieved the same endurance in the public consciousness . Further , the circumstances and character of a jury trial is such that jurors are compelled to examine the evidence presented to them exclusively and are not primarily influenced by recollections of what may have been reported in a sensational and essentially ephemeral manner some considerable time before . In the concentrated atmosphere of a court room , when the jury are required to focus on the evidence presented to them , the clear directions by the trial judge are , in almost every case , likely to be sufficient to secure a fair and unbiased hearing . The development of the jury system , the strict rules which apply to the presentation of evidence ... and the continuing evolution of judges\u2019 directions to the jury are all designed to secure a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal . If this were not so , it would be necessary to abandon the principle of trial by jury . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge was satisfied that allegations by the applicant that the police had put improper and prejudicial information in the media were without concrete support .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the rule of specialty in the context of extradition precluded the inclusion in the indictment of averments concerning events after the victim \u2019s death , given that the NORP authorities had refused to extradite him on the charge of perverting the course of justice , Lord PERSON found against the applicant . He accepted that the indictment could not include any offence in respect of which extradition had not been granted , and that in the present case it therefore had to be restricted to abduction and murder . He considered the statement accompanying the extradition request , to the effect that death had been brought about by dismemberment or by cause unknown , to have been both reasonable and justified . He further observed that the applicant could face no separate penalty on a charge of perverting the course of justice under the indictment . Even without mention of dismemberment in the indictment , the murder charge would always be aggravated by the method of disposing of the body . He concluded that it was therefore appropriate to include the averments as to dismemberment and disposal .", "CARDINAL . ORG of the High Court of Justiciary ( \u201c the Appeal Court \u201d ) heard the appeal on DATE . On DATE it refused the appeal and issued a written opinion . On the question of the pre - trial publicity , it observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ W]e should in the first place say that in our view there is no doubt that the publicity which followed the disappearance of PERSON was extensive and highly prejudicial to the appellant ... It is not , in our view , necessary to go into the publications in particular detail or to recite the various pejorative epithets that were used in relation to the appellant . It is sufficient to note that the information published included statements that the appellant had previously been convicted of murder , that his conviction had been quashed \u2018 on a technicality\u2019 and that he had also been convicted of assault . Moreover , the publications drew attention to the fact that there was some similarity in respect of the use of a razor or similar instrument between the circumstances of the appellant \u2019s previous convictions and the supposed circumstances of the present case . This is just the kind of information which has led to the discharge or refusal of a prosecution , in the few cases in which that extreme course has been resorted to by the court . It is , of course , true that there are legal systems in which the court , and the jury , are permitted to know details of a person \u2019s previous criminal record , but our practice has always set its face very strongly against any such disclosure . It is well known that even accidental disclosure of some minor previous conviction in the course of a trial may well lead to abandonment of the proceedings or at least of the particular indictment . In these circumstances , we have no doubt that publication of such information was very liable to prejudice the accused . Indeed , we would question whether any reporter or editor could have been unaware of the importance which the law of GPE gives to non - disclosure of a previous criminal record . In these circumstances , if the trial had required to proceed within the normal period after the issue of a petition warrant , that is assuming a relatively quick arrest and a trial within DATE , we would have grave doubts as to whether the prosecution could have proceeded with such a timescale . In the light of the pre - trial publicity , the ORG might have had to consider whether to release the appellant from custody and endeavour to bring the case to trial before the expiry of DATE time limit .", "CARDINAL . If the prejudicial nature of the information is the crucial matter to be put on CARDINAL side ... , the matters to be placed on the other side can be succinctly referred to as the effects of the lapse of time and the process of trial . As has , again , been set out in previous authority , the legal systems which rely on adversarial proceedings and trial by jury are prepared to extend a high degree of trust , which is believed to be well merited , to the readiness of jury men and women to apply the law as it is stated to them and consider the case strictly on the evidence led at a trial . If this were not so , it is doubtful whether the continuance of the practice of jury trial could be justified . Further , as the cases show , it has been generally accepted , not only in GPE , that the effect of prejudicial press publicity tends to diminish with time . While the general public recollection may continue to hold some idea that a particular widely reported event has occurred and that there were some remarkable or sensational circumstances surrounding it , recollection of the details of such publicity is a very different matter . In the present case , the result of the delays which have occurred is that the vast bulk of the publicity is now DATE in the past . It is true that there were reports of the appellant \u2019s return to GPE which might have reminded a reader of the previous narratives , but such reports did not go into any detail in relation to what had previously been reported . They certainly did not repeat the materially prejudicial statements to which we have referred . Apart from the mere lapse of time , account is always taken of the trial process itself which by setting the evidence before the jury in detail and providing them with the expert analyses of counsel and the directions of the judge , is calculated to direct their attention to the evidence and away from any extraneous material . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the specialty argument and the inclusion in the indictment of an averment of dismemberment , ORG found that the argument before it had added nothing to the considerations which were before the trial judge , whose conclusions ORG upheld .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant pleaded not guilty to the charge . His counsel subsequently made a request for an order under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Contempt of Court Act DATE restricting the reporting of the trial . The request was refused by Lord PERSON for reasons set out in his written opinion dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . The judge noted that it had been held in the case of PERSON v. ORG DATE ORG CARDINAL that the power under section CARDINAL ) of the Contempt of Court Act DATE to make an order postponing publication of a fair and accurate report of the trial proceedings was confined to such a publication ; it was not intended for use to prevent unfair or inaccurate reporting , which would be capable of being dealt with as a contempt under section CARDINAL of the Contempt of Court Act DATE . The judge therefore held :", "\u201c ... [ I]n my judgment the question for me is whether \u2018 a fair and accurate report CARDINAL the present trial \u2018 held in public , published contemporaneously and in good ORG would create \u2018 a substantial risk of prejudice in the administration of justice GPE these \u2018 ORG . I have come unhesitatingly to the conclusion that it would not . Senior counsel for the accused himself said that he had \u2018 no problem\u2019 with fair and accurate reporting ; his concern lay elsewhere . That acceptance that fair and accurate reporting did not create a problem is plainly fatal to the motion which he made , since , as the Lord Justice General put it in PERSON , section PERSON ) is intended to deal with fair and accurate reports of proceedings which should nonetheless be postponed , not with material outwith the scope of such reports ...", "Quite apart from the position taken up by senior counsel for the accused , in relation to the effect of fair and accurate reporting of the trial , I can see no basis at all in this case for concluding that fair and accurate reports of the trial , which will , after all , be held in public , could create a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in these proceedings . Indeed no case was cited to me in which a ORG has held that such reporting could create such a risk in the proceedings themselves , as opposed to other proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the jury were called and sworn and the applicant \u2019s trial commenced before Lord PERSON . He was represented by senior counsel .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s counsel subsequently invited the court to summon publishers of specific allegedly prejudicial material which had been reported and published on the Internet as news in DATE but remained available on the Internet in the archives of the publications in which it had originally appeared .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Lord PERSON refused the applicant \u2019s motion , for reasons set out in his second written opinion . In his opinion , the judge referred to the factors identified by Lord Justice PERSON LJ in ORG v. ORG , CARDINAL of which was the likelihood of the publicity coming to the attention of an actual or potential juror . Lord PERSON emphasised that in the present case , as he had been informed by the prosecution and as was not disputed by the defence , the action of entering the applicant \u2019s name into a standard search engine on the Internet would not lead the searcher to the impugned materials . Instead the searcher would have to go to the website of a particular newspaper or broadcaster , and then search its archived material . The judge continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Among the other factors referred to by PERSON LJ is the focusing effect of listening over a prolonged period to evidence in a case . It appears to me that in the circumstances of the present case this is a factor of some importance . Furthermore , he considered that an important consideration was the likely effect of the judge \u2019s directions to a jury . Likewise , I consider that this is a matter of great importance . At the commencement of the present proceedings I took pains to direct the jury that their ultimate decision would require to be based upon the evidence which they heard in the ORG proceedings , and not upon any extraneous matter which might come to their attention . In due course , that direction will be repeated when the time comes for me to charge the jury . I have no reason to suppose that the jury in the present case will not follow that direction . The system of trial by jury depends upon confidence being placed in juries to follow directions which they are given . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He was satisfied that the material in question had not been shown to be material which would create \u201c a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Lord PERSON rejected the applicant \u2019s objection to the admissibility of a statement by a deceased witness , GPE ( anonymised for the purposes of this present judgment only ) , regarding the applicant \u2019s sexual conduct , for reasons set out in his third written opinion . He considered that its admission would not violate LAW ( d ) of the LAW , noting that , unlike the position in other jurisdictions , the requirement of NORP law for the proof of a criminal charge by corroborated evidence was \u201c a protection of very considerable importance \u201d . As to the evidence contained in GPE \u2019s statement , the judge observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... Having regard to the nature of the statement of [ GPE ] , at best for the ORG , it might demonstrate only a propensity on the part of the accused to engage in homosexual sexual activity of the kind described in it . In the present case , the ORG will require to lead corroborated evidence of the crimes charged against the accused ; it appears to me that the contents of the statement of [ GPE ] , while they may be of some assistance in the context of a circumstantial case , are unlikely to be able to carry the ORG very far ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge further referred to the safeguards present in section DATE ) of the Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) Act DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and to the fact that particular directions to the jury concerning the weight to be given to GPE \u2019s statement would be necessary . Finally , he noted that it was not said on behalf of the accused that the contents of the statement were untrue . He observed that if , as the evidence in the case unfolded , the significance of the evidence contained in the statement assumed greater importance in the prosecution case , it would be open to the accused to raise the matter again , adding :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Indeed , the overall fairness or unfairness of the trial in relation to LAW of the convention could be considered in the context of an appeal . As I understand it , it is only in the context of a completed trial that a conclusive assessment of that matter can be made . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Lord PERSON ruled that the search warrant was granted in respect of the applicant \u2019s home and refused an adjournment to allow the applicant to challenge its validity by way of bill of suspension , for reasons set out in his fourth written opinion . The case to be presented on behalf of the applicant in respect of the proposed challenge to the validity of the search warrant was that the police and Procurator Fiscal had no sufficient basis for seeking a warrant . The trial judge concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Having heard what has been said in defence of the warrant , it is clear and not disputed that certain material was placed before the sheriff which supported the granting of the application and ... I am not persuaded that there has been shown a prima facie case of invalidity of the warrant , such as might be raised in a bill of suspension .", "CARDINAL . In any event , whether an adjournment for the contemplated purpose is to be granted in the course of a trial is plainly a matter for the exercise of my own discretion . While there may be cases in which the granting of such an adjournment would be appropriate , I have not been informed of any case in which that course has actually been followed . In any event , the present trial has now been running for DATE . It is far from clear how long an adjournment for the purpose of the bringing of a bill of suspension would require to be . Moreover , it is obvious that the granting of the adjournment for such an uncertain period would be highly disruptive , so far as the jury is concerned , in a trial which is plainly of importance . Having regard to the fact that the issue sought to be raised in a bill of suspension can , if appropriate , be raised in the course of any appeal which may follow any conviction in this trial , it appears to me that no injustice would be done to the accused by the refusal of the present motion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the conclusion of the trial , Lord PERSON delivered his charge to the jury . As regards prejudicial publicity , his direction was as follows :", "\u201c Now , ladies and gentlemen , I have spoken about your responsibility to evaluate and assess the evidence and reach a decision in the light of the evidence . That is what you undertook to do when you took the oath at the start of this trial . So let me dwell for a moment upon what evidence is for this purpose . Evidence quite simply is the testimony of witnesses which is actually given in this ORG including any documentary evidence or other material to which they may refer in the course of what they say which had been produced in the case . That , ladies and gentlemen , is the limit of it . That is what evidence is . Evidence does not include assertions or propositions or suggestions which have been put to witnesses in questions to them with which they did not agree . Furthermore , evidence does not include any extraneous material in any form which may have come to your attention concerning this case or to PERSON PERSON or concerning PERSON PERSON , the accused , from any source outside the CARDINAL walls of this ORG , whether it be in Press , on television or in any other way . Any such material as that should be completely ignored by you . That is not evidence . To pay heed to it would be quite simply a breach of the oath which you took at the start of theses proceedings to reach a decision in the light of the whole evidence in the case . So please , ladies and gentlemen , do bear these matters in mind when you come to deliberate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the allegation in the charge that the applicant had penetrated the victim with his private member , the judge explained to the jury that this amounted to an allegation of sodomy and gave them directions on the circumstances in which anal penetration amounted to a crime .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the evidence of the deceased witness , GPE , he said :", "\u201c ... [ W]hat I must impress upon you is that that material differs from the evidence given by a witness over there in the witness box . [ GPE ] unfortunately could not do that and certain consequences flow from that . Because he is dead , evidence is competent and permissible of the things which he said before he died because that is the only now available material which there can be relating to what he said . However , you should understand that because he is now dead , because he has not been directly a witness in this case , you should approach his evidence in a different way from the way in which you would approach the evidence of a living witness . In the first instance , you have not had the opportunity if seeing [ GPE ] or hearing him giving his evidence . You have not had the opportunity of assessing his demeanour in the way in which you can assess the demeanour of other witnesses . Furthermore , he has not been put on oath in this Court in a formal way which is a matter of significance and more particularly he has not been cross - examined by the lawyers who have appeared in this case in the way that they have been able to cross - examine other witnesses . So these features mean that you should approach his evidence , the material which is in the statement which he is said to have made , with critical care and you should assess its weight in the light of the considerations which I have just mentioned . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge also directed the jury that no adverse inferences could be drawn from the fact that , when charged following a caution in which he was told that he did not need to say anything , the applicant chose to accept the invitation to say nothing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of murder by majority verdict of the jury . He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a tariff ( punishment part ) set at DATE , to run from DATE .", "CARDINAL . In passing sentence , Lord PERSON noted :", "\u201c ... [ Y]ou have been convicted of the crime of murder . ORG has enacted that there is CARDINAL sentence which can be imposed in such a case which is imprisonment for life . Accordingly , that is the sentence which I impose ...", "...", "It is also my duty in terms of LAW of DATE to state that you have been convicted of a sexual offence to which Part CARDINAL of that Act applies . Accordingly you are subject to the notification requirements contained in that Act ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s legal advisers lodged a formal note of appeal against conviction and sentence . The note contained CARDINAL grounds of appeal against conviction , each ground being subdivided into a number of subparagraphs , and CARDINAL ground of appeal against the tariff part of the applicant \u2019s sentence .", "CARDINAL . The grounds of appeal against conviction related to : publicity issues ; the admission of the statement of GPE ; the conduct of the prosecutor at trial ; the granting of the search warrant ; the sufficiency of the evidence ; the admissibility of evidence of the applicant \u2019s travel to the GPE ; the rule of specialty ; and the compatibility of the jury trial with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the disclosure process which took place during the appeal proceedings , the applicant lodged a further ground of appeal regarding non - disclosure in relation to a police statement , which had been noted by the police in DATE , of GPE , a witness who had given oral evidence at trial . Subsequent to making her initial statement to the police , ORG had been precognised , i.e. interviewed , by both the prosecution and the defence .", "CARDINAL . The appeal against conviction was heard DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court handed down its judgment refusing all the grounds of appeal against conviction . It made some comment at the outset regarding the delay in the appeal process and observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... At a cost no doubt to the progress of the cases of other appellants , the court was able to arrange for the appeal to be heard DATE in DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Further relevant extracts of the court \u2019s judgment are summarised below .", "CARDINAL . Under this head , the applicant complained about prejudicial publicity both prior to and during his trial . He relied on LAW and complained in particular about the nature of the publicity ; the alleged involvement of the authorities in the dissemination of information to the press ; the failure of the court to control the publicity ; the failure of the prosecuting authorities to control the publicity ; the failure of the court to take steps to manage the trial in the light of the prejudicial publicity ; and aspects of the NORP jury system .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred at the outset to the opinion of Lord PERSON in response to the applicant \u2019s plea in bar of trial ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and to the fact that the matter had been considered on appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It also noted the terms of Lord PERSON \u2019s warnings to the jury , both at the start of trial and in his charge to the jury ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court considered that in approaching matters of publicity , it was important to note the nature and , in particular , the timing of the potentially prejudicial publicity . It reviewed the submissions of the applicant \u2019s counsel before Lord PERSON as to the publicity which had occurred following the search of the applicant \u2019s home , and quoted extensively the findings of ORG in its judgment in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It noted that DATE and DATE had elapsed since the publicity of which the applicant complained was published by the time that ORG gave its decision on DATE , and a further DATE ensued before the trial began .", "CARDINAL . As to the subsequent refusal of Lord PERSON to allow the section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) motion ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , the court said :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Before us , ... counsel for the appellant , sought to question this decision by the trial judge on the basis that postponement of fair and accurate reporting of the trial proceedings was a potential safeguard and that with the benefit of hindsight the focus of trial counsel and the court was too narrow . However , on the court \u2019s testing that assertion , what was submitted was that reading fair and accurate contemporaneous reports of the trial might revive in the minds of the jury some earlier press report which they might have read DATE .", "CARDINAL . We are unable to accept this branch of the argument for the appellant . ... [ T]he trial judge was undoubtedly correct in refusing the motion for postponement of fair and accurate reporting of the trial . There was no proper basis upon which he could have acceded to the motion made to him . Moreover , and perhaps more importantly , there is no suggestion in what was put before us that the allowance of the normal rule of reporting matters fairly and accurately resulted in fact in the realisation of the apprehension of trial counsel that the allowance of the contemporaneous publication of such fair and accurate reports would be the source of a repetition of the prejudicial material published prior to the proceedings becoming active . The apprehension upon which the motion was advanced not having materialised , we are unable to see how it could be contended that the refusal of this motion rendered the trial unfair . Moreover , we are unable to understand the suggestion , advanced by counsel for the appellant to us , that the reading by a member of the jury of a fair and accurate report of the DATE \u2019s proceedings should prompt a mental reaction of recalling prejudicial material which would not derive from the hearing of the whole evidence on that and DATE of the trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Regarding Lord PERSON \u2019s refusal to summon certain publishers to court ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , ORG observed that it was accepted by both prosecution and defence that the impugned materials were archived material originally published before the criminal proceedings had become active on DATE and that they could not be accessed by entering the applicant \u2019s name into a standard Internet search engine . It noted that the applicant did not submit that Lord PERSON had erred but rather that the focus before the trial court had been too narrow . ORG referred to the applicant \u2019s submission that warnings to the jury to ignore extraneous material were insufficient and that vetting or sequestration of the jury ought to have been carried out , and observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ W]e start by accepting , as did ORG dealing with the pre - trial TIME , that the articles appearing in the press and other broadcasting media in the interval between , on the one hand , the discoveries in GPE GPE on DATE and more particularly the search of the appellant \u2019s flat on DATE and , on the other hand , the criminal proceedings becoming active on DATE were highly prejudicial to the appellant . But , as that ORG recognised , in part at least as a result of the interposition of the extradition proceedings , the reality was that a substantial period of time had elapsed since the publication of the offending material in DATE . In the event , the trial began DATE after the proceedings became \u2018 GPE . It has , in our view , been consistently noted by the courts that the passage of time may assuage the effects of prejudicial media reporting ... We recognise of course that it is not a simple matter of measuring the extent to which time has elapsed . The nature of the prejudicial material and other relevant factors may come in to play . Further , as the courts have consistently recognised in the authorities to which we were referred , the discipline of the trial process is another important factor in the evaluation of whether the holding of a trial against a history of prejudicial publicity is unfair . Put shortly , the jury having been participant in an ongoing inquiry in which they have heard the actual evidence from a variety of classes of witnesses , it is that evidence which will be at the forefront of the mind of the jurors and which will predominate over any distant memory the jury might have of some earlier publicity .", "CARDINAL . ... Lord ORG \u2019s observation was to the effect that whereas the court may be presented with an assembly of a number of prejudicial published articles , it is highly improbable that any potential juror would have read all of that material ; there is thus a danger in overestimating the impact which prejudicial publicity may have had on any particular juror . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the trial judge had given the jury very clear directions in his charge on the need to decide the case only on the evidence and to set aside any extraneous material , referring specifically to items in the press , on the television or in any other source , and that similar instructions were given to the jury at the very start of the trial . It concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In our view these were all important factors or safeguards against any effect on the trial which might have emanated from what was published in the various organs of the media in the interval between CARDINAL and DATE , and more particularly between DATE and CARDINAL DATE , since it was only on DATE that the appellant was identified in the press . Certainly , in an era before the archiving of material in electronic form on internet websites , we consider that a court would not have difficulty in dismissing the contention that such prejudicial publicity in that short interval prior to the criminal proceedings becoming active inevitably , and without anything further , rendered a trial taking place DATE unfair where the directions given by the trial judge in the present case had been so given . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the additional \u201c internet dimension \u201d , the court reiterated that it was not suggested that , respecting the state of internet search engines in DATE , the information given to the trial judge as to access to archived material was flawed . ORG therefore accepted that at the time of the trial , in order to obtain access to the prejudicial archive material , a relatively determined search was required which involved , first , selecting a publisher \u2019s website and then entering into a further search within that archived website . The court also observed that it was accepted by both counsel for the applicant and the prosecution that while in DATE many people did have access to the Internet , the extent of familiarity with and use of the Internet was less than obtained in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded :", "\u201c DATE . It is against that background of circumstances as they were in DATE that we consider the suggestion , never formulated as a distinct proposition or submission , that to ensure a fair trial the trial judge , in DATE , was required , additionally to the other instructions which he gave at the start of the trial , to direct the jury to the effect that the jury members should not undertake any internet inquiries . It is to be observed , first , that the giving of such an additional instruction or direction to the jury was never suggested to the trial judge by either trial counsel ... Secondly , there may be intelligible reasons why that suggestion was not made . Whether such an instruction is a good idea is a matter of debate . As the Solicitor General related , in his recent personal experience , the giving of such a direction was seen as not being DATE or at least not always being \u2013 in the interests of the defence . Thirdly , the model directions culled from GPE and the bench book in use in ORG in GPE and GPE to which we were referred by counsel for the appellant are not only not mandatory in those jurisdictions but also were not in force at the time of the appellant \u2019s trial . They were introduced much later . The same , in our view , applies to the observations recently made by the court in PERSON v HM Advocate [ DATE SCCR CARDINAL where ORG indicated that , in an appropriate case , the trial judge might give the jury a suitably framed direction about not actively seeking material about the accused on the internet ] . The fact that some jurisdictions selected by counsel for the appellant have chosen CARDINAL path does not indicate a universality of wisdom . There are no doubt others who may have chosen not to follow that particular path . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the circumstances the court was satisfied that the fact that the trial judge did not additionally and specifically instruct the jury not to undertake Internet searches did not involve any failing on his part . His primary instruction was to ignore any extraneous materials and to pay attention only to the evidence and in the view of ORG it was implicit in that instruction that the members of the jury should not seek out such extraneous materials .", "CARDINAL . As to the suggestion that the trial judge should have ordered that the jury members be sequestered for the entirety of the trial or should have arranged for them to be vetted , ORG noted :", "\u201c DATE ... Although at CARDINAL point trial counsel floated such a course as a possible motion which he might make , in the event no such motion was made , we think wholly understandably . The notion that the members of the jury should be sequestered in hotel accommodation TIME and every weekend in conditions , even within the hotel , precluding access to the internet , is so disproportionate that it can readily be rejected . In reality , of which we think trial counsel would be very conscious , such sequestration of the jury might be likely to \u2018 PERSON seriously against the accused . Secondly , it was suggested that the trial judge ought to have embarked on an exercise of jury vetting , by specifically questioning the members of the jury regarding their respective recollections of the media articles published DATE previously . Suffice to say that such a procedure is without any warrant in our law and is wholly inconsistent with our practice of jury selection . We are not in the least surprised that responsible trial counsel did not make any such suggestion to the trial judge , who , in our view , could not have acceded to such a suggestion were it to have been advanced . \u201d", "CARDINAL . For these reasons the court rejected the ground of appeal relating to prejudicial publicity .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended that the trial judge had erred in admitting the statement made by GPE and that the admission had rendered his trial unfair .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred to Lord PERSON \u2019s opinion on this matter ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and continued :", "\u201c DATE . ... [ W]e agree ... that [ GPE \u2019s ] statement was simply CARDINAL piece of circumstantial evidence to be considered along with many other pieces of circumstantial evidence . [ GPE ] was relating what the appellant had told him of his habitual behaviour , preferences , and sexual interests ... Once all the evidence had been led , [ GPE \u2019s ] statement , if accepted by the jury and considered along with the other pieces of circumstantial evidence which they accepted , might assist them to some extent in drawing inferences about how and why the deceased , last seen in GPE town centre , and who had no previous connection with the appellant , and who did not normally go to places with strangers , might end up in the appellant \u2019s company and in his flat . But , while accepting that the hearsay evidence was thus not irrelevant , in light of all the other evidence in the case , we agree with ORG that the appellant \u2019s conviction can not be said to have been based solely or to a material extent upon [ GPE \u2019s ] statement . The statement was simply CARDINAL of many relevant pieces of circumstantial evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It further noted that the trial judge had given directions to the jury warning them to treat the evidence of GPE with caution , for reasons which he carefully explained ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant had not sought to argue that the jury were misdirected . The court added :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ E]vidence concerning the appellant \u2019s sexual interests and his statement as to what had occurred on TIME in question was also led from [ B. ] . Many other adminicles of circumstantial evidence were available to the jury to enable them to draw inferences and form a view . Thus the evidence of [ GPE \u2019s ] statement did not stand alone and was not thus a crucial element in the prosecution case . So we are unable to detect any sound basis upon which it would be open to us to hold that the admission of evidence from the police officer of what [ GPE ] said to him , by reason of its being hearsay evidence , constituted a breach of any ORG right of the appellant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained that the conduct of the prosecutor was such as to deprive him of a fair trial , as he had made frequent , deliberate , inappropriate and prejudicial comments both in the course of the evidence led before the jury and in his address to them at the conclusion of the trial to the effect that the applicant had been able to give evidence about matters which were relevant to the issues to be considered by the jury and that his silence was to be interpreted as proof of his guilt .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the impugned acts and comments of the prosecutor . It observed that the posing of rhetorical questions was a recognised and legitimate oratorical technique in a criminal trial , and that the prosecutor had employed this technique frequently in his speech in relation to a variety of matters . On the argument made by the applicant , it concluded :", "\u201c DATE . ... It is important to appreciate that nowhere in the words spoken by the Advocate depute was there any reference to the appellant \u2019s having had the opportunity of giving evidence to provide an answer to the Advocate depute \u2019s rhetorical question and having failed to do so . The trial judge in his charge to the jury underscored the need not to draw any adverse inference from the appellant \u2019s not having given evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This ground of appeal was accordingly rejected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended , inter alia , that the trial judge had erred in refusing an adjournment of the trial to enable him to seek the suspension of the search warrant on the grounds that it had been granted without adequate reasons .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that in response to its request to the Sheriff who had granted the search warrant , the latter had produced a report dated DATE , in which he set out his recollection of the hearing . ORG observed that , unsurprisingly given the lapse of time , it was apparent from that report that the ORG could remember little of the detail of the hearing . It explained that with a view to overcoming this , the applicant \u2019s lawyers had been supplied with a typed , essentially contemporaneous attendance note prepared by ORG , summarising the material laid before the Sheriff . ORG quoted the terms of the attendance note in full . In relevant extract , it recorded the following :", "\u201c Sheriff PERSON asked for justification and I informed him that the limbs and head which had been recovered were those of the missing PERSON , and that the police had carried out a GPE [ modus operandi ] profile with ORG [ ORG ] . The only suspect in GPE turned out to be PERSON , not only that , he lived in GPE .", "The sheriff was advised of the information which the police had in relation to Beggs\u2019 previous conviction at ORG , where he had picked up and intoxicated a young boy , who awoke to find PERSON cutting his leg ... The sheriff was also advised of the NORP conviction for murder and for wounding , and the fact that in relation to the woundings , PERSON had cut his victims . He was also advised that the flesh on the limbs had been cut in a similar way before the bones had been cut .", "Mr PERSON advised the sheriff that in addition to the background information given above , PERSON is known to have left this country and gone to GPE , and it is suspected is still there , the inference being that he has fled from this jurisdiction . I further advised the sheriff that we also suspected that the dismembered parts of the body had been taken by PERSON , in his motor car , to the places where they were disposed of , and that he is known to have driven CARDINAL motor car to GPE , left it there and returned on foot .", "Finally I moved the sheriff to grant the warrant on the basis that the intrusion into PERSON private life was relatively minor compared to the very serious crime under investigation , and therefore that the balance of the public interest lay in granting the warrant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG observed , having regard to the terms of the attendance note :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... In essence , the basis given for suspicion having fallen on the appellant was primarily information held by the police of previous convictions of the appellant and what might be termed police intelligence of other incidents in which there was information considered by the police as implicating the appellant but in which the evidence had been insufficient to allow prosecution . That was supplemented by such suspicions as were raised by the appellant \u2019s movements to and from GPE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In so far as counsel for the applicant sought to argue that it was illegitimate or inappropriate for the prosecuting authorities to have based suspicion on a police analysis of modus operandi , ORG rejected the suggestion , noting :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... In an appropriate case , the police and the prosecutor are , in our view , entitled to proceed upon the basis that information on a person \u2019s criminal history and analysis of modus operandi places that person in the position of a suspect . Clearly , it is not necessary when seeking a warrant that the prosecuting authorities have evidence to establish guilt ; the purpose of seeking the warrant to search the property or person of the suspect is with a view to getting evidence helpful to prove the suspicion , or from the suspect \u2019s standpoint possibly eliminating him from that field of suspicion . In our view , the present case was CARDINAL in which it was appropriate for the police and the prosecuting authorities to proceed upon the basis of previous criminal history ( whether by court conviction or police intelligence ) and a modus operandi analysis . Additionally , there was the information held respecting the appellant \u2019s movements to and from GPE .", "DATE . ORG therefore concluded that there was clearly a proper basis upon which ORG sought the grant of the search warrant and that the Sheriff had not erred in exercising his discretion to grant it . In this regard , the court observed that it was apparent from the attendance note that the Sheriff was reminded of the need to balance the public interest in the investigation of crime against the private interest of protection against unwarranted interference in the applicant \u2019s private life .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended that the trial judge had erred in rejecting a submission on the sufficiency of the evidence regarding various aspects of the charge , including in particular the alleged penetration of the deceased \u2019s hinder parts by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having reviewed the evidence presented at trial , considered that there was an adequate evidential base upon which a jury could infer that penetration by the penis had occurred and that the victim had not consented . It therefore rejected this ground of appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued that he was convicted and sentenced in breach of the rule of specialty having regard to the terms of the indictment , and in particular the inclusion of references to dismemberment and sodomy ; the leading of evidence which was put before the jury as criminal conduct ; the basis upon which conviction was sought by the prosecution ; the basis upon which the jury were charged ; and the terms of his sentence .", "CARDINAL . As to the inclusion of the averment of dismemberment in the indictment , ORG referred to the opinion of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the judgment of ORG agreeing with that opinion ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It considered that the finality of that decision was not open to being re - visited in the appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s principal argument was directed at the inclusion in the indictment of the averment that the applicant \u201c did assault [ the deceased ] ... and penetrate his hinder parts with your private member \u201d , not argued before Lord PERSON . According to the applicant , this alleged a separate crime of sodomy , not charged as such in the extradition request , and so the court had no jurisdiction to entertain this allegation of criminal conduct .", "CARDINAL . ORG first examined the scope of the specialty rule , observing :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]he specialty principle prevents a ORG to which a person has been surrendered from prosecuting that person for an offence different in its essential nature from the charge , or any of the charges , upon which he or she was extradited . The rule does not however have any effect , or operate any restriction , upon the evidence which may be deployed by the prosecutor in proof of the commission of the criminal conduct in respect of which the person was surrendered ; and that is so even if the evidence so deployed discloses or suggests the commission of a criminal offence for which extradition was not granted by the sending ORG .", "CARDINAL . We would add that these conclusions are , in our view , entirely consistent with the origins and rationale of the specialty rule . The rule is primarily CARDINAL of international law . It is concerned with respecting the power of the extraditing ORG to refuse extradition and ensuring that in so far as that ORG has a discretion to refuse extradition , that discretion is not abused by the receiving ORG . Its principal purpose is thus to preserve comity between GPE , rather than effect a protection for the accused . Given that such is the primary purpose , it is in our view comprehensible that the rule should not be concerned with the nature of the evidence and procedure followed in prosecuting the extradition offence or whether the evidence tendered in the proof of that offence might also indicate the commission of some other offence or involve the commission of some lesser offence within the category of the extradition offence ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Turning to the inclusion of the averments of anal penetration in the indictment , the court observed that while the trial judge had treated them as amounting to an allegation of sodomy and had given the jury appropriate directions on that crime , it had reservations whether they were properly to be seen as averments of sodomy rather than incidents in the indecent or sexual assault to which the indictment referred . It did not see in the trial judge \u2019s approach anything detrimental to the applicant \u2019s position . It continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]he fact is that the indictment did not include any charge of sodomy separate from the charge of assault and murder and thus no penalty separate from that imposed in respect of the murder could have been imposed upon the appellant in respect of the averment said to be an averment of sodomy . \u201d", "DATE . As regards the breach of specialty allegation , the court explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the judicial decisions to which we were referred respecting the specialty rule or principle there is recognition that in extradition cases , obviously , one can not operate a narrow technical approach as to the juristic ingredients in a particular offence ; a more \u2018 conduct based\u2019 approach needs to be followed ... We consider that in principle that view is sound . As was pointed out by ORG , the first petition warrant upon which extradition was granted referred to the possibility of establishing the death by \u2018 some other means to the petitioner presently ORG . At that point in time , the torso of the deceased had not been recovered and hence the procurator fiscal was ignorant of such details of the assault upon the deceased as might later be revealed by that examination . In the event , those details revealed evidence of forcible anal penetration . So , as part of the allegation of assault leading to death , those details were an inherent element of that assault . In other words they were part and parcel of the conduct founding the proof of the extradition charge . On the broader , conduct based approach required in the application of extradition law , we thus do not consider that the possibility that domestic law might technically , or , in the old - fashioned sense of the adverb , nicely , identify a part of the averments of the details of the assault upon the deceased as containing an averment of sodomy leads to any violation of the specialty principle .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly we do not consider that it can properly be said that the appellant was proceeded against and convicted , separately from the charge of murder , of a distinct charge of sodomy any more than it may be said that he was separately proceeded against and convicted of the discrete charge of assault . The appellant faced a single charge of murder , within which were contained as part of that charge the lesser allegations of assault , including the averment of anal penetration . Whether that be categorised as indecent assault or sodomy it remains a matter within the murder charge . These were lesser offences included within the charge of murder and for the reasons which we have endeavoured to indicate their inclusion did not offend against the international law principle of specialty . Further , in passing sentence , the trial judge stated that the appellant had been convicted of murder and he passed sentence for that offence . No separate penalty was imposed in respect of assault or indeed sodomy . The extract conviction , providing the warrant for the appellant \u2019s imprisonment , records the conviction as being that of murder alone . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Although , having passed sentence for murder the trial judge went on to say that the applicant had been convicted of an offence to which LAW applied ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , without explaining the basis for that pronouncement , this did not alter the terms of the conviction by the jury and did not in itself give rise to any liability to the notification requirements in LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG therefore found that no breach of the rule of specialty had occurred in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued that the absence of reasons for the jury \u2019s decision , in a case as factually and legally complex as his was , violated his LAW . He relied , inter alia , on the judgment of LAW in GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ; a request for referral to ORG was pending at the time .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the general tenor of this ORG \u2019s caselaw on the need for reasons , putting to CARDINAL side its recent judgment in GPE , and observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . [ W]e consider that it is clear from the judgments and decisions to which we were referred that the ECtHR\u2018jury\u2019 , the fact that , in returning its verdict , such a jury does not deliver an exposition of its reasoning does not in itself involve any infraction of LAW . In that respect we refer to the passages , to which reference has already been made , in the decisions in PERSON v GPE ; PERSON and ORG v GPE ; and ORG ( No . CARDINAL ) in which the view taken is that the absence of any direct delivery of reasons by the jury itself may be offset by the discernability of the basis of the jury \u2019s decision from the procedural framework in which the jury operates . We would also mention that , although we were not referred to the decision , in PERSON v GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL the ECtHR , at para CARDINAL of its judgment , acknowledged that \u2018 ... the rule governing the secrecy of jury deliberations is a crucial and legitimate feature of LANGUAGE trial law which serves to reinforce the jury \u2019s role as the ultimate arbiter of fact and to guarantee open and frank deliberations among jurors on the evidence which they have ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the impact of Taxquet , the court referred to an analysis by Judge PERSON , giving the lead judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON v. ORG , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , and agreed with her that Taxquet was not to be read as imposing a requirement that a jury supply reasons for its verdict . In the applicant \u2019s case it observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Just as in any other jury trial in GPE , the verdict returned by the jury in the present case is not returned in isolation . It is given within a framework which includes , in particular , the speeches to the jury by those advocating the prosecution and the defence and the directions given to the jury by the trial judge . It is not suggested that the address by the trial Advocate depute in this case did not set out clearly the nature of the ORG case and the evidence which the ORG invited the jury to accept and acceptance of which was necessary if the jury were to return a guilty verdict . Nor is it suggested that the address by defence counsel did not clearly present to the jury the basis upon which it was contended that guilt was not established and that the appellant should be acquitted . It is also not suggested that the trial Judge \u2019s charge to the jury did not adequately identify all the matters which the ORG had to establish , or fail to analyse or describe the necessary elements or ingredients in the offence . Accordingly , from that framework and also from the evidence in the case , the basis of the conviction is discernable . With a jury verdict thus placed in such a framework , we do not consider , having regard to the case law of the ECtHR to which we were referred , that the fact that a jury does not supply reasons involves an infraction of the fair trial requirements of LAW .", "CARDINAL . We would add that in the submission as initially presented and also in the ground of appeal , it is suggested that the circumstances of the present case were somehow so complicated or unusual that the normal procedures or framework within which a jury verdict is returned did not suffice . We do not agree with that suggestion . The indictment contained a single charge and , while no doubt a number of legal issues arose in the trial and required to be dealt with by the trial judge , the matters for the jury were not in our view extraordinary or particularly complex ... Further , we would add that the fact that the ORG case was largely circumstantial clearly does not take this case out of the ordinary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended that the fact that the witness statement by ORG was first placed in the hands of his lawyers in DATE prevented him from calling the witness or making use of the information in the statement in the cross - examination of other witnesses .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted at the outset :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It is plain that the drafter of the Note [ of appeal ] proceeds under a serious misconception . [ ORG ] was included as a witness on the list annexed to the indictment , and so could have been called by the defence , had it not been that , of course , she was in fact called by the prosecution and cross - examined by the defence . Further , while her police statement might in theory afford scope for cross - examination on the basis of a prior inconsistent statement , it could not be deployed as a tool of crossexamination of other witnesses , as the drafter seems to have thought . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court nonetheless heard submissions from counsel on the basis that the non - disclosure had prevented cross - examination of GPE during the trial on the basis of a prior inconsistent statement . It noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... As matters emerged in the argument before us , the only possible differences between what the police noted as being [ ORG \u2019s ] account and her ultimate evidence was that in the former she is recorded as having said that she noted blood at the left side of the deceased \u2019s mouth following a punch to the deceased \u2019s face by [ G.B. ] ; that apart , she saw no other injuries to the deceased ; and that , following the cessation of the fight or altercation , the deceased began to punch his own head \u2013 something which he had done before when drunk . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court observed that ORG had been precognosed by both sides and that the results had essentially been the same ; and that ORG evidence at trial did not materially depart from the precognitions . It continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... So it is perhaps unlikely that [ ORG ] would readily and persuasively accept the accuracy of the police officer \u2019s note of the interview ; and were she not to do so , evidence from the police officer to contrary effect , if accepted , would not of course establish the truth of the statement , but might damage her reliability and thus impede the defence in its invocation of the evidence of [ ORG ] as undermining the ORG contention . But more importantly , were [ GPE ] , on being presented with the terms of her statement as noted by the police officer , to have accepted that she did see some blood at the mouth of the deceased , following a punch from [ PERSON ] , and that at some point shortly thereafter the deceased , having got up from the ground , began to punch himself in accordance with a proclivity seen by the witness on previous occasions when drink had been taken , we are unable to see how those additional matters materially assist the defence contention that the serious facial injuries , including the fractures of the underlying bone structures , were caused prior to the deceased \u2019s entry to the appellant \u2019s flat . Were the jury to take account of those additional matters , that account would have to be taken not only in the context of all of the rest of [ ORG ] evidence , but also the wider context of all of the other evidence respecting the [ G.B. ] encounter and events preceding and succeeding , including the evidence of his seeking entry to ORG in an uninjured state ; and , of course , the medical evidence . We therefore have grave difficulties in seeing how , realistically , disclosure of the police note of the interview could have possibly affected the outcome of the trial or given a real possibility of a different outcome ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG was therefore satisfied that the absence of the police statement from the defence file , an absence , it noted , which was also shared by the prosecution , did not result in material prejudice to the applicant or in the trial being unfair .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s counsel urged ORG not only to consider each ground of appeal separately but to look at them as a whole to decide whether the trial had been fair .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave the submission consideration but was not persuaded , looking at the grounds jointly and collectively , that a miscarriage of justice had occurred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused leave to appeal to ORG on CARDINAL grounds of appeal identified which , the applicant contended , raised human rights issues .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the first ground of appeal regarding the rule of specialty , ORG found that no devolution issue arose ( see CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the second ground of appeal in respect of prejudicial publicity , leave was refused on the basis that it did not raise a matter of general public importance .", "CARDINAL . Leave to appeal was also refused in respect of the third ground of appeal based on the absence of reasons from the jury . ORG indicated that it was for ORG to decide whether leave should be granted on this ground .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG refused leave to appeal on the basis of the non - disclosure of the statement by ORG It noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... As is stated in the Note [ of appeal ] , for whatever reason , the members of this court understood from the submissions that [ NORP ] had given evidence at the trial whereas it appears that , while she was listed as a witness at an earlier stage in the proceedings and while she was precognosed by both the ORG and the defence , she did not in fact give evidence . However , the real issue raised by this additional ground of appeal was whether , to the extent that the police statement contained any details different from or additional to what had been ascertained by precognition , the defence were materially prejudiced and that issue is unaffected by the misunderstanding ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s submission that for the purposes of deciding whether to grant leave it was important to consider the various complaints \u201c in the round \u201d , ORG said :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... For our part we do not consider that this is a proper approach . In our view in considering an application for leave to appeal to ORG of GPE , it is necessary to identify and formulate a specific issue or specific issues which properly constitute a devolution issue or issues . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s application for leave to appeal against conviction .", "CARDINAL . On a number of occasions , starting in DATE , letters from the applicant \u2019s legal advisers were opened by prison officers at ORG .
