BELGIUM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG , is a public limited company under NORP law which specialises in livestock slaughter and has its head office in ORG ) . It was represented before ORG by PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( since repealed ) of the PERSON of DATE on animal health provided for the setting - up of an animal health and production fund ( \u201c the fund \u201d ) attached to ORG . Its purpose was to contribute towards the financing of compensation , subsidies and other benefits in connection with combating animal diseases and improving animal hygiene and health and the quality of livestock and livestock products . The PERSON also stipulated that the fund would be financed in particular by compulsory contributions payable by individuals and companies engaged in the production , processing , transport , preparation , sale or marketing of livestock . The amounts and procedures for collection of the contributions were to be laid down by royal decree .", "In order to give effect to this statutory provision , a royal decree on compulsory contributions to the animal health and production fund was enacted on DATE , entering into force on DATE . LAW set the initial amount of the compulsory contribution at MONEY ( BEF ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) per slaughtered bovine animal , LAW ( approximately ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) per slaughtered calf and BEF CARDINAL ( approximately LAW ) per slaughtered pig . These amounts were subsequently amended by royal decrees dated DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE .", "In DATE ORG decided to conduct an overall review of the charges payable in the agriculture and fisheries sectors in GPE and the use made of the resulting revenue , in particular in the form of aid . In order to obtain the information , it sent out a standard letter to all the Member GPE during DATE . In response , the NORP authorities informed ORG measures introduced by LAW and the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG issued a decision in which it found that the aid financed by the compulsory contributions under the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE was incompatible with the common market within the meaning of LAW current LAW ) of the LAW establishing ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . Under the terms of that Article , any aid granted by a Member ORG or through ORG resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods is incompatible in principle with the common market , in so far as it affects trade between Member GPE . In this particular case , the incompatibility arose out of the fact that the compulsory contributions were payable also in respect of animals imported from other Member GPE but were used exclusively to fund aid to NORP breeders . The ORG took the view that the system in question should therefore be abolished , in so far as products imported from other Member ORG also attracted the compulsory contribution at the stage of slaughter .", "In the body of the decision the ORG further noted that the NORP authorities had not notified it in advance of their plans to introduce the system established by LAW and the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE . They had therefore acted in breach of LAW current LAW , which requires Member GPE to inform the Commission of any plans to grant or alter aid so that it may examine their compatibility with the common market , and which prohibits the Member ORG concerned from putting its proposed measures into effect until the ORG has taken a final decision .", "According to the settled case - law of ORG in GPE , the prohibition on putting the proposed measures into effect referred to in the final sentence of Article CARDINAL ) has direct effect and gives rise to rights for individuals which the national courts must safeguard ( see in particular the following judgments of ORG of ORG ) : judgment of DATE , Case CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON v. ORG and PERSON GPE ; judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , ORG nationale du commerce ext\u00e9rieur des produits alimentaires et Syndicat national des n\u00e9gociants et transformateurs de saumon v. NORP Republic ; judgment of DATE , Case ORG , ORG international ( PERSON ) and others v. PERSON and others ) . ORG has also held that \u201c the ORG 's final decision does not have the effect of regularizing ex post facto the implementing measures which were invalid because they had been taken in breach of the prohibition laid down by the last sentence of LAW , since otherwise the direct effect of that prohibition would be impaired and the interests of individuals , which ... are to be protected by national courts , would be disregarded . \u201d According to ORG , \u201c any other interpretation would have the effect of according a favourable outcome to the nonobservance by the Member ORG concerned of the last sentence of Article PERSON ) and would deprive that provision of its effectiveness \u201d ( see ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , ORG nationale du commerce ext\u00e9rieur des produits alimentaires et Syndicat national des n\u00e9gociants et transformateurs de saumon v. NORP Republic , and judgment of DATE , Case ORG , ORG international ( PERSON ) and others v. PERSON and others ) .", "After proceedings were brought before it by several companies engaged in the trading of calves and seeking reimbursement by ORG of the compulsory contributions they had made to the fund which they considered to be contrary to Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , ORG referred a number of questions to ORG for a preliminary ruling . The questions were aimed essentially at ascertaining", "( i ) whether ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , CARDINAL et seq . , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW precluded the introduction of a compulsory contribution which constituted a parafiscal charge levied on domestic and imported products alike , in accordance with the same collection procedures , and paid into a fund which operated solely for the benefit of domestic production , and", "( ii ) whether the provisions in question had direct effect .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG replied in substance that", "( i ) a compulsory contribution constituting a parafiscal charge , applied under the same conditions as regards its collection to both domestic and imported products , the revenue from which was used for the benefit of domestic products only , constituted a charge having an effect equivalent to customs duties prohibited by LAW , if the advantages accruing from it wholly offset the burden borne by those products ;", "( ii ) if those advantages only partly offset the burden borne by domestic products , such a charge constituted discriminatory taxation prohibited by LAW ;", "( iii ) depending on the use to which the revenue was put , a parafiscal charge of that kind could also constitute ORG aid incompatible with the common market if the conditions for the application of LAW were met , that being a matter for the Commission to determine in accordance with the procedure laid down for that purpose in LAW ;", "( iv ) the provisions of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW gave rise to rights for individuals which the national courts were obliged to uphold ; it was also for the national courts to safeguard the rights of individuals where , in introducing the charge , the Member ORG concerned failed to comply with its obligations under LAW , and where a Commission decision under LAW found the levying of the charge as a method of financing ORG aid to be incompatible with the common market .", "Following this judgment by ORG , ORG Instance found that the compulsory contributions to the fund constituted discriminatory taxation prohibited by LAW . In a judgment of DATE it ordered ORG to repay to the applicants the amounts they had paid in respect of such contributions . The ORG appealed .", "Section CARDINAL of the PERSON on animal health was amended by LAW DATE laying down social and other provisions .", "The new system thus introduced stipulated that the royal decrees relating to the compulsory contributions were to be ratified by the legislature within DATE of their publication in the NORP Official Gazette . The royal decree of CARDINAL DATE on compulsory contributions to the animal health and production fund , as amended by the royal decrees of CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , was ratified by means of the abovementioned section CARDINAL of the LAW DATE , with retrospective effect from DATE . However , the ratification related only to contributions paid in respect of domestic animals . With regard to imported animals , on the other hand , the legislature , seeking to give effect to ORG of CARDINAL DATE and the judgment of ORG of DATE , provided for contributions paid since DATE to be reimbursed . To obtain reimbursement , the claimants had to prove that ( CARDINAL ) the compulsory contributions paid had related to imported animals , ( CARDINAL ) they had not taken measures to pass the contributions back to the producer , or such measures had been cancelled and ( CARDINAL ) they had paid all the compulsory contributions due in respect of domestic animals .", "As in the case of the Law of DATE , the NORP legislature did not inform ORG before enacting LAW DATE of its intention to alter the existing system of aid .", "On DATE the applicant company brought an action against ORG before ORG of First Instance seeking the reimbursement of BEF CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) , corresponding to the compulsory contributions it had paid into the animal health and production fund DATE and DATE .", "The applicant company , arguing that the contributions were contrary to LAW , applied for reimbursement on the basis of the provisions governing sums wrongly paid or , in the alternative , on the basis of the ORG 's liability in tort .", "According to the information available to the ORG , the case is still pending before ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG declared unfounded the appeal by the Government against the judgment of ORG of DATE .", "In its judgment ORG considered in particular that the Government had been wrong to assert that ORG had found the system of aid to be incompatible with the LAW only with regard to the charging of contributions in respect of animals imported from other Member LAW . On the contrary , in the view of ORG , the Commission decision had found the system as a whole to be incompatible with the LAW , as an essential component of the system , namely the parafiscal charges levied on imported animals , was incompatible with the common market .", "With regard to the new system introduced by LAW DATE ORG found that , in so far as it entailed altering the system of aid for the purposes of LAW ) of LAW , it should have been notified to the Commission in advance . As the requirement to inform the Commission had not been met , no valid basis existed for implementing the new system .", "The Government appealed against the judgment on points of law .", "In DATE the system was amended once more . Section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE was repealed and replaced by an autonomous law of DATE . The animal health and production fund was renamed the \u201c budgetary fund for the health and quality of animals and animal products \u201d .", "Section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE provided for the fund to continue to be financed in particular by compulsory contributions from individuals and companies engaged in the production , processing , transport , preparation , sale and marketing of animals and animal products .", "Section CARDINAL stipulated that , in the future , the amount of the contributions and the procedures for collection would be laid down by royal decree , it being understood that they would not be charged in respect of imported or exported animals .", "With regard to the past , however , the amount of the contributions payable by abattoirs was laid down by section CARDINAL of the PERSON , which reproduced word for word the content of the royal decrees of DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE on compulsory contributions to the animal health and production fund for each of the periods covered by the respective decrees . In addition , section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE stipulated that , unlike most of the provisions of the law , which would enter into force on DATE of its publication in ORG , section CARDINAL would apply retrospectively from DATE , the date of entry into force of the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE . LAW , meanwhile , provided for automatic compensation of the difference between the amounts due under LAW and those paid under the royal decrees on compulsory contributions to the animal health and production fund .", "However , like the PERSON of DATE , section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE made an explicit distinction between domestic animals and imported animals . It stipulated that , in the case of the latter , the compulsory contributions which had been paid from DATE under the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE , as amended by the royal decrees of CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , would be reimbursed to claimants who could provide proof that the compulsory contributions they had paid related to imported animals , that they had not taken any measures to pass those contributions back to the producer , or that such measures had been cancelled , and that they had paid all the contributions payable in respect of domestic animals , including exported slaughtered animals and exported productive livestock .", "Unlike the earlier legislation , a draft of the PERSON of DATE was notified in advance to ORG . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the ORG informed ORG that it had no objections to raise in respect of the proposed aid measures .", "Under the consolidated PERSON on the PERSON d'Etat of CARDINAL DATE , LAW ORG d'Etat issued an opinion on DATE relating in particular to the compatibility of the draft PERSON with the LAW . On that occasion , the ORG d'Etat issued a reservation as to the validity of the draft rules . The relevant passages of its opinion read as follows :", "\u201c It appears ... that ORG is involved in a dispute with a number of parties who seek the reimbursement of contributions paid . The case gave rise to a request for a preliminary ruling by ORG . In that connection , the ORG ruled first that a charge applied under the same conditions as regards its collection to both domestic and imported products , but the revenue from which was used for the benefit of domestic products only , constituted a prohibited charge having an effect equivalent to customs duties . The ORG further ruled that a charge of that kind could constitute ORG aid incompatible with the common market , and that , if ORG was not informed in advance of such aid , individuals could seek to have it declared null and void by the domestic courts as a result .", "ORG recently delivered judgment in the same case . According to ORG , the rules contained in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the Law of CARDINAL DATE on animal health were defective , even after they had been amended by LAW DATE , on account of the fact that they had not been notified to ORG . The court also found that the defects were such that the above - mentioned statutory provision could not serve as a valid legal basis for any implementing measures . ORG was therefore ordered to reimburse certain amounts which had been paid under the royal decrees enacted to give effect to the above - mentioned statutory provision .", "ORG has appealed against that judgment on points of law .", "As the case is still pending , it is not for the ORG d'Etat to adopt a position on the scope of ORG judgment and whether it was correct .", "Should it transpire that the draft rules are decisive for the eventual outcome of the case , it would be appropriate to conclude that ORG influenced the proceedings to its own advantage through the intervention of CARDINAL of the organs of ORG .", "According to the case - law of ORG , interference by the legislature in pending proceedings may be in breach of the principle of equality of arms between the parties if it is aimed at influencing the outcome of the proceedings . Such interference may also give rise to a violation of LAW of LAW .", "For that reason , the ORG d'Etat wishes to issue a reservation as to the validity of the draft rules . \u201d", "The Government responded as follows to the observations of the ORG d'Etat , in the explanatory memorandum to the draft PERSON :", "\u201c In its opinion , the ORG d'Etat states that ' such interference may also give rise to a violation of LAW of LAW .", "It should be noted that ORG approved the preliminary draft PERSON which ... was notified to it in advance in accordance with LAW .", "The case - law of ORG referred to by the PERSON d'Etat can not be applied to sections CARDINAL of the draft PERSON . The authorities have no intention of interfering in ongoing proceedings or of preventing a court from ruling on a particular issue . However , for budgetary reasons , they are obliged to limit the negative financial impact of judicial decisions which would require ORG to repay very considerable sums of money .", "The system provided for by sections DATE , which is partly retrospective , can be considered to be reasonable in view of the need to ensure the proper functioning of the fund in the general interest . The budgetary impact of having to repay the amounts concerned would imperil the funding of animal health policy ...", "In order to prevent such an outcome , the authorities must act by laying down retrospective provisions in a general law . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant company , in common with other companies engaged in the livestock trade , lodged an application with ORG seeking to have sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Law of DATE set aside .", "In support of its application , it submitted in particular that the provisions in question were in breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , taken in conjunction with Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , with LAW of LAW , with LAW No . CARDINAL , with the principle of legal certainty and with the general legal principle of the non - retrospective application of legislation .", "In enacting sections CARDINAL and DATE , the legislator had replaced the provisions of a royal decree with a retrospective statutory rule . In the view of the applicant company , that amendment prevented courts and tribunals before which proceedings had been brought from ruling on the lawfulness of the royal decree under LAW , which stated in particular that courts and tribunals could apply decrees only if they were in accordance with the law . The result , in the view of the applicant company , was an unjustified difference in treatment between those citizens to whom the provisions applied and the rest of the population , with the former being deprived of the judicial safeguards contained in Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW .", "In its judgment No . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applications .", "More specifically , the submissions based on a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , taken in conjunction with LAW and CARDINAL of LAW , LAW No . CARDINAL and the general principles of the non - retrospective application of legislation and the separation of powers , were dismissed on the following grounds :", "\u201c ORG By applying the contributions payable by slaughterhouses retrospectively ... , the legislature infringed their right to a fair hearing , equality of arms and access to a court in a discriminatory manner , as they were deprived of the possibility of alleging before the courts a violation of LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( former LAW ) ) of LAW , or of securing the enforcement of judicial decisions finding that the above provision had been violated by LAW .", "B.CARDINAL.CARDINAL LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( former LAW ) ) of LAW requires Member GPE to inform the Commission of any plans to grant or alter aid , so that their compatibility with the common market can be examined .", "The same provision prohibits the Member ORG concerned from putting the proposed measures into effect until the ORG has taken a final decision . Aid measures which are implemented prematurely , and a fortiori those implemented without the Commission having been informed , are unlawful .", "B.CARDINAL.CARDINAL On no account may the impugned provisions result in the challenging of final judicial decisions . Were they to pursue such an aim , they would be in breach of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW by depriving a category of persons of the benefit of final judicial decisions , something which can not be justified in any circumstances .", "It is true that the provisions in question are liable to influence proceedings currently in progress before the ordinary courts . However , they do not make it impossible for the applicants to allege a violation of LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( former LAW ) ) of LAW . The court further observes that the second complaint , in case number CARDINAL , alleges a violation of provisions of the LAW taken in conjunction with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( former ORG CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "The court notes that the aid measures provided for by LAW were implemented without prior notification to the Commission and that the corresponding contributions should therefore in principle be reimbursed . However , that finding does not mean that the provisions currently at issue violate Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( former ORG CARDINAL ) of LAW , as they were notified to the Commission in time and were found to be compatible with the common market .", "It should also be observed that the applicants are not challenging the aid measures as such , only the use to which the contributions designed to fund those measures are put .", "The failure to comply with the requirement to inform the Commission of aid measures in advance does not create an inviolable right to permanent exemption from payment of the contributions in question , including those based on a new instrument whose compatibility with LAW and the LAW is beyond dispute . That instrument would be unconstitutional only if it was itself in breach of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW taken in conjunction with the provisions relied on by the applicants .", "B.CARDINAL The principle of the non - retrospective application of legislation is a safeguard aimed at preventing legal uncertainty . It requires the content of laws to be foreseeable and accessible so that individuals can foresee , to a reasonable degree , the consequences of a particular measure when it is taken .", "Applying a provision retrospectively can be justified only if it is essential in order to achieve an aim which is in the public interest , such as the proper functioning or continuity of the public service . Should it transpire , moreover , that applying a provision retrospectively influences the outcome of CARDINAL or more sets of judicial proceedings in a particular way or prevents the courts from ruling on a particular point of law , the principle in question requires that exceptional circumstances must exist justifying such intervention by the legislature , which restricts , for a particular section of the population , the judicial safeguards afforded to every citizen .", "B.CARDINAL Sections CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Law of DATE do not conflict with the provisions of NORP law on ORG aid , as the legislature has abolished the contributions which were levied on imported animals . They do not create legal uncertainty , as they reproduce the content of the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE on compulsory contributions to the animal health and production fund . While it is true that the impugned provisions apply retrospectively , they do not contain any new provisions which depart from those contained in the above - mentioned royal decree , with the result that they merely consolidate provisions whose scope was known to the persons concerned . The latter could have expected the measure to be retained once the requirement to inform ORG had been met . The impugned PERSON was notified to ORG in accordance with LAW ( former LAW , and the Commission , in a letter of CARDINAL DATE , informed the Government that ' having examined the LAW pursuant to ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL ( former ORG CARDINAL ) of the LAW ' , it had no objection to its introduction .

The fact that it provides for repayment of the difference between those claims and the contributions due on the basis of the provisions at issue can not be regarded as being in breach of LAW No . CARDINAL , as the contributions have not been found to be contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , taken in conjunction particularly with LAW .
