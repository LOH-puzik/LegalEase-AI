THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a national of GPE , born in DATE in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case as they have been submitted by the applicant and as deduced from the case file may be summarised as follows :", "On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE on a flight from GPE via GPE and claimed political asylum on DATE . When interviewed the applicant stated that he had been forced to flee GPE on account of his involvement in GPE d\u2019Ivoire ( hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a student movement . He alleged that he had taken part in a demonstration on DATE . Following the demonstration , he and his friends were taken to a police station where they were beaten and forced to sign a statement that they would abandon their involvement in GPE . On DATE he was sent a summons by the police . According to the applicant he feared that he would be imprisoned and decided to flee the country because he believed his life was in danger . He managed to obtain a passport through the help of a friend in the police force .", "By letter dated DATE the Secretary of ORG notified the applicant that his asylum request had been refused on the grounds that he had not furnished any independent corroboration of either his involvement in ORG or of his claim that he was wanted by the authorities . On DATE the Special Adjudicator dismissed his appeal against the decision of the Secretary of ORG . Although satisfied that the applicant had been a student member of ORG , ORG did not consider the evidence he adduced in support of his fear of persecution to be reliable and doubted the credibility of his asylum claim . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s application for leave to appeal against the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision .", "By letter dated DATE the applicant renewed his application to the Secretary of ORG for political asylum . He relied on a number of letters and statements of third parties which in his view confirmed that he had a well - founded risk of persecution if removed to GPE . By letter dated DATE the Secretary of ORG informed the applicant that he was not prepared to treat the new representations as a fresh application for asylum . He drew the applicant \u2019s attention to the fact that the Government ban on ORG had been lifted on DATE and for that reason the materials which he had submitted in support of his renewed application no longer reflected the current situation in GPE . No appeal lay against this decision of the Secretary of ORG . The Secretary of ORG confirmed this view on DATE in a reply to a further request by the applicant for asylum .", "The applicant sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision . He maintained that the Secretary of ORG had wrongly disregarded evidence which , he claimed , confirmed the dangers to which ORG members were still exposed despite the Government \u2019s apparent conciliatory stance vis - \u00e0 - vis the organisation . He further contended that he should have been permitted to appeal to an independent body against the decision of the Secretary of ORG and have his request examined as a fresh application for asylum .", "On DATE ORG , following a hearing at which the applicant was represented by a lawyer , refused the applicant \u2019s application for leave to apply for judicial review .", "The applicant \u2019s wife , also a national of GPE , joined him in GPE on DATE and a daughter was born to them on DATE . The applicant \u2019s wife and daughter are also subject to removal directions ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
