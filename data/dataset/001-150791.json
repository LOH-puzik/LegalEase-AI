The report noted that the medical examinations of the applicant of DATE and DATE had revealed some injuries which had been inflicted in unestablished circumstances ( for more details see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . It was decided that the internal investigation be considered complete , the conclusion being that it had not established any evidence to support the applicant \u2019s complaints .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG issued another ruling refusing the institution of criminal proceedings \u2012 this time against the police officers of ORG , who had been involved in the applicant \u2019s apprehension and the subsequent investigative measures \u2012 for the lack of corpus delicti in their actions . The officers submitted that the applicant and his accomplices had manifested malicious disobedience to the orders of the police on DATE . As a result , \u201c measures of physical intervention and ... handcuffing \u201d had been applied to them . Furthermore , according to the police ORG statements , the detainees had made their confessions voluntarily .

On DATE ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings against the NORP police officers , for the lack of corpus delicti in their actions . The prosecutor noted that the officers in question had denied the veracity of the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment . Furthermore , it appeared that the applicant himself had eventually retracted his complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG also refused to institute criminal proceedings against the Brovary police as regards the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention in the local ORG . The decision was based on the explanations of the respective police officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant refused the services of the lawyer retained by his parents and asked ORG to allow his parents time to find a new lawyer for him .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG appointed a free lawyer for the applicant , since his parents had not retained a new lawyer for him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instructed the GPE and ORG to investigate the applicant \u2019s complaints of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined by a doctor , who recorded the absence of any injuries , apart from some old scars on both forearms . No further details concerning this examination are available .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant underwent another medical examination which revealed bruises on his buttocks measuring QUANTITY and QUANTITY respectively , as well as abrasions on his wrists caused by handcuffs . Another bruise measuring QUANTITY was recorded ( the copy of the report in the case file is illegible in this respect ; nor is it possible to read where that bruise was located ) . It is not clear in what circumstances and where that examination was carried out . It has not been commented on by any of the parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers in the light of their statements denying the veracity of the applicant \u2019s complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Office quashed the aforementioned ruling as premature and superficial . It criticised the prosecutor \u2019s failure to clarify when and on what grounds the applicant had been taken to ORG before his further transfer to ORG , when he had been detained in the Brovary ITT , which of the police officers had been assigned to him and when . Furthermore , it observed that it was essential to question all the doctors who had examined the applicant and had provided him with medical assistance . According to the applicant , it was after his detention in ORG that he had requested medical assistance . It was also necessary to analyse all the records pertaining to the ambulance calls made for the applicant , as well as the report on his initial medical examination in the Brovary ITT . Lastly , the applicant \u2019s complaints concerning the refusal to allow a lawyer to see him warranted investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a senior officer in the NORP police department issued a memo noting that he had visited the Brovary ITT , where he had consulted the medical examination and assistance journal . CARDINAL records , those of DATE and DATE , concerned the applicant . The ambulance doctor had been questioned . She had recognised her signature next to the record of DATE and had verbally explained that she had provided the applicant with the assistance documented in the record . However , she had refused to make any written statements . The memo in question did not contain any further details as to the applicant \u2019s condition on DATE or what medical assistance had been provided to him ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty on CARDINAL counts of aggravated theft and robbery and sentenced him to CARDINAL half GPE imprisonment , as well as confiscation of all his personal property . The confiscated property included a house and a car which had been purchased by the applicant \u2019s parents , but which the court considered to have been bought using the revenue from his criminal activities . The applicant was acquitted of the charges of banditry , money laundering , hooliganism and illegal arms handling . The court noted that the applicant had cooperated with the investigation . At the court hearing , the applicant commented on CARDINAL of the charges against him : he denied his participation in CARDINAL episode of theft and CARDINAL episode of robbery and submitted that he had earlier confessed to those CARDINAL episodes under duress . The court dismissed that allegation as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , submitting that he had voluntarily confessed to the criminal offences in question and had shown remorse . Referring to his cooperation with the investigation , as well as the fact that he had a child who was a minor , the applicant sought mitigation of his sentence . He also contested the confiscation - related part of the verdict .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . He submitted that the lower courts\u2019 decisions should be quashed as being contrary to LAW ( right to legal assistance \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW ( listing grounds for the annulment of a judgment \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant contended that he had not committed the crimes of which he had been found guilty and that he had incriminated himself after succumbing to \u201c psycho - physical influence and deception by the police \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal on points of law . As to his submission on the ostensibly involuntary nature of his confessions , ORG noted that the first - instance court had not established any facts showing any coercion of the applicant and he had not disputed that in his appeal . ORG furthermore observed that the applicant \u2019s allegation of breach of the criminal procedural legislation were too vague .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote to the applicant stating that it had instructed ORG to investigate his complaints of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG also wrote to the applicant stating that it had already dismissed his complaints , namely on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The prosecutor also referred to a similar ruling by ORG of DATE ( the case file before the ORG does not contain a copy of the quoted ruling and there is no information about its contents ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
