NORP The applicant was born in DATE in GPE , in GPE ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) , and lives in GPE in the GPE of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE he was arrested by the NORP police at his place of residence in GPE and taken to ORG in GPE , where he was presented with a bill of indictment stating that he represented a threat to NORP State Security . He alleges that he was then taken to GPE by NORP officials . By his own account , he has never instituted proceedings against the NORP authorities in respect of those events .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submits that he was arbitrarily detained and tortured in GPE in the LOC of ORG , from DATE to DATE , on the orders of PERSON , the then Minister of the Interior . He submits that he was subjected to the so - called \u201c roast chicken \u201d position throughout the entire period of detention and deprived of his basic physiological needs , particularly sleep ; he was also beaten on the soles of his feet with a baseball bat and struck all over his body with telephone cords .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submits that he suffers from a series of physical and psychological injuries and disorders .", "CARDINAL . After having been subjected to the alleged torture in GPE in DATE , the applicant fled that country in DATE and took refuge in GPE , where he applied for asylum in DATE . The applicant has since been living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities granted the applicant asylum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having learnt that PERSON was being treated in a NORP hospital , the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against him with ORG for the Republic and GPE ( \u201c the Principal Public Prosecutor \u201d ) , for severe bodily injury , illegal confinement , insults , causing danger to health , coercion and abuse of authority . The applicant applied to join these proceedings as a civil party seeking damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transmitted to the head of the security police , by internal mail , a request to \u201c attempt to locate and identify the accused individual , who [ was ] supposedly hospitalised in ORG , for heart surgery \u201d and \u201c if possible , to arrest him and bring him before an investigating judge \u201d . On receipt of this request , the police immediately contacted the hospital , which informed them that PERSON had indeed been a patient there , but that he had already left the hospital on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made an order discontinuing the proceedings on the grounds that PERSON had left GPE and that the police had been unable to arrest him . This decision to discontinue the proceedings was not challenged by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By his own account , on DATE the applicant asked a NORP lawyer to represent him with a view to bringing a civil action for compensation against PERSON and GPE . On DATE the lawyer informed the applicant that this type of action had never been successful and advised him not to lodge such a claim . It was allegedly impossible to lodge a civil action of this sort in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a writ dated DATE , the applicant lodged a claim for damages with ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) against GPE and against PERSON He claimed MONEY ( CHF ) , with PERCENT interest from DATE , as compensation in respect of the non - pecuniary damage arising from the acts of torture to which he had allegedly been subjected . The applicant submitted that the conditions for reparation of non - pecuniary damage provided for by Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW , applicable under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( PERSON f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur le droit international priv\u00e9 , the ORG , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , had been met .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing was held before ORG ; neither of the defendants was in attendance or represented .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG declared the claim inadmissible on the grounds that it lacked territorial jurisdiction . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c With regard to an action in tort based on the unlawful acts that were allegedly committed in GPE by the defendants , to the claimant \u2019s detriment , the NORP courts do not have territorial jurisdiction under international law to examine the complaint , given that the defendants are not domiciled or habitually resident in GPE , and given also that no illegal act or detrimental outcome occurred in GPE , pursuant to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of the LDIP ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the NORP courts also lacked jurisdiction under the forum of necessity , given the lack of a sufficient connection between , on the one hand , the case and the facts , and , on the other , GPE . In this connection , ORG ruled as follows :", "\u201c All of the acts with regard to whose after - effects the claimant , a NORP national , seeks compensation for non - pecuniary damage , were allegedly inflicted on him , as he submits , in GPE in DATE , within the premises of ORG of the Interior , by ORG and its officials . The mere fact that on account of those acts the claimant applied for and received political asylum in DATE in GPE , where he has since been domiciled , does not , in itself and in the light of current case - law , amount to a sufficient connection enabling a forum of necessity to be established against the defendants in GPE and GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a writ dated DATE , the applicant appealed against that decision before ORG GPE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . His appeal was rejected in a judgment of DATE . After noting that the appellant had shown that he was unable to bring a civil action in GPE , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c As the outcome of the present appeal depends on the immunity from jurisdiction of the respondent parties , the question whether there exists a forum of necessity in the appellant \u2019s place of residence can , however , remain undecided . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG thus held that the respondents enjoyed immunity from jurisdiction , since the acts of torture had been perpetrated in the exercise of sovereign authority ( iure imperii ) and not under private law ( iure gestionis ) . Referring to the judgment delivered by ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . ORG , ORG CARDINAL-XI ) , it further considered that there had been no violation of the applicant \u2019s right of access to a court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG , dated DATE , in which he asked it to rule that the courts of the Republic and the GPE of GPE had territorial jurisdiction and to find that the defendants did not enjoy immunity from jurisdiction . With regard to the jurisdiction of the NORP courts , he argued that the purpose of the introduction of a forum of necessity in section CARDINAL of the LDIP ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had been to avoid denials of justice , especially in cases of political persecution , and that he had provided sufficient evidence that he could not reasonably bring proceedings before a foreign court . As to the immunity from jurisdiction purportedly enjoyed by GPE and PERSON , the applicant submitted that the exercise of public power did not include an entitlement to commit international crimes such as torture . He specified in this regard that the very definition of torture in LAW and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of DATE ( hereafter : \u201c the Convention against Torture \u201d ; see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) ruled out any immunity . Lastly , he referred , in very general terms , to LAW relating to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the reasoning of which was notified to the applicant on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal . Reiterating the reasoning in the first - instance judgment , ORG considered that the NORP courts did not in any event have territorial jurisdiction . The relevant passages of ORG judgment read as follows :", "\u201c It must first be considered whether the NORP courts have jurisdiction to examine the action .", "CARDINAL As GPE is not a party to LAW on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( ORG , RS CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , there exists no convention rule between the CARDINAL GPE governing the question of forum , which must therefore be examined in the light of the ORG ( sections PERSON ) and CARDINAL ) LDIP ) .", "CARDINAL In this instance , the jurisdiction of the NORP authorities can not be derived from the general rule concerning the international jurisdiction of the ORG of domicile of the defendant contained in section CARDINAL of the LDIP , since the respondents are not domiciled in GPE . The cantonal court was , moreover , right in finding that the criteria , set out in section CARDINAL of the ORG , for establishing jurisdiction over actions in respect of wrongful acts were not met in so far as the defendants had neither their domicile nor their place of habitual residence or business in GPE ( section CARDINAL ) PERSON ) , and neither the wrongful act nor the resultant injury occurred in GPE ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) LDIP ) .", "CARDINAL In the absence of an ordinary forum , the problem must be addressed under LAW of the ORG , which concerns the forum of necessity ... Under the latter provision , where no forum is provided for in GPE by the ORG and where proceedings in another country prove impossible or one can not reasonable require that they be brought in that country , the NORP judicial or administrative authorities of the locality with which the case has a sufficient connection have jurisdiction .", "The application of this rule for assigning jurisdiction thus calls for CARDINAL cumulative conditions to be met : firstly , the NORP authorities do not have jurisdiction under another provision ; secondly , legal proceedings in another country are impossible or can not reasonably be required ; and , thirdly , the case in question has a sufficient connection with GPE . In the present case , the first condition is indisputably fulfilled . Fulfilment of the second condition appears more problematic , but in the light of the third condition , which merits more extensive discussion , it is not necessary to elaborate further on this question .", "CARDINAL LAW of the ORG , which must be interpreted restrictively ... represents a safety valve , intended to avoid denials of justice ... in the event of a negative conflict of jurisdiction .", "In this connection , ORG , in its authoritative interpretation of this provision , noted that \u201c there are cases that have such a tenuous connection with GPE that it is not appropriate to set in motion the entire judicial system in order to resolve them . However , section CARDINAL lays down an exception to this principle . The NORP authorities must assume jurisdiction even in cases where the connection with our country is very tenuous , where it is impossible to bring proceedings or to lodge an appeal abroad . It is for the claimant or the appellant to demonstrate this impossibility . Where this evidence has been adduced , jurisdiction reverts to the authority of the locality with which the case has a sufficient connection . Where there are several competing fora in GPE , it is the first authority before which an action is brought that has jurisdiction . Clearly , the impossibility of bringing and pursuing proceedings abroad can only be examined in the light of the tangible circumstances and of the possible consequences for the individual concerned in the particular case ; it will ultimately be for the court to recognise , or not , its jurisdiction \u201d .... .", "Although section CARDINAL ORG may thus seem innately paradoxical in so far as proceedings for which there is no basis for connection with an ordinary forum in GPE are , ipso facto , lacking in any particular connection with this country , in such a way that determining a \u201c sufficient connection \u201d may prove challenging , and the aim pursued by DATE to prevent a formal denial of justice \u2013 difficult to achieve , this legal provision has not in practice been without effect ; the cantonal courts in particular have recognised its applicability in the areas of family law , inheritance and proceedings on debt - enforcement and bankruptcy ... .", "Moreover , legal writers have noted that a subsidiary forum must necessarily be recognised in situations of political persecution ... However , neither the case - law nor legal opinion provide much in the way of guidance concerning civil actions for compensation in respect of damage resulting from crimes against humanity , life and physical integrity , committed abroad , by foreign perpetrators .", "CARDINAL That being stated , it is necessary to consider what is meant by \u201c case \u201d [ \u201c cause \u201d in the NORP version ] in section CARDINAL LDIP .", "It is settled case - law that the law must , in the first instance , be interpreted literally . An interpretation which deviates from the literal meaning of a text expressed in clear terms is allowable only where there are objective reasons for considering that the text fails to convey the true meaning of the provision concerned . Such reasons may derive from the drafting history , from the aim and sense of the provision concerned and from the structure and layout of the law . If the text is not absolutely clear , if it can be interpreted variously , the approach must be to seek out the true import of the provision having regard to all relevant factors , including in particular the drafting history , the intention pursued by the rule , the spirit and values on which it is based or again its relationship with other legal provisions . ORG does not favour any CARDINAL method of interpretation but adopts a pragmatic plurality in its search for the true meaning of the rule ; in particular , it takes as a basis a literal understanding of the text only where this offers , with no ambiguity , a solution that is substantively just ( ORG CARDINAL III CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , V CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL.CARDINAL ; CARDINAL III CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL and the judgments cited therein ) .", "In itself , the meaning to be attributed to the term \u201c cause \u201d is uncertain in the sense that it does not have a general definition in the laws of civil procedure of the LANGUAGE - speaking cantons ( see , however , Bertossa / Gaillard / Guyet/ Schmidt , PERSON procedure civile genevoise , vol . I , GPE DATE , n.CARDINAL ad LAW , concerning the force of res judicata , in which the authors consider that identical claims , in terms of their content , based on the same arguments and the same combination of alleged facts , constitute the objective limit of res judicata ; that identity is determined by the complete set of legal considerations which formed part of the first application and were adjudicated upon ; this was how \u201c cause \u201d was to be understood in former Article CARDINAL ) ; the alleged facts of the case determine an overall situation [ \u201c ORG \u201d , \u201c PERSON \u201d ] which it is for the court to assess ) but would appear to equate to \u201c proc\u00e9dure \u201d or \u201c demande en justice \u201d or in NORP to \u201c NORP \u201d , \u201c Rechtssache \u201d , \u201c Prozess \u201d , \u201c GPE \u201d , \u201c causa litigandi \u201d or \u201c ORG \u201d . At all events , \u201c cause \u201d is not the literal and unambiguous translation of the terms \u201c ORG \u201d or \u201c fattispecie \u201d used in the NORP and NORP versions of section CARDINAL of the LDIP . It should be borne in mind , at this point , that the latter terms are usually translated in NORP as \u201c \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u201d or \u201c expos\u00e9 des faits \u201d or \u201c \u00e9tat des faits \u201d .", "As the versions of the law drafted in the CARDINAL official languages have the same standing , the question arises whether the difference between the NORP wording and that of the other CARDINAL versions results from an error in the legislative process , from a difference in meaning which becomes apparent only in the context of specific cases according to a varying understanding of the legal provision in each of the languages , or , lastly , from a linguistic difference attributable either to the non - translatability knowingly taken into account in the drafting or to uncertainty on the part of the legislator as to the meaning to be conveyed ( see PERSON , PERSON mehrsprachiger PERSON , in ORG pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au ORG international de droit compar\u00e9 , GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL et seq . , especially p. CARDINAL s. ) .", "It seems clear that the first of these possibilities can be ruled out . To distinguish between the second and third possibilities the understanding of the term \u201c cause \u201d in legal NORP terminology must be considered . In this regard , the \u201c cause \u201d of the action is the basis of the claim [ \u201c base de la pr\u00e9tention \u201d ] ( \u2018 ORG \u201d rather than \u201c ORG \u201d ) , though it should be noted that the legal writers are in some disagreement as to the content and scope of that basis . Some argue that the \u201c cause \u201d must be seen as a legal concept allowing the claim to be defined , while for others the \u201c cause \u201d comes down to a set of facts giving rise to the legal issues in debate or the legal interest invoked ( see PERSON / Guinchard , ORG civile , CARDINALth edition , GPE DATE , n. CARDINAL p. CARDINAL et seq . , who conclude that the \u201c cause \u201d of the action is constituted by a legally characterised set of facts ) .", "In the case in point , it must be acknowledged that a comparison with the NORP and NORP versions assists in the interpretation of the NORP text , supporting the view that the term \u201c cause \u201d should be assigned the restricted meaning of \u201c set of facts \u201d or , to take a literal translation of \u201c PERSON \u201d and \u201c fattispeccie \u201d , \u201c expos\u00e9 \u201d or \u201c \u00e9tat de faits \u201d and not \u201c proc\u00e9dure \u201d . In other words , it is the \u201c cause \u201d \u2013 which concerns the set of facts and the legal argumentation \u2013 rather than the person of the applicant which must have a sufficient connection with GPE .", "In the present case , however , the claimant complains of acts of torture that were allegedly committed in GPE , by NORP resident in GPE , against a NORP residing in GPE . All of the specific features of the case come back to GPE , except for the fact of residence in GPE at the relevant time . The facts of the case thus have no connection with GPE , so that the question of whether or not the link with this country is sufficient does not arise . In those circumstances , it is not possible to recognise the jurisdiction of the NORP courts , short of disregarding the clear text of s[ection ] CARDINAL of the LDIP [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] . The fact that the claimant then chose to come to GPE can not change anything , since it is a fact subsequent to the events of the case and , moreover , does not form part of it .", "CARDINAL . Since the absence of a sufficient connection between the facts of the case and GPE suffices to establish the NORP courts\u2019 lack of jurisdiction , the appeal must be dismissed , without it being necessary to examine the issue of immunity from jurisdiction .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG made submissions before the Grand Chamber describing the action taken by GPE after the fall of the regime in DATE in order to establish a new democracy and a political system based on respect for human rights and the rule of law . They considered that the possibility of submitting complaints to the newly established courts was the most direct and \u201c natural \u201d means of promoting reconciliation , re - establishing social peace and improving prevention , whilst also respecting the steps taken to repair the harm done to the victims . In this context , the Government referred to LAW of DATE , worded as follows :", "\u201c The ORG commits to implementing the transitional justice system in all areas within the timeline set by the related legislation . In this regard , no claim in respect of the non - retrospective nature of laws , or the existence of a previous amnesty or pardon , or the binding force of double jeopardy , or the statute of limitations or prescription of the crime or punishment , shall be admitted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government observed that the constituent elements of transitional justice had already been set out in \u201c Organic Law no . DATE of DATE , on the introduction of transitional justice and related organisational arrangements \u201d , enacted by ORG on DATE and published in ORG on DATE . The respondent Government specified that Part III of Title I covered \u201c Accountability and criminal liability \u201d , in order to \u201c prevent impunity and ensure that offenders do not escape punishment \u201d ( section CARDINAL ) . Section CARDINAL provided for the establishment of specialised divisions in the courts of first instance , composed of judges who would receive special training in transitional justice . They \u201c [ would ] rule on cases relating to serious violations of human rights \u201d , including torture ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) ) , which DATE in accordance with section DATE were not subject to statutory limitation .", "CARDINAL . The Government explained that Part IV of Title I focused more specifically on \u201c Reparation and Rehabilitation \u201d ( sections CARDINAL ) . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL :", "\u201c [ CARDINAL compensation of victims of violations is a right guaranteed by law and the ORG shall offer every form of sufficient , effective redress commensurate with the extent of the violations committed and the individual situation of each victim . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government further added that LAW of the law established a \u201c Truth and ORG \u201d ( ORG ) , which was an independent body whose members were chosen by ORG from among public officials known for their neutrality , impartiality and competence ( sections CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of LAW ) . Under section CARDINAL , the ORG \u2019s work was to cover the entire period from DATE to DATE , the date of the law \u2019s promulgation . The duration of the ORG \u2019s work was limited to DATE , starting from the date of appointment of its members ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the Government informed the ORG that , according to information obtained by it from ORG in GPE , persons who considered themselves victims of the former regime had until DATE to apply to the ORG . ORG was currently dealing with CARDINAL cases . In this capacity , it was holding hearings which , since DATE , had also been held in public . According to the information received , it was foreseen that selected cases would be transmitted to the courts at a later stage in the investigation process .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has not contested these submissions by ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .
