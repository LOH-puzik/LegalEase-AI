The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has lived in a flat in a residential quarter of GPE since DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE ORG has allowed licensed LOC such as bars , pubs and discotheques to open in the vicinity of her home , making it impossible for people living in the area to sleep .", "CARDINAL . Local residents first complained about vandalism and noise in the locality before DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In view of the problems caused by the noise , ORG resolved on DATE not to permit any more night clubs to open in the area . However , the resolution was never implemented and new licences were granted .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG commissioned a report by an expert . The expert found that the noise levels were unacceptable and exceeded permitted levels . At TIME on DATE they were in excess of CARDINAL dBA Leq ( decibels ) , ranging from CARDINAL to CARDINAL LOC .", "CARDINAL . In a report of CARDINAL DATE the police informed ORG that nightclubs and discotheques in the sector in which the applicant lived did not systematically close on time . They said that they were able to confirm that the local ORG complaints were founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG approved a new bylaw on noise and vibrations , which was published on DATE in ORG province . LAW bylaw lays down that in a family residential area ( such as the one in which the applicant lives ) external noise levels were not to exceed CARDINAL dBA Leq TIME of the bylaw defines \u201c acoustically saturated zones \u201d as areas in which the large number of establishments , activity of the people frequenting them and passing traffic expose local residents to high noise levels and cause them serious disturbance .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the bylaw specified the conditions that had to be satisfied for an area to be designated an \u201c acoustically saturated zone \u201d ( zona ac\u00fasticamente saturada ) and the consequences of designation , which included a ban on new activities ( such as nightclubs and discotheques ) that led to acoustic saturation .", "CARDINAL . Following a resolution of ORG sitting in plenary session on DATE , which was published in ORG of the GPE province on DATE , the area in which the applicant lived was designated an acoustically saturated zone .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , on DATE ORG granted a licence for a discotheque to be opened in the building she lived in . The licence was subsequently declared invalid by a judgment of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to determine whether the area should be designated an acoustically saturated zone , ORG took various sound - level readings to monitor acoustic pollution there . In each of its reports the ORG laboratory indicated that the noise levels exceeded those permitted by the bylaw .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was exasperated by the situation , which prevented her from sleeping and resting and caused her insomnia and serious health problems . On DATE she lodged a preliminary claim with ORG in which she relied on LAW ( right to life and to physical integrity ) and LAW ( right to the privacy and inviolability of the home ) . She sought MONEY ( MONEY ) for the damage she had sustained and the cost of installing double glazing .", "CARDINAL . Having received no reply from the authorities and in accordance with LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the applicant lodged an application for judicial review with ORG on DATE , alleging a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged its written observations . It submitted that the application was premature and should be declared inadmissible , as the ORG could still find a solution . This preliminary objection was dismissed in a decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the representative of state council \u2019s office argued that the court should find in favour of the applicant . He considered that there had been a violation of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL LAW and that the applicant \u2019s claim for damages was justified .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE , delivered after an adversarial hearing in public , ORG dismissed the application for judicial review . It found that the readings had been taken in the entrance hall to the building , not in the applicant \u2019s flat , and could not entail a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL LAW ; it also noted that the medical expert \u2019s report stated only that the applicant had been receiving treatment for insomnia for DATE , without indicating the length of or reason for such treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with ORG . Relying on Articles CARDINAL ( equality ) and CARDINAL ( right to a fair hearing ) of the LAW , she complained that ORG had not given sufficient reasons in its judgment or assessed the evidence . She also complained under LAW and CARDINAL LAW of a violation of her rights to life , physical and mental integrity , privacy and the inviolability of the home .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the amparo appeal admissible and invited the applicant , the representative of state council \u2019s office and ORG to submit their observations . On DATE , it summoned the parties to a hearing on the merits on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE , which was attended by all the parties , the applicant repeated her factual and legal submissions , stressing that there had been a violation of her fundamental rights .", "CARDINAL . ORG raised a number of preliminary objections . It further submitted that the appeal was confined to the decision of ORG . With regard to the alleged violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL LAW , it stated that there was no evidence of noise levels inside the applicant \u2019s home and that the authority concerned should not bear sole responsibility for the noise to which the applicant had allegedly been exposed , as it had very limited means at its disposal to combat it .", "CARDINAL . The representative of state council \u2019s office agreed with the applicant that there had been a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL LAW . He argued that the amparo appeal should be regarded as hybrid , since it both accused ORG of failing to defend the fundamental rights set out in LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW and challenged the Valencia High Court of ORG \u2019s decision , alleging a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW also .", "CARDINAL . As regards the violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL LAW , the representative of state council \u2019s office said that , in the light of the judgments of ORG , in particular in the case of PERSON NORP v. GPE , there had been a violation of the applicant \u2019s right to the inviolability of her home , as her home environment had been rendered unfit for ordinary everyday living . On the basis of the ORG \u2019s case - law , he sought a broader definition of the constitutional concept of the \u201c home \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As regards noise levels inside the applicant \u2019s home , the representative of state council \u2019s office considered that the burden of proof had been reversed , as it was clear in the instant case that officials from ORG had confirmed on a number of occasions that the maximum permitted noise levels were being exceeded . Consequently , he did not consider it necessary to require such proof from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was served on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal after also dismissing ORG preliminary objections . It ruled that the amparo appeal was hybrid in nature , that is to say that it alleged a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL LAW by ORG and a breach of ORG DATE LAW by ORG .", "CARDINAL . As regards the alleged violation of ORG DATE , ORG began by noting that it was not entitled to substitute ORG assessment of the evidence with its own . As to the applicant \u2019s allegation that the judgment did not contain sufficient reasons , it noted that ORG decision could not be regarded as arbitrary or unreasonable . It further observed that the applicant had not identified the decisions on which she relied in alleging discrimination . Thus , there was no evidence of any violation of ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the alleged violation of ORG CARDINAL ( right to life and physical integrity ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( right to privacy and to the inviolability of the home ) of the LAW , ORG referred to the decisions in which ORG had held that , in cases of exceptional gravity , repeated damage to the environment could infringe the right to respect for private and family life under LAW , even if did not endanger health . ORG held , however :", "\u201c ... there may only be a violation of LAW if the level of acoustic saturation to which a person is exposed as a result of an act or omission of a public authority causes serious and immediate damage to his or her health . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG found that that test had not been satisfied in the case before it and pointed out :", "\u201c ... even though the appellant maintains that the noise levels to which she was exposed turned her into an insomniac , the only evidence she has adduced is a certificate stating that she was admitted to hospital and saw a doctor , without any indication of the period for which she had been suffering from lack of sleep or the cause thereof . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court found that the applicant had not established a direct link between the noise and the damage she had sustained .", "CARDINAL . As to the allegation of a violation of LAW , the Constitutional Court further found that she had not established the existence of a nuisance in her home that amounted to a violation of the constitutional provision . It stated :", "\u201c ... the appellant has confined herself to making a general complaint by stating that the origin of the noise was diffuse and not restricted to a single source of production , and that the acoustic saturation resulted from a combination of noises . ... On the contrary , her entire case is based on a few sound - level readings taken inside her home which gave disparate results ... and do not establish that there has been a violation of the right relied on . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . By way of conclusion , ORG dismissed the amparo appeal on the following ground :", "\u201c Consequently , as regards the alleged violation of the rights relied on the amparo appeal must be dismissed , as the appellant has failed to prove the existence of a genuine effective breach of fundamental rights attributable to ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . That judgment was delivered by ORG sitting as a full court . However , CARDINAL judges expressed concurring opinions . The first said that the judgment restricted the free development of the personality at home . He considered that the conditions that had to be satisfied for there to be a violation of fundamental rights in the case under consideration were unreasonable and he defended the need to speak of a triple layer of constitutional protection , ranging from the right to physical and moral integrity ( LAW ) to an environment that was suitable for personal development ( LAW ) , via the right to privacy in the home ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The second judge pointed out in his concurring opinion that there was a preliminary problem that had not been adequately dealt with , namely the degree to which the relevant authority was required to provide the requested protection . Determining the extent of that obligation was a prerequisite to establishing whether or not there existed a causal link between the authority \u2019s failure to act and the alleged violation . The authorities were obliged to exercise their power when the breach of the fundamental rights attained a certain level of gravity .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the LAW are as follows :", "\u201c The provisions relating to the fundamental rights and freedoms recognised under LAW shall be construed in accordance with LAW and the international treaties and agreements which GPE has ratified in that sphere . \u201d", "\u201c Everyone shall have the right to life and to physical and mental integrity . ... \u201d", "\u201c The home shall be inviolable . ... \u201d", "\u201c Everyone shall have the right to enjoy an environment suitable for personal development and the duty to preserve it .", "... \u201d", "\u201c Every citizen shall be entitled to seek protection of the freedoms and rights recognised in LAW by bringing an action in the ordinary courts under a procedure designed to ensure priority and expedition and , in appropriate cases , by an appeal ( recurso de amparo ) to LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL , which was repealed by LAW of DATE ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , read as follows :", "\u201c ...

Zones that are acoustically saturated by additional causes are areas or places in which the large number of establishments , activity of the people frequenting them and passing traffic expose local residents to high noise levels and cause them serious disturbance .", "CARDINAL . NORP An area may be designated an acoustically saturated zone ( ORG ) if , though individual activities are compliant with the levels set out in this bylaw , the level of disturbance due to external noise as referred to in DATE is exceeded twice - weekly in consecutive DATE , or CARDINAL times intermittently over a period of DATE , and exceeds PERCENT ( A ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of the report drawn up by PERSON , a professor of applied physics , on the sound - level readings taken in the district in which the applicant lived in GPE read as follows :", "\u201c The results obtained from measurements taken by ORG acoustic laboratory over a period of DATE in the said area and measurements taken by other bodies showed that ambient noise levels in this area , in particular at TIME and DATE ( especially TIME ) are extremely high . At these periods in the area concerned the TIME equivalent sound levels ( PERSON ) frequently exceed CARDINAL dB ( A ) and the maximum corresponding levels exceed PERCENT ( A ) .", "As a result , we can say that noise levels in dwellings in this urban area are intolerably high at TIME - time and , consequently , detrimental to the health and well - being of the residents .", "This conclusion is based on the fact that , even with the windows closed ( including in the height of DATE ) , indoor noise levels are very high . It should be noted that under the current regulations ( building norm FAC ) the minimum insulation requirement for the frontage of buildings is CARDINAL dB ( A ) . In practice , that figure is never attained and is generally in the region of PERCENT ( A ) .", "Consequently , in these circumstances , night - time noise levels inside the dwellings , for example in bedrooms overlooking the street , can be estimated at in the region of PERCENT ( A ) , with maximum levels reaching PERCENT ( A ) . We would point out that this is a general estimate and is made without the need for specific measurements to be taken inside the dwellings concerned .", "We should explain here that the difference CARDINAL ) is enormous . Thus , an increase from CARDINAL dB ( A ) does not represent a slight increase in noise ( as a layman might think ) but the doubling in intensity of the corresponding noise .
