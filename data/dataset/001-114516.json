The ORG further recommended that the NORP authorities remind the members of the special intervention units that all forms of ill - treatment against detainees ( including verbal provocation and insults ) are unacceptable and are to be severely sanctioned , and that the use of force in order to control violent and/or recalcitrant prisoners must be limited to occasions when it is strictly necessary ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
