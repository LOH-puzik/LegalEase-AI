On DATE ORG granted interim custody in respect of PERSON to the respondent , while the interim access order of DATE remained in force as regards the applicant \u2019s contact with her daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG recommended that custody be granted to the respondent , while the applicant \u2019s access rights were to be limited to TIME every Friday , at FAC . The access ruling was subject to change and extension once the emotional and caring links between the applicant and her daughter had been restored . The ORG \u2019s experts pointed out that the applicant had not contacted them in order to be able to see PERSON , and offered professional assistance to facilitate contact between the mother and child , as well as with the respondent in order to motivate PERSON to maintain contact with the applicant . They noted that the respondent had inquired about the applicant \u2019s interest in seeing PERSON and had been allowing regular visits to PERSON by her older stepbrother ( the applicant \u2019s son ) .", "CARDINAL .

Despite the ORG \u2019s warning about the need to take appropriate steps to prepare PERSON for the forthcoming visits after a lengthy absence of care and contact between them , the applicant allegedly insisted on having contact with PERSON starting from DATE", "CARDINAL . It would appear that since CARDINAL DATE the applicant has been meeting with PERSON regularly . However , ORG experts reported that the applicant was not really aware that a mother \u2019s absence could have a profound impact on her daughter and could alienate her daughter \u2019s affection towards her . While she insisted on emotional reciprocation from her daughter , the contact was a significant source of stress for the child , who cried , hid behind her father , persistently avoided to look at her mother , refused the applicant \u2019s gifts and asserted that she had been beaten by her . Nevertheless , the applicant systematically accused the respondent of abusing his position as the parent with interim custody and of inculcating PERSON \u2019s attitude towards her .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also reported a severely dysfunctional parental relationship and an ambivalent approach on the part of the respondent to the importance of PERSON \u2019s contact with her mother . In order to improve the parental and parent - child relationships , on DATE the Centre adopted of its own motion a decision on corrective monitoring of the parties\u2019 exercise of parental rights by ORG , for DATE . The ORG was supposed to work with the parents to help them acquire a better understanding of their parental rights and responsibilities , as well as of the needs of their daughter . After they had undergone this therapy , the ORG was to evaluate changes in their attitudes and approaches in exercising parental roles , as well as to assess the need for further measures for the protection of PERSON \u2019s rights . The respondent was also supposed to bring PERSON regularly to ORG , which would work on improving her motivation in order to try to salvage her contact with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings against PERSON , requesting that he be deprived of his parental rights ( \u201c roditeljsko pravo \u201d ) because of his behaviour in respect of their daughter . It would appear that PERSON lodged the same claim against the applicant and that the competent court eventually joined the CARDINAL proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the course of those proceedings , on DATE the applicant sought an interim injunction against domestic violence . She claimed that PERSON had threatened her , which is why she was afraid to attend the scheduled meetings with her daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court granted her request and issued an interim measure prohibiting PERSON from approaching or further disturbing the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG However , on DATE ORG quashed this interim measure on appeal and returned the case for reconsideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court decided to separate the proceedings for protection against domestic violence from those for deprivation of parental rights .", "CARDINAL . As regards the proceedings for protection against domestic violence , on DATE ORG in GPE granted an injunction against domestic violence , i. e. \u201c insulting or any other insolent , unscrupulous or malevolent behaviour \u201d as defined in the LAW . In particular , it banned the respondent from disturbing the applicant for DATE , as well as from coming within QUANTITY of her and her place of residence , other than when necessary to allow contact between the applicant and the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the former part of this decision , quashed the latter due to the lack of valid and convincing reasons and remitted it for re - examination .", "CARDINAL .
