The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant , who had just turned DATE , and a CARDINAL-year - old boy called \u201c GPE \u201d , approached an CARDINAL-year - old woman in the street . The applicant attempted to take the woman 's bag , causing her to fall to the ground and fracture her left arm . The applicant ran away and GPE stayed with the victim . The applicant was charged with attempted robbery . His defence was that he had acted under duress , having been threatened by GPE", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in connection with other offences , he was given a DATE supervision order and was remanded to the care of the local authority and placed with foster parents .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG , looking at the applicant 's offending history , which included offences of robbery , burglary , theft and arson , considered that it might be appropriate to impose a custodial sentence if he were convicted of the attempted robbery , and committed him for trial in ORG . After committal , the applicant 's legal representatives obtained CARDINAL expert reports . The first report was prepared by PERSON , an adolescent forensic psychiatrist , who was able to talk to the applicant for TIME in DATE before the latter terminated the interview . The applicant was also seen by PERSON , a consultant clinical psychologist , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his report PERSON observed , inter alia :", "\u201c Mental state examination", "[ The applicant ] sat motionless in the chair throughout my brief interview . He appeared distracted and frequently asked me to repeat my questioning claiming that he could not understand me . He appeared defensive when questioned regarding family circumstances and was vague about his past schooling . He appeared reluctant to discuss his offending behaviour , asking me what point was there discussing it with me .", "Ultimately , after repeating the statement that he was bored and wanted to eat he informed me that he would not answer any more questions and wanted to leave . Since it was clear that he was resistant to further questioning or probing I consented to his wish .", "Impression", "It has been extremely difficult to form a detailed impression of this young man 's problems and needs by virtue of his unwillingness to enter into the assessment process and a failure to obtain collateral information regarding his personal development and family background .", "It is evident from the limited information available that [ the applicant ] has exhibited a behaviour disturbance from an early age which has resulted in restricted academic progress and alienation from his peers . ... [ The applicant 's ] persistent pattern of disruptive and socially inappropriate behaviour would be consistent with a diagnosis of conduct disorder of the unsocialised type .", "It would appear from PERSON psychological report ... that [ the applicant ] has a significant degree of learning difficulties . He has a full scale IQ of CARDINAL ( CARDINAL.CARDINALnd centile ) , a verbal IQ of CARDINAL ( CARDINALst centile ) and a performance IQ of CARDINAL ( CARDINAL.CARDINALst centile ) . These scores would be consistent with his academic underachievement and could be viewed as a consequence of his disrupted schooling . PERSON notes that with [ the applicant 's ] cognitive abilities being more consistent with a child of CARDINAL rather than CARDINAL , his ' ability to reason is noticeably restricted ' . ...", "It is clear that [ the applicant ] has complex needs which should ideally be addressed under the provisions of a care order for the foreseeable future . ...", "It is conceivable that , if a coordinated package of care fails to meet [ the applicant 's ] complex educational and emotional needs , he will potentially pose a high risk of reoffending . At this time however I believe that a long term care order , with a stable foster placement and an appropriate educational package should be considered if an alternative to a custodial sentence were felt viable .", "Recommendations", "CARDINAL . It is difficult to assess issues concerning [ the applicant 's ] fitness to plead since his discussion of the offence with me was limited . However , based on the information available to me and the findings of the psychological testing I would conclude that [ the applicant ] on balance was aware of his actions and that they were wrong . His understanding of their consequences however may have been adversely affected by his learning difficulties and impaired reasoning skills . Overall I would consider that [ the applicant ] is sufficiently capable of entering a plea though obviously the court process would have to be explained carefully in a manner commensurate with his learning difficulties .", "CARDINAL . NORP [ The applicant ] should be placed on a Supervision Order for as long as possible with a plan to address his emotional and educational needs and reduce his offending behaviour .", "CARDINAL . Long - term foster care should in my opinion be considered in preference to a custodial sentence if this were deemed possible .", "CARDINAL . A copy of PERSON report should be forwarded , with her consent , to [ the applicant 's ] school in order to devise an appropriate educational package to meet his complex needs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON 's report , dated DATE , states as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] was seen in the company of his Youth Justice Worker in the outpatient department . He was friendly and cooperative with a reasonable attention span in the individual setting . He generally understood what was required of him although some explanations required repetition and he occasionally needed encouragement to persevere . ...", "[ The applicant ] was given the WISC - III [ Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - CARDINALrd edition ) , which looks at the development of reasoning skills as applied to both verbal and non verbal problem solving . ... [ O]verall , [ the applicant ] is presenting with a significant degree of learning delay . His Verbal IQ is slightly higher than his Performance IQ , but both fall at or below the first percentile .", "On FAC , [ the applicant ] gained a score that was only just outside the average range on ORG , indicating reasonably good rote memory skills . Consistent with this was his ability to carry out the mental calculations for ORG . His scores on the remaining subtests were more significantly below average , reflecting poorly developed verbal reasoning skills . He found it particularly difficult to define words for Vocabulary , which he did to the level expected of most children aged DATE .", "In general , [ the applicant ] experienced more difficulty with the Performance Scale subtests than with those that were language based . His age equivalents on this Scale ranged from DATE at the lowest to DATE at the highest . His approach to tasks that were reliant on the appreciation of visuo - spatial relationships was noticeably immature and he did not always attend to the relevant features .", "[ The applicant 's ] attainments in literacy were looked at using the WORD [ Wechsler Objective Reading Dimensions ] and it was found that his ability to read and spell individual words out of context were both at levels that would be predicted from his general intelligence . He coped less well than expected with the Reading Comprehension section but this should be interpreted in the context of his disrupted educational career .", "Summary", "[ The applicant ] is currently presenting with a significant degree of learning difficulty that is most apparent in his ability to carry out visually based tasks . ... If looked at in terms of age equivalents , [ the applicant 's ] cognitive abilities cover a range from DATE , which will mean that his ability to reason is noticeably restricted . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . There was a pre - trial hearing in DATE . The applicant 's counsel relied on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and argued that the trial should be stayed as an abuse of process because of the applicant 's low attention span and educational age , which meant that he would be unable fully to understand and participate in the trial . This submission was rejected by the judge , who ruled , inter alia :", "\u201c I do not accept that placing [ the applicant ] on trial in the ORG amounts to inhuman or degrading treatment or will be unfair . Following the procedures now habitually adopted in ORG when trying children , the trial before the jury will be conducted in as informal a manner as is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial . Legal wigs and robes will not be worn . The issue before the jury will be a simple one . There is no reason to think that [ the applicant ] will be any less able to give his evidence to the jury than to ORG . On the material before me he appears to be a ' streetwise ' child , whose intellectual impairment is largely the result of spending CARDINAL of his critical DATE outside the education system .", "I questioned whether there is felt to be a public interest in proceeding with the prosecution , having regard to the fact that [ the applicant ] is already subject to a DATE supervision order for offences including robberies . I was told that since that order was made on DATE ( at which time [ the applicant ] was also taken into local authority care ) , he has committed ( and admitted ) a number of other offences . He was placed with foster parents , who in DATE felt ( according to PERSON report ) that he was making some progress . Now , they are unwilling to keep him , finding him uncontrollable . In these circumstances it is entirely understandable that the ORG wish to proceed with the prosecution .", "Mr PERSON also wished to take the point at trial that [ the applicant ] is unfit to plead . This argument is not supported by PERSON written report , but I was told that in a subsequent conference with counsel PERSON was equivocal on this point and his oral evidence might support it , although he has not seen [ the applicant ] since DATE ( when the boy was uncooperative anyway ) . No supplementary written report has been served . Mr PERSON has overlooked the fact that the evidence of CARDINAL medical practitioners would be needed before a jury could be invited to find his client unfit to plead ; also that PERSON is not a medical practitioner . He asked me to vacate [ the ] trial date to give the defence time to engage a second doctor .", "I refused this application also , inviting PERSON to reflect on whether this point can really be pursued in the light of PERSON conclusions . If the boy is unfit to plead , then he would presumably have been unfit to plead in ORG , yet the point has apparently never been suggested on his various appearances there . Since TIME hearing I understand from Mr PERSON that he has duly reflected and discussed the matter with his instructing solicitors , and does not now intend to pursue the issue of fitness to plead . The trial will therefore proceed on the merits , the issue being duress . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the hearing in DATE , which lasted DATE , the applicant was accompanied by his social worker . He was not required to sit in the dock and the court took frequent breaks and dispensed with the formality of wearing wigs and gowns . The ORG case consisted of CARDINAL written statements ( by the victim of the alleged crime and the arresting police officer ) and the oral testimony of QUANTITY eyewitnesses . The applicant gave evidence that he had committed the offence under duress , and PERSON also gave evidence consistent with her report .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was convicted and sentenced to DATE detention .", "CARDINAL . He appealed to ORG , inter alia , on the grounds that he had been deprived of a fair trial in view of his age and impaired intellectual capacity . The applicant advanced new evidence before ORG , including a statement by the applicant 's supervising social worker , who had been with him in ORG , and who said , inter alia :", "\u201c To address [ the applicant 's ] first appearance [ in the ] ORG , the court was attired in full regalia and [ the applicant ] was totally perplexed at the rigid formality and surroundings of ORG , and it is my opinion that he did not fully understand the situation .", "... [ A]t his trial I was pleased to see that the ORG was dressed in mufti . Whilst the jury was being sworn in [ the applicant ] asked me who they all were . I explained in as simple language [ sic ] a boy of DATE should understand , that they were members of the public who would have the duty of finding [ the applicant ] not guilty or guilty .", "He then said if they were the public why could not his mother sit there to help him . [ The applicant ] did not have a member of his family in attendance despite efforts made by myself .", "Whilst the trial was taking place [ the applicant ] kept turning around to talk to myself asking what was happening . [ The applicant ] has an extremely short attention span and it is my opinion that his lack of understanding of the formalities of ORG led to the jury observing what could have been misinterpreted as bad behaviour and a ' could not care less ' attitude .", "I believe this also antagonised some jury members when [ sic ] I observed watching [ the applicant ] closely . Even when the sentence was passed [ the applicant ] again did not understand what had been passed or where he was being placed .", "[ The applicant ] was under the impression that he would be returning to his foster / remand placement with [ his foster father ] , who was present at ORG . Despite my efforts to explain the situation to him [ the applicant ] did not comprehend the situation he was in . When he was taken to the holding cells awaiting escorts I took time to try again to explain the consequences of his trial and sentence but he was still confused . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's appeal was dismissed by ORG , which refused leave to argue the abuse of process / unfair trial ground , holding that it was clear that the first - instance judge , in exercising his discretion to allow the trial to proceed , had taken account of the applicant 's age , level of maturity and intellectual and emotional capacities , and that steps had been taken to promote the applicant 's ability to understand and participate in the proceedings . ORG also rejected the application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed . It noted , from a comprehensive report prepared by the unit where the applicant was detained , that there had been great improvements in both the applicant 's behaviour and his work and considered that , given the long period of instability in the applicant 's life , a settled period of support and education of the kind he was now receiving must be in his best interests .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of ORG as amended by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the age of criminal responsibility in GPE and GPE is DATE , below which no child can be found guilty of a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Magistrates ' Courts Act DATE , children and young persons under CARDINAL must be tried summarily in ORG , where the trial usually takes place in the specialist ORG , which has an informal procedure and from which the general public are excluded .

This practice direction applies to trials of children and young persons in ORG . Effect should be given to it forthwith . In it children and young persons are together called ' young defendants ' . The singular includes the plural and the masculine includes the feminine .", "CARDINAL .", "The overriding principle", "CARDINAL . NORP Some young defendants accused of committing serious crimes may be very young and very immature when standing trial in ORG . The purpose of such trial is to determine guilt ( if that is an issue ) and decide the appropriate sentence if the young defendant pleads guilty or is convicted . The trial process should not itself expose the young defendant to avoidable intimidation , humiliation or distress . All possible steps should be taken to assist the young defendant to understand and participate in the proceedings . The ordinary trial process should so far as necessary be adapted to meet those ends . Regard should be had to the welfare of the young defendant as required by section CARDINAL of ORG .", "Before trial", "CARDINAL . NORP If a young defendant is indicted jointly with an adult defendant , the court should consider at the plea and directions hearing whether the young defendant should be tried on his own and should ordinarily so order unless of the opinion that a joint trial would be in the interests of justice and would not be unduly prejudicial to the welfare of the young defendant . If a young defendant is tried jointly with an adult the ordinary procedures will apply subject to such modifications ( if any ) as the court may see fit to order .", "CARDINAL . At the plea and directions hearing before trial of a young defendant , the court should consider and so far as practicable give directions on the matters covered in DATE below inclusive .", "CARDINAL . It may be appropriate to arrange that a young defendant should visit , out of court TIME and before trial , the courtroom in which the trial is to be held so that he can familiarise himself with it .", "CARDINAL . If any case against a young defendant has attracted or may attract widespread public or media interest , the assistance of the police should be enlisted to try to ensure that a young defendant is not , when attending for the trial , exposed to intimidation , vilification or abuse .", "CARDINAL . The court should be ready at this stage ( if it has not already done so ) to give a direction under LAW DATE or , as the case may be , section CARDINAL of ORG and Criminal Evidence Act DATE .

The trial should , if practicable , be held in a courtroom in which all the participants are on the same or almost the same level .", "CARDINAL . A young defendant should normally , if he wishes , be free to sit with members of his family or others in a like relationship and in a place which permits easy , informal communication with his legal representatives and others with whom he wants or needs communication .", "CARDINAL . The court should explain the course of proceedings to a young defendant in terms he can understand , should remind those representing a young defendant of their continuing duty to explain each step of the trial to him and should ensure , so far as practicable , that the trial is conducted in language which the young defendant can understand .", "CARDINAL . NORP The trial should be conducted according to a timetable which takes full account of a young defendant 's inability to concentrate for long periods . Frequent and regular breaks will often be appropriate .", "CARDINAL . Robes and wigs should not be worn unless the young defendant asks that they should or the court for good reason orders that they should . Any person responsible for the security of a young defendant who is in custody should not be in uniform . There should be no recognisable police presence in the courtroom save for good reason .", "CARDINAL .

But the court may restrict the number of those attending in the courtroom to report the trial to such a number as is judged practicable and desirable . In ruling on any challenged claim to attend the courtroom for the purpose of reporting the trial the court should be mindful of the public 's general right to be informed about the administration of justice in ORG .
