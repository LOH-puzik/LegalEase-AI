CARDINAL of those requests were dismissed by different panels of ORG on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started serving his prison sentence on DATE . He remained in prison until DATE when he was released conditionally . During his term of imprisonment , he was transferred CARDINAL times between CARDINAL prisons and CARDINAL prison hospitals , as required by his state of health or a number of on - going court cases in which he was involved .", "CARDINAL . At the beginning of the detention period , it had been recorded that the applicant was suffering from lumbar lordosis ( discopatie lombar\u0103 ) and psychopathy , the latter having been first diagnosed in DATE .
