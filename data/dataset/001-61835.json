When granting protection to that right it is irrelevant whether an unjustified interference was the result of a fault and whether or not it was caused deliberately . It is not even required that an unjustified interference should produce any particular consequences . It suffices that an unjustified interference was capable of affecting or violating one \u2019s personal rights . The fact that plaintiff A can not exercise the profession and hold the job which he held prior to his accusation and that the clientele of plaintiff B [ who is an advocate ] shrank considerably during the criminal proceedings as well as the fact that the plaintiffs were forced to move to another apartment because of deteriorated relations with their neighbours clearly show that there has been such an interference [ with their personal rights ] . That interference is causally linked to prosecution of the plaintiffs and to the criminal proceedings held against them . There is no doubt that such interference is objectively capable of causing damage . As regards both plaintiffs , it affected their professional life , their position in the society , family life and their relations with neighbours ... The interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 [ personal rights ] is directly linked to the criminal proceedings [ against them ] ...", "It follows from the above that there has been an interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 personal rights which , in substance , still persists and that it is related to the criminal proceedings against the plaintiffs . The criminal proceedings were carried out by GPE through its competent authorities . The defendant is therefore obliged to compensate for damage of a non - pecuniary nature .", "... compensation for damage of a non - pecuniary nature has the character of satisfaction . The purpose of compensation granted in the form of a sum of money is to \u201c purify \u201d the affected person in the eyes of other persons in all spheres of life where harm was caused ... The amount of compensation granted should therefore be adequate to the interference and its circumstances ... It is beyond any doubt that the plaintiffs were publicly known in the district of PERSON ( in view of their professional positions ) and that their reputation was affected in all spheres of life . The case was taken up by the media whereby their esteem in professional life was diminished over the whole country . The amount of compensation must therefore not only be adequate to provide satisfaction to the plaintiffs , but its amount should also ensure that the plaintiffs regain their esteem and dignity in the eyes of the public . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "5-4", "5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
