{"ITEMID": "001-73360", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF DICKSON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 8;No violation of Art. 12", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE , respectively . The first applicant is in prison ( FAC , PERSON ) and the second applicant lives in Hull .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a tariff of DATE . He is imprisoned in a private prison and his earliest expected release date is DATE . He has no children .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he met the second applicant , while she was also imprisoned , by correspondence through a prison pen pal network . She has since been released , although it is not clear when . In DATE the applicants married . The second applicant already had CARDINAL children from other relationships .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since the applicants wished to have a child , in DATE the first applicant applied for facilities for artificial insemination . In DATE the second applicant joined this application . Their solicitors made representations to the Secretary of ORG , relying on the length of the relationship and the fact that , given the first applicant \u2019s earliest release date and the second applicant \u2019s age , it was unlikely that the applicants would be able to have a child together without the use of artificial insemination facilities .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE the Secretary of ORG refused their application . He first set out his general policy ( \u201c the policy \u201d ) :", "\u201c Requests for artificial insemination by prisoners are carefully considered on individual merit and will only be granted in exceptional circumstances . In reaching decisions particular attention is given to the following general considerations :", "- whether the provision of AI facilities is the only means by which conception is likely to occur", "- whether the prisoner \u2019s expected day of release is neither so near that delay would not be excessive nor so distant that he / she would be unable to assume the responsibilities of a parent", "- whether both parties want the procedure and the medical authorities both inside and outside the prison are satisfied that the couple are medically fit to proceed with AI", "- whether the couple were in a well established and stable relationship prior to imprisonment which is likely to subsist after the prisoner \u2019s release", "- whether there is any evidence to suggest that the couple \u2019s domestic circumstances and the arrangements for the welfare of the child are satisfactory , including the length of time for which the child might expect to be without a father or mother", "- whether having regard to the prisoner \u2019s history , antecedents and other relevant factors there is evidence to suggest that it would not be in the public interest to provide artificial insemination facilities in a particular case . \u201d", "He then gave his reasons for refusal in the present case . On the one hand , the second applicant would be DATE at the earliest possible date of release of the first applicant so that the likelihood of her being able to conceive naturally was small . Both applicants were also in full agreement about their wish to conceive artificially . However , on the other hand , and in the first place , the relationship was established while they were in prison and had not been tested in the normal environment of DATE life . Secondly , there was insufficient provision in place to provide independently for the material welfare of any child which might be conceived . Thirdly , there was little in the way of an immediate support network in place for the mother and any child which might be conceived . Fourthly , any child would be without a father for an important part of its childhood years . Fifthly , in light of the violence of the first applicant \u2019s crime , there would be legitimate public concern that the punitive and deterrent elements of his sentence of imprisonment were being circumvented if he were allowed to father a child by artificial insemination .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision . On DATE the ORG refused leave on the papers . The applicants renewed their application and on DATE leave was again refused after an oral hearing . On DATE the applicants introduced an application to this ORG and it was declared inadmissible in DATE on the basis that they had failed to exhaust domestic remedies ( App . No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The applicants then applied to ORG for leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE their application was unanimously rejected by ORG . ORG relied in principle on the judgment of ORG in R ( PERSON ) v Secretary of ORG for ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) . He pointed to the similarity of the arguments put by the applicants in the present case and in the PERSON case . ORG relied on the conclusion of Lord PERSON in the PERSON case ( see \u201c Relevant Domestic Law and Practice \u201d below ) and commented :", "\u201c ... Lord PERSON clearly had in mind , and he set it out in the course of his judgment , the provisions of LAW setting out various matters that may justify interference with the right to respect for private and family life , including the protection of health or morals and the protection of the rights and freedom of others . It seems to me that concern , not only for the public attitude to the exercise by prisoners of certain rights in prison which they would take for granted outside , and concern for the rights of a putative child in the upbringing it would receive depending on the circumstances and the length of the imprisonment involved , are highly relevant circumstances for the purposes of LAW", "Accordingly , in my view , it is not open to [ the applicants ] to seek to re - open the validity of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s policy which this court has held in PERSON is rational and otherwise lawful . As Lord PERSON made clear in his judgment in that case , although the starting point of the policy is that deprivation of facilities for artificial insemination may prevent conception altogether , the finishing point is whether there are exceptional circumstances for not applying the policy ... \u201d", "He then noted that on occasions the Secretary of ORG had \u201c dis - applied the policy \u201d when the circumstances had merited it : he referred to a letter from the ORG Solicitor to the applicants which apparently demonstrated this fact and pointed out that counsel for the Secretary of ORG had informed the court that there had been other such instances .", "CARDINAL . Auld LJ then applied the policy to the present case :", "\u201c To the extent that [ the applicants have ] suggested that he Secretary of ORG has irrationally misapplied his own policy to the circumstances , or has otherwise acted disproportionately in applying it , I would reject the suggestion . There is no basis for saying that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s approach can be equated , as [ the applicants ] suggested , with the extinction of a fundamental right . It was a weighing of the starting point of the policy against the other considerations for which the policy itself provided , an exercise of discretion and proportionality in respect of which , in my view , the Secretary of ORG can not be faulted on the circumstances as presented to him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The other judges also relied on the judgment in PERSON . PERSON said the following :", "\u201c The case of PERSON is also clear authority that considerations and potential consequences of public interest over and above a narrow view of the requirements of good order and security in prison can play a role in a decision whether or not to permit such artificial insemination ... I note that , in addition to the NORP authorities specifically mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL by Lord PERSON , the Commission , in its decision in PERSON v ORG App No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL at DATE , also recognised the potential relevance of more general considerations of public interest . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG is empowered to make rules for the management of prisons by LAW of FAC , DATE , which , in so far as material , provides as follows :", "\u201c The Secretary of ORG may make rules for the regulation and management of prisons ... and for the classification , treatment , employment , discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant rules are the Prison Rules DATE ( SI DATE No CARDINAL ) . Rule CARDINAL provides as follows :", "\u201c Outside Contacts", "( CARDINAL ) Special attention shall be paid to the maintenance of such relationships between a prisoner and his family as are desirable in the best interests of both .", "( CARDINAL ) A prisoner shall be encouraged and assisted to establish and maintain such relations with persons and agencies outside prison as may , in the opinion of the governor , best promote the interests of his family and his own social rehabilitation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The long standing policy of the prison service , set out above in the letter of Secretary of ORG of CARDINAL DATE was challenged by a Mr PERSON , a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder . He was DATE of age at the time his case came before ORG with a minimum of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment to serve . His wife was CARDINAL of age . At his earliest release she would have been CARDINAL . He and his wife had been refused artificial insemination facilities : it was considered that there was nothing exceptional about their case .", "CARDINAL . They challenged the policy rather than its application to their case arguing that it was an unjustified interference with their LAW . They distinguished that policy from the policy on conjugal visits : the latter gave rise to pragmatic ( security ) concerns whereas artificial insemination did not . The Government argued that the policy was justified : ( a ) it was an explicit consequence of imprisonment that prisoners should not have the opportunity to found a family ; ( b ) there would likely be serious and justified public concern if prisoners continued to have the opportunity to conceive children while in prison ; and ( c ) it was undesirable , as a general rule , for children to be brought up in single parent families .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered , while the first reason did no more than restate the policy , the second and third reasons were legitimate justifications for the policy . In giving judgment for the court , Lord PERSON said ( at DATE ff ) :", "\u201c [ The Secretary of ORG ] submitted that this passage demonstrated that public perception was a legitimate element of penal policy . I agree . GPE sanctions are imposed , in part , to exact retribution for wrongdoing . If there were no system of penal sanctions , members of the public would be likely to take the law into their own hands . In my judgment it is legitimate to have regard to public perception when considering the characteristics of a penal system .", "Furthermore , [ the applicants\u2019 ] submissions did not recognise the significance of the word \u201c justified \u201d in the phrase \u201c justified public concern \u201d . A policy which accorded to prisoners in general the right to beget children by artificial insemination would , I believe , raise difficult ethical questions and give rise to legitimate public concern ...", "... [ the applicants ] submitted that [ the disadvantage of single parent families ] was not a material consideration when formulating prison policy ... Again , I do not agree . By imprisoning the husband the ORG creates the situation where , if the wife is to have a child , that child will , until the husband \u2019s release , be brought up in a single parent family . I consider it legitimate , and indeed desirable , that the ORG should consider the implications of children being brought up in those circumstances when deciding whether or not to have a general policy of facilitating the artificial insemination of the wives of prisoners or of wives who are themselves prisoners .", "For those reasons [ the applicants have ] failed to make out his case that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s policy only to facilitate artificial insemination in exceptional circumstances is irrational . [ The applicants ] accepted that there were in this case no exceptional circumstances , and [ they were ] right to do so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . For those reasons the court concluded that the policy was not a disproportionate interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW . Lord PERSON remarked that , for any applicant claiming exceptional circumstances , the normal \u201c starting point \u201d should be the need to demonstrate that , if facilities for artificial insemination were not provided , conception would not just be delayed but prevented altogether ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["12", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
