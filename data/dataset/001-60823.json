The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants granted to a company now known as ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) an option to purchase PERCENT of the share capital in ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) for QUANTITY ( \u201c GBP \u201d ) a share , with a further option to purchase PERCENT at a price to be fixed by an agreed formula . On DATE the first lot of shares in ORG was purchased . Relations between GPE and the applicants subsequently deteriorated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and PERSON issued ORG proceedings against the applicants claiming , inter alia , damages for breach of contract . On DATE Buckingham exercised its call option on PERCENT of the shares of ORG , PERSON alleging that no further payment was due to the applicants given its outstanding claims against them .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the second applicant was granted legal aid .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiffs finally served their statement of claim on CARDINAL DATE having received numerous extensions of time ( ordered by the court on the basis of the parties\u2019 consent ) . The statement of claim ran to CARDINAL pages . It included many allegations of breaches of warranties in the option agreement and claims that the applicants owed ORG substantial sums of money which they had borrowed from ORG through ORG loans schemes .", "CARDINAL . The applicants served a short - form defence on DATE after CARDINAL extensions of the relevant time - limit granted by ORG following contested hearings . Further particulars of the defence were requested by the plaintiffs in DATE . At a directions hearing on DATE , a Master of the High Court , inter alia , allowed the applicants to amend their defence and to file a counterclaim , and ordered that the action be set down for hearing on or before DATE . This date was subsequently vacated by the parties\u2019 agreement . On DATE the applicants were accorded until DATE to file the amended defence and counterclaim , and it was so filed . In DATE the first applicant was granted legal aid . The GPE reply and defence to the counterclaim was served on DATE , after an extension of time .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the applicants\u2019 solicitors , on DATE ORG ordered that the GPE claim and the applicants\u2019 counterclaim be set down for hearing . The relevant setting down notice was filed by the plaintiffs on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG ordered the plaintiffs to file outstanding pleadings . By letter dated DATE , the applicants requested an expedited hearing from the Lord Chancellor \u2019s office . The letter of ORG dated DATE , in response , explained that the applicants could apply to ORG to advance the hearing but that the court was otherwise unable to bring the hearing date forward . It further explained that such delays often occurred given the number of cases waiting to be heard , in the light of the estimated hearing time ( then DATE ) and because a fixed hearing date had been requested .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicants were advised by solicitors and by junior and ORG that an application for an expedited trial was unlikely to succeed as inter alia there were no grounds for granting the applicants priority over other litigants . On DATE the plaintiffs filed outstanding pleadings ( further and better particulars of the statement of claim ) and in DATE and DATE discovery of documents took place in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for all parties submitted an increased estimated hearing time of DATE . On DATE the hearing date was fixed for DATE . ORG later confirmed in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE that the DATE delay in such cases was \u201c not untypical \u201d and that the reason was that the Chancery lists were \u201c extremely congested \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was ordered ( on its own petition ) to be wound up .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , due to the late discovery of the plaintiff \u2019s documents ( some CARDINAL boxes ) , the applicants applied for an adjournment of the hearing date and for an expedited hearing date thereafter . Both requests were granted and the hearing date was re - scheduled for DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the applicants served further amendments to their defence and counterclaim .", "CARDINAL . The hearing began on DATE and lasted DATE . Since ORG was in liquidation and did not appear , the judge dismissed ORG \u2019s action at the outset . PERSON applied to make substantial amendments to its pleadings and its claims were adjourned . Only the applicants\u2019 counterclaim was therefore examined . Judgment ( CARDINAL pages ) was delivered by PERSON on DATE in favour of the applicants in the sum of GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL plus costs .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE a High Court Master made a provisional charging order over the property of GPE in the sum of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE creditor banks appointed administrative receivers in respect of GPE . On CARDINAL DATE the High Court Master confirmed the charge on GPE \u2019s property in the amount of the judgment and of the interest and legal costs accrued since the judgment .

In DATE ORG assessed the applicants\u2019 costs ( including those of the appeal but less the periods for which they were legally aided ) at GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL approximately .", "CARDINAL . Given the appointment of administrative receivers to GPE , the applicants investigated how to achieve priority for their judgment over unsecured and preferential creditors of GPE , and it was considered that the judgment could be enforced against the intra - group indebtedness of certain subsidiaries of GPE in GPE ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants therefore had the judgment registered in GPE . In DATE they issued proceedings in the GPE to garnishee funds owed to GPE by its GPE subsidiaries .

On DATE ORG , on the application of GPE \u2019s administrative receivers for a winding up order , appointed provisional liquidators to take over its affairs . In DATE those provisional liquidators obtained from the GPE courts a provisional discharge of the order garnisheeing the subsidiaries\u2019 funds . That provisional order was subject to the courts in the GPE determining whether the latter would permit the applicants to enforce their judgment debt ahead of the existing secured and preferential creditors of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants therefore issued new proceedings ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on DATE in ORG in GPE to have determined the issue identified by the GPE courts . Pointing to the delay in the determination of their claim against GPE in the substantive proceedings , they requested ORG to exercise its discretion to give them priority over the secured and preferential creditors of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a compulsory winding up order of GPE was obtained which confirmed the provisional liquidators in office .", "CARDINAL .

On CARDINAL DATE PERSON handed down ORG judgment . He found that he could not prefer the judgment debt of the applicants over the secured and preferential creditors of GPE . He described the \u201c lamentable history \u201d of the proceedings and was critical of the conduct of those proceedings by PERSON and their legal representatives , referring to their \u201c highly successful spoiling tactics \u201d , to the \u201c carefully dilatory conduct of the action before DATE \u201d and to their \u201c extremely overdue \u201d statement of claim pointing out , in this context , that \u201c if litigation is about the obtaining of justice at a fair trial it is equally clear that that process was wholly obstructed \u201d . A notice of appeal was filed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard the appeal and on DATE it confirmed the judgment of ORG ( PERSON and another v. FAC plc ( in liq ) and others , ORG plc ( in liq ) ( no CARDINAL ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL ) .

It went on :", "\u201c The civil justice system has unfortunately failed to give [ the applicants ] prompt relief for their complaints , and their eventual victory before PERSON has become a very hollow victory . Nevertheless , there was in our judgment no substantial flaw in the way in which PERSON exercised his discretion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also refused leave to appeal to ORG . The application for leave to appeal to ORG ( filed on DATE ) was rejected by that body on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
