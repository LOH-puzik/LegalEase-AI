As to the cause of the movement of the population , the NORP authorities maintained that the movement was not caused by the violence in the region alone . They contended that economic factors also accounted for the \u201c migration \u201d . The report , recognising the situation of internal displacement due to the conflict in the region , confirmed the ORG \u2019s stand point . However , it pointed out that there was no doubt that there had been a major displacement and migration to towns affecting those caught in the crossfire of the conflict : on the one hand NORP security forces had targeted villages suspected of supporting the ORG . On the other hand the ORG had assassinated inhabitants of the villages \u201c collaborating \u201d with the ORG authorities ( i.e. belonging to the village guards system ) or refusing to support the ORG . This vicious circle of violence had forced many people to flee their homes .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON pointed to the failure of ORG to provide emergency assistance to people forcibly displaced in the south - east , including persons displaced directly as a result of the actions of the security forces . He further underlined the failure of the Government to provide a sanitary environment , housing , health care and employment to the internally displaced population .", "CARDINAL . As to the prospects for the future , Mr PERSON observed that the respondent Government had started developing return and rehabilitation projects DATE . However , the first returns had occurred in DATE , as the region had not been secure before the latter date . Despite obvious improvements , security remained the main concern conditioning mass return movements . On the one hand , the authorities felt reluctant to allow for a large influx of returnees fearing the return of ORG militants . For that reason , they scrutinize every application and did not authorize returns to certain areas . On the other hand , the displaced population was in most cases unable to return without state financial or subsistence assistance and sometimes reluctant because of fresh memory of the atrocities committed in the past . Nevertheless , ORG ( ORG ) , which is a comprehensive development programme aimed at the ending of the disparities between this region and the rest of the country , financed a number of projects concerning the return and resettlement of displaced persons . Among them was the \u201c town - villages project \u201d , which , through the construction of centralised villages , had allowed CARDINAL displaced persons to return to their region . According to the official figures , CARDINAL persons had returned to CARDINAL villages up to DATE . Even so , a number of human rights organisations were critical of the ORG \u2019s efforts since the application forms for those who wished to return included a question concerning the reason for leaving the village . According to these organisations , displaced persons were not allowed to return unless they gave the actions of the ORG as a reason . Furthermore , there had been allegations that return was authorised only to the villages within the village guard system .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON concluded with satisfaction that the humanitarian situation in the region had progressed in relation to the situation presented in the last report of ORG ; although the aims of provision of full security for mass returns and taking measures for revitalisation of the economy were still to be achieved .

Mr PERSON reported that the figures concerning the displaced population ranged widely CARDINAL persons , predominantly of ethnic NORP . Regarding the cause of the displacement in GPE , the Representative contended that the situation of displacement had mainly resulted from armed clashes , violence and human rights violations in south - east GPE . Like the rapporteur of ORG , he recognised the Government \u2019s claim that economic factors also accounted for the population movements .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON stated that the majority of the displaced persons had moved into provincial cities , where they had reportedly lived in conditions of extreme poverty , with inadequate heating , sanitation , infrastructure , housing and education . He noted that the displaced persons had to seek employment in overcrowded cities and towns , where unemployment levels were described as \u201c disastrous \u201d . Mr PERSON observed that the Government officials were mainly concerned with explaining the initiatives that the authorities were taking regarding the return and resettlement of the displaced population .

He noted that the extent of the consultation with the displaced and the nongovernmental organisations working on their behalf might be insufficient . He further reported the concerns regarding the plan of a new centralised settlement pattern , as opposed to the traditional pattern of CARDINAL large settlement ( village ) surrounded by smaller settlements ( hamlets ) . PERSON PERSON noted that , although establishing security in the region through promoting centralised settlement units was a legitimate policy , the authorities should consult the displaced themselves . CARDINAL other issues that were of concern for Mr PERSON were the absence of basic data which would give an accurate picture of the displacement and the failure to implement the project .", "CARDINAL . As to return and resettlement initiatives other than the \u201c Return to Village and Rehabilitation Project \u201d , Mr PERSON noted that there had not been sufficient information as to their target groups and how exactly they related to one another .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the obstacles to return , Mr PERSON referred to the practice of requiring persons to declare that they would not seek damages from the ORG . PERSON noted that Government officials denied the existence of a non - litigation clause in the application forms for those who wished to return . Furthermore , he had received information concerning the application forms , which included a question concerning the reason for leaving the village . According to the reports , only those persons who stated that they had been displaced as a result of \u201c terror \u201d were allowed to return . Mr PERSON further noted that there had been allegations that return was authorised only to villages within the village guard system .

The Government should enhance their efforts to address the current conditions of the displaced , which are reported to be poor , in co - operation with non - governmental organisations and ORG agencies .", "c. The Government should provide more comprehensive and reliable data on the number of persons displaced as a result of the actions of both ORG ( ORG ) and the security forces , on their current whereabouts , conditions and specific needs , and on their intentions with respect to return or resettlement .", "d. The Government should facilitate broad consultation with the displaced and the non - governmental organisations and civil society organisations working with them . The Government should further consider producing a document that clearly outlines the objectives , scope and resource implications of the Return to Village and Rehabilitation Project . Finally the results of the feasibility study conducted should be made public and the Government should facilitate an open discussion with the displaced and non - governmental organisations on the findings of this study and the steps which should be taken to implement them .", "e.

In this connection , the ORG might consider convening a meeting with international agencies , including ORG , and representatives of the potential partners to explore ways in which the international community could assist the Government in responding to the needs of the displaced .", "f. The Government should ensure a nondiscriminatory approach to return by investigating and preventing situations in which former village guards are allegedly given preference in the return process over those persons perceived as linked to ORG .", "g. The Government should ensure that the role of the security forces , or jandarma , in the return process is primarily one of consultation on security matters . Displaced persons who have been granted permission by the authorities to return to their villages - the decision being based on the advice of the jandarma - should be allowed to do so without unjustified or unlawful interference by the jandarma .", "h. The Government should take steps to abolish the village guard system and find alternative employment opportunities for existing guards . Until such time as the system is abolished , the process of disarming village guards should be expedited .", "i. The Government should undertake mine clearance activities in the relevant areas of the south - east to which displaced persons are returning , so as to facilitate that process .", "j.
