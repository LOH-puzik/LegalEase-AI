The facts of the case , particularly concerning events from DATE to CARDINAL DATE when PERSON was held in custody by the security forces , were disputed by the parties . The Commission , pursuant to former LAW ( a ) of the LAW , conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties .", "The Commission heard witnesses in GPE from DATE . These included the applicant ; PERSON , the public prosecutor at Cizre who signed the request for the extension in detention of PERSON ; Dr PERSON , doctor at ORG who treated PERSON for a bullet wound to the knee ; PERSON Can who examined PERSON at ORG ; Major PERSON , the LOC gendarme commander who apprehended PERSON ; PERSON who was present at ORG apprehension ; Colonel PERSON , who was in charge of transferring PERSON from ORG ; PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , who worked in GPE provincial gendarme interrogation department at the time of PERSON arrival at GPE ; and ORG , a \u201c confessor \u201d , who had previously joined the ORG and had later given himself up to the authorities .", "CARDINAL . The DATE \u2019s findings of fact are set out in its report of DATE and summarised below ( Section A ) . The applicant accepts the ORG \u2019s findings of fact . The Government \u2019s submissions concerning the facts are summarised below ( Section B ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the NORP region in the south - east corner of GPE , close to the GPE and NORP borders , was the scene of intense terrorist activity . The town of GPE was close to the GPE mountains , where there were numerous ORG camps and shelters . The road between ORG , the provincial centre , was subject to attack , necessitating military protection for convoys passing on the main road between the CARDINAL towns .", "CARDINAL . NORP The district gendarme commander in Cizre at the time was Captain PERSON . The provincial gendarme headquarters , commanded by a colonel , was located in GPE , as was the CARDINALrd gendarme border brigade . Though the CARDINAL commands were distinct , it appeared from the evidence that the provincial gendarme command headed by a colonel was subordinate to the brigade command under a general . There was an interrogation centre at the provincial gendarme command , where the CARDINAL interrogators PERSON , PERSON and PERSON worked .", "CARDINAL . During an operation conducted in or around the Cudi district of Cizre by the police and district gendarmes early in the morning of DATE , PERSON was shot in the knee and taken into custody by gendarmes under Captain PERSON \u2019s command at TIME . In the search report of DATE detailing this incident , it was stated that PERSON had been found in possession of a PERSON rifle , handgun and hand grenades . According to this report and the oral evidence of Captain PERSON , PERSON immediately revealed to the gendarmes his name , that his code name was \u201c LOC and that he had come to Cizre to carry out actions for the ORG . Captain PERSON considered that it was apparent from what PERSON told him that he was a commander . However , he did not recall that PERSON made any offer to him to give assistance in finding ORG locations . PERSON , who was also on the scene at this time , heard PERSON give his name and code name and say that he was from the mountain . He did not hear PERSON volunteer any assistance to the security forces .", "CARDINAL . After this initial exchange with the gendarmes at the scene of his capture , PERSON was taken to ORG where he was admitted for treatment by PERSON at TIME . PERSON had no recollection of PERSON but was of assistance in deciphering his report for ORG . This recorded that PERSON had an entry and exit wound to the knee , with injury to the front lower right knee joint . He was conscious and at that point his life was not in danger . Due to the lack of equipment and orthopaedic expertise , PERSON recommended his transfer to GPE .", "CARDINAL . At a time unknown the same day , PERSON was handed over to Captain PERSON , an officer from the GPE provincial gendarmerie who was in command of the convoys going between GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Commission requested , on numerous occasions , the records which indicated the places and times of PERSON detention following his apprehension . No record was provided indicating where he was held in Cizre between his treatment in hospital and his transfer to the GPE convoy . Captain PERSON thought that PERSON must have been entered in the LOC gendarme records as he was detained pursuant to the authority of the NORP public prosecutor . Records provided by the Government from NORP district gendarmerie contained no entry concerning PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The decision to transfer PERSON to GPE was taken by the DATE gendarme border brigade . Captain PERSON had reported the capture of PERSON to the brigade command and they requested his transfer to GPE . The transfer record of DATE also referred to the brigade \u2019s request . The reason for the transfer was not expressed in that document . Captain PERSON considered that PERSON would have had to go to GPE as he was a commander with information about the GPE mountains and it was the forces in GPE who conducted operations in that region .", "CARDINAL . The only record relating to PERSON detention after his arrival in GPE was an entry in the ORG polyclinic record . This was dated DATE , giving no time . Neither Captain PERSON nor the doctor who gave treatment had any recollection of the incident , so were unable to provide any explanations as to exactly when he arrived or to whom he was delivered . Dr Can , who treated PERSON , considered on the basis of his entry in the hospital record that he would have treated the injury , placing a long leg splint or supervising an assistant in doing so . He was of the opinion that PERSON would not have been admitted to the hospital as his notes made no reference to this step being taken or considered necessary . The follow up treatment which he stated would be necessary DATE antibiotics , which would most likely have been handed to the patient on the spot , and the requirement for the wound to be dressed at DATE intervals \u2013 did not require continuous hospital care .", "CARDINAL . Of the CARDINAL officers identified by the Government as having interrogated PERSON at the GPE provincial gendarme headquarters DATE PERSON , PERSON and PERSON \u2013 CARDINAL , PERSON , remembered interrogating PERSON . No logs or records were provided by the ORG from the interrogation department recording PERSON interrogation , nor the interrogation notes which the witnesses said would have been taken . The Government denied that these documents existed . The only source of information about the interrogation of PERSON therefore was the oral evidence of PERSON and the brief comments which appeared in various gendarme reports following PERSON \u2019s alleged escape .", "CARDINAL . According to PERSON , he interviewed PERSON on CARDINAL occasion , while PERSON was confined to bed either in the hospital or infirmary . He remembered taking notes which they gave to their superiors . He could recall that the information related to the area where the person had carried out activities but did not mention any alleged offer to assist the security forces by showing locations . The Delegates had also requested the infirmary records concerning PERSON presence and treatment . The Government stated the infirmary records contained no information about PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Though the Commission did not exclude that the hospital or infirmary records were inaccurate , it noted that in its experience it had found the records made by doctors to be generally reliable , if sometimes brief , whereas the inaccuracy of , and omissions from , gendarme records had been the subject of adverse findings in a number of cases . Further , it found the testimony of the interrogation officers to be unconvincing , giving the impression of being selective or piecemeal accounts . From their evidence , it was generally expected for the same officers to follow through a suspect \u2019s interrogation to the stage when a statement was taken by the district gendarmerie who had the responsibility at the end of the custody period to deliver the suspect to the public prosecutor for judicial procedures to be followed . PERSON had no explanation however for why he only visited PERSON once . While PERSON removal from the interrogation process must have been unexpected or unusual , he apparently knew nothing about it \u2013 nor about PERSON \u2019s apparent involvement in an operation to locate shelters or his apparent escape afterwards . The ORG was not persuaded that a suspect in respect of whom the provincial gendarmerie had commenced interrogation would or could be transferred elsewhere without some information or explanation being provided to the officers involved in the interrogation . Furthermore , a single , apparently brief interrogation did not account for the CARDINAL DATE extended custody periods which were requested by the FAC district gendarmerie on behalf of those holding PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The evidence of the interrogation officers was therefore unable to provide any approximate date as to when any interrogation took place or any reliable basis on which to reach any finding as to where PERSON was held after his examination by Dr Can . Though his wound should have been dressed DATE and Dr Can would have expected himself , or another doctor , to check the patient \u2019s state after DATE or DATE , there is no evidence that he received any follow - up medical care after DATE .", "CARDINAL . A custody period of DATE from the date of apprehension was granted by the NORP public prosecutor at the request of the district gendarme commander . A further period of DATE was granted by him on DATE on the request of the district gendarmerie .", "CARDINAL . According to a hand written incident report dated DATE , TIME , signed by a gendarme captain group commander PERSON and gendarme first lieutenants PERSON and PERSON , both of whom were team commanders , PERSON escaped from the security forces while assisting them on an operation in the GPE mountains to find ORG shelters .", "CARDINAL . According to the evidence of the doctors who treated him , it was probable that PERSON was not rendered completely immobile by the injury to his knee . With the long leg splint , he would have been able to hobble , with a crutch or assistance . In DATE after the injury , he would have been in considerable pain . By DATE , a period of DATE after his injury , he would have been expected to have made some recovery . PERSON , the orthopaedics expert , estimated that the splint would have had to stay on for DATE and that a patient might be able to run as well as walk within the same range of time . He pointed out that with sufficient motivation a person could run , notwithstanding a high level of pain . In the absence of medical notes , the ORG was unable to reach any firm conclusions as to what state of fitness PERSON would have been in on DATE . It found it highly unlikely however that he was fully fit or able to walk or run normally at this date .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that the incident report of CARDINAL DATE was an unreliable document . The report stated that PERSON ran off after a clash broke out , under cover of the fading light , precipitation and rocky terrain . It did not mention how many gendarmes were involved in the operation , how many were guarding the suspect and whether \u2013 and if not , why not \u2013 the suspect was restrained or handcuffed in some way . No details were given of the steps taken to recover the suspect . The times given on the report were particularly implausible . It was stated that the clash broke out at TIME following which there was a sequence of events \u2013 the escape , the discovery of the escape , an unsuccessful search , the monitoring of various radio conversations between terrorist \u2013 culminating in the drawing of the report and its signing by the CARDINAL officers at TIME .", "CARDINAL . In these circumstances , the ORG considered that it was of crucial importance that the CARDINAL signatories of the report gave explanations of the document and what they in fact saw and did . The Delegates in requesting the ORG \u2019s assistance in summoning them to give evidence emphasised that the ORG should at the same time identify the officers who personally witnessed PERSON escape as the Commission had experience that the signatories of reports did not necessarily have any direct knowledge of the contents . At the taking of evidence in DATE , ORG informed the Delegates that they had been unable to find CARDINAL officers who signed the report and that they had recently received information that the names used were code names . In reply to the FAC request for steps be taken to identify the officers who used these code names in DATE , the ORG stated that it was not possible to identify the CARDINAL officers . The Delegates also requested the other operation records or details which could cast light on the incident . The Government stated that no other records existed .", "CARDINAL . No document was provided recording authorisation for the transfer of PERSON to any particular operational command at GPE . In particular , there was no contemporaneous document or record indicating that he was transferred from the provincial gendarme interrogation unit elsewhere . It had not been established by the written or oral evidence that PERSON had in fact offered to show locations during his interrogation .", "CARDINAL . The Government relied principally on the evidence of CARDINAL ex - ORG members or \u201c confessors \u201d \u2013 the written statements taken from ORG and PERSON , and the oral evidence of ORG \u2013 as substantiating the allegation that PERSON had escaped and rejoined the ORG in the GPE mountains on DATE . The ORG however did not find this material to be reliable or , on certain crucial aspects , credible . It referred , inter alia , to the lack of any explanation as to how the CARDINAL confessors came to be identified at the same time as persons with relevant information about PERSON ; that ORG and PERSON statements of CARDINAL DATE referred to injuries suffered by PERSON in DATE and made no reference to the injury which he had received in DATE ; and the fact that ORG statement of CARDINAL DATE stated that he joined the ORG in DATE becoming a friend of PERSON before his capture in Cizre , though that latter event occurred on DATE .", "The ORG also found that ORG oral evidence was inconsistent and unconvincing . His story changed under questioning and gave the impression of embroidery . It was not reconciliable with uncontroverted facts . For example , ORG was insistent that he spent a DATE training course with PERSON after he joined the ORG in DATE , which explanation formed the basis for his claim of forming a close friendship with PERSON , whereas PERSON was apprehended in Cizre in TIME of DATE . ORG were accordingly not satisfied that he had seen PERSON after DATE as asserted . It concluded that the ORG \u2019s claim that PERSON escaped while assisting the security forces on an operation was not substantiated by the evidence given and could not be regarded as established as a fact or a significant probability . There was accordingly no explanation for what happened to PERSON after he was treated by Dr Can at ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was informed on DATE that his son had been apprehended and injured in a clash in LANGUAGE . Arriving in Cizre on DATE , he went to see the public prosecutor immediately . He was told to come back after DATE extended custody period . Meanwhile , the applicant sought to visit , or discover further information , about his injured son by approaching the gendarmerie in GPE and Cizre but was turned away . On the expiry of DATE period , at DATE or beginning of DATE , he returned to the public prosecutor handing in a written petition . The public prosecutor signed the petition and he took it to the district gendarme commander who referred him back to the public prosecutor . During DATE period to end , the applicant returned to the public prosecutor repeatedly seeking for news and on CARDINAL occasion , the public prosecutor contacted the district gendarmerie by telephone .", "CARDINAL . On the expiry of the second period , the applicant returned to the public prosecutor . On DATE , he handed in a further written petition which stated that he had no news although DATE had passed from DATE second custody period . He requested information and stated that he feared for his son \u2019s life . On or DATE , the public prosecutor informed him that it was reported that his son had escaped . The written report from the district gendarmerie to the prosecutor was dated DATE but it was possible that the information was received by the public prosecutor prior to this date . The applicant informed the public prosecutor orally that he did not believe this story and that he believed his son had been tortured and killed .", "CARDINAL . The public prosecutor at Cizre took no steps to investigate the alleged escape of PERSON while in custody in reaction either to the applicant \u2019s expressed fears or to the fact that a prisoner awaiting judicial procedures had somehow been permitted to escape . On DATE , the public prosecutor issued a decision of withdrawal of jurisdiction and transferred the file concerning PERSON as a suspected member of the ORG to ORG ( ORG ) public prosecutor . It stated as an apparent fact that he had escaped to rejoin the ORG . The steps taken by the ORG prosecutor were related to investigating his membership of ORG and not related to investigating his disappearance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant returned to Cizre in DATE to see the public prosecutor , who informed him that the case had been transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Following the communication of the case to the respondent Government by the ORG in DATE , it appears that an investigation was briefly pursued by the Cizre public prosecutor ( file no . MONEY ) This was limited to an enquiry dated DATE to the NORP district gendarme command for the names of the officers who signed the report of DATE to be identified . Following a letter dated CARDINAL DATE from the FAC district gendarmes which stated that enquiries should be addressed to the GPE gendarme border regiment command , and that the special operations group command were responsible , the NORP public prosecutor declined jurisdiction in a decision of DATE , transferring his file to the GPE public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . NORP The GPE public prosecutor had meanwhile commenced an investigation ( prel . DATE ) under the prompting of GPE . At this stage , the following steps were taken :", "\u2013 on DATE , a request was made to the DATE gendarme border regiment for the identities of the personnel of the special operations group involved in the operation of CARDINAL DATE to be identified ;", "\u2013 on DATE , a statement was taken from the applicant on CARDINAL DATE by the ORG public prosecutor ;", "\u2013 on DATE , a statement was taken from ORG by a public prosecutor ;", "\u2013 on DATE and DATE , an urgent reminder was sent requiring a response to the above request of DATE ;", "\u2013 on DATE , a request for information about the identities of personnel was sent to GPE provincial gendarme command who replied on CARDINAL DATE that it was ORG who had taken PERSON ;", "\u2013 following receipt of a letter on DATE , in which ORG command denied knowledge of the CARDINAL names on the report of DATE but named CARDINAL officers ( LOC , NORP and \u00c7etin ) as being group commander and team commanders at that time , a request was made for those QUANTITY officers to be asked a list of CARDINAL specific questions , namely , about whether they were serving in ORG at the time , whether they or ORG received PERSON , whether they knew the names on the report and where it would be possible to identify the names on the report ;", "\u2013 on DATE , a request was made of the NORP public prosecutor for the transfer record concerning PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the GPE public prosecutor issued a decision of withdrawal of jurisdiction , stating that it had not been possible to identify the officers involved in the alleged incident . The decision concluded that the matter should be investigated under LAW as it concerned special operations teams and that the file was to be transferred to the GPE provincial administrative council .", "CARDINAL . The investigation was taken over by ORG who by letter of DATE appointed Major PERSON , a gendarme officer from the provincial gendarme command to investigate the allegations that PERSON had been killed and to identify the perpetrators . This stage of the investigation lasted until DATE . During this period , Major PERSON again asked ORG specifically to identify the CARDINAL persons who signed the report . He received the reply on DATE that the names were not found in the records and that the records had been burned in DATE with the result that the names of the personnel who were on operation in GPE at the time could not be determined . Major PERSON requested medical records and transfer details about PERSON from the Cizre district gendarmerie . Via a rogatory request , he obtained statements from the applicant , ORG , Captain PERSON and the CARDINAL officers previously named as having served in GPE special operations at the relevant time . They stated , inter alia , that PERSON had not been delivered to them and that code names were not permitted , though Captain PERSON was noted as recognising his signature on the incident report of DATE . On the basis of this information , Major PERSON found in his report of CARDINAL DATE , that it was established that PERSON had been taken to GPE mountain to locate ORG shelters by teams from the CARDINALrd gendarme border brigade special operations group command and that he had escaped on DATE . The statements of ORG and PERSON were referred to as supporting this . The report noted that there were no interrogation records concerning PERSON though it appeared that Captain PERSON had transferred him to ORG . The report concluded that it was not possible to establish the identities of the suspects , the identities of the persons of the report not being ascertainable due to changes in military personnel , the failure to keep records properly and the destruction of records . In those circumstances , a prosecution could not be brought . The provincial governor accepted this conclusion and the proceedings were terminated .", "CARDINAL . The investigation documents concerning the enquiries by the GPE public prosecutor and Major PERSON , the gendarme officer appointed by ORG were submitted to the Commission by the Government on DATE , after the Commission had closed the taking of evidence and invited the parties to submit their oral observations . These documents included information about the possible identification of special operations group officers involved in the PERSON incident . Though the names of CARDINAL officers were known to the investigating authorities in DATE , the Government did not bring them to the attention of the ORG or its Delegates who could have taken the decision to call them to give oral evidence . The ORG found that in failing to provide it with this information during the taking of evidence , the ORG had fallen short of its obligations under former LAW ( a ) of the LAW to furnish all the necessary facilities to the Commission in its task of establishing the facts of the case .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was apprehended on DATE by the security forces during an armed clash with ORG terrorists . During interrogation , PERSON said that he knew certain hideouts used by ORG members in the GPE mountains . Upon this information , a search team went to the mountains with PERSON . This area was used frequently by the ORG . A clash started between the ORG and the security personnel . Benefiting from this clash , PERSON escaped and was lost immediately in the near darkness . He was not handcuffed and knew the area very well . It was very probable that he re - joined the ORG following his escape . He would have been able to run even though his leg was injured .", "CARDINAL . As PERSON escaped from the security forces , the Government stated that it was not for them to prove that he is still alive and they can not give an explanation for his whereabouts .", "CARDINAL . The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW all forms of homicide ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) and attempted homicide ( Articles CARDINAL and DATE ) constitute criminal offences . It is also an offence for a government employee to subject CARDINAL to torture or ill - treatment ( Article CARDINAL in respect of torture and Article CARDINAL in respect of ill - treatment ) or to deprive an individual unlawfully of his or her liberty ( Article CARDINAL generally , Article CARDINAL in respect of civil servants ) .", "CARDINAL . The authorities\u2019 obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW . Offences may be reported to the authorities or the security forces as well as to public prosecutor \u2019s offices . The complaint may be made in writing or orally . If it is made orally , the authority must make a record of it ( LAW .", "If there is evidence to suggest that a death is not due to natural causes , members of the security forces who have been informed of that fact are required to advise the public prosecutor or a criminal court judge ( Article CARDINAL ) . By Article CARDINAL of LAW , any public official who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor \u2019s office an offence of which he has become aware in the exercise of his duty is liable to imprisonment .", "A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the case of alleged terrorist offences , the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of ORG prosecutors and courts established throughout GPE .", "CARDINAL . If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties , the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by the Law of DATE on the prosecution of civil servants ( sometimes referred to as LAW ) , which restricts the public prosecutor \u2019s jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings . In such cases it is for the relevant local administrative council ( for the district or province , depending on the suspect \u2019s status ) to conduct the preliminary investigation and , consequently , to decide whether to prosecute . Once a decision to prosecute has been taken , it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case .", "An appeal to ORG lies against a decision of the ORG . If a decision not to prosecute is taken , the case is automatically referred to that court .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of DATE , paragraph ( i ) , of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE on the authority of the governor of a state of emergency region , the DATE PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) also applies to members of the security forces who come under the governor \u2019s authority .", "CARDINAL . If the suspect is a member of the armed forces , the applicable law is determined by the nature of the offence . Thus , if it is a \u201c military offence \u201d under LAW ( Law no .
