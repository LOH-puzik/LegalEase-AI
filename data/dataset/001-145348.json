The first and second applicants were born in DATE , and the third and fourth applicants in DATE and DATE respectively . They live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants married on DATE in GPE and brought up the third and fourth applicants together . The third applicant is the second applicant \u2019s daughter and the first applicant \u2019s stepdaughter ; the fourth applicant is the first and second ORG daughter .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicants sought asylum in GPE on QUANTITY occasions . Each time their applications were rejected they returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , having re - entered NORP territory , filed a fresh request for asylum . The first and second applicants claimed that they had been tortured and had received death threats from the NORP police after the first applicant had attended CARDINAL political demonstrations in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Refugee Office \u201d ) rejected the applicants\u2019 request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was convicted of selling stolen goods and was given a DATE suspended prison sentence and fined MONEY ( CHF ) . On DATE he was convicted of driving without a valid licence and sentenced to QUANTITY of community service . On DATE he was convicted of attempting to steal perfumes in a shopping centre and was sentenced to TIME of community service . On DATE he was convicted of buying stolen goods and given a ninemonth suspended sentence and fined CARDINAL . The suspension of his previous sentence having been revoked , he served this sentence as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and ordered ORG to review the ORG request . It considered that the information contained in medical records regarding the first applicant \u2019s state of mental health drawn up in GPE in DATE might be a reason to grant refugee status to the applicants . According to medical certificates , the first applicant suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , depression and schizoaffective disorder . He had been hospitalised on several occasions after attempting to commit suicide .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first and the second applicants separated . Their young daughter , the fourth applicant , stayed with the second applicant , who obtained full parental authority , while the first applicant was granted extended access , including the right to see her every DATE , DATE and for CARDINAL of the school holidays .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the third applicant a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . She then withdrew her asylum request and applied for NORP citizenship , which was granted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following a fresh examination of the facts , rejected the remaining applicants\u2019 request for asylum . On DATE they lodged an administrative appeal , arguing , inter alia , that they continued to have a close family relationship even after the first CARDINAL applicants had separated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partially reversed ORG decision . The court specified , at the outset , that the decisions given by ORG could be contested before ORG , whose decision was final .", "CARDINAL . The court also observed that the first and second applicants had separated and ceased living together , and that the fourth applicant usually lived with her mother . Accordingly , the family unit had ceased to exist and the principles established under LAW no longer applied . As a consequence , each applicant \u2019s residence rights had to be examined separately . The court considered that this approach was even more justified in view of the first applicant \u2019s behaviour and his criminal record .", "CARDINAL . The court further observed that the fourth applicant was then DATE and had from the age of CARDINAL grown up in GPE , where she had attended school and was completely integrated . It appeared that she did not have any practical knowledge of her country of origin , having never returned after her arrival in GPE , and that she hardly spoke LANGUAGE , GPE \u2019s main language . Under these circumstances , the court considered that sending her back would amount to an uprooting of excessive rigidity ( un d\u00e9racinement d\u2019une rigueur excessive ) and granted her and her mother temporary residence ( admission provisoire ) in GPE for DATE , renewable on a DATE basis thereafter .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the first applicant , ORG considered his expulsion to be lawful . The court observed , at the outset , that he had not established that he would be at any risk on his return to GPE . The court further considered that his state of health gave reason for concern , since he suffered from PTSD and had made several suicide attempts . However , the court observed that GPE had a health system which , even if it could not be compared to the NORP system , was nevertheless reliable . The court considered that the applicant would have access to specialist care in the main urban centres of the country .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that the first applicant \u2019s attending doctors considered that his return to GPE was in itself likely to jeopardise his health , irrespective of the medical treatment he received . Furthermore , he would be confronted with serious social problems . However , ORG considered that , under the pertinent legislation , the applicant \u2019s criminal record excluded him from being granted temporary residence . The court noted in this context that the applicant had , over a longer period of time , acquired a total of CARDINAL stolen goods ( primarily gold jewellery ) deriving from various burglaries ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
