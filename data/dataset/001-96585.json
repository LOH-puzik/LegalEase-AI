The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . DATE there was a ORG and Equipment International Exhibition ( \u201c the arms fair \u201d ) at FAC in GPE , GPE , which was the subject of protests and demonstrations .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the first applicant was riding a bicycle and carrying a rucksack near the arms fair , on his way to join the demonstration . He was stopped and searched by QUANTITY police officers who told him he was being searched under section CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the GPE \u201d : see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) for articles which could be used in connection with terrorism . He was handed a notice to that effect . The first applicant claimed he was told in response to his question as to why he was being stopped that it was because a lot of protesters were about and the police were concerned that they would cause trouble . Nothing incriminating was found ( although computer printouts giving information about the demonstration were seized by the officers ) and the first applicant was allowed to go on his way . He was detained for TIME .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , the second applicant , wearing a photographer 's jacket , carrying a small bag and holding a camera in her hand , was stopped close to the arms fair . She had apparently emerged from some bushes . The second applicant , a journalist , was in the area to film the protests . She was searched by a police officer from ORG notwithstanding that she showed her press cards to show who she was . She was told to stop filming . The police officer told her that she was using her powers under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . Nothing incriminating was found and the second applicant was allowed to go on her way . The record of her search showed she was stopped for TIME but she thought it was more like TIME . She claimed to have felt so intimidated and distressed that she did not feel able to return to the demonstration although it had been her intention to make a documentary or sell footage of it .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought to challenge the legality of the stop and search powers used against them by way of judicial review . Prior to ORG hearing , the Secretary of ORG offered the applicants a procedure which would have enabled ORG to review in closed session , with the benefit of submissions from a special advocate , the underlying intelligence material which had been the basis for the Secretary of ORG 's decision to confirm the authorisation ( section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act : see paragraphs DATE below ) . The applicants , however , indicated that they did not consider it necessary or appropriate to proceed in this way , since they did not intend to challenge the assessment that there was a general threat of terrorism against GPE . Instead , they contended , first , that the authorisation and confirmation in question , since they formed part of a rolling programme of authorisations covering the entire GPE area , were ultra vires and unlawful , since there were a number of clear indications that ORG had intended an authorisation under LAW ( \u201c a section CARDINAL authorisation \u201d ) to be given and confirmed only in response to an imminent terrorist threat to a specific location in respect of which normal police powers of stop and search were inadequate . Secondly , the applicants claimed that the use of the section CARDINAL authorisation by police officers to stop and search them at the arms fair was contrary to the legislative purpose and unlawful and that the guidance given to police officers was either non - existent or calculated to cause officers to misuse the powers . Thirdly , the applicants claimed that the section CARDINAL authorisations and the exercise of powers under them constituted a disproportionate interference with their rights under Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the application ( [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ) . Lord Justice PERSON , giving the judgment of the court , held that ORG had envisaged that a section CARDINAL authorisation might cover the whole of a police area as a response to a general threat of terrorist activity on a substantial scale and that the authorisation and the subsequent confirmation by the Secretary of ORG were not ultra vires .", "PERSON held as follows , in connection with the applicants ' second ground of challenge :", "\u201c The powers conferred on the police under section DATE are powers which most NORP people would have hoped were completely unnecessary in this country , particularly in time of peace . People have always been free to come and go in this country as they wish unless the police have reasonable cause to stop them . ORG has , however , judged that the contemporary threats posed by international terrorism and dissident NORP terrorism are such that as a people we should be content that the police should be able to stop and search us at will for articles that might be connected with terrorism .", "It is elementary that if the police abuse these powers and target them disproportionately against those whom they perceive to be no particular friends of theirs the terrorists will have to that extent won . The right to demonstrate peacefully against an arms fair is just as important as the right to walk or cycle about the streets of GPE without being stopped by the police unless they have reasonable cause . If the police wish to use this extraordinary power to stop and search without cause they must exercise it in a way that does not give rise to legitimate complaints of arbitrary abuse of power .", "We are not , however , satisfied that the police 's conduct on DATE entitles either Mr PERSON or PERSON to a public law remedy . There is just enough evidence available to persuade us that , in the absence of any evidence that these powers were being habitually used on occasions which might represent symbolic targets , the arms fair was an occasion which concerned the police sufficiently to persuade them that the use of section CARDINAL powers was needed ... . But it was a fairly close call , and ORG would do well to review their training and briefing and the language of the standard forms they use for section CARDINAL stop / searches if they wish to avoid a similar challenge in future . ... \u201d", "Finally , the court found that the powers were provided for by law and not disproportionate , given the risk of terrorist attack in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal gave judgment on DATE ( [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) . As to the proper interpretation of the legislation , it held that :", "\u201c It is clear that ORG , unusually , has permitted random stopping and searching , but , as we have already indicated when examining the language of the relevant sections , made the use of that power subject to safeguards . The power is only to be used for a single specified purpose for a period of an authorisation granted by a senior officer and confirmed by the Secretary of ORG . Furthermore , the authorisation only has a limited life unless renewed .", "We do not find it surprising that the word ' expedient ' should appear in section NORP ) in conjunction with the power to authorise . The statutory scheme is to leave how the power is to be used to the discretion of the senior officer . In agreement with ORG , we would give the word its ordinary meaning of advantageous . It is entirely consistent with the framework of the legislation that a power of this sort should be exercised when a senior police officer considers it is advantageous to exercise the power for the prevention of acts of terrorism .", "Interpreted in this way , sections DATE and DATE could not conflict with the provisions of the Articles of the ORG . If those ORG were to be infringed it would be because of the manner of the exercise of the power , not its existence . Any possible infringement of the ORG would depend on the circumstances in which the power that the sections give is exercised . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG did not consider it necessary to determine whether LAW applied , since it held that any deprivation of liberty was justifiable under LAW ) . However it held that , if the point had to be decided , the better view was that there was no deprivation of liberty , taking into account the likely limited nature of any infringement in a normal stop and search and the fact that the main aim would not be to deprive an individual of his liberty but rather to effect a verification of one form or another . Nor did it consider that LAW and CARDINAL applied . Although the applicants ' evidence gave some cause for concern that the power had been used against them to control or deter their attendance at the demonstration , those issues had not been tested because the thrust of their argument was directed at the conformity of the legislation with the LAW and , properly used as a measure of limited duration to search for articles connected with terrorism , the stop and search power would not impinge on the rights to freedom of expression or assembly .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Commissioner of ORG had conceded that the stop and search measures amounted to interferences with the applicants ' LAW , and ORG accepted that this was the correct approach , describing section CARDINAL as \u201c an extremely wide power to intrude on the privacy of the members of the public \u201d . It considered that the interference was , however , in accordance with the law , for the following reasons :", "\u201c ' The law ' that is under criticism here is the statute , not the authorisation . That law is just as much a public record as is any other statute . And the provisions are not arbitrary in any relevant sense . Although the police officer does not have to have grounds for suspecting the presence of suspicious articles before stopping a citizen in any particular case ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) ) , he can only be authorised to use those powers for limited purposes , and where a decision has been made that the exercise of the powers is expedient for the serious purpose of the prevention of acts of terrorism ( section LANGUAGE ) . The system , so controlled , can not be said to be arbitrary in any sense that deprives it of the status of ' law ' in the autonomous meaning of that term as understood in LAW . In addition , while the authorisations and their confirmation are not published because not unreasonably it is considered publication could damage the effectiveness of the stop and search powers and as the individual who is stopped has the right to a written statement under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , in this context the lack of publication does not mean that what occurred was not a procedure prescribed by law . \u201d", "Furthermore , given the nature of the terrorist threat against GPE , the authorisation and confirmation of the power could not , as a matter of general principle , be said to be disproportionate : the disadvantage of the intrusion and restraint imposed on even a large number of individuals by being stopped and searched could not possibly match the advantage that accrued from the possibility of a terrorist attack being thereby foiled or deterred . Having regard to the nature of the arms fair , its location near an airport and a previous site of a terrorist incident ( connected with the GPE problems ) and the fact that a protest was taking place , the police were entitled to decide that section CARDINAL powers should be exercised in connection with it . However , the inadequacy of the evidence provided by the police concerning the use of the section CARDINAL power in the vicinity of the arms fair made it impossible to come to any conclusion as regards the lawfulness and proportionality of the use of the power against the applicants .", "CARDINAL . ORG , on DATE , unanimously dismissed the applicants ' appeals ( [ DATE ] UKHL CARDINAL ) . Lord PERSON , with whom the other ORG agreed , began by observing :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It is an old and cherished tradition of our country that everyone should be free to go about their business in the streets of the land , confident that they will not be stopped and searched by the police unless reasonably suspected of having committed a criminal offence . So jealously has this tradition been guarded that it has almost become a constitutional principle . But it is not an absolute rule . There are , and have for DATE been , statutory exceptions to it . These appeals concern an exception now found in sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ( ' LAW ) . The appellants challenge the use made of these sections and , in the last resort , the sections themselves . Since any departure from the ordinary rule calls for careful scrutiny , their challenge raises issues of general importance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first issue before ORG was as to the proper construction of the statute . The applicants had argued that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) should be interpreted as permitting an authorisation to be made only if the decision - maker had reasonable grounds for considering that the powers were necessary and suitable , in all the circumstances , for the prevention of terrorism . Lord PERSON rejected this interpretation , since the word \u201c expedient \u201d in the section had a meaning quite distinct from \u201c necessary \u201d . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... But there are other reasons also for rejecting the argument . It is true , as already recognised , that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) , in dispensing with the condition of reasonable suspicion , departs from the normal rule applicable where a constable exercises a power to stop and search . CARDINAL would therefore incline , within the permissible limits of interpretation , to give ' expedient ' a meaning no wider than the context requires . But examination of the statutory context shows that the authorisation and exercise of the power are very closely regulated , leaving no room for the inference that ORG did not mean what it said . There is indeed every indication that ORG appreciated the significance of the power it was conferring but thought it an appropriate measure to protect the public against the grave risks posed by terrorism , provided the power was subject to effective constraints . The legislation embodies a series of such constraints . First , an authorisation under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) may be given only if the person giving it considers ( and , it goes without saying , reasonably considers ) it expedient ' for the prevention of acts of terrorism ' . The authorisation must be directed to that overriding objective . Secondly , the authorisation may be given only by a very senior police officer . Thirdly , the authorisation can not extend beyond the boundary of a police force area , and need not extend so far . Fourthly , the authorisation is limited to a period of DATE , and need not be for so long . Fifthly , the authorisation must be reported to the Secretary of ORG forthwith . Sixthly , the authorisation lapses after TIME if not confirmed by the Secretary of ORG . Seventhly , the Secretary of ORG may abbreviate the term of an authorisation , or cancel it with effect from a specified time . ORG , a renewed authorisation is subject to the same confirmation procedure . Ninthly , the powers conferred on a constable by an authorisation under sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) may only be exercised to search for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism . Tenthly , ORG made provision in section CARDINAL for reports on the working of the LAW to be made to it at least once a year , which have in the event been made with commendable thoroughness , fairness and expertise by Lord PERSON of Berriew QC . Lastly , it is clear that any misuse of the power to authorise or confirm or search will expose the authorising officer , the Secretary of ORG or the constable , as the case may be , to corrective legal action .", "CARDINAL . The principle of legality has no application in this context , since even if these sections are accepted as infringing a fundamental human right , itself a debatable proposition , they do not do so by general words but by provisions of a detailed , specific and unambiguous character . Nor are the appellants assisted by ORG circular . This may well represent a cautious official response to the appellants ' challenge , and to the urging of PERSON that these powers be sparingly used . But it can not , even arguably , affect the construction of section GPE ) . The effect of that sub - section is that an authorisation may be given if , and only if , the person giving it considers it likely that these stop and search powers will be of significant practical value and utility in seeking to achieve the public end to which these sections are directed , the prevention of acts of terrorism . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON rejected the applicants ' contention that the \u201c rolling programme \u201d of authorisations had been ultra vires , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The appellants ' second , and main , ground of attack was directed to the succession of authorisations which had had effect throughout the Metropolitan Police District since DATE , continuing until DATE . It was , they suggested , CARDINAL thing to authorise the exercise of an exceptional power to counter a particular and specific threat , but quite another to authorise what was , in effect , a continuous ban throughout the GPE area . Again this is not an unattractive submission . One can imagine that an authorisation renewed DATE after DATE might become the product of a routine bureaucratic exercise and not of the informed consideration which sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL clearly require . But all the authorisations and confirmations relevant to these appeals conformed with the statutory limits on duration and area . Renewal was expressly authorised by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . The authorisations and confirmations complied with the letter of the statute . The evidence of the Assistant Commissioner and PERSON does not support , and indeed contradicts , the inference of a routine bureaucratic exercise . It may well be that ORG , legislating before the events of DATE , did not envisage a continuous succession of authorisations . But it clearly intended that the section CARDINAL powers should be available to be exercised when a terrorist threat was apprehended which such exercise would help to address , and the pattern of renewals which developed up to DATE ( it is understood the pattern has since changed ) was itself a product of ORG 's principled refusal to confer these exceptional stop and search powers on a continuing , countrywide basis . Reporting on the operation of the CARDINAL Act during DATE and DATE , PERSON ... found that sections DATE and CARDINAL remained necessary and proportional to the continuing and serious risk of terrorism , and regarded GPE as ' a special case , having vulnerable assets and relevant residential pockets in almost every borough ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the question whether either applicant had been deprived of liberty as a result of the stop and search procedure , Lord PERSON commented on the absence of any decision of ORG on closely analogous facts and accepted that there were some features indicative of a deprivation of liberty , such as the coercive nature of the measure . However , since the procedure would ordinarily be relatively brief and since the person stopped would not be arrested , handcuffed , confined or removed to any different place , such a person should not be regarded \u201c as being detained in the sense of confined or kept in custody , but more properly of being detained in the sense of kept from proceeding or kept waiting \u201d . Article CARDINAL did not , therefore , apply .", "CARDINAL . As to the question whether LAW was applicable , Lord PERSON was :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... doubtful whether an ordinary superficial search of the person can be said to show a lack of respect for private life . It is true that ' private life ' has been generously construed to embrace wide rights to personal autonomy . But it is clear Convention jurisprudence that intrusions must reach a certain level of seriousness to engage the operation of the Convention , which is , after all , concerned with human rights and fundamental freedoms , and I incline to the view that an ordinary superficial search of the person and an opening of bags , of the kind to which passengers uncomplainingly submit at airports , for example , can scarcely be said to reach that level . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON did not consider that the power to stop and search under sections DATE , properly used in accordance with the statute and Code A , could be used to infringe a person 's rights under Articles CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite his doubts as to the applicability of LAW , DATE , DATE or DATE , Lord PERSON went on to consider whether the stop and search powers complied with the requirement of \u201c lawfulness \u201d under the Convention , as follows :", "\u201c DATE . The lawfulness requirement in the Convention addresses supremely important features of the rule of law . The exercise of power by public officials , as it affects members of the public , must be governed by clear and publicly - accessible rules of law . The public must not be vulnerable to interference by public officials acting on any personal whim , caprice , malice , predilection or purpose other than that for which the power was conferred . This is what , in this context , is meant by arbitrariness , which is the antithesis of legality . This is the test which any interference with or derogation from a LAW right must meet if a violation is to be avoided .", "CARDINAL . The stop and search regime under review does in my opinion meet that test . LAW informs the public that these powers are , if duly authorised and confirmed , available . It defines and limits the powers with considerable precision . Code A , a public document , describes the procedure in detail . The LAW and the LAW do not require the fact or the details of any authorisation to be publicised in any way , even retrospectively , but I doubt if they are to be regarded as ' law ' rather than as a procedure for bringing the law into potential effect . In any event , it would stultify a potentially valuable source of public protection to require notice of an authorisation or confirmation to be publicised prospectively . The efficacy of a measure such as this will be gravely weakened if potential offenders are alerted in advance . Anyone stopped and searched must be told , by the constable , all he needs to know . In exercising the power the constable is not free to act arbitrarily , and will be open to civil suit if he does . It is true that he need have no suspicion before stopping and searching a member of the public . This can not , realistically , be interpreted as a warrant to stop and search people who are obviously not terrorist suspects , which would be futile and time - wasting . It is to ensure that a constable is not deterred from stopping and searching a person whom he does suspect as a potential terrorist by the fear that he could not show reasonable grounds for his suspicion . It is not suggested that the constables in these cases exercised their powers in a discriminatory manner ( an impossible contention on the facts ) , and I prefer to say nothing on the subject of discrimination . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope of PERSON agreed with Lord PERSON . In particular , he considered that the stop and search power complied with the principle of legality for the following reasons :", "\u201c DATE . The sight of police officers equipped with bundles of the stop / search form CARDINAL which is used to record the fact that a person or vehicle was stopped by virtue of sections CARDINAL ) or CARDINAL ) has become familiar in LOC since the suicide bombings that were perpetrated on DATE and the attempts to repeat the attacks DATE . They can be seen inside the barriers at stations on LOC , watching people as they come through the barriers and occasionally stopping someone who attracts their attention and searching them . Most people who become aware of the police presence are there because they want to use the transport system . The travelling public are reassured by what they see the police doing at the barriers . They are in the front line of those who would be at risk if there were to be another terrorist outrage . But those who are singled out , stopped and searched in this way may well see things differently . They may find the process inconvenient , intrusive and irritating . As it takes place in public , they may well also find it embarrassing . This is likely to be the case if they believe , contrary to the facts , that they are being discriminated against on grounds of race . These features of the process give rise to this question . Are the limits on the use of the power sufficient to answer a challenge that the Convention rights of the person who is searched are being violated because its use is unforeseeable and arbitrary ?", "DATE . From that person 's perspective the situation is one where all the cards are in the hands of the police . It is they , and not the general public , who know that an authorisation is in force and the area that it relates to . It is they who decide when and where within that area they should exercise the power that has been given to them . It is they who decide which persons or which vehicles should be stopped and searched . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) make it clear that the power may be exercised only by a constable in uniform . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) provides that the power may be exercised only for the purpose of searching for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism . But no criterion is laid down in the statute or in any published document as to the precise state of mind that the constable must be in before the power can be exercised .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) provides that the power may be exercised whether or not the constable has grounds for suspecting the presence of articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism . The definition of the word ' terrorism ' for the purposes of the LAW is a wide one , and the matter is left to the judgment of each individual police officer . The first indication that members of the public are likely to get that they are liable to be stopped and searched is when the order to stop is given . Those who are well informed may get some indication as to what is afoot when they see the police with bundles of forms in their hands looking in their direction . But for most people the order to stop will come as a surprise . Unless they are in possession of articles of the kind that the constable is entitled to search for , they may well wonder why they have been singled out for the treatment that they are being subjected to .", "CARDINAL . There is , of course , a strong argument the other way . If the stop and search procedure is to be effective in detecting and preventing those who are planning to perpetrate acts of terrorism it has to be like this . Advertising the time when and the places where this is to be done helps the terrorist . It impedes the work of the security services . Sophisticated methods of disguise and concealment may be used where warnings are given . Those involved in terrorism can be expected to take full advantage of any published information as to when and where the power is likely to be exercised . So the police need to be free to decide when and where the use of the procedure is to be authorised and whom they should stop on the spur of the moment if their actions are to be a step ahead of the terrorist . Must this system be held to be unlawful under LAW on the ground that it is arbitrary ?", "...", "CARDINAL . ... The use of the section CARDINAL power has to be seen in the context of the legislation that provides for it . The need for its use at any given time and in any given place to be authorised , and for the authorisation to be confirmed within TIME , provides a background of law that is readily accessible to the citizen . It provides a system of regulatory control over the exercise of the power which enables the person who is stopped and searched , if he wishes , to test its legality in the courts . In that event the authorisation and the confirmation of it will of necessity , to enable the law to be tested properly , become relevant evidence . The guidance in DATE of Code A warns the constable that the power is to be used only for reasons connected with terrorism , and that particular care must be taken not to discriminate against members of minority ethnic groups when it is being exercised . It is no more precise than that . But it serves as a reminder that there is a structure of law within which the power must be exercised . A constable who acts within these limits is not exercising the section CARDINAL power arbitrarily .", "CARDINAL . As the concluding words of para CARDINAL of the decision in GPE v GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL indicate , the sufficiency of these measures must be balanced against the nature and degree of the interference with the citizen 's Convention rights which is likely to result from the exercise of the power that has been given to the public authority . The things that a constable can do when exercising the section CARDINAL power are limited by the provisions of section CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) . He may not require the person to remove any clothing in public except that which is specified , and the person may be detained only for such time as is reasonably required to permit the search to be carried out at or near the place where the person or vehicle has been stopped . The extent of the intrusion is not very great given the obvious importance of the purpose for which it is being resorted to . In my opinion the structure of law within which it is to be exercised is sufficient in all the circumstances to meet the requirement of legality .", "CARDINAL . It should be noted , of course , that the best safeguard against the abuse of the power in practice is likely to be found in the training , supervision and discipline of the constables who are to be entrusted with its exercise . Public confidence in the police and good relations with those who belong to the ethnic minorities are of the highest importance when extraordinary powers of the kind that are under scrutiny in this case are being exercised . The law will provide remedies if the power to stop and search is improperly exercised . But these are remedies of last resort . Prevention of any abuse of the power in the first place , and a tighter control over its use from the top , must be the first priority . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON of PERSON - under - PERSON observed , inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Given the exceptional ( although , as Lord PERSON has explained , neither unique nor particularly novel ) nature of [ the section DATE ] power ( often described as the power of random search , requiring for its exercise no reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing ) , it is unsurprisingly hedged about with a wide variety of restrictions and safeguards . Those most directly relevant to the way in which the power impacts upon the public on the ground are perhaps these . It can be used only by a constable in uniform ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) . It can be used only to search for terrorist - connected articles ( section GPE ) ( a ) ) . The person searched must not be required to remove any clothing in public except for headgear , footwear , an outer coat , a jacket or gloves ( section CARDINAL ) ) . The search must be carried out at or near the place where the person or vehicle is stopped ( section CARDINAL ) ) . And the person or vehicle stopped can be detained only for such time as is reasonably required to permit such a search ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . Unwelcome and inconvenient though most people may be expected to regard such a stop and search procedure , and radically though it departs from our traditional understanding of the limits of police power , it can scarcely be said to constitute any very substantial invasion of our fundamental civil liberties . Nevertheless , given , as the respondents rightly concede , that in certain cases at least such a procedure will be sufficiently intrusive to engage a person 's article CARDINAL right to respect for his private life , and given too that this power is clearly open to abuse \u2014 the inevitable consequence of its exercise requiring no grounds of suspicion on the police officer 's part \u2014 the way is clearly open to an argument that the scheme is not properly compliant with the Convention requirement that it be ' in accordance with the law . '", "CARDINAL . For this requirement to be satisfied ... not only must the interference with the Convention right to privacy have some basis in domestic law ( as here clearly it does in LAW ) ; not only must that law be adequately accessible to the public ( as here clearly it is \u2014 unlike , for example , the position in GPE v GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL ) ; not only must the law be reasonably foreseeable , to enable those affected to regulate their conduct accordingly ( a requirement surely here satisfied by the public 's recognition , from the very terms of the legislation , that drivers and pedestrians are liable to be subjected to this form of random search and of the need to submit to it ) ; but there must also be sufficient safeguards to avoid the risk of the power being abused or exercised arbitrarily .", "DATE . As I understand the appellants ' argument , it is upon this final requirement that it principally focuses : this power , submits PERSON , is all too easily capable of being used in an arbitrary fashion and all too difficult to safeguard against such abuse . True , he acknowledges , if the power is in fact abused in any particular case the police officer concerned will be liable to a civil claim for damages ( and , no doubt , to police disciplinary action ) . But , he submits , it will usually be impossible to establish a misuse of the power given that no particular grounds are required for its apparently lawful exercise . Assume , for example , that a police officer in fact exercises this power for racially discriminatory reasons of his own , how could that be established ? There are simply no effective safeguards against such abuse , no adequate criteria against which to judge the propriety of its use . Certainly it is provided by paragraph CARDINAL of Code A ( a published code issued CARDINAL of ORG ) that : ' Officers must take particular care not to discriminate against members of minority ethnic groups in the exercise of these powers ' . But , say the appellants , there is simply no way of policing that instruction with regard to the exercise of so wide a random power . No way , that is , submits [ counsel for the applicants ] , unless it is by stopping and searching literally everyone ( as , of course , occurs at airports and on entry to certain other specific buildings ) or by stopping and searching on a strictly numerical basis , say every tenth person . Only in one or other of these ways , the appellants ' argument forces them to contend , could such a power as this be exercisable consistently with the principle of legal certainty : there can not otherwise be the necessary safeguards in place to satisfy the Convention requirement as to ' the quality of the law ' ...", "CARDINAL . I would reject this argument . In the first place it would seem to me impossible to exercise the section CARDINAL power effectively in either of the ways suggested . Imagine that following the GPE bombings DATE the police had attempted to stop and search everyone entering an underground station or indeed CARDINAL ( or CARDINAL ) such person . Not only would such a task have been well nigh impossible but it would to my mind thwart the real purpose and value of this power . That , as Lord PERSON puts it in paragraph CARDINAL of his opinion , is not ' to stop and search people who are obviously not terrorist suspects , which would be futile and time - wasting [ but rather ] to ensure that a constable is not deterred from stopping and searching a person whom he does suspect as a potential terrorist by the fear that he could not show reasonable grounds for his suspicion . ' It is to be hoped , first , that potential terrorists will be deterred ( certainly from carrying the tools of their trade ) by knowing of the risk they run of being randomly searched , and , secondly , that by the exercise of this power police officers may on occasion ( if only very rarely ) find such materials and thereby disrupt or avert a proposed terrorist attack . Neither of these aims will be served by police officers searching those who seem to them least likely to present a risk instead of those they have a hunch may be intent on terrorist action .", "DATE . In his DATE review of the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism ( Temporary Provisions ) Act DATE ( amended as explained by Lord PERSON in paragraph CARDINAL of his opinion ) and GPE ( Emergency LAW Act DATE , Mr PERSON said this of the power to stop and search those entering or leaving GPE with a view to finding out whether they were involved in terrorism :", "' The \u201c intuitive \u201d stop", "CARDINAL . It is impossible to overstate the value of these stops ...", "CARDINAL . I should explain what I mean by an \u201c intuitive stop \u201d . It is a stop which is made \u201c cold \u201d or \u201c at random\u201d\u2014but I prefer the words \u201c on intuition\u201d\u2014without advance knowledge about the person or vehicle being stopped .", "DATE . I do not think such a stop by a trained Special Branch officer is \u201c cold \u201d or \u201c random \u201d . The officer has experience and training in the features and circumstances of terrorism and terrorist groups , and he or she may therefore notice things which the layman would not , or he or she may simply have a police officer 's intuition . Often the reason for such a stop can not be explained to the layman . '", "CARDINAL . Later in his review Mr PERSON noted of the more general stop and search powers originally contained in sections CARDINALA and CARDINAL of the DATE Act that ' these powers were used sparingly , and for good reason ' . I respectfully agree that the section CARDINAL power ( as it is now ) should be exercised sparingly , a recommendation echoed throughout a series of annual reports on QUANTITY by PERSON of ORG , the independent reviewer of the terrorist legislation appointed in succession to Mr Rowe \u2014 see most recently paragraph CARDINAL of his DATE report , suggesting that the use of the power ' could be cut by CARDINAL per cent without significant risk to the public or detriment to policing . ' To my mind , however , that makes it all the more important that it is targeted as the police officer 's intuition dictates rather than used in the true sense randomly for all the world as if there were some particular merit in stopping and searching people whom the officers regard as constituting no threat whatever . In short , the value of this legislation , just like that allowing people to be stopped and searched at ports , is that it enables police officers to make what Mr PERSON characterised as an intuitive stop .", "CARDINAL . Of course , as ORG chaired by Lord PERSON of GPE noted in its DATE report on ORG DATE :", "' Sophisticated terrorists change their profile and methods to avoid presenting a static target . For example , ORG is reported to place particular value on recruiting NORP converts because they judge them to be less likely to be scrutinised by the authorities . '", "It seems to me inevitable , however , that so long as the principal terrorist risk against which use of the section CARDINAL power has been authorised is that from ORG , a disproportionate number of those stopped and searched will be of NORP appearance ( particularly if they happen to be carrying rucksacks or wearing apparently bulky clothing capable of containing terrorist - related items ) .", "CARDINAL . Is such a conclusion inimical to Convention jurisprudence or , indeed , inconsistent with domestic discrimination law ? In my judgment it is not , provided only that police officers exercising this power on the ground pay proper heed to paragraph CARDINAL of Code A :", "' The selection of persons stopped under LAW should reflect an objective assessment of the threat posed by the various terrorist groups active in GPE . The powers must not be used to stop and search for reasons unconnected with terrorism . Officers must take particular care not to discriminate against members of minority ethnic groups in the exercise of these powers . There may be circumstances , however , where it is appropriate for officers to take account of a person 's ethnic origin in selecting persons to be stopped in response to a specific terrorist threat ( for example , some international terrorist groups are associated with particular ethnic identities ) . '", "Ethnic origin accordingly can and properly should be taken into account in deciding whether and whom to stop and search provided always that the power is used sensitively and the selection is made for reasons connected with the perceived terrorist threat and not on grounds of racial discrimination . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants also commenced a claim in ORG on DATE for , inter alia , damages under LAW DATE on the basis that the police had used the stop and search powers unlawfully against each applicant and in breach of LAW , CARDINAL of the Convention , to control or deter their attendance at the demonstration rather than to search for articles linked to terrorism . The claims were stayed pending the outcome of their appeal to ORG and were finally heard in DATE . ORG rejected the applicants ' claims and determined that the power had , in respect to each of them , been properly and lawfully exercised . The applicants did not seek to appeal against this judgment .", "CARDINAL . Police officers have the power to stop and search individuals under a range of legislation . For example , section CARDINAL of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act DATE allows an officer who has reasonable grounds for suspicion to stop and search a person or vehicle to look for stolen or prohibited items . Section CARDINAL of ORG and LAW DATE allows a senior officer to authorise the stop and search of persons and vehicles where there is good reason to believe that to do so would help to prevent incidents involving serious violence or that persons are carrying dangerous instruments or offensive weapons .", "CARDINAL . The police power to stop and search at random where expedient to prevent acts of terrorism was first introduced as a response to the bombing campaign DATE in and around GPE . LAW of ORG DATE inserted a new section CARDINALA into the Prevention of Terrorism ( Temporary LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) in similar terms to LAW CARDINAL of QUANTITY ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , but without any requirement that the Secretary of ORG confirm the authorisation . ORG DATE created an additional , separate power to stop and search pedestrians , under section CARDINALB of the CARDINAL LAW . LAW also established for the first time the confirmation procedure involving the Secretary of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ORG asked Lord PERSON , a ORG judge , to undertake an Inquiry into the need for specific counter - terrorism legislation in GPE following the decrease in terrorism connected to GPE . The Inquiry included consideration of whether there remained a continuing need for a power equivalent to that in sections CARDINALA and CARDINAL of the DATE Act . In his ORG , \u00a7 DATE ) , PERSON noted that DATE the police in GPE had carried out searches of CARDINAL drivers and passengers and CARDINAL pedestrians under sections CARDINALA and CARDINAL of the DATE Act . When considering whether similar powers should be retained in any permanent counter - terrorism legislation that might be enacted , he observed that a decision to give the police a power to stop and search at random was not to be taken lightly . On the other hand there was evidence that a number of terrorists had been intercepted by alert officers on patrol , and in CARDINAL case a potential catastrophe had been averted . He said that there was also reason to believe that terrorists were deterred to some extent by the prospect of police road checks and the consequent risk that they would be intercepted . He commented :", "\u201c As to usage , the figures show that the power has been used with great discretion . The requirement for authorisation by a very senior police officer is an important control mechanism . A number of requests have been turned down . That is reassuring . The police are very sensitive to the damage which would be done if there were ever any grounds for suspecting that the power was being used as anything other than a counter - terrorism measure . \u201d", "In the end Lord PERSON recommended that powers on the lines of the existing sections CARDINALA and DATE should be retained in permanent legislation . He also recommended that the Secretary of ORG 's confirmation should be required in relation to each provision . Since ORG applied the same standards to the terrorism provisions as to other statutory powers to stop and search , he saw no need for additional safeguards .", "CARDINAL .

In others , with obvious targets such as an airport or ORG , there has been more extensive use , as one would expect . There is no part of GPE where the powers have not been used at all between DATE and DATE , the period for which I have statistics . There are huge differences between the boroughs in this context : I take this to be evidence of specific operational decisions by the police .

Having said that , at present there is no other city with continuous section CARDINAL authorisations .", "...", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON 's judgment [ in the present case : see paragraph CARDINAL above ] exactly reflects my own concerns on this front .

That anxiety arises from the contents of DATE , and the difficulty faced in real - time situations by constables confronted by complex legislative decisions .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section DATE , a section CARDINAL/CARDINAL search can be carried out by a constable in an authorised area whether or not he has grounds for suspicion , but may only be ' for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism ' . This calls at least theoretically for officers to pause for thought between ( a ) stop , ( b ) commencement of search , and ( c ) during search . If the search commences as defined in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) , but the officer realises at any given moment that in reality he is searching for non - terrorism articles , he should change gear into a non-[Terrorism Act CARDINAL ] search procedure .

In my view section DATE and section CARDINAL remain necessary and proportional to the continuing and serious risk of terrorism .

However , I would urge ORG and [ the ORG ] ... to produce new , short , clear and preferably nationally accepted guidelines for issue to all officers in DATE authorised areas . All briefings should remind officers that , even where there is a section CARDINAL authorisation , other stop and search powers may be judged more appropriate with some individuals stopped .

I have evidence of cases where the person stopped is so obviously far from any known terrorism profile that , realistically , there is not the slightest possibility of him / her being a terrorist , and no other feature to justify the stop . In CARDINAL situation the basis of the stops being carried out was numerical only , which is almost certainly unlawful and in no way an intelligent use of the procedure . Chief officers must bear in mind that a section CARDINAL stop , without suspicion , is an invasion of the stopped person 's freedom of movement . I believe that it is totally wrong for any person to be stopped in order to produce a racial balance in the section CARDINAL statistics . There is ample anecdotal evidence that this is happening . I can well understand the concerns of the police that they should be free from allegations of prejudice ; but it is not a good use of precious resources if they waste them on self - evidently unmerited searches . It is also an invasion of the civil liberties of the person who has been stopped , simply to ' balance ' the statistics . The criteria for section CARDINAL stops should be objectively based , irrespective of racial considerations : if an objective basis happens to produce an ethnic imbalance , that may have to be regarded as a proportional consequence of operational policing .", "CARDINAL .

My view remains as expressed in DATE , but reinforced : that I find it hard to understand why section CARDINAL authorisations are perceived to be needed in some force areas , and in relation to some sites , but not others with strikingly similar risk profiles . Where other stop and search powers are adequate to meet need , there is no need to apply for or to approve the use of the section . Its primary purpose is to deal with operationally difficult places at times of stress , when there is a heightened likelihood of terrorists gaining access to a significant location . For example , I have no criticism of its careful use at the time of a major demonstration at FAC : terrorists might well use the opportunity of participation in such a demonstration to enter , photograph or otherwise reconnoitre , and otherwise add to their knowledge of a potential target such as FAC . Nor do I criticise its use at or near critical infrastructure or places of especial national significance .", "CARDINAL . I now feel a sense of frustration that ORG still does not limit their LAW authorisations to some boroughs only , or parts of boroughs , rather than to the entire force area . I can not see a justification for the whole of the LOC area being covered permanently , and the intention of the section was not to place GPE under permanent special search powers . However , a pilot project is about to start in which the section is deployed in a different way . I shall examine that project closely . The alarming numbers of usages of the power ( CARDINAL stops per month as we entered DATE ) represent bad news , and I hope for better in a DATE 's time . The figures , and a little analysis of them , show that section DATE is being used as an instrument to aid non - terrorism policing on some occasions , and this is unacceptable .", "CARDINAL . I am sure that safely it could be used far less . There is little or no evidence that the use of section CARDINAL has the potential to prevent an act of terrorism as compared with other statutory powers of stop and search . Whilst arrests for other crime have followed searches under the section , none of CARDINAL of searches has ever resulted in conviction of a terrorism offence . Its utility has been questioned publicly and privately by senior ORG staff with wide experience of terrorism policing .", "CARDINAL . It should not be taken that the lesser usage of section CARDINAL in places other than GPE means that such places are less safe , or more prone to terrorism . There are different ways of achieving the same end . The effect on community relations of the extensive use of the section is undoubtedly negative . Search on reasonable and stated suspicion , though not in itself a high test , is more understandable and reassuring to the public .", "CARDINAL .

A significant number of witnesses expressed serious concerns at the use of counter - terrorism powers on protestors , particularly the power under LAW to stop and search without suspicion . Witnesses suggested that the use of the powers contravened the ORG which note :", "Domestic legislation designed to counter terrorism or ' extremism ' should narrowly define these terms so as not to include forms of civil disobedience and protest ; the pursuit of certain political , religious , or ideological ends ; or attempts to exert influence on other sections of society , the government , or international opinion .", "CARDINAL . ORG complained that the police had relied on LAW to prevent journalists from leaving demonstrations . Some witnesses noted that restrictions on peaceful protests were increasingly justified by reference to the security threat . The following comment by PERSON reflects the views of a number of witnesses :", "... there can be no justification to call upon anti - terrorism legislation to police protests / protestors and such use debases the very real threat terrorists are capable of posing to us all .", "CARDINAL . High profile examples of the inappropriate use of counter - terrorism powers include : preventing PERSON from re - entering the ORG conference in GPE in DATE , following his physical ejection for heckling the then ORG Secretary PERSON MP ; and stopping and searching a protestor and a journalist at an arms fair at FAC in GPE , GPE in DATE . Less well - known examples include the use of stop and search on demonstrators at military bases or people wearing slogans on t - shirts .", "CARDINAL . ORG and the author and commentator PERSON both distinguished protestors ( including animal rights extremists ) from terrorists . Mr PERSON said ' terrorism is a word we ought to reserve for some kind of insurgency , or guerrilla of asymmetrical warfare ' . In contrast , ORG argued in relation to protest against its activities by animal rights activists , however , that ' insufficient consideration was given to counter - terrorism powers in what was widely considered in practice ( but not in name ) to be domestic terrorism ' .", "CARDINAL . When we asked police representatives whether it was appropriate to use counter - terrorism powers against protestors , PERSON replied that ' there are occasions when we do need to use our counter - terrorism powers : I would say that that is why we have them ' .", "CARDINAL . Addressing the same question , the Minister was clear that counter - terrorism powers should only be used in relation to terrorism . He noted that the Prime Minister had ordered a review into the use of stop and search powers and as a result new guidance had been published . He pointed out , however , that :", "If you have a big protest near a big power station or airport , [ ... ] it is very difficult to say that under no circumstances should the police in those situations ever consider using a counterterrorism power when we all know it is perfectly possible for the legitimate protestors to be infiltrated by CARDINAL or CARDINAL who may have other desires ...", "CARDINAL . The new guidance on stop and search noted that the powers to stop and search under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL only allow an officer to ' search for articles of evidence that relate to terrorism ' and that ' [ the section CARDINAL ] power should be used sparingly ' . In the light of the decision of ORG in PERSON , which concerned the use of the stop and search power on protestors and journalists outside an arms fair in the FAC in GPE , the guidance states that stop and search should never be used to conduct arbitrary searches but should be based on objective criteria . The guidance refers to protests , noting that section CARDINAL may be appropriate for large public events that may be at risk from terrorism , but states ' officers should also be reminded at briefings that stop and search powers under LAW CARDINAL must never be used as a public order tactic . ' The only reference to human rights is contained in the section of the guidance on the contents of the community impact assessment : it suggests that ' the requirements of LAW DATE ' should be included in the community impact assessment . Although not specifically referring to journalists , the guidance states that LAW , even where a section CARDINAL designation is in place , does not prevent people from taking photographs . In addition , although film and memory cards may be seized as part of a search , officers do not have a legal power to delete images or destroy film .", "CARDINAL . Whilst we accept that there may be circumstances where the police reasonably believe , on the basis of intelligence , that a demonstration could be used to mask a terrorist attack or be a target of terrorism , we have heard of no examples of this issue arising in practice . We are concerned by the reports we have received of police using counter - terrorism powers on peaceful protestors . It is not clear to us whether this stems from a deliberate decision by the police to use a legal tool which they now have or if individual officers are exercising their discretion inappropriately . Whatever the reason , this is a matter of concern . We welcome the Minister 's comments that counter - terrorism legislation should not be used to deal with public order of protests . We also welcome the recommendation in the new guidance to human rights being included in community impact assessments . We recommend that the new guidance on the use of the section CARDINAL stop and search power be amended to make clear that counter - terrorism powers should not be used against peaceful protestors . In addition , the guidance should make specific reference to the duty of police to act compatibly with human rights , including , for example , by specifying the human rights engaged by protest . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG published a report summarising the conclusions of their review into the use of the power under LAW .
