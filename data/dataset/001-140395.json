NORP Before the demonstration took place , on DATE , ORG was alerted by ORG that the upcoming \u201c Smash ORG \u201d demonstration would be a hostile one and would not aim to highlight any clear political message . ORG did not manage to establish contact with the organisers of the demonstration .", "CARDINAL . The demonstration was to start at TIME on DATE . A separate area was reserved for the representatives of the media so that they could freely and safely observe the situation and take photographs on the demonstration place .", "CARDINAL . At the start of the demonstration , bottles , stones and jars filled with paint were thrown at public and policemen . Some demonstrators kicked and hit police officers . The police announced several times over loudspeakers that a peaceful demonstration was allowed on the spot but that the crowd was not allowed to demonstrate by marching . The crowd tried to break through the police defence line . Relying on all the information in their possession , the police decided to interrupt the demonstration which had now turned violent .

CARDINAL of people then left voluntarily .", "CARDINAL . After the escalation of violence , the police considered that the event had turned into a riot and decided to seal off the demonstration area .

On DATE the GPE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) found the applicant guilty of disobeying the police but did not impose any penalty on him . The court found it established that the applicant had been aware of the orders of the police to leave the scene but had decided to ignore them . It appeared from the witness statements given before the court that the applicant had not told or indicated the arresting police officer that he was a journalist . According to the arresting officer , this fact only became known to him when the relevant magazine appeared .

The court found it further established that the police orders had been clear and that they had clearly concerned everybody . The court balanced the LAW right against other interests , finding that the police had had the right to ask the applicant , among others , including the former Member of ORG , to leave the scene . The interference with the applicant \u2019s right to exercise his freedom of expression had thus been based on law , and it had fulfilled the legitimate aim of preventing disorder .

The applicant was a journalist and that he had not participated in the demonstration or caused any disorder . ORG had not reasoned why his arrest and conviction were \u201c necessary in a democratic society \u201d and had thereby failed to justify the interference .", "CARDINAL .
