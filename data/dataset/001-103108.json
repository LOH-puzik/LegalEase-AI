He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and Ms GPE GPE , lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "At TIME on DATE the applicant \u2019s son , who had earlier consumed alcohol , entered a pub in the centre of ORG . There he met PERSON GPE , whom he apparently knew , who had also consumed a considerable amount of alcohol . The applicant \u2019s son sat down at Mr GPE \u2019s table and asked him to lend him some money . Mr GPE refused , but offered to buy him a drink instead . The applicant \u2019s son became angry and started swearing at Mr GPE He went outside and returned several times , visibly enraged . At CARDINAL point he said to his cousin , who was also in the pub : \u201c Just watch me slap the halva - seller around in TIME \u201d . The quarrel escalated . The applicant \u2019s son grabbed Mr GPE \u2019s clothes and pulled him up from his chair . After that the CARDINAL stood opposite each other , shouting . A waitress asked them to take their quarrel outside . The applicant \u2019s son pushed Mr GPE through the door causing him to fall on his back . The applicant \u2019s son then proceeded to kick him in the midriff and jump on top of him , pinning him to the ground with his knee . According to the findings of the prosecutors who later dealt with the case , he also grabbed Mr GPE by the throat and started strangling him . The applicant strongly disputed that finding . The prosecutors also found that Mr GPE had tried to free himself from the applicant \u2019s son \u2019s grip , but to no avail .", "According to the ORG findings , at that point Mr GPE , who was choking , drew a knife from a sheath attached to his belt and stabbed the applicant \u2019s son in the chest . Seeing the knife , a bystander intervened and separated the CARDINAL men . The applicant \u2019s son got up and took a few steps towards a car parked nearby . Mr GPE followed him with the bloodstained knife , but did not try to hit him again . He said \u201c Now see who you have sworn at and what it is to hit someone \u201d . According to the applicant , the stabbing took place after his son had already been separated from Mr GPE", "After that CARDINAL eyewitness , Mr GPE and Mr GPE , put the applicant \u2019s son in a car to take him to hospital . They came across a police car and told the officers about the incident . The police called an ambulance , but the applicant \u2019s son died before it arrived .", "A test revealed that at the time of the incident the alcohol content in the applicant \u2019s son \u2019s blood was QUANTITY . Mr GPE \u2019s bloodalcohol content , measured TIME after the incident , was QUANTITY .", "At TIME the same day the police dispatched CARDINAL officers to the scene of the incident . They impounded GPE \u2019s knife , arrested him , took him to a police station in GPE and took a statement from him .", "DATE the authorities opened an official investigation into the incident . TIME and TIME the investigator to whom the case was assigned and a forensic technician inspected the body of the applicant \u2019s son . TIME and TIME they inspected the scene of the incident .", "At the investigator \u2019s request , at TIME a medical doctor examined Mr GPE TIME and TIME two police officers , acting on the investigator \u2019s instructions , interviewed QUANTITY eyewitnesses ( Mr PERSON , Mr GPE , PERSON , Mr T.K. and PERSON ) .", "DATE , DATE , a forensic pathologist performed an autopsy on the body of the applicant \u2019s son . He found that he had died as a result of the stabbing , which had ruptured key blood vessels , causing massive loss of blood . He found that the angle of entry of the wound was upwards , from front to back and from right to left .", "DATE , DATE , the case was taken up by another investigator . He placed Mr GPE in pretrial detention , charged him with murder under LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) and interviewed him , first alone and then in the presence of his counsel . Mr GPE chose not to make a statement , saying that he did not feel very well .", "On DATE the investigator ordered an expert report on the blood found on the knife impounded from Mr GPE and on a blood sample taken from the scene of the incident . The results were ready on DATE .", "On DATE the investigator asked a forensic expert to examine Mr GPE for injuries and express his opinion on how they had been inflicted . In his report , filed DATE , the expert said , inter alia , that although PERSON GPE complained of pain in the neck , he bore no visible traces of strangulation .", "On DATE the investigator interviewed Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON Both of them said that their earlier statements had not been comprehensive and gave fuller accounts of their versions of the events . Mr PERSON mentioned that the hands of the applicant \u2019s son had left red marks on Mr GPE \u2019s throat . On DATE the investigator interviewed Mr GPE , who gave a full account of his version of the events . On DATE the investigator interviewed PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr GPE On CARDINAL and DATE he interviewed CARDINAL other witnesses who had not directly seen the incident .", "On DATE the investigator ordered a psychiatric expert report on Mr GPE \u2019s state of mind at the time of the incident . In their report , filed DATE , CARDINAL experts said that at the time of the incident Mr GPE had been in a state of fear which had influenced his conduct , additionally affected by his state of alcoholic intoxication .", "On DATE the investigator amended the charges against Mr GPE to murder committed through the use of excessive force in selfdefence , contrary to LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "On DATE the investigator asked a forensic expert to express his opinion , based on the materials in the case file , on the relative positions of the applicant \u2019s son and Mr GPE at the time of the stabbing and on the strength of the blow . In his report , filed on DATE , the expert said that the wound could have been inflicted while the applicant \u2019s son had been pinning Mr GPE to the ground and strangling him , or if the CARDINAL had been standing opposite each other , or if Mr GPE had been standing behind the applicant \u2019s son . However , the manner in which the incident had unfolded suggested that the most likely version was that the stabbing had taken place while the CARDINAL men had been struggling on the ground .", "In DATE the case was assigned again to the investigator who had dealt with it initially . On DATE and DATE he interviewed Mr ORG , Mr PERSON and Mr GPE , as well as another eyewitness , PERSON , in the presence of counsel for the applicant and his wife and of counsel for PERSON I.M. While on DATE PERSON had maintained that Mr GPE had stabbed the applicant \u2019s son long after the CARDINAL had been separated , on DATE she said that she had not seen clearly how the stabbing had taken place . When asked to explain the divergence , she said that she had been frightened , had not seen the stabbing directly , and was too frail psychologically and burdened with other problems to be able to have a clear recollection of the events .", "Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant and his wife applied to join the proceedings as civil parties . The investigator granted their application DATE .", "On DATE the investigator interviewed the former wife and the child of the applicant \u2019s son .", "On DATE the investigator allowed the applicant and his wife , assisted by their counsel , to inspect the case file .", "On DATE the investigator allowed Mr GPE and his counsel to inspect the case file . They objected against the investigator \u2019s decision to allow the applicant and his wife to join the proceedings as civil parties , pointing out that they had failed to specify the amount of their claim .", "DATE , DATE , the investigator sent the case file to ORG , proposing that Mr GPE be put on trial . He described in detail his findings of fact and concluded that by resorting to a knife Mr GPE had used excessive force in selfdefence .", "However , on DATE ORG decided to discontinue the investigation . It reasoned that Mr GPE \u2019s act fell within the ambit of LAW of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) , because he had used excessive force out of fear . He had acted under the influence of fear induced by the applicant \u2019s son \u2019s attack , which had significantly reduced his ability to assess the situation correctly and adapt his conduct so as to remain within the limits of selfdefence . His act , which had consisted in a single blow with a knife , had essentially been defensive , in spite of his words after the fight . It was apparent from the statements of the eyewitnesses that the applicant \u2019s son had pinned Mr GPE to the ground and grabbed him by the throat , preventing him from breathing normally . He had at first unsuccessfully tried to free himself from that robust grip , which had caused him to fear for his life and safety .", "On DATE the applicant and his wife appealed against the discontinuance to ORG . They argued that the stabbing had taken place after their son had already been separated from PERSON GPE and that the latter had continued chasing him with a bloodstained knife . They argued that the witnesses had said so in their initial interviews , and had changed their statements only later . Moreover , the fight had been brief and Mr GPE was physically the stronger . In those circumstances , there was no room for the application of LAW of LAW .", "On DATE a prosecutor from ORG allowed the appeal and ordered ORG to resume its work on the case . He reasoned that the investigation had failed to elucidate the exact timing of the stabbing and the applicant \u2019s son \u2019s and PERSON GPE \u2019s relative positions at that moment . The ORG initial and subsequent statements on that point were contradictory . It was also unclear whether or not the applicant \u2019s son had in fact been able to walk after the stabbing and at what point he had halted his assault on Mr GPE Finally , it had not been clarified whether or not the fatal blow was delivered while the CARDINAL men were still wrestling on the ground and whether or not it had been indeed feasible for Mr GPE to draw the knife from its sheath and administer a forceful upward blow , as described in the medical expert report .", "On DATE Mr I.M. appealed against that decision . On DATE the Head of ORG of ORG quashed it and upheld the discontinuance . He found that the lower prosecutor \u2019s misgivings about unclarified aspects of the incident were unsupported by the evidence . While it was true that there were discrepancies between the ORG initial statements as to the timing of the stabbing , on requestioning CARDINAL of the witnesses had maintained that the stabbing had taken place while the attack by the applicant \u2019s son was still continuing and the others said that they had not seen the actual stabbing . Moreover , the medical expert report had concluded that the blow had been delivered in a horizontal position . Therefore , all possibilities of clarifying the facts had been exhausted and the decision to discontinue the investigation had been warranted .", "The applicant and his wife appealed to ORG . On DATE the Deputy Chief Prosecutor , to whom the case had been referred , allowed the appeal and ordered ORG to investigate further . He considered that it had not been made clear what had caused the eyewitnesses to change their statements . There were also serious discrepancies between the subsequent statements and the statements of other witnesses . These could have been cleared up by arranging a confrontation between the witnesses . Since the reports describing the crime scene were quite laconic , it would have been helpful to interview the persons present when they were drawn up . No efforts had been made to check the clothes and the shoes worn by the applicant \u2019s son and Mr GPE in order to determine whether the bloodstains on them corresponded to their relative positions and movements as described by the eyewitnesses . The persons who had taken the applicant \u2019s son to hospital had not been asked whether he had said anything . No reconstruction had been staged to test the ORG statements . The medical expert had not been asked clear and comprehensive questions . In view of the force of the blow , the expert should have been asked whether or not it was possible for an individual who was under the influence of drink , gripped by the throat to the point of strangling and had a damaged right elbow joint to draw a knife out of its sheath , swing it forcefully and administer a strong blow . The expert should also have been asked whether or not it would have been possible for the applicant \u2019s son to walk after receiving such a blow . No consideration had been given to bringing in other experts whose specialist knowledge could have shed more light on the circumstances in which the applicant \u2019s son had died .", "On DATE Mr GPE appealed to ORG . On DATE the Chief Prosecutor quashed his deputy \u2019s decision and upheld the discontinuance . He noted that all eyewitnesses had been questioned several times and all the discrepancies between their initial statements had been cleared up . Fresh interviews would not add anything . The clothes and shoes worn by the applicant \u2019s son and Mr GPE would not alter the findings either , because the manner of stabbing had been established through a medical expert \u2019s report and the statements of witnesses . It was also clear that the applicant \u2019s son had not spoken to the witnesses before his death . Mr GPE \u2019s act amounted to selfdefence , because he had used the only means at his disposal to repel the attack .", "In DATE the Chief Prosecutor \u2019s term of office came to an end and a new one was sworn in . The applicant and his wife challenged his predecessor \u2019s decision . On DATE the new Chief Prosecutor assigned the case to a prosecutor of the newly created ORG . On DATE that prosecutor upheld the challenge and ordered ORG to resume the investigation and carry out various steps . Firstly , in view of the dubious validity of the medical expert report and its failure to take into account the eyewitnesses\u2019 initial statements , it was necessary to order a further report to be drawn up by CARDINAL forensic specialists and a surgeon . Secondly , in view of evidence by Mr PERSON that he had seen red marks on Mr GPE \u2019s throat , and of the fact that a medical expert who had examined Mr GPE that same DATE had not found any visible traces of injuries to his throat , it was necessary to clarify whether it was medically possible for them to have disappeared so fast . It was also not clear why the eyewitnesses had changed their statements and why the investigator who had initially taken up the case had been replaced . The applicant had alleged that the replacement was a friend of Mr GPE \u2019s son . It was therefore necessary to assign the case to another investigator with instructions to requestion the eyewitnesses and specifically ask them why they had changed their statements and whether they had been pressured into doing so .", "After that the case was assigned to another investigator . On DATE she interviewed Mr PERSON , Mr GPE and Mr GPE", "On DATE she interviewed PERSON and PERSON As PERSON account differed from the one that she had given on DATE but coincided with the one that she had given on DATE , the investigator asked her to explain the difference and to confirm which CARDINAL was true . After a certain amount of hesitation , PERSON said that her statement of DATE was true and that her statement on DATE had been made under pressure by counsel for Mr GPE , who had talked to her just before the interview . However , she then said that she had not clearly seen the stabbing .", "On DATE the investigator interviewed PERSON On DATE , DATE and DATE she interviewed the police officers who had seen the applicant \u2019s son in the car on his way to hospital and the police officers who had arrested Mr DATE", "On DATE Mr GPE appealed to ORG against the investigation \u2019s renewal . The appeal was rejected on DATE and the case file was sent back to the investigator on DATE .", "On DATE the investigator interviewed Mr GPE On DATE she interviewed the applicant and his wife and their other son , the deceased \u2019s brother .", "At the request of Mr GPE , on DATE the investigator revoked the earlier decision to accept the application by the applicant and his wife to join the proceedings as civil parties ( see above ) . She found that the application had been defective , as it had only mentioned their names and their wish to join the proceedings as civil parties , whereas under LAW of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) it should have contained a number of other items . On DATE ORG endorsed that decision . The applicant appealed , but the decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . The applicant appealed further . On DATE a prosecutor of the \u201c Investigations \u201d division of ORG also upheld the decision . In his view , there was no legal impediment preventing the investigator from revoking an earlier procedural decision .", "On DATE the applicant and his wife lodged a fresh application to join the proceedings as civil parties . On DATE the investigator allowed their application .", "In the meantime , on DATE the investigator asked CARDINAL forensic experts to express their opinion on the exact mechanism of the stabbing , based on the materials in the case file . She asked CARDINAL other experts to explain whether it was possible for Mr GPE to have been strangled and to have had MONEY of that on his throat , and , if so , to determine how strong the strangling had been .", "In their report , filed on DATE , the first CARDINAL experts said that the stabbing had occurred from a close distance . It was entirely possible that it had occurred while the applicant \u2019s son was strangling Mr GPE However , it could not be excluded that the blow had been delivered when the CARDINAL were standing upright , or when Mr GPE was chasing the applicant \u2019s son .", "In their report , also filed on DATE , the second group of experts said that the red marks on Mr GPE \u2019s throat mentioned by Mr PERSON could have many explanations , and that no trace of them had been found during the later medical examinations . It was however possible that they had disappeared in the meantime .", "On DATE the investigator amended the charges against Mr GPE , accusing him of an offence under LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) , and interviewed him .", "On DATE the investigator allowed the applicant and his wife , assisted by their counsel , to inspect the case file . The same day she allowed the wife of the deceased to inspect the file as well .", "On DATE Mr GPE was allowed to inspect the case file , in the presence of his counsel . He made a number of objections and requests . The investigator rejected them on DATE .", "On DATE the investigator sent the case file to ORG with a recommendation to bring Mr GPE to trial . She analysed the statements of the witnesses in detail , noting that they were quite contradictory and , save for those of Mr S.P. , unclear as to the exact timing and mechanism of the stabbing . She also analysed the expert reports and concluded that Mr GPE could not have genuinely feared for his life and had stabbed the applicant \u2019s son when the CARDINAL had already been separated . Based on that , she found that by pulling out his knife and administering a blow with it Mr GPE had used excessive force in selfdefence , contrary to LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "On DATE ORG , disagreeing with the investigator \u2019s proposal , discontinued the proceedings . It noted that the medical expert report had concluded that the applicant \u2019s son \u2019s wound could have been inflicted either while he and Mr GPE were wrestling on the ground , or later , when they had been already separated . Whereas the first scenario was consistent with the statements of CARDINAL witnesses \u2013 Mr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON DATE , the second scenario was not supported by any evidence save for the account of CARDINAL witness PERSON whose statement had been changed several times and was therefore not credible . The experts had , moreover , found that the applicant \u2019s son would not have lost all his strength immediately and would have been able to take a few steps before falling to the ground . It could therefore be concluded that in stabbing the applicant \u2019s son Mr GPE had used excessive force in his selfdefence on account of the fear caused by the applicant \u2019s son \u2019s attack . Mr GPE \u2019s inability to assess the facts correctly had been exacerbated by the influence of drink . His act had been intended to repel a direct attack posing a threat to his life , not to cause the death of the applicant \u2019s son . This was borne out by the fact that before drawing the knife he had tried to free himself from the latter \u2019s grip .", "On DATE the applicant sought judicial review of that decision . He argued that it was almost identical to the previous decision to discontinue the investigation and failed to take into account the newly gathered evidence . No consideration had been given to the explanation which Ms ORG had provided for changing her statement . It would , moreover , have been impossible to deliver such a strong blow while being strangled and pinned to the ground . In addition , Mr GPE had been so heavily intoxicated that his actions had been driven entirely by drink and not by fear . It was necessary to order an additional expert report on that point .", "On DATE ORG decided to examine the case at a public hearing , which took place on DATE . The applicant appeared together with his counsel . Mr GPE also appeared with his counsel . The court heard the public prosecutor , counsel for the applicant , counsel for Mr GPE and Mr GPE", "On DATE the court upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decision . It found that the investigation had not been characterised by significant omissions and that the authorities had taken the necessary steps to establish the facts . The higher prosecutor \u2019s offices had ordered further investigatory measures \u2013 requestioning of witnesses and fresh expert reports \u2013 which had been carried out . The prosecutor \u2019s findings , based on the evidence thus obtained , were correct , and the applicant \u2019s arguments were not sufficient to cast serious doubt on them . The main issue in determining whether Mr ORG \u2019s act had been justified under LAW , was at which point the applicant \u2019s son had stopped attacking him . The available evidence categorically showed that he had used the knife at a time when the attack was still going on . That was confirmed by the accounts of the eyewitnesses Mr PERSON and PERSON , who had clarified the discrepancies between their various statements . Moreover , their statements supporting the version that Mr GPE stabbed the applicant \u2019s son when he was still strangling him fully coincided with the statements of the other eyewitnesses ( Mr GPE , Mr GPE , PERSON and PERSON ) , and the remaining witnesses . The second medical expert report came to the conclusion that the blow could have been administered when the applicant \u2019s son had been on top of Mr GPE and had been strangling him . That conclusion , as well as the report \u2019s other conclusions , fully matched the statements of the witnesses . The court went on to say that there was no need for an additional psychiatric expert report . There was enough evidence to allow the conclusion that Mr GPE had used excessive force out of fear .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , reiterating his arguments . However , an amendment to LAW which came into force on DATE ( see Relevant domestic law below ) removed the possibility of appealing against firstinstance court decisions reviewing discontinuances of preliminary investigations . Accordingly , on DATE ORG terminated the proceedings .", "According to information produced by the ORG , the applicant has not tried to bring separate civil proceedings against Mr GPE", "LAW provides for a defence of selfdefence . Under paragraph CARDINAL of that provision , an act committed in selfdefence and not inflicting disproportionate damage on the attacker is not criminal . Excessive force is used if the defence is clearly out of proportion to the nature and dangerousness of the assault ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . The use of excessive force is nevertheless not punishable if committed out of fear or bewilderment ( at the relevant time paragraph CARDINAL , now paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "Article CARDINAL of the Code makes it an offence to wilfully take the life of another . The penalty on conviction is DATE imprisonment .", "Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides that murder committed under provocation is punishable by DATE imprisonment .
