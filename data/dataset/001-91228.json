ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON .", "On DATE the applicant , PERSON PERSON ( her husband ) and CARDINAL children ( PERSON NORP born in DATE and ORG born in DATE ) moved into a ORG - owned flat in GPE , GPE , under a specially protected tenancy agreement . On DATE the applicant divorced Mr O.V. According to the applicant , since their divorce she and Mr ORG have made continuous , but unsuccessful , efforts to exchange the flat for CARDINAL smaller ones .", "In DATE the applicant resigned from her job in the GPE port and sent her children to school in GPE , GPE , where they acquired temporary registration at the flat of some people she knew for the period of their studies . In DATE the elder daughter , ORG , entered university in GPE and subsequently moved to a dormitory .", "On an unspecified date in DATE Mr GPE instituted civil proceedings against the applicant and the children , seeking termination of their tenancy . He alleged that the CARDINAL of them had established a new home at an unknown address in GPE , where the applicant had met another man , visited the GPE flat only on occasion for leisure purposes and were no longer interested in occupying it on a permanent basis .", "On DATE the applicant was served with a summons at her GPE address , but it was returned undelivered .", "On DATE the ORG heard the case in the applicant \u2019s absence and allowed Mr ORG claim . This judgment was not appealed against and became final .", "On DATE Mr PERSON registered the applicant and the children from the flat and on CARDINAL DATE privatised it in his name .", "On DATE he sold the flat to the B. family .", "According to the applicant , she learned about the judgment and the subsequent transactions concerning the flat in DATE , when the B. family moved in and changed the locks .", "On DATE the applicant solicited signatures from CARDINAL residents of her building and the neighbouring one , attesting to the fact that she had resided in the flat and left it only on occasion .", "Some time before DATE the case file was lost and subsequently restored by DATE .", "On DATE the applicant alleged before ORG that the judgment of DATE was unfair , in particular , as she had not been accorded an opportunity to participate in the proceedings .", "On an unspecified date the applicant requested ORG of GPE to lodge an application for supervisory review ( protest ) against this judgment . On DATE a protest was lodged and on DATE the ORG of ORG of the GPE quashed the judgment , referring , in particular , to the insufficiency of evidence to the effect that the applicant had been duly notified of the court proceedings . The case was referred back for fresh consideration .", "On DATE the applicant and her daughter ORG , who had reached the age of majority , lodged a counter - claim , seeking to annul the privatisation of the flat and the subsequent contract of sale . The applicant maintained that she had lived in the flat on a permanent basis . In support of her allegation , she provided copies of certificates of her dental treatment in GPE in DATE and her temporary employment with \u201c N. \u201d , a private company , DATE and DATE .", "On DATE ORG allowed PERSON claim and dismissed the counter - claims . It found that the applicant had failed to show that after DATE she and her children had used the apartment as a permanent residence . The court acknowledged that they might have visited it on occasion , but found this fact insufficient to justify their interest in retaining the specially protected tenancy . In its reasoning the court referred , in particular , to the testimonies of QUANTITY neighbours , given at the hearing , according to which the applicant and the children were around occasionally ; depositions by CARDINAL other neighbours , given to a local constable , providing analogous information ; absence of any evidence that the applicant had been receiving correspondence at her GPE address in the period in question ; absence of any records in the municipal health - care facility concerning the applicant \u2019s children in DATE ; and absence of any evidence that the applicant had paid utility and other charges related to the apartment in the period in question .", "The applicant and ORG appealed . They challenged the witness statements as unreliable and inconsistent and referred to the court \u2019s failure to question the QUANTITY neighbours , who had certified in DATE that the applicant and the children had regularly resided in the flat . They further noted that their belongings had remained in the flat until PERSON ORG had moved them into a garage prior to the sale . They also noted that no evidence had been presented to the effect that they had established a permanent residence in GPE or elsewhere . In addition , in DATE and DATE the applicant and PERSON , respectively , had obtained NORP passports , being registered as the flat residents , which demonstrated their continuous interest in residing in GPE . As regards the payment of the charges , they maintained that the applicant had been unable to pay them , as she had been destitute , receiving no child support from Mr GPE and taking odd jobs .", "Mr PERSON filed an objection against this appeal , alleging that he had provided financial support to the children until their departure for GPE and , had the applicant been in a destitute situation , she could have sought child support from him through court proceedings . Neither had she presented any documents to prove that she had any employment in GPE . Moreover , she could not have been employed , as she had even failed to obtain a tax identification number , necessary for employment according to legislation which had been implemented at the material time . He further alleged that the applicant had moved to GPE because she had met a new \u201c father \u201d for the children and had attempted to manage without having any contact with him ( Mr GPE ) , except on her occasional visits . Her conduct had hindered his ability to exchange the flat , notwithstanding his considerable efforts , certified by relevant documents . Therefore , unable to pay the charges , which were calculated on an assumption that CARDINAL persons lived in the flat , Mr GPE had to de - register his former family members from the flat and sell it . As regards the CARDINAL neighbours who had allegedly supported the applicant \u2019s position , PERSON PERSON noted that she had been given leave to bring them to court , but had failed to secure their appearance . He also mentioned that they were not immediate neighbours and could not in open court stand by their earlier statements , which had , in his opinion , been given by them under pressure from the applicant .", "A representative of the PERSON family also filed an objection , noting , in particular , that if the applicant had lived in the flat on a permanent basis , as she had submitted , she would not have learned about its privatisation and sale with such a delay . Moreover , the certificate of her employment in GPE in DATE had been issued by a fake company and was not in accordance with the law .", "On DATE ORG of the LOC upheld the previous judgment , referring , in particular , to the fact that the applicant had failed to secure the appearance of her witnesses and that there was no reason to consider that the PERSON family had acquired the flat in bad faith .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal in cassation .", "The relevant provisions of the LAW read as follows :", "\u201c Everyone has the right to housing . The ORG creates conditions that enable every citizen to build , purchase as property , or to rent housing .", "ORG in need of social protection are provided with housing by the ORG and bodies of local self - government , free of charge or at a price affordable for them , in accordance with the law .", "No one shall be forcibly deprived of housing other than on the basis of the law pursuant to a court decision \u201d .", "The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c ORG shall have a right to obtain residential LOC from the ORG or public housing stock for use during an indefinite period according to the established procedure ...
