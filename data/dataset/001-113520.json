The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The case originated in a labour dispute following the applicant \u2019s transfer to a different post within a company providing electro - installation ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the company \u201d ) . Subsequently , the applicant lodged several claims with ORG requesting , inter alia , the annulment of the transfer decision , and payment of the difference in salary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court gave a decision upholding the applicant \u2019s claims . The company appealed . On DATE the second - instance court upheld the company \u2019s appeal and remitted the case for fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision whereby it upheld the applicant \u2019s claims and annulled the transfer decision . It found that the transfer was related to the applicant \u2019s involvement in trade union activities and his efforts to improve human relations in the company . The company , in the court \u2019s view , had failed to demonstrate that there were work - related needs which called for a transfer . The court adjudicated that the applicant should be paid the difference in salary . The company appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the appeal . The CARDINAL - judge panel , presided over by judge PERSON , found that the first - instance court had failed to provide adequate reasoning in its decision ; in particular , it had failed to explore whether lawful grounds for the transfer existed , such as an increased need for resources with respect to the applicant \u2019s new post . In the Higher Court \u2019s view , the lower court should examine the director and the chief of commerce as witnesses . The case was remitted for fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stayed the proceedings since bankruptcy proceedings had been instituted against the company .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the court repeatedly requested the applicant to inform it of the progress of the proceedings relating to the company \u2019s bankruptcy and to specify whether he still had an interest in pursing the proceedings in his case . The applicant supplied the required information concerning the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings on DATE , and requested that the proceedings in his case be continued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court resumed the proceedings in so far as they concerned the allegedly unlawful transfer to another post and loss of salary , and dismissed the remaining claims . The applicant lodged an appeal and an appeal on points of law . Both were rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after holding CARDINAL hearings and examining witnesses , issued a judgment dismissing the applicant \u2019s claims . It found that the applicant \u2019s transfer to a different post within the company had been lawfully based on the company \u2019s need to adapt to changes in the market , and that he was therefore not entitled to any compensation . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal and upheld ORG judgment . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law in which he complained about , inter alia , not being present at one of the hearings , and his claims being previously upheld but eventually rejected owing to improper conduct of the court \u2019s proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , CARDINAL of whom was judge PERSON , rejected the appeal on points of law , finding that the lower courts had not committed any errors in the application of the procedural rules and that the applicant had been provided with an opportunity to participate in all hearings . It also noted that the previous court \u2019s decisions had been quashed because they had been found to be erroneous . Lastly , ORG found that the relevant substantive law had been properly applied to the facts of the case as established by the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal in which he disputed the findings of ORG and complained that the proceedings had been biased because of the involvement of judge PERSON , who had previously decided in favour of the company \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal on procedural grounds , stating that on account of the terminated bankruptcy proceedings against the company and the fact that the company had been deleted from the register of companies , the applicant no longer had any legal interest . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Further to the ORG \u2019s communication of the present application to the respondent Government , ORG informed the applicant that no settlement offer would be made . The ORG considered that no violation of the right to a trial within a reasonable time had occurred in his case . That letter was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant initiated proceedings before ORG , claiming damages for undue delays in the above - mentioned labour proceedings . He referred to LAW without undue Delay ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) and on that basis claimed LAW for non - pecuniary damage . He further claimed ORG CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage on the basis of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court held a hearing on DATE . On DATE it issued a judgment rejecting the applicant \u2019s claim for ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , finding that it had no basis in law . As regards the claim for LAW , the court found that it had jurisdiction to decide on it as the case fell under LAW . However , the court dismissed the claim as it had been lodged outside the DATE time - limit provided for by paragraph QUANTITY of LAW . It found that the applicant had received the letter from ORG on DATE and should therefore have lodged the compensation claim under LAW no later than CARDINAL DATE . The applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW ( Official consolidated version UPBCARDINAL , ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) read as follows :", "\u201c A judge or a lay judge shall be prohibited from exercising judicial functions :", "...", "( CARDINAL ) if he or she has participated in the same proceedings before a lower court ...", "( CARDINAL ) NORP if other circumstances raise doubts about his or her impartiality . \u201d", "\u201c If a judge or a lay judge discovers that there exists a reason for exclusion mentioned in CARDINAL of points CARDINAL to CARDINAL of section QUANTITY , he or she must immediately cease to perform any work in the case and must notify the President of the court , who shall appoint a replacement judge .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
