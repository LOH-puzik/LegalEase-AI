On DATE the applicant company purchased goods from another company ( \u201c the supplier \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Both companies were registered under LAW DATE ( \u201c the VAT Act \u201d ) and the transaction constituted a taxable supply under the said Act .", "CARDINAL . NORP The total cost of the received supply was MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) , of which ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) was the value of the goods and ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) was value - added tax ( \u201c VAT \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The supplier issued invoice no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL to the applicant company , which the latter paid in full , including the VAT of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company recorded the purchase in its accounting records for DATE and filed its ORG return for that period by DATE .", "CARDINAL . The supplier , on the other hand , did not record the sale in its accounting records for DATE , but for DATE , and reported it in its GPE return for the latter period , which it filed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the tax authorities conducted a VAT audit of the applicant company covering the period from DATE . In the course of the inspection a cross - check of the supplier was conducted in order to ascertain whether it had properly reported and recorded the supply in its accounting records . As a result , the above reporting discrepancy was discovered ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the \u201c ORG of ORG issued the applicant company with a tax assessment . It refused the applicant company the right to deduct the ORG it had paid to its supplier ( \u201c the input NORP \u201d ) , amounting to ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) , because the supplier had entered the supply in its accounting records for DATE and had reported it for that period rather than for DATE . ORG therefore considered that no VAT had been \u201c charged \u201d on the supply in the DATE tax period , that the applicant company could not therefore deduct the amount it had paid to its supplier as GPE and , furthermore , that it was liable to pay the VAT on the received supply a second time . Accordingly , it ordered the applicant company to pay the ORG in the amount of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) into the ORG budget , together with interest of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) for the period from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company appealed against the tax assessment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal and upheld the tax assessment in its entirety . It recognised that the applicant company had fully complied with its VAT reporting obligations in respect of the received supply , but found that the supplier had failed to enter its invoice in its own accounting records on the date it had been issued , DATE , and had not reported its ORG - taxable supply for DATE as it should have done . It therefore concluded that no VAT had been \u201c charged \u201d on the supply in question and that the applicant company was accordingly not entitled to deduct the input ORG , in spite of the fact that the supplier had subsequently reported the supply for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed against the decision of ORG on DATE , arguing that it could not be denied the right to deduct the input ORG solely because of its supplier \u2019s belated compliance with its LOC reporting obligations . The applicant company also claimed that the supplier \u2019s right to deduct the VAT it had paid to its own supplier had been recognised by its tax office , while the applicant company was being denied that right . In its submissions the applicant company relied , inter alia , on LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal and upheld the decisions of the tax directorates . It stated as follows :", "\u201c The ORG finds that the ... objection of the [ applicant company ] is ... unsubstantiated . In particular , [ the applicant company objected that ] it had been the compliant party , while the supplier had not complied with its obligations . The right to ... [ deduct the input VAT ] arises for the recipient of a [ taxable ] supply only if the supplier has fulfilled the conditions under section CARDINAL in conjunction with section CARDINAL of LAW . The LAW does not differentiate between the parties to a supply transaction as regards compliance ; the court can not therefore introduce such an element into this judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG concurred with the findings and conclusions of the tax authorities and stated the following :", "\u201c ... In this case the non - compliance of the supplier impacts unfavourably on the recipient ... , because the right to recover the [ input ORG ] does not arise for [ the latter ] and it does not matter that the recipient of the [ taxable ] supply [ acted ] in good faith and [ was ] compliant ... , as this is irrelevant for the [ purposes of ] taxation . ... There [ is ] also [ no ] ... violation of ... LAW , because the refusal to recognise the claimant \u2019s right to [ deduct the input ORG ] under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW did not violate its property rights , due [ to the fact that ] the recognition of its substantive right [ to deduct ] under LAW of LAW is conditional on the actions of its supplier and [ the latter \u2019s ] discharge [ of its obligations ] vis - \u00e0 - vis [ the ORG ] budget . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . LAW came into force on DATE . Although at the time GPE was not a member of ORG ( ORG ) , domestic NORP legislation in many respects followed the provisions of ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of CARDINAL DATE on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member GPE relating to turnover taxes , known as the Sixth ORG , which at the time was the principal basis for the system of valueadded tax in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In general , GPE was charged on the price due for a supply of goods or services plus certain costs , taxes and charges not including the ORG itself . Most domestic supplies of goods and services , as well as imports , were subject to the standard rate of PERCENT VAT .", "CARDINAL . VAT was generally reported and paid DATE . LOC returns had to be filed and DATE ORG payments made by DATE of DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , any person ( legal or natural , resident or nonresident ) who had a taxable turnover exceeding BGN CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) during any preceding DATE period was obliged to register for GPE purposes ( section CARDINAL ) . Voluntary and optional registration was also possible in certain cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when GPE became a member of the GPE , LAW was replaced by a new act of the same name .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time the input VAT \u2013 the so - called \u201c tax credit \u201d under domestic legislation \u2013 was the amount of tax which a ORG person had been charged under LAW for receipt of a taxable supply of goods or services , or for imported goods , in a given tax period , which the person in question had the right to deduct ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . During the relevant period and in the context of the present case , where the ORG incurred on supplies exceeded the LOC charged on sales in a given tax period , the excess GPE was first carried forward for DATE to offset any VAT debt due in DATE , as well as other liabilities to the ORG ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . If at the end of the DATE period the excess ORG , or part thereof , had still not been recovered , the balance was refunded within a further DATE ( section CARDINAL ) . This period could be extended if the tax authorities initiated a tax audit ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , section CARDINAL of LAW provided that the recipient of a supply could deduct the input GPE when the following conditions were fulfilled :", "( a ) the recipient of the supply on which ORG had been charged was a GPE - registered person ;", "( b ) the ORG had been charged by the supplier , who was a ORG person , at the latest on the date of issuance of the ORG invoice ;", "( c ) LOC was chargeable on the supply in question ;", "( d ) the goods or services received were used , were being used or would be used for GPE - taxable supplies ; and ,", "( e ) the recipient was in possession of a ORG invoice which met the statutory requirements .", "CARDINAL . Further to the above , in respect of item ( b ) , ORG was considered during the relevant period to have been charged when the supplier :", "( CARDINAL ) issued an invoice which indicated the VAT ;", "( CARDINAL ) recorded the issuance of the invoice in its sales register ;", "( CARDINAL ) entered the LOC charged in its accounting records as a liability to the ORG budget ; and", "( CARDINAL ) declared the ORG charged in its GPE return filed with the tax authorities ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , GPE was not a member of ORG . Accordingly , the acquis communautaire was not directly applicable or transposed into domestic legislation . However , as noted above , its domestic GPE legislation in many respects followed the provisions of the Sixth VAT Directive ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , it is worth mentioning in the context of the present case the following CARDINAL judgments of ORG of ORG ) , which examine the entitlement of the recipient of a supply to reimbursement of the VAT charged on such a supply in cases of suspected \u201c carousel fraud \u201d . This type of fraud , a kind of GPE missing trader intra - Community fraud , occurs when goods are imported GPE - free from other Member GPE , are then re - sold through a series of companies at GPE - inclusive prices and subsequently re - exported to another Member State with the original importer disappearing without paying over to the tax authorities the VAT paid by its customers .", "CARDINAL .

The right to deduct input value added tax of a taxable person who carries out such transactions can not be affected by the fact that in the chain of supply of which those transactions form part another prior or subsequent transaction is vitiated by value added tax fraud , without that taxable person knowing or having any means of knowing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a similar judgment of DATE in joined Cases C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL and C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON ORG ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and NORP State v GPE ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ( ECR DATE , page I-CARDINAL ) , the LOC went on to state the following .", "\u201c Where a recipient of a supply of goods is a taxable person who did not and could not know that the transaction concerned was connected with a fraud committed by the seller , LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of CARDINAL DATE on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member GPE relating to turnover taxes \u2013 Common system of value added tax : uniform basis of assessment , as amended by ORG DATE , must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes a rule of national law under which the fact that the contract of sale is void \u2013 by reason of a civil law provision which renders that contract incurably void as contrary to public policy for unlawful basis of the contract attributable to the seller DATE causes that taxable person to lose the right to deduct the value added tax he has paid . It is irrelevant in this respect whether the fact that the contract is void is due to fraudulent evasion of value added tax or to other fraud .", "By contrast , where it is ascertained , having regard to objective factors , that the supply is to a taxable person who knew or should have known that , by his purchase , he was participating in a transaction connected with fraudulent evasion of value added tax , it is for the national court to refuse that taxable person entitlement to the right to deduct . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
