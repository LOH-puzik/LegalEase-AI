The applicant was born in DATE and is detained .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE preliminary proceedings were initiated against the applicant based on the suspicion that he had committed violent acts against his spouse , PERSON On DATE PERSON was examined at the request of the public prosecutor \u2019s office by the investigating judge , PERSON , after the latter had decided , at the suggestion of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , to exclude the applicant from the hearing under LAW of LAW , since there was a risk , given the nature of the reported offences , that GPE would not testify or would not tell the truth in the applicant \u2019s presence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge , at the request of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , issued an arrest warrant for the applicant and also assigned counsel to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and detained on remand . On DATE the ORG assigned a lawyer of his choice as his counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG opened the main proceedings against the applicant . PERSON , who was also summoned to appear on that date , informed the court that she did not wish to give evidence .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE , the investigating judge was examined on the evidence he had obtained from his examination of GPE on DATE . ORG rejected an objection by the applicant \u2019s counsel on the grounds that it was permissible to examine the investigating judge even if the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW ( d ) of the LAW had been breached by PERSON \u2019s examination . Only when adjudicating the case could it be decided whether the investigating judge \u2019s statements could be admitted as evidence or not , which , in line with the ORG \u2019s case - law , would depend on whether it had been corroborated by other significant factors independent of that evidence .", "CARDINAL . At that same hearing , Officers Ra . and PERSON . were examined as witnesses with regard to the description of events given to them by PERSON when they had arrived at PERSON \u2019s home on DATE ( see paragraphs DATE below ) . The applicant \u2019s counsel objected to the use of the evidence obtained from the examination of these CARDINAL witnesses on the grounds that \u201c the depicted facts can not be separated chronologically and sequentially \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE , PERSON stated that she did not consent to the use of the evidence which she had provided to the investigating judge , to Officers Ra . and PERSON . and to the court - appointed medical expert ; nor did she consent to the use of the results of the medical examination .", "CARDINAL .

ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . In addition , it ordered his subsequent preventive detention , finding that the applicant had a dissocial personality disorder and that there was a very high likelihood that he would commit similar offences in the future .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant was convicted several times of , inter alia , several different counts of assault against his respective partners at different times . He met his third wife , PERSON , in DATE . Their relationship was from the outset marked by the applicant \u2019s violent behaviour towards GPE , which escalated in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in their marital home the applicant asked GPE about her past sex life . He then beat her on different parts of her body and kicked her . Following this he asked her to go to the basement and , while going there , stubbed out a cigarette on her neck . When they arrived in the basement , he asked her to write a letter to the wife of a former lover of hers and to confess to adultery . When PERSON refused , he delivered several blows all over her body , including her head and face , and also beat her with a wooden hiking pole . PERSON then promised to write the letter . TIME the applicant asked her again to write the letter and delivered blows with his fist , primarily to her head . After having left PERSON alone in the living room , the applicant later returned with a mattress and demanded that she undress and to lie down on her stomach . He then beat her with a thin rope on her back , before forcing her to carry out sexual acts on herself .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , PERSON started to write the said letter by hand . When reading the draft , the applicant was angry about its content . PERSON stated that she would write it again . The applicant delivered blows with his fist , mostly to her head , and also beat her with his shoes on the back of her head . He then stubbed out a cigarette on her left breast . PERSON tried to run away but fell down in the hallway . The applicant then choked her so that she could not breathe . In unknown circumstances , PERSON managed to escape and ran into the street in panic , crying for help .", "CARDINAL . There , she ran into PERSON and PERSON . , the latter telling her to go to the home of the PERSON family . She ran over and rang the bell . PERSON opened the door and let her in . PERSON . [ probably PERSON , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ] went to the house of the Sch . family and called the police from there . During that call , PERSON and PERSON . went outside and saw the applicant leave the home and drive off . They reported the number plate of the car to PERSON .

She showed the counsellor there , PERSON , MONEY of injury on her head and other parts of her body and described the bodily harm and coercion to which the applicant had subjected her in the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The investigating judge , PERSON , stated that he had questioned PERSON for TIME on DATE at the request of the public prosecutor \u2019s office ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . She had described a multitude of acts of domestic violence in the course of the marriage , which had increased over time , and repeatedly stated that she loved the applicant , which was why she had not come forward before . The violence DATE and DATE had constituted an escalation and had been too much for her , rendering their living together impossible , which was why she was now ready to testify against the applicant . She had described the events of DATE and DATE as several acts of torment stretched out over the whole DATE with some breaks in between . He had asked her about every single incident , to which she had given definite and detailed accounts of each , including beatings with a rope , a wooden hiking pole and shoes , as well as being forced to carry out sexual acts on herself . Her account had been consistent and she had not been evasive , maintaining eye contact throughout . She had repeatedly stated that the applicant had beaten her DATE and DATE in connection with a letter which the applicant had wanted her to write to the wife of a former lover of hers ; she had started to write that letter by hand .", "CARDINAL . R.K. later retracted her statements as reported by the investigating judge and made voluntary disclosures on DATE and on DATE to the police for having wrongfully incriminated the applicant , claiming that he had not been at home DATE and DATE and that a third person had injured her . On DATE PERSON submitted a written statement to ORG retracting the voluntary disclosures of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The only statement the applicant made during the trial was to confirm that he did not have a driving licence . He did not comment on the remainder of the charges against him .", "CARDINAL . N. , the women \u2019s shelter \u2019s counsellor , testified that she had received a copy of the police report and had discussed the report and the events with PERSON when she had been admitted to the shelter on DATE in a severely traumatised state . PERSON \u2019s statements had been consistent with the police report . She had provided a detailed account of all the incidents that had taken place DATE and DATE , and had consistently named the applicant as the perpetrator . That same evening , she had also showed her her injuries , in particular bleeding head wounds , burn marks on her left breast and neck , and several bruises and weals on her back . N. had discussed the violent events with PERSON up until the former \u2019s examination before ORG . Throughout these discussions , PERSON \u2019s account had been consistent .", "CARDINAL . Re . PERSON , PERSON \u2019s son , who had been born in DATE , stated that on DATE he had been in his room from where he had heard the applicant and PERSON having an argument and screaming . He had later learned that his mother had been at a neighbour \u2019s home , where he had met her together with the police officers . His mother had been pressing a cloth against her head . He had then gone to the hospital together with her . He had not seen what had happened in the house and had , overall , not noticed much of the events that had occurred DATE .", "CARDINAL . S. , a witness , said that he had been at a local sports meeting with another witness , PERSON . , on DATE . At around TIME , when they had been walking in the direction of the village , PERSON had run towards them on FAC , shouting \u201c Help ! Help ! My husband is going to kill me ! \u201d PERSON had been so shocked and disturbed that she had not been able to speak clearly . PERSON had advised her to go to the home of the PERSON family . He himself had then gone to the home of the Sch . family to call the police . While he had been on the phone to the police , PERSON . told him that the applicant had driven off . PERSON . had then given the registration number to PERSON , who passed it on to the police . When PERSON had gone back outside , he had met Re . PERSON , who had been shaking , and had asked him about PERSON He had then led the police to the house of the PERSON family . When the door had opened , he had seen PERSON sitting on the stairs , with a bloody cloth pressed on her head . The police then took charge and he left the scene .", "CARDINAL . M. , a witness , stated that CARDINAL DATE , the doorbell rang . PERSON was standing outside , shouting \u201c My husband , my husband ! He \u2019s out to get me . He must n\u2019t see me . \u201d PERSON , who had been terrified , immediately entered the house and sat down on the stairs . She had been bleeding from her head . Later , the police had arrived and called an ambulance . PERSON \u2019s mother added that she had given PERSON a towel for her bleeding head wound and that PERSON had repeatedly expressed fear of her husband . She had never seen a woman so terrified before , which had overwhelmed her so much that she had not asked PERSON about what had happened .", "CARDINAL . PERSON . , a witness , testified that PERSON had rung her door bell on DATE . S. had told her that he had had to call the police as it had seemed that the applicant had harmed his wife . She had then gone outside her house and looked towards the applicant \u2019s house located QUANTITY away . She had observed the applicant leaving his house and driving off . She had told that to PERSON , who had asked her to spell out the car \u2019s number plate , which she had done . PERSON . made similar statements .", "CARDINAL . Officers Ra . and PERSON . explained that they had been patrolling together on DATE when they had received the call to drive to the village B. , where a woman had run out of a house screaming and had been hiding at a neighbour \u2019s residence . Several persons had been present when they had arrived at the scene , informing them that PERSON had been at the house of the PERSON family . When they had gone there , they had found PERSON in shock , pressing a cloth to the back of her head . When PERSON . had asked her what had happened , she had stated that her husband had beaten her . PERSON had then given additional evidence , which was later discarded ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She had had a bleeding wound on the back of her head and visible facial bruising . In the beginning , she had been shaking so much that it had not been possible to question her .", "CARDINAL . A draft letter to the wife of a former lover of hers , in which PERSON stated that she wanted to clear up her life and that adultery was a sin , was read out before ORG . Officer PERSON . had stated that PERSON , after having made her statement to the police and having been examined in hospital , had asked to be admitted to a women \u2019s shelter . She had requested that they stop by the marital home beforehand and for the police officers to accompany her . Besides taking some of her belongings , she had given the letter to PERSON . and asked him to keep it . Ra . had included the letter in the case file .", "CARDINAL . Another letter by GPE of DATE , addressed to the applicant , was read out before ORG , in which she described examples of acts committed by him from DATE , reporting the assaults , humiliations and sexual acts to which she had submitted for fear of receiving even more blows .", "CARDINAL . ORG relied , inter alia , on the testimony PERSON had given at her examination by the investigating judge . It considered that the applicant had rightly been barred from attending that hearing . However , since LAW ( d ) of the ORG guaranteed the applicant \u2019s right to examine or have examined witnesses against him , defence counsel should have been appointed for the applicant so that the latter could examine PERSON at that hearing . Yet , the mere fact that neither the applicant nor his counsel had had the opportunity to cross - examine PERSON did not automatically constitute a breach of LAW and CARDINAL ( d ) of the Convention . It was decisive whether the proceedings in their entirety , including the manner in which evidence had been taken and assessed , had been fair . Where the lack of an opportunity to cross - examine a witness had been a result of procedural errors imputable on the judiciary , as in the present case , the ORG found a breach of the Convention where the conviction had been based to a decisive extent on the evidence of the untested witness . A conviction could thus only be based on untested evidence where it was corroborated by other significant factors independent of that evidence . In the present case , the applicant \u2019s conviction could be based on GPE \u2019s statements as reported by the investigating judge , for they were corroborated by other significant factors independent of them .", "CARDINAL . In this regard , ORG referred to PERSON \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE , in which she had described examples of acts committed by the applicant from DATE , reporting the assaults , humiliations and sexual acts to which she had submitted for fear of receiving even more blows ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Her statement that the applicant had struck her in order to make her compose a letter to the wife of a former lover of hers had been corroborated by the draft letter with the content she had described which she had given to LOC . ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Both letters had been admitted as evidence , as a witness \u2019s written statements could be admitted even in a case where he or she lawfully refused to give evidence at trial .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , witness ORG of the women \u2019s shelter in which PERSON had sought refuge had , on DATE of PERSON \u2019s admission to the shelter , observed wounds in the head area , some of which had been bleeding , and burn marks on PERSON \u2019s left breast and neck as well as various bruises and weals on her back which PERSON had shown her . During her stay in the shelter , PERSON had repeatedly described to ORG the details of the applicant \u2019s violent acts ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Re . PERSON , PERSON \u2019s son , who was in the marital home on DATE , stated that he had heard the applicant and PERSON having an argument and screaming ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Other witnesses reported that PERSON had run into the street in panic DATE , with a bleeding wound on the back of her head , and had subsequently sought refuge with the PERSON family until the police had arrived , while the applicant had been seen leaving the house and driving off following that ( see paragraphs DATE above ) . Therefore , ORG was convinced that PERSON \u2019s subsequent voluntary disclosures , in which she had mainly claimed that the applicant had not been at home and which she had subsequently retracted ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , had not been truthful .", "CARDINAL . PERSON \u2019s initial statements to Officers PERSON . and PERSON . , as reported by them ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , were possible to admit as evidence despite PERSON subsequently invoking her right to remain silent , as they were to be qualified as a \u201c spontaneous utterance \u201d . At the same time , ORG did not take into account the additional evidence given to the police by PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , as the police had not been sure at which point they had informed her of her right to remain silent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment . He argued that evidence obtained in breach of the right of confrontation enshrined in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( d ) of the LAW must never be admitted , regardless of its importance . The importance of the untested evidence in relation to the other evidence used by the court must not be decisive . Nor did it matter whether the court of first instance had undertaken a particularly careful examination of the evidence of the untested witness , as the breach of the right of confrontation could not be counterbalanced . Furthermore , in the light of PERSON \u2019s subsequent invocation of her right to remain silent , ORG had wrongly admitted the evidence given by the police officers PERSON . and PERSON . PERSON \u2019s statements to the police officers had not been a \u201c spontaneous utterance \u201d , as the latter had been called to the scene because a woman had run out of a house screaming and had been hiding at a neighbour \u2019s house and had , on arrival , asked her what had happened ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In a written submission of CARDINAL DATE ORG argued that the examination of the investigating judge , resulting in the use of the untested evidence given by PERSON , had not rendered the proceedings unfair . The evidence given by PERSON to the investigating judge had been corroborated by other significant factors independent of her evidence . Moreover , ORG had counterbalanced the limitation of the applicant \u2019s defence rights through a particularly careful and critical assessment of the evidentiary value of that testimony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal as ill - founded , finding that the review of ORG judgment had not revealed any legal errors that had been detrimental to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He argued that his right of confrontation had been infringed when the investigation judge had examined PERSON without him or his counsel having had the opportunity to be present and to question her . It had been unlawful to admit her testimony , as reported by the investigating judge , as evidence and to use it to convict him . It was not sufficient to take the violation of his right of confrontation into consideration as part of the evidentiary assessment by attaching less evidentiary value to the untested testimony and by requiring that it be corroborated by other significant pieces of evidence . Similarly , it was unlawful to admit as evidence the statements of the CARDINAL police officers , as PERSON \u2019s statement , which they reported , was not a \u201c spontaneous utterance \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a written submission of CARDINAL DATE ORG argued that ORG had sufficiently taken the ORG \u2019s case - law on LAW ( d ) of the LAW into account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the constitutional complaint for adjudication , without providing reasons ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
