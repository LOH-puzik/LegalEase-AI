At the same time , according to him , he was allocated a specific plot measuring CARDINAL ha , which , he had farmed and paid land tax on since that time . It appears that the allocated land consisted of CARDINAL different parcels , CARDINAL of them measuring CARDINAL ha .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG merged with PERSON . , a neighbouring collective farming company , which was designated as its successor . Following the merger , PERSON . did not register itself as the new owner of the land formerly allocated to V.G. Subsequently the CARDINAL farms separated again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE ordered the expropriation of CARDINAL ha of Kh . \u2019s land and its transfer to ORG closed joint stock company for the exploitation of kaolin deposits . By the same decision , ORG was obliged , in particular , to compensate the local council for the damage suffered by the agricultural producers in connection with the expropriation of the land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC district land authority drew up a draft land - ownership certificate designating the boundaries of the plot to be allocated to U.C.C. This plot was de facto located on the land which had been registered as belonging to V.G .. The draft certificate mentioned , in particular , that ORG had to obtain and register a relevant ORG land - use certificate .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , until DATE U.C.C. took no action to register its land - use rights and the plot designated for expropriation by ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE remained in the hands of the members of the ORG collective farm . The CARDINAL.CARDINAL-ha parcel of the land farmed by the applicant was affected by the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the LOC administration approved a draft certificate determining the boundaries of the plots of land to be designated to individual farmers from the lands allocated to ORG and ordered production of the respective individual land - ownership certificates .", "CARDINAL .

No information concerning registration of ownership in respect of any other land parcels farmed by the applicant has been provided to the ORG .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the LOC administration accepted the prosecutor \u2019s objection and annulled its decision of DATE in so far as it related to the CARDINAL ha of land claimed by U.C.C.", "CARDINAL . On DATE U.C.C. lodged a civil action claiming the CARDINAL.CARDINAL-ha plot of land allocated to the applicant and seeking annulment of the land - ownership certificate issued to him on DATE . It noted , in particular , that the FAC district administration had already annulled its own decision of DATE , which had served as the basis for the issuance of the land - ownership certificate to the applicant . The issuance had therefore been devoid of legal basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the aforementioned claim . It noted that the disputed plot had been allocated to the applicant mistakenly on the basis of the decision of CARDINAL DATE , without due regard to the fact that in DATE this very plot had already been expropriated and transferred to U.C.C.", "CARDINAL . Following this decision , GPE blocked the road leading to the plot disputed by the ORG and it became impossible for the applicant to access it or use it for farming .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the above judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed in cassation before ORG of GPE . He noted , in particular , that he had obtained the disputed land lawfully and in good faith . He could therefore not be deprived of it unless fair compensation was paid .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG of GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal in cassation .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date several individuals , excluding the applicant , apparently the land owners whose land was also being claimed by ORG , instituted administrative proceedings against the LOC administration . They sought , in particular , to annul its decision of DATE and to declare lawful the decision of CARDINAL DATE , on the basis of which their land - use certificates had been issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed their claim . It noted , in particular , that ORG had ordered the expropriation of Kh . \u2019s land , while the land , whose boundaries had been in dispute , had belonged to ORG , which had been a separate legal entity on the date of the decision at issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE quashed the above decision and remitted the case for retrial .", "CARDINAL . After several rounds of proceedings , on DATE ORG found that the decision of DATE had been unlawful in so far as it had related to the plots of land of the individuals who had instituted the proceedings .
