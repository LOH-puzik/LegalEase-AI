The applicants were all reservists who had been drafted by ORG in connection with ORG intervention in GPE . They remained in military service DATE , and were thus entitled to a certain per diem under the Rules on Travel and Other Expenses in ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and by virtue of CARDINAL separate decisions ( nos . CARDINAL\u2044CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL\u2044CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) adopted by its Chief of Staff on CARDINAL and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , following the demobilisation the Government allegedly refused to honour their obligation to the reservists , including the applicants .", "CARDINAL . NORP The reservists subsequently organised a series of public protests , some of which ended in open confrontation with the police . Ultimately , following protracted negotiations , on DATE the Government reached an agreement with some of the reservists ( \u201c the Agreement \u201d ) , in particular those residing in the municipalities of GPE , GPE , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and ORG , whereby these reservists were guaranteed payment in CARDINAL DATE instalments . This payment was to be effected through their respective municipalities , aggregate sums having been specified per municipality . The said municipalities were apparently chosen because of their \u201c underdeveloped \u201d status , implying the reservists\u2019 indigence . For their part , the reservists in question agreed to renounce all their outstanding claims based on their military service in DATE which were still pending before the civil courts , as well as any other claim in this connection . It was , lastly , stipulated that the criteria for the distribution of the \u201c financial aid \u201d in question should be set out by a Commission consisting of local government representatives and the representatives of the reservists themselves .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , like all other reservists without a registered residence in CARDINAL of the CARDINAL municipalities in question , could not benefit from the Agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants therefore filed a civil claim against the respondent ORG based on the regulations referred to in paragraph CARDINAL above . In their submissions , they pointed inter alia to the discrimination resulting from the Agreement . By way of redress ( tu\u017ebeni zahtev ) , the applicants requested the payment of specific sums on account of the per diems in question , as well as certain other benefits , without relying on any anti - discrimination provision \u2013 domestic or international \u2013 or otherwise referring to the issue of discrimination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of First Instance ( PERSON ) ruled against the applicants . In so doing , it acknowledged that their claim had a valid legal basis but noted , as pointed out by the respondent , that the applicable prescription period had been DATE as of their demobilisation , in accordance with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . The applicants\u2019 claim had thus been filed out of time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal against that judgment , complaining about various procedural violations allegedly committed at first instance , the failure of the court in question to properly establish all of the relevant facts , and the erroneous application of the applicable prescription periods . The applicants also referred to the Agreement , in so far as other reservists had thus resolved their problem without litigation , but they did not rely on any anti - discrimination provision , domestic or international .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) upheld the impugned judgment on appeal , and it thereby became final . In its reasoning the court stated , inter alia , that the per diems had indeed \u201c only been partly paid \u201d by ORG ( ORG odbrane ) but that both the DATE and the DATE prescription periods provided for in section QUANTITY of LAW had already elapsed before the applicants had filed their civil claim ( see paragraph DATE below ) . ORG considered the Agreement as having no bearing on the matter since the applicants had sought payment of the sums owed to them on a different legal basis .", "CARDINAL . Having been served with ORG decision , on DATE the applicants lodged a further appeal ( ustavna \u017ealba ) with ORG ( Ustavni sud ) . Relying on Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW , they complained about the fairness of the civil proceedings and the erroneous application of the relevant domestic law , including the provisions concerning prescription . The applicants also maintained that the impugned judgment of ORG was inconsistent with numerous judgments adopted by other appellate courts in GPE \u2013 that is the district courts ( okru\u017eni sudovi ) while they existed , as well as the high courts and the courts of appeal ( vi\u0161i i apelacioni sudovi ) thereafter DATE which on the same facts had applied a longer , DATE , prescription period and ruled in favour of the plaintiffs ( see section CARDINAL of LAW , in paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Lastly , the applicants mentioned the Agreement and the ORG \u2019s subsequent decision endorsing it , but did not elaborate on their substance and\u2044or impact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the adoption of the judgment by ORG in the present case , ORG ruled in favour of the applicants as regards their complaints of inconsistent domestic case - law in respect of the civil courts\u2019 application of the statutory time - limitation ( the same complaints the ORG had rejected as manifestly ill - founded \u2013 see paragraphs CARDINAL of its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) , but made no mention of the Agreement . ORG accordingly found a violation of LAW . It ordered that its decision be published in ORG , deeming this sufficient redress in a situation where the civil courts had , despite the said inconsistency , applied the relevant substantive law based on a \u201c constitutionally acceptable interpretation \u201d thereof . For more detailed reasoning , ORG referred to its decision of DATE concerning the same issue in another case involving different appellants ( U\u017e . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE referred , inter alia , to the inconsistent case - law in question , citing specific judgments irrespective of the time - frame , and found a violation of the appellants\u2019 right to equal protection before the courts as guaranteed under LAW . ORG was of the opinion that the courts of last instance , by ruling differently on the validity of claims based on identical facts and law , had placed appellants whose claims had been rejected in a materially different position from that of claimants whose claims had been allowed . There had accordingly been a violation of LAW . However , ORG considered that the allegations before it presented no constitutional basis upon which it could establish a violation of the appellants\u2019 right to a fair trial in so far as they complained about procedural fairness and the civil ORG allegedly inadequate characterisation of the legal nature of their claims . The ORG additional complaint , raised under LAW , was also rejected . In particular , there was no evidence to corroborate the claim that the first- and second - instance court decisions in the appellants\u2019 civil case had been rendered on the basis of any \u201c personal qualities \u201d , this being a precondition for determining the existence of a violation of the principle of non - discrimination . ORG took note of ORG finding of CARDINAL DATE of a violation of the prohibition of discrimination under LAW in conjunction with LAW No . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ; for additional constitutional case - law to this effect , see decision U\u017e . CARDINAL\u2044CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , as well as decisions U\u017e . CARDINAL\u2044CARDINAL and U\u017e . CARDINAL , both of CARDINAL DATE , in their relevant parts ) , but for reasons that were different from those stated in this particular constitutional appeal . The fact that the latter complaint had been dismissed did not affect the ORG \u2019s obligation to act in accordance with ORG decision in respect of all persons , including the appellants , whose war per diems had not been paid out .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE first - instance and appellate courts across GPE ruled both in favour of reservists in a situation comparable to that of the applicants and against them , relying on DATE or DATE prescription periods respectively ( for examples of cases where the reservists were successful see , among numerous others , GPE ORG judgments PERSON . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE and DATE ORG had adopted CARDINAL legal opinions ( pravna shvatanja ) , both of which implied that the applicable prescription period should be DATE pursuant to section QUANTITY ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE various appellate courts substantively ruled in compliance with ORG opinions of DATE and DATE ( see , for example , ORG decision G\u017e . CARDINAL of DATE ; ORG decisions PERSON . CARDINAL\u2044CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL\u2044CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL\u2044CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ; ORG decisions PERSON . CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ; and ORG of Appeal decisions G\u017e . CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE there were also a number of decisions where appellate courts ruled against the reservists , albeit on a different ground . Their claims , unlike those of the applicants in the present case , were rejected as being administrative in nature and as such falling outside the competence of the civil courts ( see GPE ORG decision G\u017e . CARDINAL of DATE , and ORG decisions PERSON . TIME , CARDINAL\u2044CARDINAL and CARDINAL\u2044CARDINAL , of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government endorsed the Agreement , and decided to pay the municipalities in question the amounts specified therein .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government set up a working group tasked with addressing the requests of all other reservists , that is to say those not resident in the CARDINAL municipalities mentioned above . However , having discussed the issue with various groups of reservists , this working group ultimately concluded that their demands were not acceptable , inter alia because : ( a ) they had not harmonised or specified their requests ; ( b ) some of their representatives had had dubious standing to represent them ; ( c ) there was a lack of ORG funds which could be used for this purpose ; and ( d ) in most cases , war per diems had already been paid to the reservists .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Commissioner for ORG ) , an Ombudsman - type office established on the basis of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , considered the complaints brought by an organisation representing the interests of reservists in a situation comparable to that of the applicants . She concluded that they had been discriminated against on the basis of their registered residence , that is as non - residents of the CARDINAL privileged municipalities , and recommended that the Government take all necessary measures in order to ensure that all reservists were afforded the payments recognised by their decision of DATE . The Government were also invited to provide the Commissioner with an appropriate \u201c action plan \u201d within DATE . In its reasoning , the Commissioner \u2019s decision noted , inter alia , that the payments in question were per diems , notwithstanding that the Government had chosen to consider them as social benefits awarded to persons in need ( socijalna pomo\u0107 ) , and that this was best exemplified by the fact that the reservists in question had had to renounce their legal claims concerning the per diems , as well as the fact that the individual reservists resident in the CARDINAL municipalities in issue were never under an obligation to prove their indigence ( imovinsko stanje i socijalnu ugro\u017eenost ) . This being so , there was clearly no objective and reasonable justification for the differential treatment of reservists merely on the basis of their place of residence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ministarstvo rada i socijalne politike ) noted that discussions should continue with the various groups of reservists and that , if possible , financial support should be offered to the most indigent among them ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
