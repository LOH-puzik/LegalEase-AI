The applicant was born in DATE in GPE , in the former GPE ( GPE ) , and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the natural and only daughter of PERSON , who recognised paternity in DATE . She lived in the territory of the former GPE until DATE , while her father lived in GPE ( FRG ) , having married . The father and the daughter corresponded regularly during that period . DATE , the applicant also visited her father and his wife once DATE . After the applicant obtained an exit permit in DATE for herself , her husband and her younger daughter , she left the GPE and moved to GPE . Thereafter the applicant visited her father on a regular basis until DATE . He died on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for the right to administer her father \u2019s estate , asserting the incapacity of her father \u2019s wife to protect the applicant \u2019s inheritance due to a grave illness , and notified ORG of her inheritance claims . Furthermore , she asked to receive copies of all documents relating to the estate . She asserted that DATE she had regularly visited her father at his retirement home and had talked to him on the telephone . Subsequently , her own health had prevented her from visiting . Telephone calls had been impossible because her father \u2019s health had meant he had no longer been able to use a telephone . The retirement home had been in possession of her address and telephone number , and had phoned her on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application , as there were no indications that the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s wife could not protect the inheritance . In addition , being born before DATE and thus not being a statutory heir , she had no right to receive copies of documents about the estate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , arguing in particular that she needed the power to administer the estate because her father \u2019s wife suffered from dementia and that she was a statutory heir because she was her father \u2019s natural daughter .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG decision refusing to give her the power to administer her father \u2019s estate , holding that the applicant was not a statutory heir and thus had no right to apply . ORG referred to the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and to a decision of ORG of DATE , in which the provision had been found to be in conformity with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that the application of the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act would discriminate against her and breach her inheritance rights and was therefore not in conformity with LAW . The applicant pointed out that in her case there was no need to protect the legitimate expectations of the deceased or other heirs as she was her father \u2019s only daughter and her father had been separated from his wife for DATE when he had died . Furthermore , cultural and social changes within society had to be considered when interpreting LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the grounds that it was bound by the decisions of ORG in which the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act had been found to be in conformity with LAW . In ORG view , the provision did not contravene LAW , despite NORP reunification , as ORG had held in a decision of DATE ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG , claiming discrimination as a result of the application of the aforementioned provision . According to her there were no apparent reasons why children born outside marriage should be treated differently from those born within marriage . That was particularly true in her case because she was her father \u2019s only child . The applicant argued that ORG , when considering an appeal , had to respect LAW , which provided that children born outside marriage must be provided by legislation with the same opportunities for physical and mental development and for their position in society as those enjoyed by children born within marriage . That provision prohibited a generalised application of the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG declined to consider the complaint , which it considered inadmissible for lack of sufficient substantiation ( no . CARDINAL ) . It observed , in particular , that the applicant had failed sufficiently to address the arguments of ORG decision . As the applicant doubted the validity of the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act , which had previously been declared valid by ORG , she had been obliged to give further reasons , which she had failed to do ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
