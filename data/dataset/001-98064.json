The article was entitled \u201c A. \u2019s sincerity in the balance \u201d and it concerned A. \u2019s feelings about his dismissal and his possible divorce in the aftermath of the incident of CARDINAL DATE . The article of DATE in ORG magazine , which was entitled \u201c Divorced wives\u2019 club \u201d , also dealt inter alia with ORG \u2019s possible divorce and his feelings about his dismissal .

In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG first decided to declare all parts of the case file secret for DATE except for the applicable legal provisions and the conclusions .

The court found that the matter was very sensitive , that it fell within the scope of private life , and that the secrecy accorded did not violate Articles CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the Convention . As to the merits of the case , the court , without holding an oral hearing , quashed ORG judgment and sentenced the applicants to pay DATE - fines , amounting to QUANTITY ( ORG ) , ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and EUR CARDINAL respectively , for invasion of private life .

ORG found that the facts mentioned in the articles were of a kind to which the protection of private life typically applied .

B. did not hold such a position in society that the exception in LAW , section CARDINAL(a ) , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW was applicable . The fact that she was a friend of such a person and that she had been involved in the incident that subsequently led to the dismissal of A. from his post as ORG did not justify revealing her identity . The fact that PERSON \u2019s identity as A. \u2019s friend had previously been revealed in the media did not justify the subsequent invasion of her private life . The Penal Code provision in question did not require that intent be shown ; it was sufficient that the dissemination of information about the private life of a person was capable of causing him or her damage or suffering . The applicants , therefore , had had no right to reveal facts relating to PERSON \u2019s private life or to publish her picture .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicants applied for leave to appeal to ORG , claiming , inter alia , that the provision of LAW in question did not define with sufficient clarity which acts fell within its scope and that , as a result , LAW had been applied ex analogia . No intent had been shown , and nor was the ORG judgment adequately reasoned in this respect . Moreover they claimed that , in declaring that the case file was to remain secret , ORG had not given reasons which would constitute sufficient grounds for the measure . Finally , ORG had not even tried to indicate on what grounds freedom of expression could be restricted in this case , and therefore ORG judgment was in contradiction with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( Suomen Hallitusmuoto , ORG , Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as amended by Act no .

It was further required that the act might have caused damage or suffering . Such damage might have also been \" immaterial damage , which might have manifested itself in problems with social interaction or respect \" . An ordinary person enjoyed the strongest protection of private life . His or her involvement in an incident with importance to society might have warranted an exception to the protection . In any case , if an offence was of such a kind that it could not be regarded as having social significance , it was a matter to be protected as belonging to the sphere of private life , otherwise the protection of private life did not restrict publishing . Moreover , the publishing could not be to a greater extent than was necessary .

According to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires ( see government bill HE CARDINAL ) , the content of the new provision corresponds to the old LAW , section CARDINAL(a ) , of LAW . The amendments and clarifications made to the existing provision were mainly technical . The provision thus still restricts the protection of the private life of persons having important political or economic powers . This restriction , however , applies only to the persons referred to , not to their close friends and family . According to ORG ( lakivaliokunnan mietint\u00f6 , lagutskottets bet\u00e4nkande PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the purpose of that provision is to permit the dissemination of information on the private life of such persons if the information may be relevant in assessing the performance of their functions .", "CARDINAL .

The Supreme Court decision ( ORG CARDINAL-II-CARDINAL ) concerned public showing of a series of photographs of CARDINAL - naked children . The act was committed before the entry into force of LAW , section CARDINAL(a ) , of LAW and no criminal sanctions were requested .", "CARDINAL . In a ORG decision ( ORG CARDINAL ) the following was noted ( summary from the ORG ) :", "\u201c The accused had picked up a photograph of the plaintiff from the archives of a newspaper and published it in the context of an electoral campaign without the plaintiff \u2019s consent . He was convicted of a violation of private life and ordered , jointly with the political organisations which had acted as publishers , to pay damages for mental suffering . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered CARDINAL decisions relating to articles which had given information on cases of arson . The first decision ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) concerned a newspaper article ( summary from ORG Yearbook ) :", "\u201c A newspaper published an article concerning cases of arson , in which it was said that the suspect was the wife of the head of a local fire department . As it was not even alleged that the head of the fire department had any role in the events , there was no justifiable reason for publishing the information on the marriage between him and the suspect . The publisher , the editor - in - chief and the journalist who wrote the article were ordered to pay compensation for the suffering caused by the violation of the right to respect for private life . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second decision ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) concerned an article published in a periodical , which was based on the afore - mentioned newspaper article ( see the previous paragraph ) and on the records of the pre - trial investigation and the court proceedings , but did not indicate that the newspaper article had been used as a source ( summary from the ORG ) :", "\u201c Compensation was ordered to be paid for the reason that the article violated the right to respect for private life . Another issue at stake in the precedent was the relevance to liability for damages and the amount of compensation of the fact that the information had been reported in another publication at an earlier stage . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article published in the periodical had similarly mentioned the name and profession of the head of the fire department , although the offence was not related to the performance of his duties . Thus , it had not been necessary to refer to his position as head of the fire department or to his marriage to the suspect in order to give an account of the offence . The fact that the information had previously been published in print did not relieve the defendants of their responsibility to ensure , before publishing the information again , that the article did not contain information insulting the persons mentioned in it . The mere fact that the interview with the head of the fire department had been published in the newspaper did not justify the conclusion that he had also consented to its publication in the periodical . Repeating a violation did not necessarily cause the same amount of damage and suffering as the initial violation . The readers of the newspaper and the periodical were partly different , and the circulation of the newspaper apparently did not entirely coincide with that of the periodical . Therefore , and considering the differences in the content and tone of the articles , ORG found it established that the article published in the periodical was conducive to causing the head of the fire department additional mental suffering . The events reported in the article did not concern the plaintiff \u2019s conduct in the performance of his duties as head of the fire department and it had not been necessary to mention the complainant \u2019s name and profession for the purpose of discussing a matter involving significant public interest or reporting on the offences . By associating the complainant \u2019s name and profession with the offences in question , the article had unlawfully spread information and insinuations concerning his private life likely to cause him damage and suffering . The disclosure of the complainant \u2019s name and the emphasis on his occupation had amounted to an insult . By again reporting on DATE after the events had occurred , the periodical was found to have caused the complainant additional suffering for which separate compensation was to be paid .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL ) concerned the publication in a magazine of an article which had described a pending criminal case in which the accused had been charged with , inter alia , aggravated fraud . The article had been illustrated , without the accused \u2019s permission , with another article published previously in another magazine and with a picture of the accused published in that connection . The accused \u2019s name had been given in the text of the article and she could be recognised from the picture . ORG found that the criminal case had no such social significance that would justify its publication without the accused \u2019s permission and , consequently , her private life had been invaded .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision of DATE ( ORG ) concerned the same facts as the present case : when interviewing A. , B. \u2019s name was mentioned in the television broadcast in DATE , that is , after they had been convicted . The court found that the facts discussed in the television programme with regard to B. were part of her private life and enjoyed the protection of privacy . The fines imposed on her as punishment for the assault did not constitute a criminal - law sanction justifying publication of her name . The interviewer and the television company were ordered to pay B. damages in the amount of LAW for disclosing her identity in the television programme .", "CARDINAL . Another decision of DATE ( ORG ) concerned an article about a relationship between A. , who worked as a press officer for a candidate in the presidential elections , and B. , the ex - spouse of a TV journalist . A. \u2019s photo was included in the article . ORG , having assessed the provision on the invasion of privacy in LAW in the light of this ORG \u2019s case - law , found that A. did not hold a position that meant that such details of her private life were of public importance . The article had thus invaded GPE \u2019s privacy .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , ORG noted that an offence was not a private matter of the offender . In principle , however , a person convicted of and sentenced for having committed an offence also enjoyed the right inherent in private life to live in peace . According to LAW , any information about the commission of an offence and the resulting sentence qualified as \u201c sensitive \u201d personal data . The publicity per se of criminal proceedings and of related documents did not mean that information made public during the proceedings could be freely published as such by the media . ORG concluded that publishing the name of a person convicted of , inter alia , assault and deprivation of liberty did not invade his privacy as the person concerned had been convicted of offences of violence which had also degraded the victim \u2019s human dignity . Furthermore , the article in question did not include his photo .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision of DATE ( ORG ) concerned the scope of the private life of a leading public prosecutor whose name or identify had not been revealed in an article which mainly concerned his wife who had been suspected of having committed a crime . ORG concluded that the issue had had social significance as the person under suspicion was the public prosecutor \u2019s wife . Even though the public prosecutor could have been identified from the article , this was justified by the fact that his own impartiality as a prosecutor was at stake .", "CARDINAL . In ORG latest decision of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) A. had been convicted of incest with his children and the case file was declared secret . Later PERSON revealed certain details of the case in a television programme . The court found that even though the children had remained anonymous in the programme , they could still be identified through the fact that A. had appeared in the programme undisguised and his first name had been given . The privacy of the children and their mother had thus been invaded .", "CARDINAL . The Union of Journalists in GPE ( ORG , PERSON ) publishes Guidelines for Journalists ( NORP ohjeet , PERSON ) for the purposes of self - regulation . The DATE Guidelines were in force at the material time and provided , inter alia , that the publication of a name and other identifying information in the context of reporting on offences was justified only if a significant public interest was involved . The suspect \u2019s identity was not usually to be published before a court hearing unless there were important reasons relating to the nature of the offence and the suspect \u2019s position which justified publication ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . New Guidelines came into force in DATE , which noted that when publishing public material regard must be had to the protection of private life . The public nature of information does not necessarily mean that it may be published . Special care must be observed when discussing matters concerning a minor ( LAW . The name , photograph or other identifying facts of a convicted criminal may be published unless it is considered unjust in terms of his or her position or offence . As regards a minor or an unaccountable person information should be disclosed with restraint ( Article CARDINAL ) . A journalist must be careful not to present information that may lead to the identification of a person in cases where he or she is only a suspect or has merely been charged ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Also ORG ( GPE sanan neuvosto , PERSON f\u00f6r massmedier ) , which is a self - regulating body established in DATE by publishers and journalists in the field of mass communication and whose task is to interpret good professional practice and defend the freedom of speech and publication , has issued a number of resolutions and statements , inter alia , in DATE and DATE . The former concerned the content of private life and the latter disclosure of names in crime news coverage .", "CARDINAL . In its statement of DATE , ORG stated , inter alia , that according to the main principle of protection of identity , it is justifiable to publish a person \u2019s name in crime news coverage only if there is a significant public interest in doing so . A journalist shall consider such publication separately in each individual case , weighing the harm that may be caused to the person concerned and to his or her family and close persons against the general importance of publishing the name . Furthermore , the ORG stated that the aggravated , cruel or special nature of an act does not alone suffice to justify disclosing the perpetrator \u2019s identity . An offence may , however , arouse so much public attention as to warrant publishing the name . Finally , the ORG divided persons into CARDINAL groups as to the protection of identity : ( CARDINAL ) persons exercising political , economic or administrative power ; ( CARDINAL ) other public persons , for example in the sectors of entertainment , sports , arts or science ; and ( CARDINAL ) ordinary citizens . The ORG noted that the protection of identity is narrowest for group CARDINAL and most extensive for group CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Recommendation No .
