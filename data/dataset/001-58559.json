The applicant was arrested on DATE in connection with an investigation involving CARDINAL people under a warrant issued by ORG on DATE . He was suspected of being a member of a mafia - type organisation in ORG and of running a financial company on behalf of his brother - in - law , who was believed to be the leader of the main mafia gang in the area ( Article CARDINAL bis of LAW makes it an offence to be a member of a mafia - type organisation ) .", "The accusations against the applicant were based in particular on statements made by CARDINAL PERSON , who also stood accused of being a member of a mafia - type organisation but had become a pentito ( a former mafioso who has decided to cooperate with the authorities ) . PERSON 's information about the applicant had been obtained from CARDINAL G.D. , who had been killed by the ORG on DATE , and had , in turn , received the information from another deceased victim of the ORG , GPE", "CARDINAL . The applicant was initially detained at FAC , where he spent DATE in isolation .", "CARDINAL . His first application for bail was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "ORG found in particular that although the statements made by PERSON regarding the applicant 's involvement in the ORG had provided no information or objective evidence about the applicant 's actual role and activity , they could nonetheless constitute sufficient grounds to justify his detention , having regard to the credibility and reliability of the various statements PERSON had made concerning other people or events connected with the ORG ( it applied the \u201c global credibility \u201d criterion \u2013 attendibilit\u00e0 complessiva ) .", "It added that ORG had identified the applicant from a photograph and provided information concerning his exact role in the mafia - type organisation . He had indicated that the applicant , who was the brotherinlaw of the head of CARDINAL of the ORG mafia clans , ran a financial company and , along with another person whom PERSON had previously identified as being a member of the ORG , was a co - owner of a management company that ran a discotheque .", "ORG also found that the applicant 's detention was warranted by the need to protect witnesses , since most of the evidence took the form of oral testimony and there was therefore a risk of its being lost through pressure being brought to bear on the witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred with CARDINAL other alleged mafiosi to the prison on the island of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , he appealed to ORG against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . He argued in particular that he had been detained solely on the basis of ORG 's statements , which were unsupported by any factual evidence . In addition , he said that ORG had refused to accept that he was not the manager of a financial company and had taken that allegation as evidence that he was an executive in local finance and as supporting the accusation that he was a branch treasurer for the ORG . In fact , he was merely an employee of the company and had even been the subject of disciplinary proceedings . However , ORG dismissed his appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made a further application for bail to the investigating judge ( giudice per le indagini preliminari ) , contending that there were not sufficient grounds for keeping him in detention , but it was dismissed on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's appeal to ORG was dismissed on DATE on the ground that LAW of LAW created a presumption that the continued detention of suspects charged with belonging to a mafia - type organisation was necessary and that it was therefore for the person seeking bail to produce specific , concrete evidence to rebut that presumption . ORG considered that the applicant 's arguments \u2013 such as that related to the length of his detention \u2013 were of a general nature and had been rejected in earlier cases .", "CARDINAL . On application by the prosecution , the investigating judge at ORG made an order on DATE pursuant to LAW extending the maximum permitted period of detention pending trial .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , other pentiti had stated during the course of the investigation that they did not know the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG against the order of CARDINAL DATE , contending that the impugned order was null and void as the application for an extension had not been served beforehand on his lawyer and the court had given only general , not specific , reasons .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on DATE . It held that all the law required was that the parties should be heard at an adversarial hearing and that had been done in the instant case . There was no requirement that the application should be formally served beforehand .", "As to whether the impugned measure was necessary , ORG found that although the reasoning in the order was somewhat succinct , it had pointed to the risk of evidence being tampered with , particularly in view of the special nature of the offence ( membership of a mafia - type organisation ) , and the danger presented by all the accused , who were suspected of belonging to a criminal organisation that engaged in serious crime such as homicide . Furthermore , the prosecution had given a full explanation as to why it had been necessary for the purposes of the investigation to make the application : namely because of the need to carry out complex banking and fiscal inquiries to clarify the extent to which the accused controlled the area . ORG also noted that the nature of the crime concerned meant that the investigation had to cover the mafiatype organisation as a whole , and , therefore , necessarily , all of the accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG contending that the rights of the defence had been infringed . However , his appeal was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was committed for trial on a charge of being a member of a mafia - type organisation . The public prosecutor 's office sought a DATE prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG acquitted the applicant and ordered his release unless there were other reasons why he should remain in custody .", "It observed that the case against the applicant had been founded solely on statements made by ORG on the basis of information PERSON had learnt from G.D. , who had in turn obtained that information from PERSON Both sources were now dead , thus rendering any independent corroboration of ORG 's statements impossible . The only affirmation that had been proved was that the applicant had worked at the finance company concerned , but there was no evidence that he had acted as its manager or treasurer . Indeed , that allegation had been contradicted by other witnesses and factual evidence . ORG concluded that the applicant 's guilt had not been established .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was delivered towards TIME The applicant , who had been in LOC for the verdict , was brought back to FAC , still in handcuffs , at TIME", "He was not released until TIME because the registration officer , whose presence was necessary on the release of prisoners subject to a special prison regime , was unavailable .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor 's office appealed against his acquittal .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , which became final as regards the applicant on DATE , ORG upheld his acquittal on the ground that PERSON 's statements were unsupported by other concrete evidence and had been refuted by evidence obtained during the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was held at FAC until DATE , when he was transferred to PERSON under urgent measures taken by ORG against the ORG following the killing by that organisation of CARDINAL senior judges . PERSON had previously held CARDINAL prisoners who enjoyed a less strict regime , which included the right to work on the island outside the prison . The highsecurity prisoners were held together in the \u201c PERSON \u201d wing . A large number of prison warders from other penal institutions were also transferred to FAC .", "The applicant was held at GPE without interruption until DATE . Subsequently , he was regularly transferred for short periods to enable him to be present at the various stages of the proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . The medical register kept by PERSON shows that the applicant was in good health on arrival .", "CARDINAL . He alleged that he was ill - treated in a number of ways , detailed below , mainly DATE ( the situation subsequently improved ) .", "( i ) He was regularly slapped and had sustained an injury to his right thumb . His testicles had been squeezed , a practice which the applicant said was systematically inflicted on all prisoners .", "( ii ) On CARDINAL occasion the applicant was beaten and his jumper was torn . He protested . TIME a warder ordered him to shut up , insulted and then struck him , damaging the applicant 's glasses and a false tooth .", "( iii ) He was manhandled on other occasions . Prisoners were allowed to put cleaning products in the corridors . Sometimes the prison warders caused the products to spill on the floor and mixed them with water , thus making the floor slippery . Prisoners were then forced to run along the corridors CARDINAL rows of warders . Those who fell were hit by warders and beaten with batons .", "( iv ) He was often subjected to body searches when showering .", "( v ) He had to wait very lengthy periods to see a doctor and remained handcuffed during medical examinations .", "( vi ) The warders warned prisoners that they would be subjected to reprisals if they told their lawyers or other prisoners about the treatment they were receiving .", "( vii ) In the presence of warders prisoners were required to bow their heads , keep their eyes to the ground , show respect , remain silent and stand to attention .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant said that transfers of prisoners from the prison to the courts for hearings took place in inhuman conditions : in the hold of the vessel , without air , light or food and with very poor hygiene .", "CARDINAL . The Pianosa Prison medical register shows that on DATE the applicant complained of a problem with a false tooth and the prison doctor therefore referred him for examination by a dentist . In DATE a further request was made for an appointment with a dentist to have a loose false tooth cemented .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Pianosa Prison medical service requested xrays and an appointment with an orthopaedist following a complaint by the applicant of pain in his knees . On DATE , following tests , an orthopaedist noted problems \u2013 the medical record does not reveal their exact nature \u2013 in the applicant 's knees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the dentist noted that the false tooth had completely broken and needed repair .", "CARDINAL . A medical report of CARDINAL DATE notes calcification in the knee joint . The applicant had a scan on DATE that revealed CARDINAL small wounds resulting from traumatic injury in the upper , outer part of the knee .", "CARDINAL . A medical certificate dated DATE refers to psychological disorders ( asthenia , state of confusion , depression ) that had started DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at a preliminary hearing before the PERSON investigating judge , the applicant and another prisoner alleged that they had suffered forms of ill - treatment such as \u201c torture , humiliation and cruelty \u201d in FAC until DATE . The applicant said in particular that he had suffered a broken finger and broken teeth . Even though the position had improved after DATE , he complained that the overall treatment to which he had been subjected and which had been imposed on the basis of , inter alia , section CARDINAL bis of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE , was inhuman and emotionally draining .", "CARDINAL . The investigating judge informed the GPE public prosecutor 's office of the above ; the public prosecutor 's office opened an official inquiry ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and on DATE instructed the ORG carabinieri to question the applicant about the nature and duration of the illtreatment he had allegedly suffered and to obtain from him any information he had that would help to identify those responsible . It also requested the applicant 's medical records .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was interviewed on DATE by the ORG carabinieri . He said that from the moment he arrived at GPE he had been subjected to \u201c hidings , torture , acts of cruelty and psychological torture \u201d by the warders . In particular , they would hit him in the back with their hands . When he left his cell for the exercise yard he was made to run along a corridor that had been made slippery . The warders formed a line the length of the corridor and delivered kicks , punches and baton blows . On CARDINAL occasion he had protested that the warders had torn his jumper as they struck him . CARDINAL of them had told him to shut up , insulted him and then hit him , damaging his glasses and a false tooth . Prisoners were violently beaten every time they left their cells . He added , however , that he was unable to recognise the warders responsible because the prisoners were obliged to keep their heads bowed in their presence . He stated lastly that the beatings had ceased in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the carabinieri sent the interview record and the applicant 's medical file to the GPE public prosecutor 's office . They said that they would forward a list of the warders who had worked at FAC at the material time later .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant was interviewed by the ORG carabinieri on the instructions of the LOC public prosecutor 's office . He was shown photocopies of photographs of CARDINAL prison warders who had worked at FAC . The applicant said that he was unable to identify the person who had ill - treated him , but commented that the photographs had been taken before the relevant period and were only photocopies . He added that he would have had no difficulty in identifying the warder concerned had he been able to see him in person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor 's office applied to have the complaint filed away without further action on the ground that the offenders could not be identified ( perch\u00e9 ignoti gli autori del reato ) . The LOC investigating judge made an order to that effect on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE judge responsible for the execution of sentences had sent a report to the Minister of ORG and other relevant prison and administrative authorities on prison conditions in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The report followed an initial inspection of the prison in DATE in which it was noted in particular that there had been repeated violations of prisoners ' rights and a number of incidents of ill - treatment , both in the special \u201c PERSON \u201d wing and in the ordinary wings . By way of example , it was noted in the report that :", "( i ) hygiene was appalling ;", "( ii ) prisoners ' correspondence , though permitted subject to censorship , was totally blocked and telegrams were delivered to prisoners only after substantial delays ;", "( iii ) prisoners were forced to run to the exercise yard , and probably beaten with batons on the legs ;", "( iv ) prisoners were sometimes beaten with batons and subjected to other forms of ill - treatment ( for example , CARDINAL prisoner was allegedly forced to undress completely and to do floor exercises ( flessioni ) before being subjected to a rectal search , which , according to the judge responsible for the execution of sentences , had been wholly unnecessary as the prisoner had just finished doing work in the presence of other warders ; the prisoner concerned , who was slapped while getting dressed , had then consulted the prison doctor ; TIME , CARDINAL warders had subjected him to a beating in his cell ) ;", "( v ) apparently , other similar incidents had taken place subsequently , although the situation appeared to have improved more recently , probably as a result of action taken against prison warders .", "CARDINAL . After information and press reports began to circulate that prisoners in PERSON were being subjected to violence , the GPE public prosecutor spent DATE on the island and informed the press that he had found nothing to support the allegations .", "CARDINAL . Further , on DATE inspectors for the ORG prison services had informed ORG at ORG that , according to information from reliable sources , there had been serious incidents of ill - treatment of prisoners at FAC . In particular , the report referred to CARDINAL incident in which a handicapped prisoner had been brought into the prison in a wheelbarrow to the jeers of the warders and another in which a prisoner had been forced to kneel before a candle .", "CARDINAL . In a note to the Minister 's principal private secretary dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG at ORG explained that the conditions referred to by the GPE judge responsible for the execution of sentences were due essentially to the fact that CARDINAL prisoners had been transferred to GPE as a matter of urgency in TIME CARDINAL DATE . That had caused practical problems which could to a large extent explain the inconvenience that had been noted . In addition , additional problems had been caused by building works in the prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director - General forwarded the conclusions of a group of experts appointed by the department to the principal private secretary to the Minister and to the public prosecutor 's office . On the basis of the information supplied by prisoners questioned in the prison , the experts had found that the allegations of ill - treatment were wholly unfounded apart from the incident concerning the moving of a handicapped prisoner in a wheelbarrow , which , however , had resulted from a lack of wheelchairs in the prison .", "CARDINAL . Following the report by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences , an inquiry was nonetheless started and the information obtained was sent to the GPE public prosecutor 's office . CARDINAL warders had been identified ; they were suspected of offences of causing bodily harm ( LAW ) and of abuse of authority over persons who had been arrested or detained ( LAW of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The public prosecutor 's office sought an order for both charges to be dropped , the former because no complaint had been lodged and the latter because it was time - barred . The application was allowed with regard to the offence of causing bodily harm , but dismissed with regard to the other charge and on DATE the investigating judge sought additional information . That inquiry is believed still to be under way .", "CARDINAL . In a note of CARDINAL DATE which was appended to the ORG 's observations in the proceedings before the Commission \u2013 the President of the court responsible for the execution of sentences in PERSON said that the incidents that had taken place in FAC had been ordered or tolerated by the government of DATE . He also considered that the applicant 's allegations concerning the conditions during transfers were entirely credible and that transfers of prisoners to PERSON were carried out using questionable and unjustified methods , the real purpose of which was to intimidate prisoners . He further noted that the high - security wing of FAC had been staffed by warders from other prisons who had not been subjected to any selection process and had been given \u201c carte blanche \u201d . The result , according to the President of the court , was that management of that wing of the prison had initially been characterised by abuse and irregularities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG issued an order subjecting the applicant to the special prison regime laid down in section CARDINAL bis of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE until DATE . The Minister considered that the measure was necessary in particular because of serious public - order and safety considerations following an escalation of an aggressive and ruthless campaign by the ORG , which had been responsible for the recent assassinations of CARDINAL judges and QUANTITY policemen and for car - bomb attacks in large NORP cities . That situation made it necessary to sever connections between certain prisoners and their milieu . The applicant was subject to the measure concerned because he was of bad character and dangerous ; those factors suggested that he had maintained contact with the criminal milieu which he would be able to use to issue instructions or establish links with the outside world that could in turn lead to a breakdown of public order or jeopardise security in prison institutions . In addition , it was a reasonable assumption that prisoners such as the applicant would recruit other prisoners or dominate and humiliate them in prison , just as they did in criminal organisations .", "CARDINAL . The order represented a derogation from LAW and imposed the following restrictions :", "( i ) a ban on the use of the telephone ;", "( ii ) a ban on all association or correspondence with other prisoners ;", "( iii ) censorship of all inward and outward correspondence ;", "( iv ) a ban on meetings with third parties ;", "( v ) restrictions on visits from members of the family ( to TIME DATE ) ;", "( vi ) a ban on receiving or sending sums of money over a set amount ;", "( vii ) a ban on receiving parcels ( other than those containing linen ) from the outside ;", "( viii ) a ban on organising cultural , recreational or sporting activities ;", "( ix ) a ban on voting or standing in elections for prisoner representatives ;", "( x ) a ban on taking part in arts - and - crafts activities ;", "( xi ) a ban on buying food that needed cooking ;", "( xii ) a ban on spending TIME outdoors .", "CARDINAL . These measures were subsequently extended for successive sixmonthly periods until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided , without giving specific reasons , to subject the applicant 's correspondence to censorship . However , his correspondence was not monitored while he was in LOC .", "CARDINAL . An order was also made for censorship of the applicant 's correspondence by the Minister of ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The following letters were censored :", "( i ) the applicant 's letter of DATE to his wife ( delivery of this letter was delayed by FAC as the prison authorities , considering the content to be suspect , first sent it to the judicial authorities ) ;", "( ii ) a letter of DATE sent to the applicant by his first lawyer ( stamped by FAC censors ) ;", "( iii ) a letter of DATE sent by the applicant to his family ( stamped by ORG censors ) ;", "( iv ) a letter sent by the applicant to his wife on DATE enclosing a certificate ( the Termini Imerese Prison authorities had intercepted the letter and sent it to ORG at ORG with a request for permission to remit the letter to the applicant ; as no reply was received , the letter was never remitted to him ) ;", "( v ) a letter from the applicant to his family posted on DATE ( stamped by ORG censors ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as a result of a ORG decision ( no . CARDINAL of DATE see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the Minister of ORG rescinded the measure regarding censorship of correspondence that had been issued in orders made under LAW bis .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's correspondence nonetheless continued to be subject to censorship as a result of ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ordered rescission of that order , but the applicant 's correspondence continued to be censored notwithstanding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant reverted to the ordinary prison regime ; the change entailed among other things an end to censorship . However , CARDINAL letter ( sent to the applicant by his wife on DATE ) was nonetheless censored by FAC authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of ORG authorities , an order was made by the President of ORG of ORG , renewing censorship of the applicant 's correspondence . The following letters were censored :", "( i ) a letter of DATE sent to the applicant by his second lawyer ( stamped by PERSON ) ;", "( ii ) NORP letters sent to the applicant by his wife on DATE , DATE and DATE containing CARDINAL photographs of the applicant 's children ( and each bearing FAC censors ' stamp ) ;", "( iii ) a letter of DATE from the applicant to his family ( stamped by PERSON ) ;", "( iv ) a letter of DATE sent to the applicant by his children ( stamped by PERSON ) ;", "( v ) a letter of DATE sent to the applicant by his granddaughter ( stamp illegible ) ;", "( vi ) letters of DATE and DATE sent to the applicant by his wife ( stamped by PERSON ) ;", "( vii ) a letter of DATE apparently sent to the applicant by members of his family ( stamped by PERSON ) ;", "( viii ) an undated letter sent to the applicant by his granddaughter ( stamped by PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the CARDINAL letters sent to the applicant by his lawyers on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , ORG authorities said that they could not be regarded as being correspondence with defence counsel for the purposes of LAW transitional provisions of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On an application dated DATE by the PERSON public prosecutor 's office ORG made an order on DATE imposing preventive measures on the applicant , who was put under special police supervision and required to live at FAC for DATE . ORG found in particular that the applicant had been shown to be dangerous by concrete evidence : he was being investigated in connection with a very serious offence , was in detention pending trial and , along with other suspected mafiosi , held shares in a company that ran a discotheque where members of the ORG met .", "The applicant was required , inter alia :", "( i ) not to leave his home without informing the authorities responsible for supervising him ;", "( ii ) to live an honest life and not to arouse suspicion ;", "( iii ) not to associate with persons who had a criminal record or who were subject to preventive or security measures ;", "( iv ) not to return home TIME or to leave home before TIME , unless due cause could be shown and in all cases only after informing the authority responsible for supervising him ;", "( v ) not to keep or carry weapons ;", "( vi ) not to go to bars or attend public meetings ;", "( vii ) to have on him at all times the card setting out his precise obligations under the preventive measures and a copy of the court order ;", "( viii ) to report to the relevant police station on DATE TIME .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG found that it was not possible to conclude from the evidence on the file that the company referred to had been used to launder money coming from illegal ORG activities . It consequently made an order for severance of the proceedings relating to the attachment both of the applicant 's holding in the company concerned and some of his immovable property .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , but his appeal was dismissed on DATE .", "The court of appeal noted , firstly , that a presumption arose under PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE that a member of the ORG was dangerous and that for the purposes of the imposition of preventive measures , such membership could be established on the basis of inferences , full proof being required only to secure a conviction . In the case before it , there was circumstantial evidence against the applicant , such as the decisions to detain him pending trial and to commit him for trial . Furthermore , ORG had clearly stated that the applicant was both a member and the treasurer of a mafiatype organisation . There were other factors , too , such as the applicant 's business relations with other mafiosi . The applicant 's contact with the ORG was also confirmed by the fact that he had seen fit to marry the sister of a mafia boss and thus to become a member of a mafia clan , which undoubtedly made it likely that he would receive requests for assistance from that criminal organisation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , but that appeal was also dismissed in a judgment of DATE on the ground that the assessment whether a person was dangerous was based on any factor which the court found to be cogent . ORG and ORG had established that it was likely that the applicant belonged to the FAC mafia clan on the basis of the evidence that had led to the applicant being kept in pre - trial detention . No appeal lay to ORG against the verdict of the trial and appellate courts on the facts .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on CARDINAL DATE the PERSON ordered the applicant to surrender his passport . That order could not be executed as the applicant said that it had been lost .

Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant had applied to ORG for an order lifting the preventive measures on the ground that he had now been finally acquitted ( by a judgment of DATE ) and that it was impossible for him to find employment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed that application . In doing so , it firstly reiterated the settled case - law of ORG whereby matters established at trial , though insufficient to support a conviction , could , if appropriate when coupled with other evidence , nonetheless amount to serious evidence capable of proving that a person who has been acquitted might be dangerous . That , said ORG , was the position in the case before it . It considered that the statements made by PERSON showed that the applicant had associated with the FAC mafia clan , as proved by the fact that his late brother - in - law had been the head of the main clan . As to his inability to find work , the court considered that it was unrelated to the preventive measures since the applicant could at any stage have sought permission to work and would have been authorised to do so , provided , of course , that the work was compatible with his obligations under the preventive measures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's identity card was returned marked \u201c not valid for foreign travel \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant made a further request to ORG to rescind the preventive measures against him repeating that he had now been finally acquitted and stressing that he had always complied with the preventive measures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed that application stating , firstly , that the proceedings concerning the preventive measures were quite separate from the criminal proceedings so that the acquittal had no automatic effect on the preventive measures that had already been ordered .
