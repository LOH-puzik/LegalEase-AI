THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-4;No violation of Art. 5-1;Not necessary to examine art. 5-2;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , a GPE citizen born in DATE , died in DATE . At the time of lodging his application with the ORG he was detained in ORG , a special secure mental hospital for the criminally insane .", "His complaints were directed against his recall to ORG in DATE , following a DATE period of conditional discharge . He claimed that his recall was unjustified , that he was not promptly given sufficient reasons for his re - detention , and that he had no effective way of challenging the authorities\u2019 action .", "CARDINAL . In GPE and GPE the law relating to the confinement of persons of unsound mind , and more particularly the compulsory detention of patients concerned in criminal proceedings , is contained in LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" ) . At present , a review of the relevant provisions of the LAW is under way .", "A \" patient \" is defined by section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL as \" a person suffering or appearing to suffer from mental disorder \" ; according to section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL , \" mental disorder \" means \" mental illness , arrested or incomplete development of mind , psychopathic disorder , any other disorder or disability of mind \" . The \" responsible medical officer \" ( as referred to in subsequent paragraphs of this judgment ) is defined by LAW . CARDINAL as being \" the medical practitioner in charge of the treatment of the patient \" .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL of the DATE Act empowers criminal courts to direct where appropriate that a person convicted of an offence shall be dealt with by way of medical treatment rather than by way of punishment , if necessary in a special secure mental hospital for the criminally insane ( section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ) . Thus , where a person is convicted before a ORG - prior to DATE , ORG or DATE an offence other than an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law , the court may , pursuant to section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL , by order ( hereafter referred to as a \" hospital order \" ) authorise his admission to and detention in such hospital as may be specified in the order . The conditions which must be met include the following :", "a ) the court must be satisfied , on the written or oral evidence of CARDINAL medical practitioners ( CARDINAL of whom has special experience in the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorders ) , that the offender is suffering from mental illness , psychopathic disorder , subnormality or severe subnormality ; and that the mental disorder is of a nature or degree which warrants the detention of the patient in a hospital for mental treatment ;", "b ) the court must be of the opinion , having regard to all the circumstances , including the nature of the offence and the character and antecedents of the offender , and to the other available methods of dealing with him , that the most suitable method of disposing of the case is by means of a hospital order .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL , where it appears to the court , having regard to the nature of the offence , the antecedents of the offender and the risk of his committing further offences if set at large , that it is necessary for the protection of the public , the court may by further order ( hereafter referred to as a \" restriction order \" ) direct that the hospital order shall be subject to special restrictions in respect of discharge , either without limit of time or during such a period as may be specified in the order . Before making a restriction order , the court must hear oral evidence from CARDINAL of the medical practitioners mentioned above .", "CARDINAL . Where a restriction order has been made , responsibility for the control of the patient , though not for his treatment , is vested in the Home Secretary .", "Thus , the Home Secretary has special powers under LAW of LAW in connection with the discharge of restricted patients . If he is satisfied that the restriction order is no longer required for the protection of the public , he may direct that the patient shall cease to be subject to the special restrictions ( sub - section CARDINAL ) . While a restriction order is in force , he may , \" if he thinks fit \" , discharge a patient from hospital either absolutely or subject to certain conditions ; where he absolutely discharges him the restriction order ceases to have effect ( sub - section CARDINAL ) . If the discharge is conditional , the Home Secretary may , at any time during the continuance in force of the restriction order , by warrant recall the patient to hospital ( sub - section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW , the Home Secretary may at any time refer to a ORG for their advice the case of a patient who is for the time being subject to a restriction order . The patient himself may not apply directly to such a ORG , but he may ask the Home Secretary in writing to do so . Where so asked by a patient who is detained in hospital , the ORG Secretary must refer the patient \u2019s case to the ORG within DATE of the receipt of the request unless during that period he discharges the patient absolutely or conditionally . Such requests may only be made at certain specified intervals , namely DATE after the date of the relevant hospital order , DATE after that and thereafter once DATE . In the case of a patient conditionally discharged and subsequently recalled , application may be made DATE after readmission , DATE after readmission and thereafter DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG , set up under section CARDINAL of LAW , consist of a lawyer , a psychiatrist ( independent of the detaining authority who examines the patient ) and a third member with suitable qualifications . CARDINAL of the functions of such a ORG is to advise the ORG Secretary periodically about the patient \u2019s condition ( see the preceding paragraph ) . The ORG Secretary takes this advice into consideration , but is not bound by it . He may therefore reject the advice where medical opinion is not unequivocal , there is a conflict with other advice he has received or the interests of public safety so require .", "Rule CARDINAL of ORG provides that a ORG shall consider a reference made by the ORG Secretary in whatever informal manner they think appropriate , that they may interview the patient and that they shall interview him if he so requests . In practice , a restricted patient may , like any other detained patient , be legally represented or accompanied by members of his family , or both . The dossier of papers supplied to the ORG by ORG is not generally disclosed to the patient himself and only partially disclosed to the legal representative , if any . In particular , the home circumstances report is never sent to the legal representative and the up - to - date medical report only if the responsible medical officer agrees .", "Advice from ORG about restricted patients is regarded as confidential to the ORG Secretary . Patients and the representatives are simply told that the Minister \u2019s decision has been taken in the light of ORG advice .", "CARDINAL . According to the evidence submitted by the Government , there are CARDINAL ways by which the need for continued detention of a restricted patient may come to be reviewed by ORG :", "- there may be a recommendation from the medical officer responsible for the patient that the patient should be discharged ;", "- the patient may ask for his case to be referred to a ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ;", "- the patient may write about his case to a Member of ORG who brings it to the attention of the Secretary of ORG ;", "- the patient himself may write to the Secretary of ORG asking that he be discharged .", "CARDINAL . The person responsible for initially taking a recalled patient \" into custody \" will usually be a police officer , but may also be a social worker , a probation officer , a nursing officer or \" any person authorised in writing by the managers of the hospital \" ( see sections CARDINAL par . CARDINAL and CARDINAL par . CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW ) .", "At the end of DATE ministerial circulars issued to the relevant authorities , including the police , the probation service and the special hospitals , announced that \" in order to meet criticisms made by ORG , a new CARDINAL - stage procedure for informing recalled patients of the reasons for their re - detention was to be introduced . At the first stage of this procedure , the person taking the patient into custody should inform the patient in simple terms that he is being recalled to hospital on the authority of the ORG Secretary pursuant to the provisions of LAW and that a further explanation will be given later . A detailed account of the reasons for the recall must then be provided to the patient by the medical staff at the hospital where he is to be detained ; this is to be done as soon as possible after the patient \u2019s admission to hospital and in any event within TIME of admission . The responsible medical officer is also required to ensure that the officer who supervised the patient during release and a responsible member of the patient \u2019s family ( or his legal adviser ) are informed of the reasons .", "CARDINAL . Any person who is detained may make an ex parte , that is to say , a unilateral , application for a writ of habeas corpus to a ORG of ORG or , if no such ORG is sitting at that time , to a single judge ( of ORG ) in court or , if there is none , to such a judge wherever he may be found . Habeas corpus is a common law remedy , developed both by statute and by the courts themselves , by which a person may challenge the legality of his detention . Applications are given priority over other business . The case is considered on the basis of affidavit evidence , as to which cross - examination does not take place in practice . The normal procedure is for applications to be made by counsel ; only in exceptional circumstances would a court hear an applicant in person . The judge or ORG may , where the illegality is clear , order that the writ issue forthwith but more commonly will arrange for the person holding the detainee to be notified of the application and be given an opportunity of appearing before the full court to justify the detention . If at the hearing ORG is not satisfied that the detention is lawful , it will issue the writ which will have the effect of procuring the release of the person detained .", "There is in this respect no limitation on access to the courts by patients detained under LAW . According to the Government , such patients may apply at any time for a writ of habeas corpus save that where an application fails a fresh application made on the same grounds but without fresh evidence to support it will not succeed .", "CARDINAL . The scope of review open to the courts in habeas corpus proceedings can be extensive . Under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL , the courts may inquire into the truth of the facts stated in the return to a writ of habeas corpus where the applicant is confined \" otherwise than for some criminal or supposed criminal matter and except persons imprisoned for debt or by process in any civil suit \" .", "CARDINAL . However , the operation in practice of the remedy of habeas corpus is by no means uniform and the case - law is not free from apparent contradiction . CARDINAL factor partially explaining the apparently contradictory nature of the case - law is , as the Government pointed out , that the scope of review undertaken by the courts varies according to the context in which the application for a writ is brought . In particular , where the liberty of the subject has been restrained on account of an order made in purported exercise of a discretionary power vested by statute in the executive authorities , the scope of review will to a large extent be governed by the terms of the relevant statute .", "In habeas corpus proceedings , in examining an administrative decision to detain , the court will always inquire whether the applicant has been lawfully detained in accordance with the requirements stated in the relevant legislation . Furthermore , even an order for detention that is technically good on its face can be upset , inter alia , if the detaining authority misused its powers by acting in bad faith or capriciously or for a wrongful purpose ( see NORP v. Governor of ORG , ex parte PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL King \u2019s Bench CARDINAL and NORP v. FAC ( Governor ) , ex parte LOC ( DATE ) CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) , or if the decision to detain is supported by no sufficient evidence or is CARDINAL which no reasonable person could have reached in the circumstances ( see PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL and PERSON Secretary of ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . Subject to the foregoing , the court will not be able to review the grounds or merits of a decision taken by an administrative authority to the extent that under the legislation in question these are exclusively a matter for determination by that authority .", "If the return to the writ on its face shows a valid authority for the detention , it will in effect be for the applicant to establish that the detention is illegal ( see Re Wajid Hassan ( DATE ) CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL and PERSON Secretary of ORG , loc . cit . ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE , the applicant received psychiatric treatment for delusions . He was diagnosed as having a paranoid psychosis .", "On DATE , he appeared at ORG and pleaded guilty to a charge of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm . The facts before the court were that the applicant had struck a workmate in the mouth with a heavy spanner .", "Following his conviction , the court remanded him in custody for medical reports . At the adjourned hearing on DATE , oral reports were given by CARDINAL medical practitioners concerning the applicant \u2019s mental health ; the court made an order under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act for his admission to and detention in ORG , a special secure mental hospital for the criminally insane . The court also made a restriction order against the applicant for an indefinite period in accordance with section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . During X \u2019s detention in ORG , his case was frequently reviewed by the hospital authorities . In DATE , his case was referred , at his own request , to a ORG . In the light of the ORG \u2019s advice , the ORG Secretary decided not to authorise the applicant \u2019s discharge or transfer to another hospital .", "However , in DATE , the responsible medical officer was able to report an improvement in GPE \u2019s condition to the extent that he recommended that X should be conditionally discharged . On DATE , the Home Secretary ordered the applicant \u2019s conditional discharge under section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL of LAW . The conditions to be observed were that the applicant should reside at the matrimonial home , be under the supervision of a probation officer and attend a psychiatric out - patients\u2019 clinic as directed by the responsible medical officer at ORG .", "CARDINAL . Throughout the time of his conditional discharge the applicant lived with his wife . He committed no further criminal offence . After an initial period of unemployment , he eventually settled into stable employment . He was seen at regular intervals by the nominated probation officer and a consultant psychiatrist at GPE . Reports on his mental condition indicated that he continued to suffer from mental disorder , but until DATE the probation officer , the responsible medical officer at ORG to whom the probation officer was reporting and the consultant psychiatrist in GPE saw no reason why he should not stay at liberty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , however , the applicant \u2019s wife visited the probation officer and told him that the applicant \u2019s condition had not , for a long time , been as she had described in her previous progress reports . On the contrary , she said , he remained deluded and threatening , using obscene language , accusing her of loose morals , and drinking quite heavily . She told the probation officer that she had reached the end of her endurance and intended to leave her husband DATE , but was afraid to stay in the house with him that night .", "The probation officer alerted the responsible medical officer at ORG . The medical officer was aware of X \u2019s previous history , including his record of impulsive and dangerous conduct under stress ; he also had copies of the psychiatric reports prepared on X during the latter \u2019s period of conditional release . In consequence , the doctor became alarmed at the possibility of a recurrence of violent behaviour by X , especially if X came to know of his wife \u2019s intention to leave him . The doctor did not judge it necessary to seek to have the wife \u2019s complaints verified since it was in his view sufficient that the complaints had been made and that the probation officer found them credible . The doctor therefore referred the matter to the ORG Secretary who , acting on his advice , ordered the applicant \u2019s immediate recall to ORG in pursuance of section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , shortly after his return home from work , X was taken into custody by the police . There is no evidence as to what exactly the police said to the applicant on detaining him . X maintained that he received no explanation other than the warrant order itself . The Government referred to the usual procedure then applied in cases of this kind whereby the person concerned was simply informed that he was being recalled to ORG by the ORG Secretary . X was detained TIME and escorted back to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on his arrival at the hospital he was not given any explanation for his recall , although he inferred from interviews with the responsible medical officer some time after his readmission that it had something to do with complaints from his wife .", "The Government maintained that immediately on ORG return to ORG the responsible medical officer sought to explain to him the reasons for his recall , and in particular the fears and anxieties expressed by his wife . However , since X was at this time extremely resentful , disturbed and suffering from delusions , it is possible , so the ORG submitted , that he did not fully understand or appreciate the explanations afforded to him .", "CARDINAL . On TIME before being escorted back to ORG , ORG had instructed solicitors to apply for a writ of habeas corpus on his behalf .", "The following DATE , the solicitors spoke on the telephone to the responsible medical officer who , in confidence , mentioned in general terms the wife \u2019s visit to the probation officer , her anxiety regarding aspects of the applicant \u2019s behaviour and his , the doctor \u2019s , action in advising recall because of concern for the wife \u2019s safety .", "The application - which was made ex parte - came before ORG on DATE With the agreement of ORG \u2019s counsel , the application was adjourned in order to enable further information to be sought ; the ORG wished in particular to know more about the reasons that had led to the ORG Secretary \u2019s action . CARDINAL of the judges remarked : \" It really needs more information , ... and very often the patient himself is unable to give it . CARDINAL has to look to the sources which have called for his recall . \"", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to ORG requesting information as to the reasons for their client \u2019s recall . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG replied :", "\" In DATE the supervising probation officer reported to the responsible consultant psychiatrist at ORG that [ X \u2019s ] condition was giving cause for concern . In the light of the advice subsequently received from the consultant ORG considered it necessary for the protection of the public and in [ X \u2019s ] own interest that he would be recalled to hospital immediately for further observation and treatment . \"", "The solicitors also approached the probation service in GPE , but the probation service declined to supply them with the information sought .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the adjourned application for a writ of habeas corpus was heard in ORG of ORG . ORG had before it the ORG letter of CARDINAL DATE , letters from CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s former workmates stating that they found nothing unusual about his behaviour , and affidavits from the applicant himself , from his general practitioner and from the consultant psychiatrist in GPE . Exhibited to the CARDINAL latter affidavits were medical reports supplied at the request of PERSON \u2019s solicitors and covering the period of conditional discharge .", "In his report , dated DATE , the consultant psychiatrist wrote :", "\" For quite a time I felt that whilst one was sitting on a time - bomb I had no clear evidence that he was in fact likely to be harmful to somebody . Nevertheless I felt very apprehensive throughout the whole of his period ... In my opinion the man is a querulous suspicious person liable to paranoid ideation and inevitably presents a risk to the community ... \"", "He also confirmed views he had expressed in DATE in a letter to the GPE probation service . In this letter he spoke of the need to \" steer [ X ] clear of depressed situations which could lead to murder or serious bodily harm to other people \" , and added :", "\" The greatest danger in handling him is to lose one \u2019s judgement to such an extent that one minimises the degree to which he has shown evidence of a striking paranoid psychosis . \"", "Counsel for the applicant , stating that his client had not the slightest idea why the probation officer had alerted the responsible medical officer at ORG , explained :", "\" ... although enquiries have been made , no information has been obtained on that point so that it is difficult for the applicant or his advisers to know whether there was sufficient justification for the course taken by the Home Secretary . \"", "CARDINAL . At the close of the hearing , ORG rejected the application . Although the record of the proceedings contained in the transcript is not entirely clear , it would appear that the ORG , in reaching its conclusion , had regard to the discretion vested in the ORG Secretary under LAW par . CARDINAL of LAW , the apprehension expressed by the consultant psychiatrist , and the fact that the probation officer saw possible signs of impending danger to other people . The concluding remarks of CARDINAL of the judges on the ORG were as follows :", "\" Unless the ORG authorities , [ the consultant psychiatrist ] and the ORG Secretary take this view , then people life [ X ] can not be released from hospital except in the most exceptional circumstances . The only possible way this can operate is by letting people out on licence , with very careful supervision , and an immediate reaction in the event of any signs of new danger ... \"", "CARDINAL . Following X \u2019s readmission to ORG , his responsible medical officer was of the opinion that he should be further detained for treatment and medical reports indicated that he remained in a psychotic state .", "In DATE , X asked the Home Secretary to refer his case to a ORG in accordance with section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; PERSON claimed to have made an earlier request in DATE , but there is no record of this , either in ORG or at ORG . The hearing before ORG took place in DATE . The ORG \u2019s advice , which was not communicated to X or his solicitors , was to the effect that the patient continued to suffer from mental illness but could now be released provided he remained subject to certain conditions . In DATE , the responsible medical officer having noted an improvement in the patient \u2019s state , the ORG Secretary agreed in principle to a conditional discharge if suitable arrangements could be made .", "X left the hospital in DATE on leave .
