On DATE ORG ( tapaturmavirasto , olycksfallsverket - \" ORG \" ) gave its decision on a request by the applicant for compensation under the DATE Military Injuries Act ( sotilasvammalaki , lag om skada , \u00e5dragen i milit\u00e4rtj\u00e4nst , PERSON LAW \" ) from ORG in respect of certain conditions which he claimed resulted from his service in the wars DATE between GPE and GPE . ORG accepted that a shrapnel wound to the applicant \u2019s back was a military injury but rejected his claims in respect of inguinal hernia , chronic prostatitis , acute tonsillitis and a number of other conditions . Considering that the degree of his disability was CARDINAL per cent , the minimum required to qualify for a life annuity ( elinkorko , livr\u00e4nta ) under section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG refused to grant him such a benefit .", "On appeal , ORG ( vakuutusoikeus , f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ) recognised that the applicant in addition suffered from tonsillitis entitling him in principle to compensation but found that the degree of his disability nevertheless remained CARDINAL per cent . On DATE it therefore dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for compensation . This decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant asked ORG to adjust the degree of his disability . He cited a medical report of DATE to establish that he suffered from the above - mentioned conditions . In DATE he submitted a further report .", "ORG rejected the request on DATE on the ground that the applicant had failed to show a fundamental change in the circumstances on the basis of which his disability had initially been assessed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed from that decision to ORG . He adduced additional evidence , including the results of an X - ray examination and laboratory tests of CARDINAL DATE , and renewed his previous request for compensation in so far as it had been refused in the proceedings referred to in paragraph CARDINAL above .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings ORG obtained an opinion from ORG , dated DATE , which , without giving reasons , recommended the rejection of the appeal . It also received copies of a master file concerning the applicant , and a medical file containing a record of his war - time medical examinations , from the ORG of the Military District of Western Uusimaa ( PERSON sotilaspiirin esikunta , staben f\u00f6r LOC milit\u00e4rdistrikt ) . These documents showed , inter alia , that in DATE the applicant had been treated in a military hospital for inguinal hernia and that in DATE he had undergone an operation for this condition .", "ORG did not communicate copies of the opinion or files to the applicant . They were , however , included in ORG case file , which was available to the applicant throughout the proceedings in that court ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act on ORG - laki yleisten asiakirjain julkisuudesta , lagen om allm\u00e4nna handlingars offentlighet , CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on the assessment of the degree of his disability , finding that his shrapnel injuries and acute tonsillitis still represented a disability of CARDINAL per cent . It also rejected his claim for compensation on the ground that it had been decided with legal force ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) by ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The decision stated that ORG had obtained the above - mentioned opinion from ORG and files from the ORG of the Military District . It further indicated that ORG would return the master file and the file pertaining to the applicant \u2019s war - time medical examinations to the ORG and that an appeal could be lodged with ORG \" if the matter [ concerned ] entitlement to compensation \" .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , challenging ORG ruling that a final decision on his compensation claim had been given by ORG on DATE . He requested rehabilitation treatment on an DATE basis and the reimbursement of certain subsistence expenses . He claimed that his war injuries were permanent . His appeal did not mention that the documents obtained by ORG had not been communicated to him .", "CARDINAL . ORG transmitted the case file to ORG ; it included ORG opinion but not the master and medical files , which had been returned to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . According to the Government , copies of the master file had been included in the case file relating to the first set of proceedings in ORG . The Government further stated that , in the second set of proceedings , ORG and ORG had based their decisions at least in part on the master and medical files .", "CARDINAL . The Agent of the Government stated at the public hearing on DATE that at the material time it was consistent practice of ORG and ORG not to communicate documents of the kind in question even if they had been obtained at the court \u2019s own request and irrespective of whether the issue at stake was one of admissibility or merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision of DATE . ORG decision stated :", "\" The appeal to ORG has requested compensation for [ certain alleged illnesses ] . The finding of ORG The decision of ORG is not varied .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not legally represented either in ORG or in ORG . At no stage of the proceedings did he consult the case file .", "CARDINAL . A compensation scheme , entirely funded by ORG , for injury and illness suffered as a result of military service was set up under LAW .

The general rule in CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW provides that compensation under LAW \" shall be granted \" to persons for injury or illness suffered by them as a result of service , inter alia , as conscripts .

Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) in \" LAW . On Compensation \" ( ORG ) reads :", "\" A wounded or ill person whose degree of disability is CARDINAL per cent shall be entitled to a life annuity . The figure representing the degree of disability corresponds to the extent to which the injury or illness suffered reduces the ability of the person concerned to support himself or herself . \"", "CARDINAL . LAW ( CARDINAL ) , as applicable at the material time , provided that an appeal against a decision by ORG on entitlement to compensation under LAW lay to ORG . A decision by ORG was however to be final in certain matters .", "ORG has interpreted the above provision to mean that the person concerned can appeal on entitlement to compensation but not on the degree of disability , so that an appeal on the latter is inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . According to a general principle of law in GPE , a decision by ORG rejecting , in full or in part , a claim by an individual to be granted a benefit from a public authority has legal force ( lainvoima , laga kraft ) , in the sense that it may not be the subject of a further appeal . However , it is not res judicata ( oikeusvoima , r\u00e4ttskraft ) . The claimant may at any time , by means of a fresh application , request the competent authority to reconsider the claim ( see , inter alia , ORG , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , pp . CARDINAL in GPE - oikeus p\u00e4\u00e4piirteitt\u00e4in , GPE DATE ) . This principle also applies to a request for compensation under LAW .", "CARDINAL .
