GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;No violation of Art. 14+8;Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Luzius Wildhaber", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , a NORP national born in DATE , lives in GPE . He is the father of the child , C. , born out of wedlock on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE he acknowledged paternity and undertook to pay maintenance for C. He fulfilled this obligation regularly .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant had been living with the child 's mother and her elder son PERSON . In DATE the mother , together with the CARDINAL children , moved out of the flat . The applicant continued to see his son frequently until DATE . On several occasions , he also spent his holidays with the CARDINAL children and their mother . Subsequently , no more visits took place .", "CARDINAL . The applicant attempted to visit his son with the assistance of ORG ( ORG ) , acting as mediator . When questioned by an official of ORG at his home in DATE , PERSON stated that he did not wish to have further contacts with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( ORG ) for a decision granting him a right of access ( GPE ) to C. on DATE , QUANTITY The applicant maintained that the mother had refused him access to C. because he had accused her of having failed to ensure the supervision of the child when he had broken his arm in a playground accident in DATE and as a result of which he had stopped the voluntary DATE payments of MONEY which he claimed to have made at the mother 's request in addition to the stipulated child maintenance . The mother contested the applicant 's submissions . She stated that the applicant had always been very generous to her but that he had not paid her any maintenance .", "CARDINAL . ORG , after a hearing on DATE and having heard C. on DATE , dismissed the applicant 's request on DATE . The court observed that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) concerning the father 's right to personal contact with his child born out of wedlock ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was conceived as an exemption clause which had to be construed strictly . Thus , the competent court should order such access only if this was advantageous and beneficial for the child 's well - being . According to the court 's findings , these conditions were not met in the applicant 's case . ORG noted that the child had been heard and had stated that he no longer wished to see his father who , according to the child , was bad and had beaten his mother repeatedly . The mother likewise had strong objections to the applicant which she had imparted to the child , so that the child had no possibility of building an unbiased relationship with his father . ORG concluded that contacts with the father would not enhance the child 's well - being .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for an order requiring the child 's mother to consent to a family therapy for him and the child and for an order determining his right of access after contacts with his son had successfully resumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG recommended that the court should obtain a psychological expert opinion on the question of access rights .", "CARDINAL . Having heard C. on DATE and his parents at an oral hearing on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's renewed request to be granted access on DATE .", "In so doing , the court referred to its prior decision of CARDINAL DATE and found that the conditions under LAW were not met . It noted that the applicant 's relationship with the child 's mother was so strained that the enforcement of access rights could not be envisaged as this would not be in the interest of the child 's well - being . The child knew about his mother 's objections to the applicant and had adopted them . If PERSON were to be with the applicant against his mother 's will , this would put him into a loyalty conflict which he could not cope with and which would affect his well - being . The court added that it was irrelevant which parent was responsible for the tension ; it placed particular emphasis on the fact that important tensions existed and that there was a risk that any further contacts with the father would affect the child 's undisturbed development in the family of the custodial parent . After CARDINAL long interviews with the child , ORG reached the conclusion that his development would be endangered if the child had to take up contact with his father contrary to his mother 's will . At these interviews the child had called his father \u201c nasty \u201d or \u201c stupid \u201d , adding that on no account did he wish to see him and said also : \u201c PERSON always says PERSON is not my father . PERSON is afraid of PERSON . \u201d", "ORG furthermore considered that the facts of the case had been established clearly and exhaustively for the purposes of Article CARDINAL of LAW . It therefore found it unnecessary to obtain an expert opinion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged an appeal ( Beschwerde ) against this decision , requesting that that decision be quashed , that an expert opinion be obtained on the questions of access and of the child 's true wishes in this respect , and that the father 's access rights be determined accordingly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) , without a hearing , dismissed the applicant 's appeal . In so doing , it first stated that there were doubts on the admissibility of the appeal as the applicant , by letter of CARDINAL DATE , had informed the court of first instance that he would respect that court 's decision , and had requested help in order to reach a friendly settlement . Furthermore , ORG found that the grounds of appeal contained in his submissions did not fully coincide with the request addressed by the applicant to the court of first instance .", "ORG , however , left open the question of whether or not the appeal was inadmissible and decided that in any event the applicant 's request for access rights had to be dismissed as access was not in the interests of the child 's well - being . It was not sufficient that such contacts were compatible with the child 's well - being ; they had to be advantageous and beneficial ( n\u00fctzlich und f\u00f6rderlich ) , and necessary for the child 's equilibrium ( seelisch notwendiginter alia , the reasons for which the father wished to have contacts with the child , that is , whether his motives were emotional or based on other factors . In this context the relationship between the parents had to be taken into account as well .", "ORG concluded , in line with the decision appealed against , that the tensions between the parents had a negative effect on the child , as was confirmed by the hearings with the child held on DATE and DATE , and that contact with his father was not therefore in the child 's best interest , even less so because this contact had in fact been interrupted for CARDINAL . It was irrelevant who was responsible for the break - up of life in common . What mattered was that in the present situation contact with the father would negatively affect the child . This conclusion , in ORG view , was obvious , which was why there was no necessity of obtaining an opinion from an expert in psychology . Moreover , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW did not provide for a psychological therapy to prepare a child for contact with his or her father . ORG finally observed that there was no necessity to hear the parents and the child again since there was no indication that any findings more favourable for the applicant could result from such a hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) refused to entertain the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( ORG ) .", "According to ORG , the complaint did not raise any issues of a general character affecting the observance of the LAW . In particular , the question of whether LAW was compatible with the right to family life as guaranteed by LAW ) did not arise , as the ordinary courts had based the denial of the applicant 's request for access rights not only on the ground that such a right would not serve the child 's well - being , but also on the much stronger reason that it was incompatible with the child 's well - being . Furthermore , the right to a fair hearing was not violated by the fact that the applicant had not been heard personally and that his request to obtain an expert opinion had been rejected .", "CARDINAL . The statutory provisions on custody and access are to be found in the NORP Civil Code ( ORG ) . They have been amended on several occasions and many were repealed by the amended PERSON on Family Matters ( Reform zum Kindschaftsrecht ) of DATE ( ORG ( PERSON - BGBl ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , which came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

According to LAW , as amended , a child is entitled to have access to both parents ; each parent is obliged to have contact with , and entitled to have access to , the child .

The family courts can , however , restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child 's welfare . A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if otherwise the child 's well - being would be endangered . The family courts may order that right of access be exercised in the presence of a third party , such as a ORG authority or an association .", "CARDINAL .
