On DATE he requested his release .", "In the subsequent proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer .", "On DATE an expert member of ORG ( PERSON ) of the GPE of ORG examined the applicant in hospital . As a result , ORG authorised on DATE his forced confinement in hospital ( zwangsweise GPE ) until DATE . In its decision the Commission referred to the applicant 's chronic illness , in particular his manic ideas ( PERSON ) and that he might endanger others . The Commission thereby relied on PERSON et seq . of ORG ( PERSON ) concerning detention for welfare purposes ( f\u00fcrsorgerische GPE ; privation de libert\u00e9 \u00e0 des fins d\u2019assistance ; see below , Relevant domestic law and practice ) .", "On DATE the psychiatric university clinic requested the applicant \u2019s continuing psychiatric detention as his situation had not ameliorated . An expert member of ORG again examined the applicant on DATE and concluded that he suffered from a chronic mental illness . The expert noted that the applicant was ready to stay in the clinic until he had found a new apartment .", "On DATE ORG authorised , with reference to the expert \u2019s examination of DATE , the applicant 's continuing forced confinement until he had found a new apartment or at the latest until DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) of the GPE of GPE - Stadt , requesting his immediate release from the clinic or at least a finding that his stay in the clinic had been unlawful . He submitted , inter alia , that he had not been properly heard by the members of ORG .", "ORG transmitted the appeal on DATE to ORG which , on DATE , filed its observations . The Commission noted that the applicant had agreed to stay in the clinic until he found a new apartment ; he could move about freely and also leave the clinic though he returned at TIME to sleep . As long as he was under medicaments there was no danger of endangering others , though this could change immediately if the medicaments were taken belatedly , or not at all .", "On DATE the applicant was released from the clinic .", "On DATE ORG declared the applicant 's appeal inadmissible as he had meanwhile been released and therefore lacked interest in his appeal ( fehlendes NORP ) . The ORG thereby referred to its constant case - law . To the extent that the applicant requested compensation in view of the alleged unlawfulness of his detention , the ORG noted that he had the possibility of filing a separate civil claim according to PERSON of ORG ( see below , Relevant domestic law and practice ) . The decision of ORG was served on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed a public law appeal ( staatsrechtliche Beschwerde ) and an appeal ( GPE ) with ORG ( PERSON ) , claiming that he had a legal interest in his complaints , and requesting legal aid . In his appeal , he furthermore addressed the unlawfulness of his detention , in his public law appeal he complained about the length of the proceedings .", "In a decision dated DATE and issued in respect of the applicant 's appeal , ORG dismissed his request for legal aid and imposed advance court costs of MONEY ( CHF ) on the applicant . The ORG found in particular that the appeal lacked prospects of success as the applicant had meanwhile been released . The ORG thereby referred to its case - law as well as a previous case in which it had already explained this case - law to the applicant \u2019s lawyer . As the applicant failed to pay the court costs , ORG declared the appeal inadmissible on DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's public law appeal . Insofar as the applicant complained of the length of the proceedings before the cantonal authorities , the ORG found that he lacked practical interest in his appeal as he had meanwhile been released .", "B.
