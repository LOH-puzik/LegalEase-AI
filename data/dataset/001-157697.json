CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE . These CARDINAL applications were lodged by residents of ORG , GPE , who alleged that their relatives had been killed or wounded , and that they had suffered injuries and lost their property during the attack on the village from DATE . In the ORG case , cited above , the applicant and her relatives were trying to flee the fighting on DATE when an aviation bomb exploded near their minivan , wounding the applicant and killing CARDINAL of her relatives . In the GPE and Others case , cited above , the applicants described how they had been trapped in the village during intense shelling and had tried to leave through what they had perceived to be a safe exit route . The ORG has established a number of facts relevant to the present case , which can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Ever since the start of operations by the NORP military and security forces in GPE in DATE , the village of ORG , situated in ORG , had been considered a \u201c safe zone \u201d . By DATE CARDINAL persons were living there , including local residents and internally displaced persons from elsewhere in GPE . In the period leading up to DATE the residents of ORG were not informed by the ORG authorities about the possible advance of illegal fighters into the village , even though such information was available to the military commanders . On DATE the village was captured by a large group of NORP fighters escaping from PERSON . The NORP military forces carried out an assault , using indiscriminate weapons such as heavy , free - falling aviation bombs , artillery , missiles and other weaponry . Although the operation was not spontaneous and involved the use of indiscriminate and highly lethal weaponry , the residents of the village were provided neither with sufficient time to prepare to leave nor with safe exit routes to escape the fighting . The CARDINAL exits from the village were controlled by the military by means of roadblocks . The residents were allowed to leave through the roadblock on the road leading towards the district centre of ORG , but the other one , on the road leading towards GPE , remained closed during most of the fighting . The shelling of ORG continued until DATE inclusive ( see GPE and Others , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE a large group of insurgent fighters entered ORG , walking into houses and asking for clothes and food . On DATE airstrikes started . The applicant \u2019s family went into hiding in a cellar .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s family decided to travel to ORG , which the applicant \u2019s father described as a \u201c peace zone \u201d . The applicant \u2019s father drove his black GPE car ; her mother and brother PERSON sat in front , while the applicant , her sister GPE and brother PERSON , as well as CARDINAL cousins , PERSON and PERSON , were in the back seat . On DATE they arrived in ORG and stopped in the centre of the village .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , they did not know anyone in the village and an unknown man invited them to stay at his house , as did many other villagers . The family stayed with this man for TIME and everything was calm . On TIME CARDINAL DATE airstrikes started , and there were a lot of explosions . The applicant \u2019s family went into the cellar under their host \u2019s house . Many other people also arrived , including relatives and acquaintances from ORG . They stayed in the cellar throughout DATE , while the shelling of the village continued .", "CARDINAL . Later in the afternoon the applicant \u2019s father said that it was too dangerous to stay in ORG and that they would drive to ORG . The applicant \u2019s father , mother , CARDINAL brothers and CARDINAL cousins , as well as the applicant herself , got into the car . The applicant remembered seeing a lot of people on cars , tractors and on foot trying to get out of ORG . There were explosions .", "CARDINAL . At some point the applicant lost her conscious awareness of what was happening and found herself lying in the road . Their car was burning . She could see her sister GPE , brother PERSON and cousin PERSON . They were all alive but wounded and burned . The applicant could not see her parents . An old man brought the applicant into the courtyard of a house . Sometime later the applicant , her sister , brother and cousin were put on a bus . The applicant lost consciousness and woke to find herself in hospital in ORG . Her legs were covered with plaster , and her face and hands were burned . She also saw her sister GPE in the same room .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her sister were brought by ambulance to GPE , Ingushetia . TIME the applicant did not see her sister and she did not know at that time where her family was .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was discharged from the Nazran hospital , with her legs still in plaster . She was diagnosed with fractures of the left hip and right shin , and thermal burns . The circumstances of the wounding were indicated as \u201c shelling , direct hit on the car in which the family was travelling \u201d . The applicant went to live with her grandmother in ORG .

On DATE the investigation into the criminal case was transferred to the military prosecutor \u2019s office of the North - Caucasus Military Circuit ( the military prosecutor \u2019s office ) .

On this basis the investigation concluded that command corps\u2019 actions were absolutely necessary and proportionate to the resistance put up by the insurgent fighters . It found an absence of corpus delicti in the actions of the servicemen . By the same decision the victim status of CARDINAL individuals was withdrawn . The individuals in question were to be informed of the possibility of seeking redress through civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the victims were not informed by the prosecutor \u2019s office about the termination of the proceedings and nothing happened until DATE , when they learnt that the proceedings had been terminated .", "CARDINAL .

Some of these letters contained the decision of DATE as attachment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL applicants in GPE and Others case lodged a claim with the military court of LOC . They complained about the ineffectiveness and incompleteness of the investigation . In particular , the applicants noted that some of their relatives\u2019 deaths had not been recorded by the investigation and that these persons had not been listed amongst those who died in ORG in DATE . They asked the court to quash the decision to terminate the criminal proceedings and to oblige the military prosecutor \u2019s office to resume the investigation in the criminal case , to grant each of them the status of victim in the criminal proceedings , and to issue them with copies of the relevant decisions . These complaints did not directly refer to the situation of the applicant \u2019s family .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 request was granted and the case was reopened in DATE under the number DATE . However , on DATE the investigation was closed , with the same conclusions as in DATE , on the basis of Article CARDINAL , part CARDINAL of LAW . The decision confirmed the deaths of DATE and the wounding of CARDINAL local residents , without listing their names . An additional expert report was produced by ORG of ORG in DATE , which found that the actions of the command corps in planning and executing the operation had been reasonable and in line with domestic law . No copy of that report has ever been disclosed to the applicants or submitted to ORG . The decision stated in this respect :", "\u201c ...

After issuing a preliminary notification and giving the civilians a real opportunity to leave the village , the subsequent extermination of pockets of the GPE resistance by means of artillery and attack aircraft , employing area - point method ( \u201c \u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e-\u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434 \u201d ) , did not exclude deaths among civilians . At the same time , the use of such means of extermination was consistent with the circumstances and with the measures taken in order to minimise losses among civilians . The actions of the command corps ( commanders ) during the preparation and carrying out of the special operation aimed at the liberation of ORG DATE were in line with the requirements of relevant field manuals , internal regulations and instructions , were lawful and did not contain elements of criminally \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The decision to grant victim status to CARDINAL people was quashed . The military prosecutor of ORG in LOC ( UGA ) forwarded the decision to the head of ORG , asking it to identify the GPE places of residence and to inform them of the closure of the investigation , as well as the possibility of seeking compensation through the civil courts .", "CARDINAL . The name of the applicant in the present case was not listed among the CARDINAL individuals who had been granted victim status .", "CARDINAL . After discharge from hospital , the applicant had to keep plaster on her legs for DATE . Because the hostilities in GPE were still ongoing , her relatives took her to LOC to continue her treatment . In DATE the applicant was taken to GPE for treatment for DATE . In DATE her paternal grandmother , with whom she had been living after her GPE deaths , died . After that the applicant lived with her maternal grandparents in LOC .", "CARDINAL . In their observations of DATE , the Government stated that in DATE a witness had told the investigators about the deaths of CARDINAL people in a NORP car ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 MONEY ) but their identities were unknown at that time . It was not until the applicant \u2019s questioning in DATE ( see below ) that the investigation obtained this information .", "CARDINAL .

She was not informed of the decision to close proceedings of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) . The Government submitted in their observations that this had been an omission on the part of the investigator which had been due to the large number of victims in the case .", "CARDINAL . As is apparent from subsequent documents submitted by the applicant , the investigation into the attack upon ORG was reopened in DATE . The investigators commissioned an additional expert report into the lawfulness and reasonableness of the military intervention . Neither party submitted to the ORG the decision to commission the expert report , the questions put to the experts , or a copy of the report itself , nor is it clear which documents were made available to the experts . The applicant \u2019s knowledge of and involvement in this procedural step has not been clarified . It appears that the document , as most other documents in the file , has been classified . A summary thereof and summaries of other documents are contained in a CARDINAL - page - long extract from the decision to close the criminal investigation issued by a senior investigator of ORG of ORG in ORG on DATE ( extract dated DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The aforementioned extract opensat that time . According to the text , on TIME a group of CARDINAL fighters under the command of field commander PERSON had entered ORG ( also spelled ORG ) . They were armed with automatic firearms , large - calibre machine guns , flame - throwers , portable anti - aircraft launchers and armoured vehicles . On DATE the head of the operations centre ( OC ) of ORG in GPE gave orders to block the village to carry out a special operation . By that time , most inhabitants had left the village and others were hiding in their houses . The decision to evacuate the civilians was taken DATE . The population had been informed of this possibility through the head of the administration and by means of a loudspeaker device mounted on a helicopter . Following skirmishes on the outskirts of ORG and casualties suffered by the security forces , at TIME artillery started to carry out pin - point strikes aimed at clusters of fighters in the centre and on the periphery of the village . After sustaining casualties , a reconnaissance group retreated from ORG on TIME on DATE , following which attack aircraft were called in . Due to the fierce fighting and the artillery and air strikes upon the clusters of fighters , the residents started to leave , and by TIME on DATE \u201c their outflow had become significant \u201d . The extract stated that the special operation had continued for DATE , although the strikes continued until DATE . On TIME [ presumably TIME DATE ] a significant proportion of the fighters , numbering CARDINAL in all , had left the village under cover of poor visibility and escaped into the mountains ; CARDINAL had been killed during the operation . The commanders of the special operation had taken measures to arrange the evacuation of civilians but their plans had been upset by the fighters , especially in the initial stages of the operation . Many residents trying to leave the village had been caught in the crossfire between the fighters and the security forces . Most residents had been killed or injured in the initial stages of the operation , in the central part of the village where the most intense fighting had taken place . No conclusive figure of injured or dead civilians , fighters or security forces was given in the extract .", "CARDINAL . The extract then states that the latest decision to terminate proceedings had occurred on DATE . That decision was quashed on DATE and the investigation was extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The extract goes on to cite statements from various military and civilian witnesses , without indicating their names or ranks or the dates when these statements were taken ( see ORG , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The document also refers to an additional operational - tactical expert report ( \u201c DATE \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430 \u201d ) produced on DATE by unnamed \u201c external experts from the military faculty of ORG \u201d ( \u201c \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044b \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u042e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u201d ) based in GPE - on - Don . As summarised in the extract , the experts\u2019 conclusion did not differ from the findings reached by the previous expert reports commissioned by the investigation ( see paragraphs DATE above ) . The expert report is cited as follows :", "\u201c In DATE the operational situation in the area of the counter - terrorist operation in GPE was extremely tense and difficult . ... After the defeat suffered in the plains of GPE and in PERSON , [ the illegal insurgents ] attempted to move into harsh southern mountainous regions where they would be able to take rest and recover , in order to organise further military action . ... A very difficult situation developed in the area covered by ORG . Their main task was to prevent the illegal insurgents from breaking through from the mountainous areas of GPE to the plains , to identify , disarm and detain members of the illegal armed groups , and to destroy them in the event of armed resistance ...", "... In DATE reconnaissance information was received about the taking of ORG by a large group of fighters . The exact number of fighters was unknown . In order to prevent any further gathering of the fighters , it was decided to surround the village and carry out a special operation there ... A plan for the special operation was worked out . The plan detailed the detachments responsible for blocking and searching , the order of fire contact in the event of armed resistance by the fighters , the location of the command headquarters and control points ... The artillery targets were established in advance along the lines of the ORG possible escape routes from ORG and potential arrival of reinforcements , outside of the village . CARDINAL control points ( roadblocks ) were established at the CARDINAL ends of the village to ensure the exit of civilians \u2013 one towards ORG and the other towards ORG . The civilians left the village through the CARDINAL roadblocks , along \u2018 humanitarian corridors\u2019 .", "The head of ORG was informed of the decision to carry out a special operation . He requested postponement in order to ascertain the situation with his own resources and to drive the fighters out of the village . The special operation was postponed for DATE . However , the following morning the fighters attacked ORG [ special police forces ] based in ORG and attempted to break through the lines of the security forces . The security forces sustained casualties . As became apparent during the clashes , the fighters were armed not only with firearms , but also with grenades and fire - launchers , large calibre machine guns , mine - launchers and anti - tank rocket launchers . The fighters were well prepared and were able to use artificial and natural hiding places in order to deliver combat in a populated area . The number of fighters greatly exceeded the security forces ( by CARDINAL times ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision goes on to cite the report \u2019s conclusion that the use of fighter jets , artillery and mine - launchers upon fortified positions had been justified and that the refusal to employ them would have resulted in heavy losses among the security forces and failure to achieve the goals as set . Over a period of DATE most fighters present in the village were killed ( CARDINAL military unit had reported CARDINAL killed fighters ) .", "CARDINAL . The report cited military field manuals and concluded that the actions of the commanders had been in full compliance with those acts . The commanders had organised and planned the enforcement of the objectives set . The pin - point air strikes upon previously agreed targets , the direct strikes by artillery and anti - tank rocket launchers , and the tank and anti - tank guns had been directed by forward air controllers and artillery pointers upon clearly established and observed targets .", "CARDINAL . Page CARDINAL of the extract contains the following citation from the decision : \u201c the evidential material in the criminal investigation file ... shows that CARDINAL fighters who entered ORG were armed with automatic firearms , large - calibre machine - guns , grenade - launchers and armoured vehicles ; fortified firing points had been established in the captured houses . [ In such circumstances ] the use of artillery and airborne weapons DATE was justified ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As cited in the extract , the experts focused on the use of artillery and aircraft . From the operative military documents referring to the use of artillery it was impossible to discern where and when exactly , and at what targets the artillery had been employed , since all the documents reviewed by the experts were judged by them as either irrelevant to the operation in question or not containing any relevant information . As to the aircraft , they had used aviation bombs and unguided and guided missiles of undisclosed types . The number of aircraft involved and the number and timing of the mission sorties , as well as the number of missiles and bombs used , was not specified . As cited , the report established that during the mission sorties the pilots had received information from the forward controllers , because the missions were taking place in the vicinity of , or within , the populated area . The target selection was done using smoke pods or by reference to clearly identifiable topographical \u201c highpoints \u201d . There was no evidence of provocations by fighters or mistakes in selecting targets . The document went on to state that the identification of targets had occurred on the basis of information received prior to departure , from the forward air controllers during the flight , and from the observed activity . Since their use by illegal insurgents could not be verified , attacks on vehicles were ruled out unless very precise and distinguishable directions had been received from the ground . The aircraft attacked from a height of QUANTITY and from a distance of QUANTITY ; from that distance details such as clothing and the presence of firearms could not be distinguished . For that reason , contact with the air controllers was necessary before and after hitting the selected target .", "CARDINAL . In the cited extract , the experts concluded that \u201c such engagement of artillery and aviation munitions practically ruled out the likelihood of casualties to civilians , except those who were with the fighters in houses occupied by the latter \u201d .", "CARDINAL . They further concluded that the \u201c employment of a minimal amount of artillery , the choice of the most accurate target direction possible , and the use of the minimum amount of shells necessary ... guaranteed safety from injuries by splinters both for the civilians and security forces . ... Having examined the criminal investigation file , the experts concluded that the OC of the Western Zone Alignment and the head of the special operation in GPE - Yurt had taken all possible measures in order to prevent losses among civilians while planning and carrying out the operation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the situation of the civilians , the experts judged that they had been able to leave the village along \u201c humanitarian corridors \u201d through CARDINAL roadblocks . The information about the corridors had been communicated by means of a helicopter and an armoured personnel carrier ( ORG ) . The head of the administration had been properly informed of the beginning of the special operation and , at his request , its start had been postponed for DATE . The civilians had been informed of the need to evacuate and CARDINAL roadblocks had ensured safe and unhindered passage . The civilians had been accorded the time necessary for the evacuation and the transport carrying the civilians was able to travel back and forth through the roadblocks .", "CARDINAL . While the report , as cited in the extract , conceded that an unspecified number of civilians had been killed during the operation through the use of weapons under the control of the operation \u2019s commanders , such measures had been in compliance with the appropriate order of decision - taking in the choice of targets and means employed during the special operation .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of this report , the investigator concluded that the measures resulting in civilian casualties had been absolutely necessary within the meaning of Article CARDINAL , part CARDINAL of LAW ( as in the previous decisions of DATE and DATE see Abuyeva and Others , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The extract ended by listing the names of the CARDINAL individuals who had been killed , but Mr PERSON ( a son of the applicant in the GPE case , cited above ) was listed twice . It did not contain the names of the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL family members , nor of her cousin PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) . Nor did it contain the names of CARDINAL relatives of applicants CARDINAL and CARDINAL in the Abuyeva and Others case ( see Abuyeva and Others , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The non - exhaustive list of the wounded included the applicant ; however no separate list of victims has been drawn up ; nor does it appear that a copy of that decision was sent to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a lawyer representing PERSON , another victim in criminal investigation no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL , appealed to ORG against the decision of CARDINAL DATE to close the criminal investigation and to terminate PERSON victim status in the proceedings . The statement of appeal was based on the following grounds : the decision had not been based on the established facts , no proper collection and examination of evidence had taken place and legal classification of the events had been incorrect .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , it was argued that the investigation had failed to establish the following pertinent facts : the number of illegal fighters in ORG ; the timing and conditions of the transmission of information about the operation and evacuation of civilians ; the purpose of the roadblocks at the CARDINAL extremities of the village ; and the details of the aircraft bombings . As to the number of fighters , the statement of appeal referred to various figures cited in the extract and emphasised the fact that the source of this information had not been identified . Likewise , there was a lack of clarity as to the number of fighters killed , nor were there any indications as to any names , identification procedures etc . The appeal statement also pointed out that the number of the security force personnel involved had not been given ; it was therefore difficult to evaluate the numerical superiority of the fighters and the need to employ massive weapons . Furthermore , the victim challenged the statement that the administration and population of ORG had been informed about the operation in advance , pointing to the absence of any clear evidence in the case - file to that effect . Turning to the roadblocks set up by the security forces , the appeal statement pointed out that there were no grounds for concluding that this measure had facilitated the exit of civilians from ORG and reiterated the findings made in this respect by the ORG in the judgments in the ORG and GPE and Others cases ( both cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL , accordingly ) . As to the details of aircraft bombing , it was argued that the investigators had accepted CARDINAL mutually incompatible versions and no steps had been taken in order to clarify whether the pilots , or the aviation controllers who had coordinated the fire , had been able to observe and distinguish legitimate targets ( members of illegal armed groups ) from civilians . It was also pointed out that the employment of unguided missiles and free - falling general purpose bombs in any event ruled out the possibility of limiting the impact to the selected targets .", "CARDINAL . As regards the incompleteness of the investigation , it was stressed that the investigators had failed to collect the information necessary to evaluate the threat to the civilian population and the appropriateness of the use of selected weapons and ammunition , and to compile an exhaustive list of victims and damage caused . On the last point , it was emphasised that no list of those who had been killed , both civilians and fighters , had ever been compiled and that the information in this regard remained incomplete .", "CARDINAL . Finally , it was argued that the legal classification of the ORG actions had been incorrect and that the application of Article CARDINAL part CARDINAL of LAW had been unjustified without the prior", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG examined and dismissed the appeal . The court referred to the conclusions of the expert report of DATE , according to which the actions of the operational commanders had been in accordance with the relevant field manuals and other instructions and were justified in view of the numerical superiority of the fighters . The court also found that the evidence collected by the investigation justified the conclusions reached as regards each of the points raised by the appeal . As to execution of the GPE and GPE and Others judgments , the court stressed that in accordance with LAW , and in line with ORG DATE , the investigation had been reopened in DATE and a number of relevant steps had been taken . In particular , a new expert report had been commissioned and carried out . The ORG \u2019s position on the ineffectiveness of the previous investigation had therefore been taken into account and the failings had been rectified .", "CARDINAL . The victim appealed . In her appeal of DATE it was stressed that the breach of procedural obligations under LAW in this case had taken on a lasting character . Pointing to the relevant passages in the ORG and GPE and Others judgments , both cited above , the appeal argued that the following fundamental defects of the investigation , as identified by ORG , had not been corrected in the new round of proceedings : there had been no independent evaluation of the proportionality and necessity of the lethal force used ; no individual liability had been established for the aspects of the operation which had led to civilian losses , and these aspects had not been studied and evaluated by an independent body , preferably a judicial one . It was reiterated that the expert report of DATE , as cited in the decision of DATE , had simply repeated the findings of CARDINAL previous expert reports which had already been examined by the ORG . Like DATE , it had not been based on the pertinent facts of the case . Finally , the important question of the total number of victims had still not been resolved , as demonstrated by the failure to include some of the GPE deceased relatives in the total .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the appeal . During the hearing , the victim \u2019s representative submitted a number of additional points . He concentrated on the relevant precepts of international humanitarian law and the practice of international criminal tribunals which , he argued , should have guided the investigator in his examination of the case . In his view , the decision of DATE had failed to take into account the relevant interpretation of these provisions in so far as it concerned the definition of victims as civilians , and the widespread , systematic , indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on them .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeals . It found that ORG had examined all the relevant evidence and had applied a comprehensive and consistent interpretation thereto . At this stage , the judge was unable to analyse the substance of the question of guilt or innocence , or to evaluate the correctness or sufficiency of the evidence collected . ORG stressed that the victim \u2019s arguments regarding both the incompleteness of the investigation and the failure to take into account ORG binding judgments had been thoroughly examined and dismissed .", "CARDINAL . As is apparent from subsequent documents , the victim \u2019s ORG cassation appeal was unsuccessful . On DATE a judge of ORG refused to accept the request for review , in view of the detailed and well - reasoned decisions of the military courts . The victim \u2019s argument that the legal position of ORG in the new round of proceedings had not been taken into account was judged to be unfounded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
