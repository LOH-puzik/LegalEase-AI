On DATE the applicant and CARDINAL others were charged with extorting money from PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( okresn\u00fd s\u00fad ) remanded the applicant and CARDINAL of his alleged accomplices in custody from DATE . The court held that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he was charged , that the offence had been committed in an organised way , and that therefore there was a risk that he could put pressure on witnesses , contact other perpetrators and tamper with evidence . The court relied on the testimony of ORG , who allegedly had been warned by one of the applicant \u2019s accomplices about instructions from the applicant not to cooperate with the police . On DATE ORG ( krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad ) dismissed an interlocutory appeal ( s\u0165a\u017enos\u0165 ) by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a police investigator charged the applicant and CARDINAL other people with establishing , masterminding and supporting a criminal group . The applicant was also charged with aggravated coercion , extortion , and causing bodily harm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u0161peci\u00e1lny s\u00fad , hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , where the case had been transferred in the meantime owing to the organised nature of the crimes , dismissed an application by the applicant for release . It relied on the particularly serious and organised nature of the offences he was charged with , and held that there was a real danger that he might influence witnesses and contact other perpetrators in order to tamper with evidence . On DATE ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . In addition to the reasons mentioned above , it relied on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant was the leader of a criminal group which had been operating for DATE , and that not all of the members of that criminal group had been identified . The court pointed out that the criminal investigation was particularly complex . On DATE ORG dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police investigator charged the applicant with another count of extortion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed another application by the applicant for release . It relied on the testimony of several witnesses who were afraid to testify against him . The court took into account the complexity of the criminal investigation , finding that there had been no undue delays . On DATE ORG dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with CARDINAL other counts of extortion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , and extended the grounds for his detention by including the risk of his reoffending . It held that it was reasonable to suspect that , if released , the applicant would continue his criminal activities , taking into account : the motives for such activities and their duration and extent ; the methods of intimidation and violence used by the criminal group ; the hierarchical and organised nature of the group ; and the fact that not all of the members of the group had been identified . On DATE ORG dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was extended until DATE . ORG added that his detention assisted the investigation , since the victims were willing to testify , but still not all of the members of the criminal group had been identified . On DATE ORG dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was indicted before ORG on DATE . The bill of indictment concerned QUANTITY criminal acts , CARDINAL defendants and CARDINAL victims . The applicant was charged with establishing , masterminding and supporting a criminal group , aggravated coercion , causing bodily harm , and QUANTITY acts of extortion . All the crimes were qualified as particularly serious crimes . The sums extorted ranged from QUANTITY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the grounds for the applicant \u2019s detention and ruled that he should remain in detention . It pointed out that , according to the indictment , he was allegedly the leader of a criminal group , a group which had been conducting criminal activities for DATE against people who were victims and witnesses in the trial , by means of threats and the use of physical and psychological violence . On DATE ORG dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when conducting a preliminary examination of the bill of indictment , ORG again reviewed the grounds for the applicant \u2019s detention and ruled that he should remain in detention . On DATE ORG dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed another application by the applicant for release . It held that several witnesses were afraid to testify against him in his presence and had thus been heard in his absence . In particular , CARDINAL witness had been contacted and threatened by unknown persons in an attempt to get him to change his testimony . The court also took into account that not all the witnesses had been heard by the trial court . On DATE ORG dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court limited the grounds for his detention to the risk of his reoffending , because the trial court had already heard all witnesses . It stated that there was substantial evidence suggesting that the applicant was the leader of a criminal group which had operated systematically for DATE , and therefore it was reasonable to assume that , if at liberty , he might continue with the criminal activities . The court further held that it was essential to protect victims and witnesses who had expressed a fear of the applicant when testifying at the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted by ORG of establishing , masterminding and supporting a criminal group , CARDINAL acts of extortion , CARDINAL acts of aggravated coercion and fraud and was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . He remained in detention pending the outcome of an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a request for release lodged by the applicant was dismissed by ORG . ORG dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against his conviction , which thereby became final . The applicant started to serve a prison sentence , and the time spent in detention was taken into account when calculating his prison term .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional complaint ( \u00fastavn\u00e1 s\u0165a\u017enos\u0165 ) against ORG decision of DATE to dismiss his interlocutory appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Among other things , he complained that his detention was no longer justified , that it had lasted an excessively long time , and that ORG had not answered all the arguments raised in his interlocutory appeal ( \u201c the first constitutional complaint \u201d ) . He complained under LAW DATE and LAW , and under their constitutional equivalents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he filed another constitutional complaint , alleging a lack of speediness in relation to the judicial review of his detention by the decisions of ORG of DATE and ORG of DATE ( \u201c the second constitutional complaint \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) accepted a part of the applicant \u2019s first constitutional complaint for further examination , including the complaint regarding the length of his detention . It held that the formal requirements under sections CARDINAL of LAW had been satisfied . At the same time , it dismissed the rest of the complaint as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the second constitutional complaint for further examination , and joined the proceedings relating to the first and the second constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . It held that ORG , in its decision of DATE , had failed to respond to all of the applicant \u2019s arguments . Although ORG had examined in detail the applicant \u2019s arguments regarding the grounds for his detention , it had failed to respond to his other arguments , such as one about the impartiality and independence of the tribunal reviewing his detention , and another about alleged shortcomings in his representation during the judicial review , and thus the court had breached LAW .", "ORG further held that the judicial review of the applicant \u2019s detention DATE and DATE had not been sufficiently speedy , and found another violation of LAW on this account .", "It quashed ORG decision of DATE and awarded the applicant ORG CARDINAL as just satisfaction . It did not order his release , since the applicant had been convicted in the meantime and had started to serve a prison term .", "ORG considered it unnecessary to examine the rest of the applicant \u2019s complaints , including the CARDINAL under LAW of the LAW regarding the length of his detention .", "CARDINAL . Between the applicant \u2019s arrest and the completion of the pre - trial investigation , the authorities conducted interviews with CARDINAL defendants , interviewed CARDINAL victims and twentythree witnesses , commissioned CARDINAL expert opinions , analysed telecommunication recordings , conducted home searches and identity parades , and gathered a large amount of documentary evidence .", "CARDINAL . Between the lodging of the indictment with the trial court and the applicant \u2019s conviction by the court of first instance , the trial court held hearings over the course of DATE . The hearings were scheduled on a DATE or near DATE basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the presiding judge of ORG appointed a substitute defence lawyer for the applicant to prevent the obstruction of court hearings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the presiding judge of ORG fined CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s defence lawyers : CARDINAL for failing to appear at CARDINAL court hearings , and the other for obstructing justice ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
