THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in PERSON . He is represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is director and sole shareholder of the company with limited liability \u201c J.F.A.M. ORG \u201d , which in turn is the sole shareholder of CARDINAL other companies ; \u201c ORG \u201d and \u201c ORG \u201d . These CARDINAL companies form CARDINAL unit for the purposes of the determination of turnover tax ( omzetbelasting ) and corporation tax ( vennootschapsbelasting ) .", "In DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) carried out an inspection of the business administration of the above CARDINAL companies . This inspection was closed after possible fiscal offences had been found . ORG ( LOC Inlichtingen- en ORG ; \u201c FIOD \u201d ) then started a fiscal criminal investigation . At some unspecified point in time , a declaration of discontinuance of criminal proceedings within the meaning of LAW ) was issued , i.e. a statement to the effect that the case had ended without the institution of any further criminal proceedings .", "In DATE , the fiscal authorities - apparently on the basis of information received that ORG would pay out overtime in the form of travel allowances - announced a fiscal inspection of the business administration of this and the affiliated companies . PERSON , an official of the fiscal authorities , inspected these administrations at the premises of the ORG accountancy firm . This inspection took place during DATE in DATE and DATE as well as on DATE and DATE . During the inspection of the administration , PERSON of the companies accountancy firm asked PERSON on several occasions whether he had found any particularities , which PERSON denied .", "On DATE , the ORG entered the premises of ORG and the CARDINAL ORG accountancy firm , where they searched for and seized the business administration of ORG", "At some unspecified point in time , the applicant was summoned to appear on DATE before ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) on charges of , inter alia , tax evasion and forgery .", "In its judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings , ORG convicted the applicant of tax evasion and forgery and sentenced him to TIME of community service . It further imposed a CARDINAL months\u2019 prison sentence , suspended pending a probation period of DATE and payment of a fine in the amount of MONEY ( NLG ) . Both the applicant and the prosecution filed an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) .", "On DATE , in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer , a hearing was held before ORG in the course of which ORG heard the applicant and , at the request of the defence , CARDINAL experts . At having heard the parties\u2019 final pleas , ORG closed the trial proceedings and informed the parties that it would pronounce its judgment on DATE at TIME .", "On DATE , ORG gave judgment in public . The applicant himself was not present at the reading out of ORG judgment in abridged form , i.e. not containing a statement of the contents of the means of evidence on which it had based the applicant \u2019s conviction .", "In its judgment , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant of tax evasion and forgery and sentenced him to TIME of community service . ORG further imposed a CARDINAL months\u2019 prison sentence , suspended pending a probation period of DATE and payment of a fine of NLG CARDINAL .", "ORG rejected the argument raised by the defence that the prosecution should be declared inadmissible on the ground that the fiscal authorities had abused their authority ( \u201c d\u00e9tournement de pouvoir \u201d ) in that the fiscal authorities\u2019 powers of inspection had been exercised for obtaining evidence for use in criminal proceedings thus denying the applicant guarantees under criminal law . According to the text of the abridged judgment , it held on this point :", "\u201c It has been argued by the defence that the information obtained from Mr PERSON and others was not preceded by a cautioning < i.e. a warning that such information could be used in criminal proceedings>. However , it has not been established during the trial proceedings that , in the context of the inspection < of the business administration > , either a < cautioning > declaration within the meaning of LAW has been made or that Mr PERSON and others were summoned to provide information in writing . Therefore it can not be said that the accused has been denied any guarantees ( under criminal law ) . The short delay , as pointed out by the defence , between the closure of the inspection of the administration and the searches do not lead to another conclusion . With this , and unlike the situation in other cases where DATE fiscal > inspection runs simultaneously with a criminal investigation , a clear distinction has been made for the accused of < fiscal > inspection activities and criminal investigation activities entailing the application of coercive measures . \u201d", "On DATE , the prosecution filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE , the applicant addressed a letter to ORG , which reads :", "\u201c On DATE , your ORG has pronounced judgment in my case . My lawyer has requested you on DATE to send him a complete version of the judgment ( het uitgewerkte arrest ) , because I consider filing an appeal in cassation against the judgment , but this is dependent on the reasons and contents of the judgment .", "To date I have not received the complete version of the judgment .", "I had wanted to contact my lawyer about this , but he can not be reached as he is staying abroad and will only be back in his office on DATE . As from DATE I myself will be gone for DATE to LOC .", "As the complete version of the judgment is still not available , I wish to inform you that I am filing an appeal in cassation against the judgment < of the ORG of Appeal>. I herewith refer to the contents of my lawyer \u2019s letter of DATE in which he already informed you of my intention to file an appeal in cassation although making this dependent on the reasons and contents .", "I reserve myself the right , when I have taken notice of the reasons , to withdraw this appeal in cassation after I have been able to confer further about this with my lawyer upon my return .", "DATE I request you to take good notice of my request and to confirm me at the address given below the institution from my side of an appeal in cassation ? \u201d", "On DATE , the applicant was provided with the complete version of the judgment of DATE . His attention was drawn to the fact that the time - limit for filing an appeal in cassation had expired on DATE .", "The elements that had been added to the abridged version of the judgment of DATE were the means of evidence on which the applicant \u2019s conviction was based , i.e. fiscal declarations made by or on behalf of the companies concerned , and statements taken from the applicant , CARDINAL employees of ORG , a fiscal investigation officer involved in the investigation at issue , and fiscal officials having processed DATE declarations made by or on behalf of the companies concerned .", "On DATE , the applicant was notified of the fact that on DATE the prosecution had filed an appeal in cassation against ORG judgment of DATE", "On DATE , the prosecution withdrew its appeal in cassation .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s appeal in cassation had been filed on DATE and held that , since the applicant had attended the trial proceedings before ORG in person , his appeal in cassation was therefore inadmissible .", "Pursuant to LAW , hereinafter referred to as \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a judgment must contain the means of evidence as well as the pertinent facts and circumstances on which a conviction is based .", "According to LAW ORG , the court must deliver the judgment within DATE following the closure of the trial proceedings , but it may confine itself to pronouncing judgment in abridged form , i.e. not containing the means of evidence and the pertinent facts and circumstances on which a conviction is based .", "According to LAW , a complete version of the judgment has to be prepared where the convicted person or the public prosecutor lodges an appeal against the judgment . In that case the text of the means of evidence and the pertinent facts and circumstances must be included in the judgment within DATE when the person concerned is detained in connection with the facts in issue or , if that is not the case , within DATE . The case - file , including the complete judgment , must subsequently be transmitted to the appeal court .", "According to LAW , a judgment must be signed within TIME after its delivery by the judges who have examined the case . A judgment in abridged form is signed in that form and , as soon as this has happened , the accused or his counsel are able , according to LAW , to inspect it as well as the official records of the trial hearings .", "A complete version of the judgment may also be made available upon request of the accused or his lawyer within DATE after delivery of the judgment , unless this request is devoid of reasonable interest ( Article CARDINALc \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ORG ) .", "Under LAW ORG , both an accused and the prosecution may file an appeal in cassation against a judgment of a ORG . Such an appeal is limited to procedural conformity and points of law .", "Pursuant to LAW ORG , an appeal in cassation must be filed within DATE after the delivery of the final decision by a trial court where the trial proceedings have been conducted in the presence of the accused .", "If only the prosecution has filed an appeal in cassation , the accused must be notified of this fact ( LAW ORG ) . An accused may file a subsidiary appeal in cassation ( incidenteel beroep in cassatie ) within DATE after receipt of this notification ( LAW ORG ) . Such a subsidiary appeal is limited to the scope of the principal appeal , i.e. the appeal lodged by the prosecution . In case the principal appeal is declared inadmissible or when it is withdrawn , the subsidiary appeal will not be examined .", "Upon receipt of the case - file at ORG , the Registrar of the ORG shall notify the appellant in cassation and the adversary party accordingly ( LAW ) . According to LAW ORG , an accused who has filed an appeal in cassation must submit his complaints in cassation ( cassatiemiddelen ) within a delay of DATE after the serving of the notification referred to in LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
