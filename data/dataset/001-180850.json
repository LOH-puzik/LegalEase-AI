The applicant refused to provide comments on the recordings and stated that his conversations with ORG were irrelevant because he had only wanted to show that he was working on his case . Those conversations had not been of any consequence as he had not been able to influence FAC or the judges at ORG and ORG ( GPE telefonu ir \u012fra\u0161u su V.[\u0160. ] nekomentuoja , paai\u0161kindamas , kad visi jo pokalbiai su V.[\u0160. ] buvo d\u0117l aki\u0173 , kadangi ka\u017ek\u0105 kalb\u0117ti su V.[\u0160. ] reik\u0117jo , tad nieko nerei\u0161kian\u010diais pokalbiais jis tik siek\u0117 parodyti , kad dirba , ta\u010diau tuo jis nesiek\u0117 sukelti joki\u0173 pasekmi\u0173 , kadangi negal\u0117jo paveikti nei L.[D. ] , nei Kai\u0161iadori\u0173 apylink\u0117s ar ORG apygardos teismo teis\u0117j\u0173 ) . ORG stated that he had known ORG since DATE and that ORG had called him and asked for help . When ORG had gone to ORG , ORG had told him that the applicant required money and that ORG doubted that the money would be used in the proper way .", "The court \u2019s conclusions were based on the evidence given by ORG , ORG , FAC and other employees of ORG . It also addressed the secret recordings of the applicant \u2019s conversations , including those recorded prior to the authorisation for actions imitating criminal conduct . The court held that the transcripts of the conversations between the applicant and ORG showed that the applicant had been the first to indicate the amounts of money to be paid . The applicant \u2019s statement that he had been going to conclude an agreement on legal services after he had taken LTL CARDINAL were refuted by his conversation with ORG , where the applicant had stated that in case of failure he would keep PERCENT of the money and return the rest . The video - recordings showed that the applicant had not counted the money and that he had indicated to ORG to put it in the side pocket of the car door . That allowed the court to draw the conclusion that the applicant realised that the money was remuneration for his criminal activity . The court further held that ORG \u2019s testimony , voice and videorecordings showed that the applicant had not been incited to take a bribe and that the criminal conduct simulation model had been applied within the limits prescribed by the court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . By the same judgment the K\u0117dainiai District Court found PERSON guilty of abuse of office and forgery , which had allowed ORG to be transferred to a unit with lighter security ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

PERSON pleaded guilty , but stated that ORG had named the applicant as a lawyer that could help him obtain release on probation . The court decided to return the recorder watch to ORG", "CARDINAL . The applicant and PERSON lodged an appeal . The applicant argued that the provisions of domestic law had been applied incorrectly , that FAC and ORG used undue pressure , and that ORG had used unauthorised equipment , the recorder watch , which he had not been allowed to have in prison . The applicant asked the appellate court to question ORG and ask him how he had acquired such a watch in a correctional facility . The applicant also stated that PERSON had overseen matters relating to ORG \u2019s transfer to a unit with lighter security and that there was no evidence that he had tried to bribe PERSON The applicant also stated that he had never named any specific person in the courts whom he would have bribed because he had not intended to perform such an act . He had only talked to GPE about the outcome of the proceedings for release on probation because ORG had called him constantly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG approved an application by the prosecutor to transfer the case to ORG from ORG for examination on appeal in order to have a fair trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG held an oral hearing where several witnesses , including ORG , had been questioned . On DATE ORG held that ORG had purchased the watch for his personal use and that the provisions of domestic law did not directly prohibit the use of such equipment in prison . The court also held that the initial contact between ORG and the applicant had been arranged by PERSON , that FAC had not known the applicant beforehand and had not had any motive to incite him to commit a crime . The court also found that no agreement on the provision of legal services had been concluded between the applicant and ORG and that the applicant \u2019s argument that he had intended to conclude one later had been dismissed as an attempt to improve his situation . On the basis of the audio - recordings , the court also observed that the applicant had been the first to say that he could settle the matter for money . The court also found that there had been no incitement and that the authorities had not put any active pressure on the applicant to commit an offence . On the contrary , the applicant had incited GPE to give him an amount that would be sufficient for himself , an intermediary and CARDINAL court judges . The court also held that at the time the offence had been committed , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provided for CARDINAL alternative sentences for bribery of an intermediary : arrest or imprisonment for DATE . On DATE LAW had been amended and the applicant \u2019s offence had then satisfied the requirements of LAW , which provided for various sentences : a fine , arrest or imprisonment for DATE . As the provision in force provided for a more lenient sentence , the court decided to impose a fine of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The court dismissed PERSON \u2019s appeal by the same judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . He again argued that he had been incited to commit an offence , that ORG , as a convicted prisoner , was not allowed to have recording equipment , that he had been provided with that equipment by the ORG , and that the transcripts of the recordings should not have been used as evidence against him in the case . The applicant also alleged that the LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL had been remuneration for his legal services and that he had not actually taken the LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL from ORG , who had simply left the money in his car . The applicant further complained that the court of first instance had not even assessed whether the evidence had been lawfully collected . The appellate court , in turn , had approved evidence that had been gathered unlawfully and had misinterpreted domestic law . The applicant also argued that ORG \u2019s testimony had contradicted itself : it was not clear who had informed the ORG about the alleged crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . The court held that the pre - trial investigation had been opened on DATE upon the request of ORG with his testimony , PERSON had given the authorities his voice - recording watch , where he had recorded his conversations with PERSON and the applicant . The court held that convicted prisoners who used voice recorders breached internal prison regulations , but that did not mean that officers who carried out a pretrial investigation and obtained information from such a voice recorder acted unlawfully . The court also held that the finding of the applicant \u2019s guilt had not been based solely on the evidence obtained from ORG \u2019s watch . The court observed that PERSON had suggested the applicant as a lawyer because he knew the prosecutors and judges dealing with ORG \u2019s case , while PERSON had not incited the applicant to take bribes . By the same judgment ORG left an appeal on points of law by PERSON unexamined because therein he had raised arguments that had not been raised before the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined an application by the applicant to reopen the proceedings . It decided not to do so , but reduced the fine to LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
