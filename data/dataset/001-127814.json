However , as soon as CARDINAL partner reached DATE , such acts constituted an offence under LAW . They became legal again when the younger partner reached the age of DATE . Given that Article CARDINAL applied not only to occasional relations but also to ongoing relationships , it led to rather absurd results DATE namely , a change of periods during which the homosexual relationship of CARDINAL partners was first legal , then punishable and then legal again \u2013 and could therefore not be considered to be objectively justified .", "CARDINAL .
