THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "On DATE , the applicant applied for asylum in the GPE under a false identity . This asylum request was rejected by decision of DATE . The applicant 's subsequent appeal was dismissed on DATE by ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a second request for asylum in the GPE , this time under this true identity . He stated that he was single , that he had no relatives living in the GPE and that his father had died . His family in GPE consisted of his maternal grandfather , his mother and CARDINAL brother who was born in DATE . He had no other relatives . He claimed that he had been arrested in GPE on DATE after a passenger in his taxi had been found to carry weapon parts , that he had been taken into detention , had been ill - treated during his detention and had managed to escape with the aid of a guard . He further claimed that had left GPE by boat on DATE and that he had arrived in the GPE on DATE .", "On an unspecified date , a medical examination of the applicant disclosed that he might be infected with HIV and he was referred to ORG in DATE for further medical examinations . In a letter of DATE , a specialist in internal diseases of this hospital confirmed this diagnosis and stated that the applicant found himself in the CARDINAL clinical category of the disease , i.e. the asymptomatic stage of the disease with a CDCARDINAL + count of MONEY The specialist concluded that , given the low CDCARDINAL + count , antiretroviral treatment was indicated . The applicant was in fact provided with such treatment .", "On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatsecretairs van Justitie ) rejected the applicant 's asylum request , finding that the applicant 's asylum account lacked credibility . In so far as the applicant relied on his health problems , the Deputy Minister considered that the applicant could apply for a residence permit on medical grounds . On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG of The Hague .", "In a letter of DATE , a specialist in internal diseases of ORG informed the applicant 's lawyer that , if the applicant were to cease taking anti - HIV medication , his prospects would become very unfavourable within a short delay . The specialist further wrote that it was not to be expected that , in GPE , medication was obtainable that the applicant needed to suppress the HIV - infection and to improve his immune system .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG of The Hague rejected the applicant 's appeal of DATE . It accepted the finding of the Deputy Minister that no credence could be attached to the applicant 's asylum account . In so far as the applicant relied on his health problems , ORG decided not to take into account the information set out in the letter of DATE as this information had only been submitted DATE before the hearing held on DATE . It found that taking this information into consideration would be contrary to the principles of due process . It further held that it had not been established that there was a causal link between the applicant 's illness and his departure from GPE and that it had not appeared that there were such compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature being connected to the applicant 's reasons for leaving GPE that it should be held that , in all reasonability , it could not be expected from the applicant to return to his country of origin . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a third request for asylum on the basis of newly emerged facts or altered circumstances ( nieuw gebleken feiten of veranderde omstandigheden ) . When , on DATE , he was interviewed by the immigration authorities on this request , the applicant stated inter alia that he was cohabiting with another asylum seeker from GPE since DATE and that CARDINAL children had been born out of this relationship in DATE and DATE , respectively . He further stated that his family in GPE consisted of his mother and a younger brother .", "This third request was rejected on DATE by the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) , who had succeeded the Deputy Minister of ORG under LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) which , on DATE , had replaced LAW DATE . As to the applicant 's argument that , given his ORG , his expulsion to GPE would be in violation of his rights under LAW ; the Minister recalled that , according to the constant case - law , such a situation would only arise if the alien concerned found himself in an advanced and directly life - threatening stage of an incurable disease . The Minister found that there were insufficient indications in the applicant 's submissions for holding that there was such a situation in his case and , on this basis , concluded that \u2013 irrespective of the possibilities of treatment in GPE and the presence a social support network there DATE the applicant 's case did not raise an issue under LAW . Moreover , as already indicated in the decision of DATE , the applicant could apply for a temporary residence permit on medical grounds . The Minister further found no indication in the applicant 's case for concluding that , owing to traumatic experiences linked to the reasons for leaving the country of origin , it could not in all reasonability be expected from the applicant to return to GPE thus rendering him eligible for a residence permit on grounds of compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature . On this point , the Minister considered that the health problems relied on by the applicant were not linked to his reasons for leaving GPE . The applicant was ordered to leave the GPE within TIME .", "On DATE , the Minister informed ORG for ORG opvang ORG ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) , since the applicant 's asylum request had been rejected on DATE , the applicant 's entitlement to ORG - sponsored reception and care facilities for asylum seekers ( \u201c opvang \u201d ) had ceased . However , the Minister was of the opinion that the applicant 's expulsion should be stayed under LAW as , according to medical advice obtained , the applicant was unfit to travel . The Minister therefore advised the ORG to prolong the provision of reception and care facilities to the applicant until DATE . On DATE , the Minister informed the applicant that the ORG had been advised to prolong until DATE the provision of facilities . The Minister further indicated that an advice of ORG Medische Advisering ) would be sought on a possible prolongation of this period .", "On DATE , the applicant 's treating specialist doctor of ORG informed the applicant 's lawyer that , DATE after having started treatment in DATE , the applicant 's condition was stable but that his immune system had apparently been so weakened when he had started treatment that it had still not been properly restored . The doctor further stated that by the suppression of the AIDS virus there was no direct danger , but that as soon as the anti - HIV therapy would be stopped , the applicant would fall back to the advanced stage of the disease which , given its incurable nature , would entail a direct threat for life .", "The applicant 's appeal against this Minister 's decision of DATE was dismissed by ORG of GPE on DATE .", "By letter of DATE , the Minister for ORG informed the applicant 's lawyer that , before a decision could be taken on the question whether the applicant 's expulsion should be stayed further on medical grounds , it was necessary to obtain medical information from the doctors treating the applicant for which the latter 's written consent was required . The applicant 's lawyer was requested to return the appended consent form within DATE .", "On DATE , the Minister informed the applicant that , pending the issuance of an advisory opinion of ORG about his situation and on the basis of LAW , his expulsion would be stayed until DATE .", "The applicant 's appeal to ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG against the ruling given on DATE by ORG of The Hague was rejected on DATE . Although ORG accepted that the letter of DATE of ORG constituted a relevant new fact , it found that this could not lead to quashing the impugned decision taken by the Minister on DATE . It considered that it could not be concluded from the contents of this letter that the applicant 's illness had attained such an advanced and direct lifethreatening stage that it should be held that the expulsion of the applicant to GPE or any other country would be in violation of LAW . It further took into consideration that \u2013 according to an additional medical statement of CARDINAL DATE that had been submitted to ORG \u2013 the HIV - virus would be suppressed as long the applicant would continue taking medication , so that there was no direct threat for life . It therefore accepted that there were no grounds on the basis of which the Minister should reconsider the decision of DATE .", "Under LAW of LAW DATE ( PERSON , hereinafter \u201c the Act \u201d ) , which was in force until DATE , aliens coming from a country where they have a well - founded reason to fear persecution on account of their religious or political convictions , or of belonging to a particular race or a particular social group , could be admitted as refugees . The expression \u201c refugee \u201d in this provision was construed to have the same meaning as in LAW ( decision of ORG ( Afdeling Rechtspraak ) of ORG of DATE , PERSON [ ORG ] DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE , LAW entered into force . On the basis of LAW , an alien may be eligible for a residence permit for the purposes of asylum if , inter alia ,", "\u2013 he or she is a refugee within the meaning of LAW , or", "\u2013 he or she has established well - founded reasons to assume that he / she will run a real risk of being subjected to torture or other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment if expelled to the country of origin .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) provides that an applicant must adduce newly emerged facts or altered circumstances ( nieuw gebleken feiten of veranderde omstandigheden ) if a new request is filed following a decision in which the original request is , either totally or partially , rejected . When no such facts or altered circumstances have been adduced , the administrative authority may reject the new request with reference to the decision on the original request . Article CARDINAL thus embodies the res iudicata principle for the administrative law . Nevertheless , an exception has been made in this particular area of the law , in that an alien may adduce exceptional facts and circumstances relating to him or her personally , on the basis of which the new request may be assessed outside the framework of Article CARDINAL . In the case of a repeat asylum application which also invokes the risk of treatment contrary to LAW , an assessment by the court outside the framework of Article CARDINAL is therefore possible .", "ORG has on CARDINAL occasion quashed the dismissal of a repeat application for a residence permit for the purposes of asylum despite the absence of new facts or altered circumstances ( judgment of DATE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON Asiel- en ORG [ Newsletter on ORG and Refugeelaw ] CARDINAL ) . It did so on the basis of the exceptional circumstance that there was no dispute between the parties , that on his return to his country of origin , the alien would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment or punishment proscribed by LAW .", "During the initial asylum procedure , an alien is in principle entitled to reception and other facilities including health care , provided by the ORG . Pursuant to LAW , an alien whose stay in the GPE is not lawful is not entitled to such facilities . This provision applies to asylum seekers whose applications have been unsuccessful . Also , a second or further application for asylum does not confer a new entitlement to facilities . An exception to that basic principle can nevertheless be made if , inter alia , the asylum seeker finds him or herself in extremely compelling humanitarian circumstances ( FAC schrijnende humanitaire omstandigheden , LAW of FAC ) .", "The ORG decides whether or not facilities will be provided . Appeal lies against a decision to refuse facilities , but also against a failure to decide ( or to decide within a reasonable time ) on a request for facilities . The lodging of an appeal does not suspend the denial of facilities , but a provisional measure may be requested to the effect that such facilities are made available pending the appeal proceedings .", "According to LAW , the Minister can order the expulsion of an alien illegally staying in the GPE and who has not voluntarily left the GPE within the time - limit fixed for this purpose . However , pursuant to LAW , no expulsion will take place when , in view of the health condition of the alien , travelling is contra - indicated .", "In a report dated DATE of ORG f\u00fcr die ORG ) on HIV and AIDS in GPE , it is stated that DATE according to information set out in the UNAIDS / WHO Epidemiological Fact Sheet DATE on GPE \u2013 it was assumed that PERCENT of the adult population in GPE was HIV - positive whereas PERCENT of the total population in GPE is insured against sickness .

It further states that , PERCENT of the total population in GPE has a health insurance , the costs of treatment are generally borne privately and that , as the average DATE income in GPE lies CARDINAL , a person infected with HIV or suffering from AIDS who does not have health insurance will hardly be able to afford treatment if relatives are unable to provide financial support , despite the fact that negotiations between the NORP authorities and the pharmaceutical industry have resulted in a considerable reduction of the prices of certain medications for the treatment of HIV / AIDS ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
