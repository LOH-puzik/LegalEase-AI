CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended - \u201c the Decree \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In her official capacity , the applicant acted on behalf of the municipal District of Bratislava \u2013 Star\u00e9 mesto ( \u201c the claimant \u201d ) in seeking the enforcement of an amount of money payable to the claimant by CARDINAL individuals ( \u201c the defendants \u201d ) under a judgment of the Bratislava II ORG ( Okresn\u00fd s\u00fad ) of CARDINAL DATE . The sum payable arose in consideration for the sale of non - residential LOC by the claimant to the defendants .", "CARDINAL . Under the Decree , as it then stood , the basis for calculating the applicant \u2019s remuneration was the amount of the claim that was being enforced ( vym\u00e1han\u00e9 ) . After the events complained of had taken place , this provision was changed in that the basis for the calculation of a ORG \u2019s remuneration was to be the amount of the claim that had actually been enforced ( vymo\u017een\u00e9 ) . Should the entire claim be enforced , the remuneration would be PERCENT of that base figure ( see paragraphs CARDINAL in the \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d section below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the claimant requested that the applicant enforce the judgment and late - payment penalties against the defendants . The accumulated claim amounted in total to the equivalent of CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a single judge of ORG authorised the applicant to carry out the enforcement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant issued a notice of enforcement ( upovedomenie o za\u010dat\u00ed exek\u00facie ) by which she notified the defendants that the enforcement proceedings had commenced and that , unless they settled their debt within DATE , the applicant intended to enforce the judgment and costs of the enforcement by establishing a mortgage over real property belonging to the defendants and by seeking a forced sale of that property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant issued an order for enforcement ( exeku\u010dn\u00fd pr\u00edkaz ) of the judgment . By this order she directed the defendants\u2019 bank to deduct the judgment debt and costs of the enforcement from the defendants\u2019 account . By these means , amounts equivalent to some ORG CARDINAL and EUR CARDINAL were recovered , respectively , for the benefit of the claimant and the applicant by way of her remuneration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the claimant and the defendants reached a settlement , in which :", "( i ) the defendants acknowledged their debt ( equivalent to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , consisting of the principal amount ( ORG CARDINAL ) and legal fees payable by them ( EUR CARDINAL ) ;", "( ii ) the claimant waived CARDINAL of the debt on the condition that the defendants paid the remainder according to a payment schedule agreed upon , less the ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL that they had already paid ; and", "( iii ) the claimant undertook to withdraw its enforcement petition on the condition that the defendants \u201c settle all provable expenses of [ the applicant ] that [ had been ] incurred in connection with the enforcement of the clam [ referred to above ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

In a letter dated DATE the claimant informed the applicant that the defendants had paid the outstanding amount of their debt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the enforcement proceedings and ruled that the defendants were to pay the applicant the equivalents of LAW by way of remuneration and of EUR CARDINAL exclusive of value - added tax ( \u201c VAT \u201d ) by way of reimbursement for the costs of enforcement .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred to Article CARDINAL of the Code and to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Decree ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE in the \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d section below ) . It based the calculation of the applicant \u2019s remuneration on the amount that had been actually obtained for the claimant through the direct involvement of the applicant ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The amount of remuneration already paid ( EUR CARDINAL ) was deducted .", "CARDINAL . The decision of CARDINAL DATE stated that it was not subject to appeal . Later on , the LAW was amended so that a decision on the remuneration and reimbursement of a ORG \u2019s costs was made subject to appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL in the \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d section below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the ruling of CARDINAL DATE concerning her remuneration by way of a complaint under LAW to ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL in the \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d section below ) .", "CARDINAL . She relied on a judgment ( n\u00e1lez ) of ORG of DATE in case no . II . \u00daS CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL in the \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d section below ) and argued , first of all , that her claim for remuneration constituted \u201c possessions \u201d for the purposes of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further argued that there was no justification in law for limiting the amount of her remuneration by calculating it on the basis of the amount actually enforced through her direct involvement . She submitted that the object and purpose of the relevant rules had required that the amount of her remuneration should have been calculated on the basis of the total amount paid by the defendants to the claimant while the enforcement proceedings were pending . This was implied , inter alia , in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Decree read in conjunction with LAW of the LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE in the \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d section below ) , which regulated the remuneration of a ORG in the event that a defendant settled his or her debt voluntarily .", "CARDINAL . A different approach would allow any defendant to circumvent the law by delaying payment of his or her debt until enforcement proceedings commenced and then paying the debt directly to the creditor without having to bear the consequences , such as the costs of the enforcement .", "A distinction between amounts paid through the involvement of a ORG and directly to the creditor without the involvement of a ORG was unfounded and unlawful .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the applicant asserted a violation of her rights under LAW No . CARDINAL and its constitutional counterpart .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court observed that the applicant \u2019s entitlement to remuneration as such had not been contested but that what remained disputed was that remuneration \u2019s amount .", "CARDINAL . In those circumstances , her claim did not amount to an existing \u201c possession \u201d . Neither could her hope of her entitlement being realised as a specific amount in accordance with her interpretation of the relevant laws be considered \u201c legitimate \u201d so as to amount to a \u201c possession \u201d under the applicable case - law .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court accepted that the present decision was \u201c at [ a ] certain variance \u201d with its above - cited judgment in case no . II . \u00daS CARDINAL . However , that judgment had concerned a specific problem relating to LOC . Even though it had not been expressly stated in that judgment , a ORG liable to pay ORG on his or her remuneration had a legitimate expectation to have that amount of tax reimbursed by a defendant . The present decision was thus fully in compliance with the ORG \u2019s jurisprudence .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court shall decide complaints by natural or legal persons alleging a violation of their fundamental rights or freedoms ... unless the protection of such rights and freedoms falls within the jurisdiction of a different court .", "CARDINAL . NORP If ORG finds a complaint justified , it shall deliver a decision stating that a person \u2019s rights or freedoms as set out in paragraph CARDINAL have been violated by a final decision , specific measure or other act and shall quash such decision , measure or act . If the violation that has been found is the result of a failure to act , ORG may order [ the authority ] which has violated the rights or freedoms to take the necessary action . At the same time it may remit the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings , order such authority to refrain from violating the fundamental rights and freedoms ... or , where appropriate , order those who have violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph CARDINAL to restore the situation to that existing prior to the violation .", "CARDINAL .

The supervising court is to discontinue ( zastav\u00ed ) the enforcement if the person who initiated the enforcement has so requested ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Under the LAW , as applicable at the relevant time , no appeal lay against a decision on costs upon the discontinuation of enforcement proceedings . However , on DATE an amendment ( PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ) to the Code entered into force , pursuant to which such decisions are now subject to appeal ( LAW of the amended Code ) .", "CARDINAL . In respect of enforcement carried out under the LAW , a ORG is entitled to remuneration , reimbursement of costs and compensation for time spent on the matter .

If the creditor causes the discontinuation of enforcement proceedings , the court can order him or her to cover the necessary costs of the enforcement ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . This provision implies that the court has the ability , not an obligation , to make an order for costs against the creditor . Such an order presupposes an analysis of procedural responsibility ( zavinenie ) for the discontinuation . The provision confers discretion on the part of the court based on an assessment of the actions of the creditor and the degree and seriousness of the creditor \u2019s responsibility should it be established ( a decision by ORG of DATE in case no .

The amendment has no retroactive effect .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL ) , a ORG \u2019s remuneration is to be PERCENT of the figure used as the basis for calculation .", "CARDINAL . In the event that defendants settle their debts themselves and the enforcement is consequently \u201c abandoned \u201d under LAW of the LAW , the ORG \u2019s remuneration is to be reduced to CARDINAL of the amount calculated pursuant to the abovementioned rules ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL .
