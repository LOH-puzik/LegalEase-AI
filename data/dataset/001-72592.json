The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the village of NORP , GPE region , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant worked as a customs officer at ORG in LOC , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with the criminal offences of aiding and abetting in smuggling and tax evasion , abuse of power and fraud . The same day the applicant was arrested . He remained in custody until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of PERSON decided the applicant \u2019s case . The court established , in particular , that the applicant had certified documents confirming that CARDINAL vans with goods had left the customs territory of GPE , and that the applicant had not checked the actual presence of the vehicles at the customs post . The goods were , however , found and seized by ORG somewhere else within the customs territory of GPE . The court did not find any proof that the applicant had acted deliberately in order to aid the crime : the applicant denied any criminal intent and no other persons involved in the actual smuggling or tax evasion had been established by the investigation . On the basis of these findings , the court sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for the negligent performance of his professional duties and to a fine of UAH CARDINAL . At the same time , the court acquitted the applicant of other charges . By the same decision , the applicant was absolved from this sentence under LAW of DATE . This decision was not appealed and became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the President of ORG lodged a request for a supervisory review of the judgment of DATE , on the grounds of an erroneous qualification of the applicant \u2019s actions and his unreasonable acquittal on the other criminal charges brought by the prosecution . The President also noted that the sentence was too lenient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG allowed the request of its President , quashed the judgment of DATE , and remitted the case for a fresh consideration . The court instructed the first instance court to examine more thoroughly the existing evidence in the case and to conduct additional , more comprehensive interrogations of the accused and the witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of PERSON considered the case anew and sentenced the applicant to five years\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE pending probation , and a fine of UAH CARDINAL . The court found the applicant guilty of aiding and abetting in smuggling , an abuse of power and fraud . The court acquitted the applicant of aiding and abetting tax evasion , since all the smuggled goods had been seized by the law enforcement bodies and no profit had been made by anyone selling them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG upheld the decision of the first instance court . The former found that the first instance court had correctly qualified the applicant \u2019s actions . This decision was final .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the President of ORG lodged a request for a supervisory review of the judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , on the ground that the courts had not followed the instructions given in the previous decision of the Presidium of ORG of DATE about the qualification of the applicant \u2019s actions and the severity of the sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidium of ORG chaired by the President allowed the request , quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE , and remitted the case for a fresh consideration . The ORG found that the first instance court had not followed the earlier instructions and that the sentence was too lenient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of PERSON considered the case anew , found the applicant guilty of all charges and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal and changed the decision of the first instance court , sentencing the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for the negligent performance of his professional duties . The court noted that no criminal intent in the applicant \u2019s actions could be established and , given the lapse of time , it seemed improbable that any other offenders , who had been directly involved in smuggling , could be found . Therefore , the court acquitted the applicant of the other charges ( aiding and abetting in smuggling and tax evasion ) for a lack of corpus delicti . By the same decision , the applicant was absolved from his sentence under LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , LAW of LAW allowed a final and binding judgment to be subject to a supervisory review . The final judgment in a case could be appealed under the supervisory review procedure by the President of ORG or ORG of GPE , ORG or ORG GPE or their Deputies ( Article CARDINAL ) , and had to be considered by ORG or ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) . Under Article CARDINAL , if the appeal against the final judgment was to the detriment of the person thereby convicted or acquitted , it could be lodged only within DATE after the impugned judgment had come into force . Otherwise , the supervisory review appeal could be lodged at any time .", "The supervisory review procedure was repealed in DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
