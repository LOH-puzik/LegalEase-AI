THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in GPE in DATE . He is currently living in GPE , GPE , and is subject to a deportation order . He is married to a NORP national who is living and working in GPE . The CARDINAL children of the marriage , the younger of whom was born in GPE , are living with the applicant .", "The applicant is represented in the proceedings before the ORG by ORG , a firm of advocates practising in GPE , GPE .", "The applicant claims that he originally entered GPE on DATE and was granted leave to remain for a limited period to pursue a course of studies in GPE . While in GPE he became a member of ORG ( \u201c GDM \u201d ) , an anti - government group . On DATE he returned to GPE to visit his parents and to deliver publications on behalf of the LOC .", "The applicant arrived back in GPE on DATE through normal channels on a flight from GPE , GPE . DATE he learned that the NORP authorities had traced the distribution of the PERSON leaflets to him . The applicant was given leave to enter for DATE to complete his studies .", "On DATE he was granted further leave to remain as a student until DATE . In a letter dated DATE ORG ( \u201c CWIAC \u201d ) applied for political asylum on the applicant \u2019s behalf claiming that he was being sought by the NORP authorities in connection with the distribution of anti - government publications . ORG wrote to the applicant on DATE inviting him to attend for interview on DATE . A copy of the letter was sent to the ORG . The applicant failed to attend . He maintains that this was due to the fact that the letter informing him of the interview had been wrongly addressed .", "The applicant submitted an asylum application on CARDINAL DATE claiming that he had a well - founded fear of persecution if he were to be returned to GPE . The Secretary of ORG considered the request on the basis of the applicant \u2019s written representations . In a letter dated DATE the ORG notified the applicant that the Secretary of ORG had refused his application . Among his reasons for refusing the request , the Secretary of ORG highlighted that the application was made DATE before the date of expiry of his leave to remain as a student and DATE after he discovered that he was wanted by the NORP authorities . In the Secretary of ORG \u2019s opinion these factors undermined the credibility of his asylum claim . In addition , the Secretary of ORG considered that the claim as a whole was vague , lacking in detail , substance and credibility , and that his account of being sought by the NORP authorities had been fabricated in order to bolster a bogus claim made with the sole intention of circumventing the immigration rules DATE before his limited leave to remain in GPE was due to expire . Furthermore , the Secretary of ORG stated that the political and human rights situation in GPE had changed radically since the applicant \u2019s departure in DATE and there was no reason under the ORG LAW relating to LAW DATE why the applicant could not return safely to his country of nationality .", "On DATE the Special Adjudicator heard the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of the Secretary of ORG . The applicant appeared in person . At the hearing the applicant testified that he had CARDINAL young children , CARDINAL of whom was born in GPE . He stated that his wife was a ORG official posted in GPE and that she had travelled to GPE DATE to see him up until DATE . He told the Special Adjudicator that he had been detained and tortured in DATE and DATE . In DATE he went to GPE to study but was able to travel back to GPE in DATE and in DATE since he did not risk persecution during that period . It was only when he distributed the ORG materials during his visit in DATE that the risk of persecution became a reality again .", "On DATE the Special Adjudicator dismissed the appeal . In his decision the Special Adjudicator agreed with the Secretary of ORG \u2019s opinion that the timing of the applicant \u2019s request for asylum as well as his failure to attend the interview reflected adversely on his credibility . He found the applicant \u2019s account of his arrest and torture in DATE and in DATE and his allegation of being sought by the authorities in connection with the distribution of ORG materials entirely unsubstantiated . He observed in addition that his movements back and forth between GPE and GPE DATE were not the actions of a man who has a well - founded fear of persecution . The Special Adjudicator concluded :", "\u201c ... I do not find that the appellant is a credible witness and I find that he has fabricated the whole account .", "It is quite clear that even if I accepted part of the appellant \u2019s account there has been an amnesty in GPE and that there has been a sea change in the politics in GPE and there has been a gradual return to democracy . \u201d", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s application for leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision . The applicant did not renew his application ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
