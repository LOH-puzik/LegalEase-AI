On DATE the applicant gave birth to a daughter , A.C. DATE , she married PERSON ( \u201c the respondent \u201d ) , her daughter \u2019s biological father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged a claim with ORG , seeking dissolution of the marriage , custody of GPE and child maintenance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant interim care and custody of GPE until the marriage was dissolved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the applicant and ORG were visiting a mental care institute where the child was undergoing treatment for her disturbed mental health as a result of her GPE divorce , ORG forcibly removed ORG from the applicant \u2019s custody and , in so doing , assaulted the latter physically , knocking her unconscious .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an interim custody order requiring that NORP surrender custody of GPE to the applicant until the end of the marriage dissolution proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bailiff accompanied the applicant to the respondent \u2019s home , requesting that the child be surrendered . The respondent \u2019s father and ORG were also present . The respondent stated that he would not prevent the mother from seeing her child but refused to hand her over , even if it meant paying a fine , claiming that the applicant could not provide suitable living conditions for ORG and that ORG preferred living with him .", "CARDINAL . Faced with the respondent \u2019s failure to comply with the enforcement order , on CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered him to pay a fine in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ; QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) , within DATE and to return the child to her mother by the same deadline .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff again went to the respondent \u2019s home , but there was no one there . On DATE the court contacted ORG asking for urgent action , since the applicant alleged that domestic violence was taking place there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the social care centre informed the court that it had advised the applicant and the respondent to visit a mental care institute in order to be provided with appropriate guidance in communicating with each other and in order for the child to resume the interrupted course of treatment . The court was informed that the Doljevac ORG had taken over responsibility for the case , since that was where the respondent \u2019s residence was located .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the respondent to pay a further fine in the amount of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) and to return ORG to her mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the respondent and his father contacted the court , declaring that the child did not want to go to her mother and refusing to pay the fine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new attempt was made to enforce the interim order , this time in the presence of a psychologist from the Doljevac ORG , civilian police officers , the enforcement judge , a bailiff and the applicant . The child started to cry and refused to go with the applicant . The respondent stated that he had spoken with the child , encouraging her to go and live with her mother if she wanted , but the child had refused . The applicant was of the opinion that the child had been given instructions and put under pressure and was in fact strongly attached to her . She wanted to take the child immediately , regardless of her behaviour . The psychologist was against forcible transfer of the custody , claiming that it could have a negative influence on the child \u2019s mental health and lead to autism . The child had already showed some of those symptoms , but they stopped after she had moved into her father \u2019s home , where she had been living for DATE . The psychologist proposed that mother and child start to meet under the supervision of the FAC on its LOC . She also noted in TIME that the parents should cease their manipulation of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first meeting between mother and child was held on the premises of the FAC , but the applicant later told the court that it had not been successful because the child was allegedly subjected to pressure by her father .", "CARDINAL . At the next meeting , held on DATE , the child was constantly holding on to her father , crying and avoiding contact with her mother . The psychologist was not present during the meeting , being on sick leave at the time . After leaving the LOC of ORG , the applicant and respondent and other persons present started to fight . The respondent \u2019s father allegedly physically attacked the applicant . The court informed PERSON about the incident , seeking advice as to how to proceed further .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the court to enforce the interim custody order in the presence of the police .", "CARDINAL . The enforcement of the interim order was to be attempted on DATE on the LOC of ORG in the presence of the judge , a psychologist and a teacher from the Centre , the applicant and the respondent \u2019s representative . The respondent and the child did not appear . The child was allegedly ill .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the next enforcement attempt was made . The respondent again failed to appear . According to his representative , he had not been properly summoned . At the hearing , CARDINAL psychologists were present , CARDINAL from ORG and the other from ORG . Both gave their opinion concerning the forced return of the child to her mother , the psychologist from LOC contending that it was the only option , since the father was not willing to hand over the child voluntarily , and the psychologist from PERSON arguing against it , on the basis that it could have a negative influence on the child \u2019s further development .", "CARDINAL . The enforcement attempt scheduled for DATE was also postponed due to the absence of the respondent and his representative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the respondent appeared without the child , because she was allegedly sick , but he did not submit any evidence in support of this allegation . Throughout the meeting he claimed that he was willing to hand over the child to the mother but that the child was refusing to cooperate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court again ordered the respondent to pay a fine in the amount of ORG CARDINAL and to return the child to her mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court asked ORG to prepare an opinion concerning the enforcement of the interim custody order because of the difficulties encountered in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG issued an experts\u2019 report on DATE . The report contained the opinions of a psychologist , a sociologist and a neuropsychiatrist , all of whom had conducted interviews with the child and both her parents . The experts found that the child \u2019s intellectual ability was on the low side and that her emotional and social maturity was underdeveloped as a result of the family situation . They also found that both parents were manipulating the child and not doing what was in her best interests . Their ultimate opinion was that the forcible removal of the child from her father and her current social environment without proper psychological preparation could at that stage provoke certain psychological disorders . The experts advised that the child should receive psychological and social counselling to help her overcome her resistance towards her mother , that the father and his family should be helped to change their attitude and stop influencing the child \u2019s opinion towards her mother , and that both parents should receive counselling on how to behave in the best interests of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled in favour of the father . The marriage was thus dissolved , ORG was granted custody of GPE , and the applicant was ordered to contribute towards her maintenance on a DATE basis . Lastly , the court held that the applicant was entitled to spend time with GPE on the LOC of ORG TIME and TIME until such time as a different access arrangement might be warranted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG upheld ORG judgment at second and third instance , respectively .", "CARDINAL . All of the above - mentioned courts reasoned that , \u201c notwithstanding her earlier forcible removal from ... [ the applicant \u2019s custody ] ... \u201d , it was in the best interests of ORG to remain with her father since a separation could prove psychologically detrimental . In support of this conclusion , the courts referred to a separate opinion drafted by ORG , in addition to an expert \u2019s report , stating that it would indeed be advisable for GPE to remain in the environment to which she had become accustomed , where she was surrounded by love and care , and where she had made social connections ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition , ORG found that there was no evidence that the respondent had committed acts of violence against the child or the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG suspended the interim custody proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant never sought enforcement of the judgment of DATE as regards the DATE meetings with the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG , alleging a breach of her parental and family rights , essentially complaining about the non - enforcement of ORG interim custody order of DATE . She also argued that ORG ultimate ruling on the issue of ORG \u2019s custody had failed to take into account the child \u2019s best interests and had instead retroactively endorsed ORG \u2019s violent and unlawful conduct and had permanently separated her from her child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint regarding the interim custody order of DATE for being out of time , having been lodged DATE after the applicant had been served with ORG judgment of DATE . With respect to the applicant \u2019s complaint regarding ORG , ORG rejected it on the merits , accepting ORG reasoning entirely .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found GPE guilty of unlawfully removing ORG from the applicant \u2019s custody and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE . The respondent was ordered to return the child to the applicant within DATE of the date on which the judgment became final . This judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting upon the applicant \u2019s initiative , the Ni\u0161 municipal public prosecutor requested the revocation of the respondent \u2019s probation , but withdrew the request on DATE because the respondent had in the meantime been granted custody of GPE On DATE ORG terminated the proceedings seeking revocation of the probation .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s claim for review of the judgment of DATE , on CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicant custody of GPE and ordered ORG to contribute towards her maintenance on a DATE basis . In its reasoning the court explained that ORG had stated that she now wanted to live with the applicant and that ORG himself no longer had any objections to this arrangement . This judgment became both final and enforceable on DATE and ORG moved to the applicant \u2019s flat shortly thereafter .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG received a criminal complaint that had been lodged against GPE for failure to make maintenance payments .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the applicant re - established contact with her daughter on DATE , that is to say after DATE , and soon afterwards GPE went to live with the applicant . However , it seems from the documents submitted by the Government that the mother - daughter relationship was not well re - established . ORG kept returning to her father whenever she had a misunderstanding with her mother . She even gave a statement to the police to the effect that her mother was maltreating her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE A.C. moved to her father \u2019s home and it appears that she is still living with him by choice . It would also appear that the respondent filed a claim for review of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE on custody of GPE and that those proceedings are still pending ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
