CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 14+8 - Prohibition of discrimination (Article 14 - Discrimination) (Article 8-1 - Respect for family life;Respect for private life;Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life);Non-pecuniary damage - award (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction)", "JUDGES": "Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Paul Lemmens;St\u00e9phanie Mourou-Vikstr\u00f6m;Georges Ravarani;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request for a residence permit in GPE on the grounds of family reunification with her partner , PERSON , who was living in NORP . She submitted that she had been educated in GPE and that she had lived in GPE for DATE . She also explained that she wanted to live with PERSON , with whom she had been in a relationship for DATE , and with whom she wanted to establish a household and start a business .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE PERSON stated that she owned a house in NORP where she wanted to live with the applicant . She explained that she had been in a relationship with the applicant for DATE and that they wanted to live together so as to avoid constant travelling and the distance between them .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings ORG FAC uprava GPE - moslova\u010dka ) found that the applicant and PERSON had been in a relationship since DATE and that in order to maintain their relationship they had been travelling to see each other . It was also established that the applicant had recently stayed with PERSON in the period between DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request with a summary reasoning indicating that all the relevant requirements under LAW had not been met .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision to ORG ( ORG unutarnjih poslova ; hereinafter : the \u201c Ministry \u201d ) , arguing that it could be inferred from the decision of ORG that her request had been dismissed because LAW did not allow family reunification for same - sex couples . She considered that there had been no grounds for a difference in treatment based on sexual orientation and that the relevant law should not be construed in a manner that allowed for such a possibility . She relied , inter alia , on LAW and the Prohibition of Discrimination Act , arguing that even if she was not to be considered as PERSON \u2019s \u201c immediate family member \u201d , within the meaning of LAW , she should in any case be considered as her \u201c other relative \u201d within the meaning of that LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the decision of ORG . The relevant part of the ORG \u2019s decision reads :", "\u201c Concerning the family reunification , based on which the request for the regularisation of the status of an alien in GPE has been submitted in the case at issue , [ it is to be noted that ] the case file shows that the appellant relies on the existence of a same - sex relationship with the NORP national PERSON , which has allegedly lasted for DATE ...", "The impugned decision shows that the [ first - instance body ] , other than citing the [ relevant ] provisions of LAW , also cited CARDINAL of LAW , according to which the effects of an extramarital relationship , that is to say the rights and obligations following from its existence , relate to a union between an unmarried woman and man which has lasted for DATE , or less if a child was born of [ the union ] ; and section CARDINAL of the Same - Sex Union Act ... which defines a same - sex union as a union CARDINAL persons of the same sex ( partners ) who are not married , or in an extramarital relationship or other same - sex union , which has lasted for DATE and which is based on the principles of equality of partners , mutual respect and assistance as well as the emotional bonds of partners .", "...", "It follows that the [ Same - Sex Union ] Act does not define a same - sex union as a family and LAW does not cover same - sex unions . It should also be taken into account that the provisions of LAW concerning temporary residence for family reunification do not provide for a possibility of regularisation of the status of an alien on the grounds of [ the existence of ] a same - sex union , nor does such a union fall within the scope of [ the term ] \u2018 immediate family member\u2019 incorporated in that LAW , which makes it clear that there is no legal ground for granting the request of the appellant .", "Therefore , the appellant wrongly considers that the first - instance body should have applied section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW in her case ... because that provision clearly provides that exceptionally to the provision defining immediate family members , \u2018 other ORG could be so considered if there are specific personal or serious humanitarian reasons for a family reunification in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an administrative action with ORG ( GPE ) , arguing that she had been discriminated against in comparison to different - sex couples who had a possibility to seek family reunification under LAW . She relied on the domestic anti - discrimination legislation , including LAW , as well as the LAW and the ORG \u2019s case - law .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action on DATE . The relevant part of the judgment provides :", "\u201c The cited section DATE ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that the immediate family members are spouses or persons who live in an extramarital relationship in accordance with NORP legislation . The cited sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW show that marriage and extramarital relationship are unions between a man and a woman . Thus , union between CARDINAL same - sex persons can not be considered under the relevant legal provisions as marriage or an extramarital relationship .", "Union between CARDINAL same - sex persons can be considered under the legal term same - sex union under the conditions provided for in section QUANTITY of the Same - Sex Union Act . However , given the limited legal effects of a same - sex union , the possible existence of such a union does not represent a basis for family reunification . It should be noted that LAW of the [ Aliens ] Act explicitly enumerates persons who are to be considered immediate family members or who are to be exceptionally considered [ so ] , which leads to a conclusion that it can not be extended to cover persons living in a same - sex union .", "Accordingly , the granting of a request for temporary residence of an alien on the grounds of family reunification depends on the satisfaction of the requirements under sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW . In the case at issue the plaintiff is neither married nor in an extramarital relationship with the NORP national PERSON , which is not in dispute between the parties . It therefore follows that the plaintiff can not be considered an immediate family member within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the [ Aliens ] Act and thus she did not justify the purpose ( in the concrete case : family reunification ) for which a temporary residence of an alien in GPE can be granted ...", "In view of the cited legal provisions , and the facts of the case , this court finds that in the concrete case it was not possible to grant the plaintiff \u2019s request . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) , contending that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her sexual orientation . She relied on the ORG and the relevant domestic anti - discrimination legislation , and she cited the ORG \u2019s case - law on the question of discrimination related to sexual orientation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , endorsing the reasoning of the lower bodies . The relevant part of the decision reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG reiterates that discrimination under LAW does not have an independent standing for a constitutional complaint but must be submitted in conjunction with another ( substantive ) constitutional right . Discrimination means difference in the treatment of persons in the same or relevantly similar situations without an objective and reasonable justification . LAW contains constitutional guarantee against discrimination on any ground in securing a concrete right .", "Although the appellant relied in her constitutional complaint in LAW and the related LAW , the Constitutional Court finds that these provisions are not applicable in the case at issue .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before it , ORG did not find facts or circumstances which would suggest that in the proceedings before [ the lower bodies ] the appellant was discriminated against on any ground ... Thus her complaint of a violation of LAW , the Constitutional Court finds unfounded .", "CARDINAL . ORG also notes that the appellant , in the concrete case , did not show that she has used the legal avenue under LAW ...", "There has therefore been no violation of her constitutional right under LAW CARDINAL of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The case - law of ORG cited in the constitutional complaint is of no relevance for the case at issue since it relates to cases concerning health insurance and inheritance of tenancy rights by same - sex partners living in a stable ( de facto ) relationship . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
