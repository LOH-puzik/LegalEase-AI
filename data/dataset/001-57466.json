THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);Preliminary objection rejected (victim);Violation of Art. 5-3;Violation of Art. 5-4;No violation of Art. 5-1;No violation of Art. 14+5;Not necessary to examine Art. 13 and 18;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON , Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON Brink , who were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively , reside in the GPE . In DATE , after being drafted as conscript servicemen in ORG , they each refused , on account of their beliefs as conscientious objectors , to obey specific orders deriving from their obligation to perform military service . They were thereupon placed under arrest by their respective commanding officers for suspected offences against LAW ( Wetboek van Militair Strafrecht ) . They were kept in custody and referred for trial before a military court .", "CARDINAL . ORG The procedure for obtaining exemption from military service on the ground of conscientious objection is laid down in ORG ( Wet Gewetensbezwaren Militaire ORG ) and a Ministerial Decree of DATE .", "Under the terms of the Ministerial Decree , if a request for recognition as a conscientious objector is lodged with the Minister of Defence within DATE of conscription the conscript will be given leave pending the decision . Where , on the other hand , active service has exceeded DATE , leave is not automatically granted in view of the need to investigate any possible abuse of the right to rely on ORG . In such cases , the commanding officer will first consult with the conscript service department at ORG .", "Where military criminal proceedings have been instituted against a conscript serviceman who has applied for the status of conscientious objector , they may be stayed pending a decision by the Minister on the request ( section CARDINAL sub - section CARDINAL of ORG ) . The decision in this respect will depend upon the particular circumstances , having regard , inter alia , to the time that has elapsed between the conscription and the lodging of the request . Proceedings must , however , be stayed once ORG on Conscientious Objectors has commenced its enquiries ( section CARDINAL sub - section CARDINAL ) . After ORG has stated its opinion , the Minister may grant recognition as a conscientious objector ( section CARDINAL ) . The Minister \u2019s decision is subject to appeal ( section CARDINAL) . The entitlement to conduct criminal proceedings for failure to obey orders or military regulations or for failure to report for enlistment lapses automatically upon recognition of the accused \u2019s conscientious objection ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Criminal procedure for the military land and air forces , including in particular the matter of arrest and detention on remand , is governed by the ORG and Air Force Code of Procedure ( Rechtspleging bij de Land - en Luchtmacht - \" LAW \" ) , as last amended on DATE . Offences under military criminal law , which applies equally to conscript servicemen such as the applicants and to volunteers , are tried at first instance before a Military Court ( PERSON ) . There may be an appeal to ORG ( PERSON ) and ultimately a ( cassation ) appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) of the GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Every officer and non - commissioned officer is empowered to arrest military personnel of lower rank suspected of a serious offence provided the circumstances require immediate deprivation of liberty ( LAW ) . The resultant detention is not to exceed TIME ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "The commanding officer may order the suspect to be placed or kept in custody on remand if ( a ) there is a serious risk of absconding or ( b ) there are important reasons of public safety requiring immediate deprivation of liberty or ( c ) this is necessary in connection with the maintenance of military discipline among other servicemen ( DATE paragraph ) . Such a detention order may be made against a serviceman suspected of any offence set out in LAW or any offence in respect of which detention on remand is permitted under LAW , with the exception of those offences of which ORG takes no cognisance ( DATE paragraph ) . An order may not be issued if the suspect is unlikely to be penalised by unconditional imprisonment or by any other measure restricting his freedom , or is likely to be given a sentence of shorter duration than that of the detention on remand ( ibid . ) . Detention must be terminated once the grounds for it cease to exist ( LAW paragraph ) . All cases of detention exceeding DATE shall be reported by the commanding officer to the commanding general ( LAW paragraph ) .", "Where detention has lasted DATE , the suspected serviceman may petition the competent ORG to fix a term ( liable to extension ) within which the commanding general must either decide whether the case is to be referred to a ORG or else terminate the detention . ORG has to rule on the petition without delay , after hearing the authority empowered to refer the case , the auditeur - militair ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and the suspected serviceman , who may have the assistance of an adviser ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG If , after receiving the advice of the auditeur - militair and , \" if possible \" ( \" zo mogelijk \" ) , after the suspected serviceman has been heard , the commanding general or a senior officer ( hoofd officier ) designated by him to act on his behalf considers that the case should be tried by ORG , the serviceman shall be referred for trial before that ORG ( LAW ) . On the other hand , the commanding general or the designated officer may in appropriate circumstances leave the case to be dealt with as a disciplinary matter ( LAW Regulation No . CARDINAL of ORG explained the effect of these provisions as follows ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" In military penal procedure , as distinct from civilian procedure , the decision to prosecute in a case is not taken separately by the prosecuting authority , the auditeur - militair , but by a military authority . That authority is the commanding general or the senior officer he has appointed to act on his behalf , i.e. the referring officer ... Thus , the auditeur - militair is merely an advisory body at this stage , although the obtaining of his advice and the giving of that advice by him are mandatory . \"", "Any decision to refer for trial must be in writing and state whether the suspected serviceman is to be released or kept in custody ; the grounds for detention set out in the second and fourth paragraphs of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) apply pari passu ( Article CARDINAL ) . If , against the advice of the auditeur - militair , the commanding general or designated senior officer chooses not to refer a suspected serviceman for trial , the auditeur - militair may take the matter to ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) . No appeal is provided for in the contrary case .", "According to the Government , it has now become standard procedure to apply the above provisions of LAW in the following manner . Where detention on remand has been ordered , the suspected serviceman is always heard by the auditeur - militair and any referral to ORG takes place shortly thereafter , on DATE after the arrest . In view of the requirements of LAW , the auditeur - militair \u2019s assessment of the circumstances and his advice to the commanding general or designated senior officer cover not only referral for trial but also the question whether the conditions for detention on remand set out in LAW fulfilled . Thus , the standard written form used by the auditeur - militair for the purposes of transmitting his advice to the referring officer contains , inter alia , a paragraph as to whether the suspect should \" be released or be placed or kept in custody \" . Practice has evolved to the point where the advice of the auditeur - militair is invariably followed and generally regarded as binding .", "CARDINAL . Detention maintained or ordered in the decision referring the serviceman for trial may not exceed DATE unless extended , by terms of DATE , by ORG at the request of the auditeur - militair ( DATE ) . Every accused detained by virtue of the referral decision must be heard by the officier - commissaris ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as speedily as possible and in any event within DATE of referral ; in this connection , the accused may be assisted by an adviser ( Article CARDINAL , first paragraph ) . Before extending detention , ORG must give the accused or his adviser the opportunity to submit argument ( Article CARDINAL , second paragraph ) .", "As soon as the grounds for the detention cease to exist , release must be ordered ( LAW , first paragraph ) . In the period between referral and commencement of the trial , power to order release is exercisable by the auditeur - militair , or by ORG at the request of either the officier - commissaris or the detained serviceman himself ( Article CARDINAL , second paragraph ) . ORG , in deciding on such requests , will hear the auditeur - militair and also the detained serviceman or his adviser where the serviceman is requesting release for the first time ( DATE paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG If the accused is in custody at the first hearing , ORG will decide , after being addressed by the auditeur - militair , whether or not the nature and circumstances of the case require his continued detention during the trial ( LAW . The ORG may direct the accused \u2019s release from detention on remand at any later stage in the proceedings , either of its own motion or at the request of the auditeur - militair or the accused himself ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The auditeur - militair has the function of prosecuting authority before ORG ( Article CARDINAL , first paragraph ) . No serving member of ORG may appear as auditeur - militair or substitute auditeur - militair ( LAW paragraph ) . The auditeur - militair and his substitute may be replaced by an acting auditeur - militair ( plaatsvervanger - LAW paragraph ) who may be a military officer , but such replacement was said by the Government to occur only in exceptional circumstances . Auditeurs - militair ( including substitutes and acting ones ) are appointed , and dismissed , by the Crown on a joint proposal from the Ministers of Justice and Defence ; they must possess a law degree ( LAW paragraphs ) . Under the terms of LAW , second paragraph , of LAW , they are obliged to comply with instructions given to them in their official capacity by the Minister of ORG . However , according to the Government , this latter provision serves as no more than the legal authority for issuing general guidelines on prosecution policy and , at least in DATE , no Minister of ORG has acted or interfered in a concrete case on the basis of LAW .", "The auditeur - militair is bound by his oath to act honestly and impartially ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . He must attend the hearings of ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) but he does not take part in the ORG \u2019s deliberations . He is under a general duty to assist ORG , as well as the commanding general , with reports , observations and advice in relation to military justice when required to do so ( Article CARDINAL ) . He is not under the supervision of ORG or ORG in the discharge of his duties , save that ORG has the power to reprimand him should he fail strictly to observe statutory time - limits ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Attached to each Military Court is CARDINAL officier - commissaris who is in charge of the preliminary investigation of cases ( DATE ) . An officier - commissaris is an officer or former officer of the armed forces with the rank of captain or higher and is appointed for a fixed term of DATE by the commanding general ( ibid . ) . While he may at the same time be a member of ORG , this is not usually the case . His task of preliminary investigation involves gathering the facts and hearing witnesses and the accused when necessary ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ) . A hearing by the officier - commissaris has the same force as a hearing by ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) . During his enquiries , he is under a duty to apply himself equally to discovering the accused \u2019s innocence and to obtaining proof or admission of guilt ( Article CARDINAL ) . Like the auditeur - militair , he is bound by his oath to act honestly and impartially ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG By virtue of LAW , the Convention forms part of and has primacy over domestic legislation , whether earlier or subsequent .", "Under the ordinary criminal law , by virtue of LAW and following of LAW , compensation may be recovered for the consequences , both material and non - material , of wrongful detention . No comparable clauses are contained in LAW . On DATE , that is subsequent to the detention of Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the Minister of ORG made an \" interim provision \" declaring LAW and following applicable by analogy to military criminal procedure , subject to a limitation period of DATE .", "Before the Commission , the Government submitted that , quite apart from this , a claim in respect of matters allegedly contrary to the ORG could always be brought against the military authorities under LAW , which provides :", "\" Any unlawful act ( onrechtmatige daad)as a result of which damage has been inflicted on another person makes the person by whose fault ( door ORG schuld ) the damage was caused liable to pay compensation . \"", "Before the ORG , the ORG stated that compensation could only be recovered under Article CARDINAL for material loss suffered , but they referred to the additional possibility of seeking from the civil courts a declaratory judgment against the authorities that a period of detention had been unlawful . On the basis of such a judgment , the Minister of Defence would \" in all likelihood \" , on request by the person concerned , grant compensation for non - material damage .", "The Government further explained that Article CARDINAL did not merely allow a litigant to sue for compensation : according to well - established case - law , the victim of an unlawful and continuing act may apply to the civil courts on the basis of Article CARDINAL for an injunction ; in circumstances of urgency , immediate interim relief may be sought in summary proceedings before the President of a ORG ( Articles CARDINAL and following of LAW ) . In cases of allegedly unlawful detention , recourse has been had to Article CARDINAL in summary proceedings so as to obtain a provisional court order for immediate release .", "There is , however , no known case in which a serviceman held in custody on remand has relied on DATE to bring either an ordinary claim for financial reparation or an application under the summary procedure for a provisional order of immediate release .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , these CARDINAL applicants were drafted as conscript soldiers in an infantry battalion , Mr. PERSON as from DATE and Mr. PERSON as from DATE This battalion was designated in DATE to leave on mission within DATE as part of ORG in the GPE . Fearing that they might be forced to use violence against other human beings , the applicants , on CARDINAL and DATE respectively , lodged applications with the Minister of Defence to be recognised as conscientious objectors ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Pending examination of their requests , the applicants at first continued to perform their normal military duties . However , the Minister not having in the meantime relieved them from service by granting them leave under LAW of DATE ( ibid . ) , Mr. PERSON on DATE and Mr. PERSON on DATE refused to obey orders to participate in a military exercise .", "CARDINAL . ORG Each applicant was thereupon placed under arrest by his commanding officer ( LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , accused of the offence of insubordination contrary to LAW . The ground invoked for their arrest was the need to maintain discipline amongst other servicemen , having regard to their battalion \u2019s imminent mission in the GPE .", "On DATE , they both appeared before the auditeur - militair . On DATE , in accordance with the advice of the auditeur - militair , the commanding general referred the applicants for trial before ORG and at the same time ordered their release ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Military Code - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , criminal proceedings having been stayed as a result of ORG on Conscientious Objectors having commenced its enquiries into their requests to be recognised as conscientious objectors ( section CARDINAL sub - section CARDINAL of ORG - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , they appeared before ORG on Conscientious Objectors ( ibid . ) . On DATE , the Minister of Defence granted them the status of conscientious objectors and they were discharged from military service .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , each of the applicants lodged a complaint with the divisional commander alleging unfair treatment by the commanding officer who had ordered the arrest . They submitted that the decisions taken against them under LAW were in breach of LAW paras . CARDINAL ( c ) and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-c , article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . The divisional commander dismissed both complaints on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicants addressed a request for compensation to the Minister of Defence , relying on Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( LAW . On DATE , the Under Secretary of ORG rejected their request on the ground that there was no basis for compensation since none of the provisions of LAW had been violated in the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Mr. van den Brink was forcibly drafted as a conscript soldier on DATE upon his failure to register in due time . On his arrival at a training centre , he was ordered by his commanding officer to take receipt of and put on a military uniform , but he persistently refused to do so . Being a \" total objector \" ( \" totaalweigeraar \" ) , he never submitted any request to be granted the status of conscientious objector ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In view of his persistent refusal , the applicant was placed under arrest on DATE by his commanding officer ( LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , accused of the offence of insubordination contrary to LAW . The ground for his arrest was the need to maintain discipline amongst other servicemen , a repetition of the offence being feared . The decision to arrest him also took into account the fact that he did not wish to have recourse to ORG .", "On DATE , Mr. van den Brink appeared before the auditeur - militair . On DATE , in accordance with the advice of the auditeur - militair , the competent senior officer referred him for trial before ORG , while deciding that he should be kept in custody on the same ground as before ( Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , second paragraph , of LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant was heard by the officier - commissaris ( LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .
