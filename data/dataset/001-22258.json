The accounts were submitted on DATE and DATE , and as they were comprehensive the expenses incurred thereby amounted to CARDINAL million Danish kroner ( ORG ) .", "On DATE the prosecution submitted an indictment consisting of CARDINAL counts with which the applicant , the above CARDINAL other top executives in ORG , as well as the CARDINAL accountants were charged . Counts CARDINAL - CARDINAL concerned the CARDINAL other top executives , counts CARDINAL - CARDINAL concerned the applicant only and count CARDINAL concerned the CARDINAL accountants .", "Count number CARDINAL concerned , inter alia , ORG accounts for DATE until DATE , which were sent to ORG , and which the applicant was accused of having manipulated , thereby converting a deficit of ORG CARDINAL , to a surplus of ORG CARDINAL , and the net capital of ORG to DKK CARDINAL million . Furthermore , the net capital contained fictitious assets and questionable transactions from DATE amounting to at least DKK CARDINAL . ORG", "Preliminary court sessions were held in DATE and DATE concerning the mental health of CARDINAL of the top executives . Subsequently his case was separated from the others .", "At a hearing on DATE the scheduling of the trial was determined to start on DATE . Due to its volume it was expected that the trial would DATE .", "During the scheduling period several pleadings were submitted in order to clarify procedural questions , including objections to the statements of account and the appointment of a co - counsel to CARDINAL of the co - accused top executives , and hearings on these issues were held on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "The trial commenced on DATE , it was conducted DATE , and lasted for DATE .

When determining the share of the legal costs payable by the defendants , the court must make a distribution between the convicted offenders and the ORG taking into account the proportion between the charge and the outcome of the case . Furthermore , in the light of the quite extraordinary level of legal costs in this case , the defendants\u2019 circumstances must be particularly taken into account together with the fact that the consolidation of the cases against [ the applicant and the CARDINAL top executives ] and the cases against the accountants should not be detrimental to the defendants ... \u201d", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG of Eastern GPE ( PERSON landsret ) . Also the co - accused top executives appealed against the judgment , and the prosecution appealed against the judgment in respect of all the accused .", "Preliminary court sessions were held on DATE and DATE during which requests from CARDINAL of the coaccused for a cocounsel were decided , and discussions went on as to the scheduling of the trial and practical problems related thereto . ORG offered the parties to sit DATE a week , but in accordance with ORG recommendation , endorsed by the prosecutor , it was agreed that CARDINAL DATE hearings were to be held . As the permanent courtroom was considered too small it was agreed that ORG should rent a larger room . The trial , which was expected to last for DATE , was scheduled to commence on DATE . Further preliminary hearings were held on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE concerning procedural matters such as the use of the statements of account , whether the prosecution \u2019s appeal relating to one of the co - accused was time - barred , and whether an assistant employed for the case by the prosecution was partial .", "The trial in ORG commenced on DATE , it lasted DATE and was terminated by judgment of DATE in which the court upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence , but reduced the costs that the applicant had to pay to DKK CARDINAL . Also the co - accused top executives\u2019 conviction and sentences were upheld , but their shares of the costs were reduced as well . CARDINAL of the accountants were convicted to a greater extent than before ORG , CARDINAL to a lesser extent .", "Before ORG the applicant and all the co - accused complained that LAW had been violated due to the length of the proceedings . In its judgment ORG stated , inter alia , that a duration of DATE in a case such as the present one with such an extraordinary extent and considerable complexity did not in itself amount to a violation of LAW . Furthermore , it approved of the prosecution \u2019s decision to join the cases against the accused with the aim of economising the legal process . However , in joining the cases the court found that the proceedings had been unduly prolonged in violation of LAW in respect of the CARDINAL accountants who had only played a minor role in the criminal activities . Thus , CARDINAL accountant , his sentence was upheld , as to the remaining CARDINAL their sentences were reduced , and they were all exempted from paying costs . As regards the applicant and the co - accused top executives the court held :", "\u201c As to the question of whether the case as such should have been terminated earlier , the court notes first of all that the investigation was carried out in respect of all counts at the same time and there is no reason to criticise its extent or duration .", "As to the court proceedings they were arranged in agreement with counsels for the defence in both court instances , and there is no reason to criticise the duration hereof or the periods spent on the deliberations and the drawing up of the judgment .", "Finally as to the period of scheduling i.e. the period from when the case was brought before the court until the trial actually commenced , this amounted to DATE and DATE both in ORG and in ORG . Of course this period can be expected to last longer in complex cases with several accused than in other cases , but in the present case the length of this specific period may also be imputed to the lack of resources in the court system .", "Making an overall assessment of the lengthy proceedings , which only to a limited extent can be imputed to \u2018 dead periods\u2019 , namely the excessive periods of scheduling , the court does not find a violation of LAW in relation to [ the CARDINAL named top executives ] or the applicant , who are accused and convicted of aggravated fraud . \u201d", "As regards the sentence imposed on the applicant and the CARDINAL co - accused top executives ORG held inter alia :", "\u201c ORG can concur entirely with ... ORG ... regarding the penal merits of the counts adjudicated and the other circumstances emphasised in the sentencing . In this connection , the High Court states that the fraud is extremely serious and that - apart from the fact that it was committed under heavy pressure from the dominant Chairman of ORG - mitigating circumstances are scarce . On this basis it might be considered to increase the sentences somewhat for [ the applicant and the CARDINAL co - accused top executives ] , but in the view of the burden on [ these ] caused by the length of the proceedings , the court approves the prison sentences ... \u201d", "As regards the order that the applicant pay costs ORG stated :", "\u201c ... it is decided , partly in view of the statement in ORG judgment , partly and particularly in view of the statement above regarding the length of the proceedings ... [ that the applicant shall pay DKK CARDINAL to the ORG ] \u201c", "On DATE the Leave to Appeal Board ( Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
