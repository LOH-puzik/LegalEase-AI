On DATE , after CARDINAL remittals , ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE found the applicant guilty in his absence and sentenced him to DATE of imprisonment . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE upheld this judgment .", "CARDINAL . It transpires from the case - file that on various occasions the applicant had relied on his health and an alleged trip to GPE as reasons for not appearing at some hearings , had dismissed his representative , had challenged judges , and had registered a false address as his address of residence .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date DATE and DATE the above judgments were transmitted to ORG in Bar for enforcement against the applicant , which is when the applicant learned about them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE reopened the proceedings , following the applicant \u2019s request to that effect filed on DATE . The same decision ordered the applicant \u2019s detention due to the fear that he might abscond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Instance found the applicant guilty of endangering traffic , sentenced him to DATE of imprisonment and prohibited him from driving . The court noted that the applicant had attempted in various manners to prolong the proceedings , including health reasons , \u201c being occupied by other affairs \u201d , dismissing his representative , challenging judges , registering a false address as the address of his residence , and an alleged trip to GPE . On DATE the High Court quashed this judgment .", "CARDINAL .

The Conclusion was apparently explained by an opinion that if the prosecution could become time - barred that would favour those defendants who by cunning managed to avoid being tried .

No appeal was allowed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant addressed ORG , complaining apparently that his prosecution had become time - barred .
