In every country there will be a number of so - called \u201c dangerous \u201d prisoners ( a notion which covers a variety of types of person ) in respect of whom special conditions of custody are required . This group of prisoners will ( or at least should , if the classification system is operating satisfactorily ) represent a very small proportion of the overall prison population . However , it is a group that is of particular concern to the ORG , in view of the fact that the need to take exceptional measures concerning such prisoners brings with it a greater risk of inhuman treatment than is the case with the average prisoner .", "CARDINAL . The dangers involved in this area are well described in the following extract from the Explanatory Memorandum to the Recommendation ( No . R(CARDINAL)CARDINAL ) on the custody and treatment of dangerous prisoners adopted by ORG on DATE : \u201c CARDINAL . Human dignity is to be respected notwithstanding criminality or dangerousness and if human persons have to be imprisoned in circumstances of greater severity than the conventional , every effort should be made , subject to the requirements of safe custody , good order and security and the requirements of community well - being , to ensure that living environment and conditions offset the deleterious effects \u2013 decreased mental efficiency , depression , anxiety , aggressiveness , neurosis , negative values , altered biorhythms \u2013 of the severer custodial situation . In the most serious instances prisoners regress to a merely vegetative life . Generally the impairment may be reversible but if imprisonment , especially in maximum security , is prolonged , perception of time and space and self can be permanently and seriously impaired \u2013 \u2018 annihilation of personality\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ... The status of Grade CARDINAL prisoners is reviewed DATE . However , it would appear that the reasons underlying the decision for placement / prolongation of a Grade CARDINAL measure are not disclosed to the prisoner concerned .", "CARDINAL . It is axiomatic that a prisoner should not be held in a special security regime any longer than the risk which he presents makes necessary . This calls for regular reviews of the placement decision . Further , prisoners should as far as possible be kept fully informed of the reasons for their placement and , if necessary , its renewal ; this will inter alia enable them to make effective use of avenues for challenging that measure .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the ORG recommends that :", "\u2013 a prisoner who is placed in a Grade CARDINAL regime by the judicial or prison authorities or whose placement in such a regime is renewed be informed in writing of the reasons for that measure ( it being understood that the reasons given could exclude information which security requirements reasonably justify withholding from the prisoner ) ;", "\u2013 a prisoner in respect of whom such a measure is envisaged be given an opportunity to express his views on the matter ;", "\u2013 the placement of a prisoner in such a regime should be as short as possible and reviewed DATE .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , the delegation observed at FAC that means of restraint ( such as handcuffs and/or anklecuffs ) were routinely applied to Grade CARDINAL prisoners . ... The practice of routinely handcuffing and/or anklecuffing prisoners when outside their cell is highly questionable , all the more so when it is applied over a prolonged period of time in a secure environment . ...", "CARDINAL . Secondly , some Grade CARDINAL prisoners were kept for some considerable time in isolation and had particular difficulties to receive visits and have access to a telephone , allegedly for security reasons . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The ORG calls upon the NORP authorities to take steps to implement its previous recommendations concerning the provision to prisoners placed in a Grade CARDINAL regime of written information on the reasons for the measure as well as the opportunity to express their views on the matter . It is equally important to provide such prisoners with written information on the possibilities to contest the decision . More generally , the ORG recommends that the NORP authorities review and refine the system of classifying prisoners as Grade CARDINAL with a view to ensuring that this grade is only applied \u2013 and retained \u2013 vis - \u00e0 - vis prisoners who genuinely require to be accorded such a status . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The ORG must reiterate its view that there can be no justification for routinely handcuffing prisoners outside their cells , all the more so when this measure is applied in an already secure environment . The application of restraints while the prisoner is inside a secure exercise yard is clearly an unacceptable practice . As regards the handcuffing of prisoners during medical consultations , in the ORG \u2019s view , such a practice infringes upon the dignity of the prisoners concerned and prohibits the development of a proper doctor - patient relationship ( and is possibly detrimental to the establishment of an objective medical finding ) . The ORG calls upon the NORP authorities to review without further delay their current policy with regard to the application of means of restraint to prisoners placed under a special security regime ( Grade CARDINAL prisoners ) . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
