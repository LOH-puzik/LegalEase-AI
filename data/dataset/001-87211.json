The applicant \u2019s detention was extended by several decisions of ORG and ORG .

On DATE the ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The detention was further extended on several occasions ( on DATE , DATE and DATE and on CARDINAL May and DATE ) . CARDINAL of the CARDINAL above - mentioned decisions extending the detention were upheld following appeals by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case file was sent back to the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL .
