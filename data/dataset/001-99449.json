NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born on DATE . His current place of residence is ORG , GPE , his place of birth . He was represented before the ORG by Mr M. Wijngaarden , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG and as apparent from information available to the public , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant entered the GPE in DATE , at DATE , for the purpose of lawful family reunion . He was granted a residence permit ( vergunning tot verblijf ) for that purpose , which was extended several times at his request until the events complained of .", "CARDINAL . After his arrival in the GPE , the applicant went to school for a time ; he later became unemployed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of belonging to an NORP terrorist group known as the \u201c NORP group \u201d ( GPE ) , from its being based in the town of GPE which is the place of residence of the Queen ( Hofstad , town where the royal residence is located ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the then Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie ; \u201c the Minister \u201d ) notified the applicant of her intention to withdraw his residence permit on the ground that he posed a threat for national security . That finding was based on an individual intelligence report ( individueel ambtsbericht ) dated DATE that ORG ( Algemene Inlichtingen- en ORG ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) had submitted , and which was appended .", "CARDINAL . According to the intelligence report of DATE , the applicant was a member of a group led by a NORP national who recruited radical NORP youths . The group , of which the applicant was stated to be one of the more radical members , held regular meetings , during which the NORP preached NORP extremism and violent jihad ( holy war ) . The applicant was understood to be in the possession of tape recordings calling for armed jihad and stating that it was forbidden to have dealings with \u201c NORP dogs \u201d ( dat omgang met \u201c christenhonden \u201d is verboden ) . The applicant was stated to have radicalised a young woman of NORP origin to the point where she had taken to wearing a burka and refused to pray with her own family . The report identified other members of the group by name ; of these , the best known was PERSON , who was later convicted of the murder of the film director PERSON .", "CARDINAL . An earlier intelligence report , dated DATE and on which the later intelligence report was based in part , described the members of the group meeting to discuss and plan violent jihad , and watching and expressing approval of films showing the beheading of persons including hostages in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through his counsel , submitted written comments denying his involvement in the planning of unlawful violence , arguing that the ORG information was unreliable and unverifiable , and that the measure intended was a disproportionate interference in his family life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister gave a decision withdrawing the applicant 's residence permit , essentially on the same grounds as those stated in the original notification . The following day she gave an additional decision declaring the applicant an undesirable alien , entailing the imposition of an exclusion order ( ongewenste vreemdeling ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for an interim measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) aimed at preventing his deportation pending the outcome of the proceedings . He lodged an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) against each of the CARDINAL decisions on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant supplemented his objection with a statement of grounds in which he argued that the ORG information was unreliable and that he could not be expected to return to GPE and accept permanent separation from his parents . In a separate letter of DATE he asked to see the information on which the ORG intelligence report was based .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked for the decision on his objection to be deferred until he had had a chance to study the ORG information . This request was repeated on DATE and DATE . On DATE , however , the Minister for ORG replied that there was no reason not to proceed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister gave CARDINAL separate decisions dismissing the objections .

The applicant appealed to ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE against both decisions on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in criminal proceedings distinct from the immigration proceedings , ORG of GPE convicted the applicant of membership of a criminal organisation and membership of an organisation aiming to commit terrorist crimes and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , sitting in GPE , gave an order for a provisional measure that would allow the applicant to await the outcome of the proceedings in the GPE . In separate decisions , it declared the appeals well - founded ; it considered the ORG intelligence reports to be insufficiently \u201c objective and transparent \u201d ( objectief en inzichtelijk ) . The Minister 's decisions were annulled and the Minister was ordered to decide afresh .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Security and Integrity Office ( Bureau PERSON ) of ORG ( Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst ) submitted a written statement to the Minister to the effect that , after examination of the documents underlying the reports , it appeared that the ORG intelligence investigation had met applicable standards of due care as regards content and procedure followed and was transparent .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister appealed to ORG of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State ) against ORG decisions on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In parallel , the Minister gave a new decision on the objection against the withdrawal of the applicant 's residence permit on DATE . She accepted that the ORG reports were adequate as to their objectivity , impartiality and thoroughness and that the ORG had to protect their sources of information . In so far as the applicant had denied the accuracy of the ORG reports , he had not given any relevant arguments .", "CARDINAL . The following day the Minister gave a new decision in much the same terms in which she dismissed the objection against the decision to impose an exclusion order on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG of ORG declared the Minister 's appeal of DATE well - founded . He annulled ORG decisions of DATE and remitted the cases to ORG . In the same decision he annulled the Minister 's decisions of DATE , which had been adopted pursuant to ORG decision of DATE , and ordered the deferral of the applicant 's deportation until DATE so that the applicant had a realistic chance to seek a provisional measure from ORG itself .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG of GPE for a stay of deportation on DATE . In his statement of grounds , submitted the following day , he now relied on Article CARDINAL , arguing that the NORP authorities treated terrorist suspects harshly . On DATE ORG granted an interim measure allowing the applicant to await the outcome of his appeals in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Having held a hearing on DATE , ORG decided that it needed to study the information on which the conclusions of the ORG intelligence reports were based . To that end , it reopened the case .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision on DATE . Having studied the ORG information , it found that the ORG 's conclusions had an adequate basis in fact ; there was no need to reopen the discussions on that score . A threat relevant to LAW in the event of the applicant 's return to GPE had not been established . The applicant 's appeal against the withdrawal of his residence permit was held to be inadmissible in view of the decision to impose an exclusion order on the applicant ; the appeal against the latter decision was dismissed as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG of ORG , which on DATE dismissed it , referring to standing case - law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was deported to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against his conviction ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE ORG of The GPE quashed the conviction and acquitted the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) with ORG ( PERSON ) against the acquittal . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG and remitted the case to ORG of GPE where it remains pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a list of persons , groups and entities to be subjected to restrictive measures pursuant to ORG ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism ( ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC ) .

The applicant brought actions in ORG ( now re - named ORG ; the first - instance body of ORG of ORG , as it was named at the time ) for annulment of ORG DATE and CARDINAL in so far as they included his name ( Cases T-CARDINAL/CARDINAL and T-CARDINAL/CARDINAL respectively ) . ORG and ORG sought , and were granted , permission to intervene .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Instance dismissed both actions and ordered the applicant to pay his own costs and those of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) provides that a foreign national may be declared an undesirable alien , entailing the imposition of an exclusion order , on the ground , inter alia , that he or she poses a danger to national security . An alien on whom an exclusion order has been imposed can not be lawfully resident in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . An exclusion order may be revoked , upon request , if the alien concerned has been residing outside the GPE for a period of DATE ( section DATE of LAW ) . Such revocation entitles the alien to seek readmission to GPE territory subject to the conditions that are applicable to every alien ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
