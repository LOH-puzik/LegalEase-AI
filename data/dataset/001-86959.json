On DATE party members , including the applicant , came to ORG for a hearing concerning the refusal to register ORG . The applicant alleged that near the court building they had been attacked by a group of CARDINAL people and had had to defend themselves . According to the Government , the party members , including the applicant , had assaulted passers - by with gas guns and rubber truncheons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested . The arresting officer indicated in his report that the victims had identified the applicant as one of the perpetrators of the assault .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was charged with participation in mass disorders , involving the use of gas guns , assault and battery , an offence under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Tverskoy District Court of GPE remanded the applicant in custody . It referred to the gravity of the charge , \u201c his role in the imputed offence \u201d , his record of administrative offences and his frequent absences from his registered place of residence . It also found that his accomplices whose identity had not been established were at large . The court concluded from that that the applicant might abscond or reoffend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Tverskoy District Court extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court referred to the gravity of the charge , the possibility of his absconding or reoffending and the need for a further investigation . In particular , it was necessary to perform a psychiatric examination on a co - accused .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal submission the applicant complained that the court \u2019s conclusions were hypothetical and were not supported by relevant facts . The applicant had permanent residence in GPE , attended university and had positive references . There was no risk of his absconding or reoffending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the detention order on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , sufficiently reasoned and justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered a further extension of the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . At the hearing the applicant asked to be released on bail or under the personal guarantee of a member of ORG . However , the court did not examine the possibility of a more lenient preventive measure . The extension order read as follows :", "\u201c The court takes into account that [ the applicant ] has no criminal record , lives with his parents at his registered place of residence in GPE , is successfully pursuing studies at [ a university in GPE ] , and has positive references . However , as he is charged with a serious criminal offence punishable by DATE imprisonment , the court considers that he may abscond or interfere with the investigation if released . The preventive measure should accordingly be maintained . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the extension order on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Tverskoy District Court extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court found that the applicant might abscond or hamper the investigation as he had been charged with a serious criminal offence and had a record of administrative offences . In reply to the applicant \u2019s request to be released on bail or under the personal guarantee of a member of ORG , the court held that there was no reason to vary or cancel the preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He denied involvement in any criminal activity and alleged that the criminal proceedings against him were politically motivated and that he was being persecuted for his membership of ORG . Referring to LAW , he complained that his detention was based on the gravity of the charge against him and that the conclusions that he might flee or impede the investigation were hypothetical and were not supported by relevant facts . ORG had disregarded his arguments that he had positive references , that a member of ORG had vouched for his attendance and that he was ready to post bail . As to his record of administrative offences , administrative fines had been arbitrarily imposed on him for attendance at peaceful assemblies organised by ORG . The parties did not inform the ORG whether the appeal had been examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL defendants , including the applicant , were committed for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE scheduled the preliminary hearing for DATE and held that all the defendants should remain in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remitted the case for a further investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE for the same reasons as before . The court found that the positive references and the personal guarantee of a member of ORG produced by the applicant were insufficient to warrant release .

On DATE ORG upheld the extension order on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defendants were again committed for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a preliminary hearing and ordered that all the defendants should remain in custody . It found that the defendants had been charged with a serious offence committed by an organised group some members of which had not yet been identified , and concluded that they might abscond or intimidate the victims and witnesses . It further noted that the defendants\u2019 assurances that they had no intention of absconding were unconvincing and held that there was no reason to apply a more lenient preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant and his co - defendants lodged applications for release with ORG . On DATE ORG rejected their applications . It noted that the defendants\u2019 arguments had already been examined and rejected many times when extension orders had been issued . It found that the grounds for the GPE detention mentioned in the extension orders were still pertinent and it was still necessary to hold them in custody . The defendants had been charged with a serious criminal offence committed by an organised group , some members of which had not yet been identified . Given the gravity of the charges against them , they might abscond , reoffend or interfere with the establishment of the truth if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the defendants\u2019 detention until DATE . It found that the grounds for their detention mentioned in the previous extension orders were still pertinent and a risk remained of their absconding , reoffending or obstructing the justice . The court also noted that the defendants\u2019 arguments about the absence of corpus delicti in their actions and about the lack of evidence of their involvement in the commission of the imputed offence were without substance because , in extending the GPE detention , the court could not make any findings as to their guilt or innocence .", "CARDINAL .
