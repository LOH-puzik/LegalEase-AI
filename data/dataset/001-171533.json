NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the ORG by Mr U. Ate\u015f , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in connection with a police investigation into the alleged activities of a drug - trafficking operation , large quantities of heroin were seized in PERSON ( a suburb of GPE ) and a number of suspects were arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a police officer who had not been involved in that operation told his superior that certain police officers , including the applicant , had been offered money in exchange for leaving one of the suspects out of the investigation . He further alleged that some police officers in the unit had each received the sum of CARDINAL ( ORG ) from the applicant in return for their turning a blind eye . The police officer \u2019s superior prepared a report to that effect and initiated a disciplinary investigation concerning the allegations of bribery .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the findings of the investigation concerning those allegations , the investigators in charge of the disciplinary investigation lodged a complaint with a public prosecutor and asked for a criminal investigation to be instigated against those police officers , including the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , on DATE the applicant was charged with bribery . A criminal trial was opened in ORG .", "CARDINAL . After hearing witnesses and assessing the evidence before it , ORG held that the accusations concerning the applicant and the co - accused did not go beyond hearsay and that there was nothing in the case file that proved the accused ORG guilt . It therefore acquitted the applicant and his co - accused of bribery on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of the findings of the disciplinary investigation , CARDINAL sanctions were imposed on the applicant which deferred his advancement to a higher rank for DATE and of DATE respectively . The relevant parts of the decision read :", "\u201c Notwithstanding the fact that the charges against the accused police officers were not proved and that they have consequently been acquitted in the criminal proceedings and that the legal constituents of the crime of bribery were lacking , under section CARDINAL of LAW Act the opening of criminal proceedings against a civil servant can not delay disciplinary proceedings , which can be conducted in parallel with such proceedings . Furthermore , exoneration of criminal liability does not prevent the imposition of disciplinary sanctions . In the light of the foregoing , bearing in mind the fact that the report in question was signed by the supervising police officer and CARDINAL senior officers and that the statement of ORG confirming the veracity of certain aspects of the allegations and the statement of [ police officer ] ORG confirming the statement of the latter ... [ the disciplinary board ] considers that the applicant \u2019s conduct constituted the disciplinary offence in question . Notwithstanding the fact that the misconduct in question can not be characterised as criminal , it was still inappropriate and was of such a nature as to diminish the respect and the trust associated with the functions of a police officer ...

The Office of the GPE Governor lodged an appeal with ORG against the decision of ORG ; the appeal was dismissed and the decision of DATE was upheld and became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant underwent an appraisal of his work . The appraisal was carried out by his immediate superior and signed by a senior police chief . He was given an unsatisfactory score of CARDINAL out of CARDINAL and received a disciplinary warning to this effect on DATE . The warning briefly stated that the applicant \u2019s appraisal score was unsatisfactory and that unless he improved his score he could be subject to the relevant provisions of the Regulation on ORG ( PERSON Memurlar\u0131 Sicil Y\u00f6netmeli\u011fi ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , the applicant instituted administrative proceedings before ORG , requesting the court to stay and to set aside the appraisal decision of DATE . He argued that his superiors had only taken into account the allegations of bribery against him in connection with the narcotics operation carried out in DATE and had failed to respect his right to the presumption of innocence given that the criminal proceedings concerning the same allegations were still pending . In that respect , he submitted that his appraisal had been biased . He further submitted that , owing to the fact that his appraisal had been poor , he had been transferred to a remote city and was therefore prevented from continuing his master \u2019s studies at ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . During the course of the proceedings the applicant submitted to ORG the judgment of DATE acquitting him of the charges of bribery .", "CARDINAL .

On the other hand , all acts of the ORG are subject to judicial review ... As a safeguard against arbitrariness , appraisal reports need to contain reasons for their conclusions ... On the basis of the examination of the case file , it is understood that the applicant was implicated in a disciplinary investigation involving allegations of bribery . Following the disciplinary investigation he received CARDINAL deferments of advancement to a higher rank of durations of DATE and DATE , respectively . Due to the fact that the applicant had received disciplinary sanctions , his appraisal report indicated that the applicant had demonstrated a tendency to put his own interests first [ tavassuta d\u00fc\u015fk\u00fcnl\u00fck ] .", "Therefore , the court finds it established that the ... disciplinary misconduct attributed to the applicant was proved during the course of the disciplinary investigation and that the poor appraisal based on the perception of his tendency to put his own interests first is not incompatible with the law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG , reiterating the arguments he had raised before ORG and further submitting that ORG had found a very similar appraisal report to be incompatible with the law in the case of a colleague who had also been subject to the same disciplinary proceedings concerning the narcotics operation of DATE . In the context of those other proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s colleague , ORG , acting as the court of first - instance , had held on DATE that :", "\u201c The appraisal system is the legal basis on which a civil servant receives a promotion , demotion or salary increase , or obtains a transfer to a different city or to a different function ...
