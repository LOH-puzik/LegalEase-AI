The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a practising lawyer by profession . He runs his law office with a partner .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE criminal proceedings on suspicion of aggravated theft , aggravated fraud and embezzlement were opened against the applicant and a number of other persons by ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge issued a search warrant for the applicant \u2019s premises . The warrant authorised the search and seizure of the following items :", "\u201c Documents , personal computers and discs , savings books , bank documents , deeds of gift and wills in favour of Dr PERSON , and any files concerning NORP [ name of CARDINAL person ] and PERSON [ name of another person ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , the search warrant stated that the applicant was suspected firstly of having taken furniture , pictures and silver worth MONEY ( ORG ) from PERSON in DATE for personal enrichment ; secondly , of having induced PERSON to sign an agreement for a secured loan of LAW in DATE , which PERSON then failed to receive ; and thirdly , of having abused the power of attorney granted to him by PERSON in order to make bank transfers , causing the latter financial damage of more than LAW in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The search of the applicant \u2019s business LOC was carried out by police officers of ORG on DATE . The applicant , his defence counsel and a representative of ORG were present . The police officers proceeded to search the applicant \u2019s computer system , copying all files to disc . The representative of ORG opposed this as being disproportionate since it was technically possible , by using appropriate search criteria , to search for and copy only those files which corresponded to the criteria set out in the search warrant . Having contacted the investigating judge , the police officers insisted on copying all files . On the proposal of the representative of ORG , the police officers copied all data returned by a search for the names \u201c NORP \u201d and \u201c PERSON \u201d to CARDINAL disc and all other data to separate discs . All the discs were sealed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report drawn up by the police officers lists the following seized items : ( CARDINAL ) laptop , ( CARDINAL ) CDs / DVDs of ORG data , ( CARDINAL ) CDs / DVDs of all NORP law office data , and ( CARDINAL ) copies of agendas .", "CARDINAL . All these items were handed over to the investigating judge . Because the applicant opposed the search of the data , ORG ( Ratskammer ) , a panel of CARDINAL judges , of ORG was called upon to decide whether they were to be examined or returned pursuant to LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG authorised the examination of all the files . It repeated that there were grounds for suspecting the applicant of the offences described in the search warrant and noted that the data in issue had been seized in the context of the preliminary investigations in respect of the applicant and other persons . A lawyer could not rely on his duty of professional secrecy and the attendant guarantees of LAW when he himself was the suspect . In sum , the examination of the seized files was necessary in order to investigate the offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG contacted the Procurator General , suggesting that he lodge a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes ) in the applicant \u2019s case . It submitted , in particular , that a search of a lawyer \u2019s business premises risked impinging on his duty of professional secrecy .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the investigating judge had to give reasons when issuing a search warrant and to describe as clearly as possible which items were to be searched for and seized . In the applicant \u2019s case it was open to doubt whether the search warrant had accurately described which items could be seized . Generally , only a search for particular files likely to be related to the offence in issue could be authorised . The same applied to searches of electronic data . A practising lawyer was obliged by law to have at his disposal a computer system fulfilling certain standards in order to communicate electronically with the courts . In fact , most lawyers also had all their files in electronic form . Standard software for law offices allowed full - text searches for any name or word and thus made it easy to narrow the search of data . In the present case such a search had returned results and thus the search warrant did not extend to the seizure of all of the law office \u2019s data .", "CARDINAL . For these reasons , ORG argued that the seizure of all the data and ORG decision to permit the examination thereof had been excessive and therefore unlawful . ORG had failed to give any specific reasons why an examination of the data relating to PERSON and PERSON would not be sufficient . The applicant \u2019s duty of professional secrecy could only be lifted in relation to the suspicion against him concerning CARDINAL of his clients but not in respect of all his lawyer - client relationships . Moreover , the partner in his law office was not under any suspicion .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the Procurator General informed ORG that he had not found any reason to lodge a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of embezzlement but acquitted him of the other charges . The court sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , CARDINAL of which were suspended on probation . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s and the public prosecutor \u2019s pleas of nullity and on DATE ORG upheld the sentence . Subsequently , the applicant obtained evidence which had not been available to him at the time of the trial . He requested a reopening of the proceedings , which was granted and led to the applicant \u2019s acquittal by ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the version in force at the material time concerned the search of LOC and persons and the seizure of objects .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided , in particular , that a search may be carried out only if there is reasonable suspicion that a person suspected of having committed an offence is hiding on the LOC concerned , or that there are objects on the LOC the possession or examination of which is relevant to a particular criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , a search should , in general , be carried out only after the person concerned has been questioned , and only if the person sought has not come forward of his or her own volition or the object or objects sought have not been voluntarily produced and if the reasons warranting the search were not eliminated during the questioning . No such questioning is required where delay would be detrimental .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL stated that a search may , as a rule , only be carried out on the basis of a reasoned search warrant issued by a judge .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the occupant of the LOC subject to the search or , if he is unavailable , a relative of the occupant , must be present during the search . A report is to be drawn up and signed by all those present .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided that , if objects relevant to the investigation or subject to forfeiture or confiscation are found , they are to be listed and taken to the court for safe keeping or seized . It referred in this respect to LAW , pursuant to which objects in safe keeping must be put into an envelope to be sealed by the court , or have a label attached so as to avoid any substitution or confusion .", "Article CARDINAL read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . When searching through documents , steps must be taken to ensure that their content does not become known to unauthorised persons .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the owner of the documents does not want to permit their being searched , they shall be sealed and deposited with the court ; ORG must determine immediately whether they are to be examined or returned . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG case - law , which is endorsed by the opinion of academic writers ( see ORG , PERSON , CARDINALth edition ) , the provisions relevant to the search and seizure of paper documents also apply mutatis mutandis to the search and seizure of electronic data . If the owner of discs or hard drives on which data are stored objects to their being searched , the data storage devices are to be sealed and ORG must decide whether they may be examined .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW regulates the professional duties of lawyers including , inter alia , the duty to maintain professional secrecy .", "CARDINAL .

It is established case - law that documents which contain information subject to professional secrecy may not be seized and used in a criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to an instruction ( Erla\u00df ) of the Federal Minister of ORG of DATE , a representative of the competent ORG shall be present during the search of a lawyer \u2019s office in order to ensure that the search does not encroach on professional secrecy ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
