On DATE , early in the morning , the applicant was arrested at his home under LAW of the Prevention of Terrorism Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) in connection with an attempted bomb attack on military personnel . The applicant was taken to GPE police station . He claims that on arrival he immediately requested to see his solicitor . Access was delayed pursuant to section CARDINAL of LOC ( Emergency Provisions ) Act DATE ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) . At TIME the applicant was examined by a doctor who advised him that if he had any complaints to make he should tell the doctor when he made his round TIME . The applicant was cautioned pursuant to LAW Order DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Unfamiliar with this new law , the applicant again requested a consultation with a lawyer and this request was refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was interviewed CARDINAL times by CARDINAL teams of CARDINAL detectives . These interviews took place TIME , TIME , TIME , TIME and TIME , and TIME .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , the applicant complained to the same doctor he had seen DATE before of ill - treatment during the second and third interviews on DATE . The doctor recorded in his notes that the applicant had alleged that he had been repeatedly slapped and occasionally punched in the back of the head during the second and third interviews and that he had been punched a few times in the stomach . The doctor gave the applicant CARDINAL tablets ( a mild analgesic ) and prescribed CARDINAL such tablets a day if required . Pursuant to this complaint , at TIME a police inspector visited the applicant 's cell and took note of the applicant 's complaints .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant 's sixth , seventh and eighth interviews took place TIME , TIME , and TIME and TIME . During the sixth interview the applicant broke his silence and gave detailed answers to a number of questions admitting to his involvement in the assembly and planting of the bomb . During the seventh interview the applicant signed a lengthy statement which described in considerable detail his part in the conspiracy to plant and detonate the bomb .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , the applicant was visited by the same doctor who asked the applicant if he had any further allegations of ill - treatment and the applicant replied that he had not . The applicant was then interviewed about another matter between TIME At TIME the applicant was allowed to consult with his solicitor , who made notes on the applicant 's allegations of ill - treatment . The solicitor chose not to pass these complaints on to the police . The applicant was then interviewed for the last time TIME about an unrelated matter . The applicant was medically examined that TIME at TIME by another doctor whose notes indicated that the applicant had made \u201c no allegations of ill - treatment since he had been last seen by a doctor \u201d . That doctor also noted that there was no sign of injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken to another police station where he was given a medical examination by another doctor . That doctor 's note records the applicant 's detailed allegations of assaults and ill - treatment which allegedly took place on DATE . No objective evidence of injury was noted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , along with others , was charged at ORG with conspiracy to cause explosions , possession of explosives with intent , conspiracy to murder and membership of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through his solicitor , made an official written statement to the Complaints and Discipline Branch of ORG complaining about his ill - treatment by one team of CARDINAL detectives while at GPE police station .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial of the applicant and his co - accused began at ORG before a single judge sitting without a jury . The applicant pleaded not guilty . The prosecution case was based on the admissions made by the applicant in interview and , in particular , the written statements signed by him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the prosecution were about to lead evidence based on the applicant 's admissions and statement made during questioning , the applicant applied under section CARDINAL of GPE ( Emergency LAW DATE ( as amended ) to have the admissions and statement made during questioning excluded on the basis of his alleged ill - treatment . A voir dire ( submissions on a point of law in the absence of the jury ) began and the applicant gave evidence as to his treatment , particularly by CARDINAL team of CARDINAL detectives during interviews nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL while in GPE police station . ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) evidence was also led which the applicant submitted demonstrated glaring defects in the authentication of the interview notes which recorded his responses to the detectives ' questions . All the relevant witnesses , including the applicant , the police officers alleged to have been involved in the ill - treatment and the doctors who had seen the applicant , gave evidence . The voir dire ended on DATE when the trial judge rejected the application , admitted the applicant 's admissions and statement into evidence and adjourned his detailed judgment in these respects .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not subsequently give evidence at the trial . However , the trial judge cautioned the applicant , pursuant to LAW , as regards adverse inferences which could be drawn from this failure to give evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial judge gave judgment .", "CARDINAL . He first outlined his detailed reasoning behind his decision further to the voir dire . He noted that the only evidence against the applicant was the admissions and statement made while in custody at GPE police station and that there was no forensic evidence against him . However , it was also noted that the applicant 's admissions and statement were entirely consistent with the evidence presented in relation to others charged ( and later convicted ) with offences arising out of the same incident . The trial judge summarised the applicant 's evidence of ill - treatment and this summary was later accepted on appeal by the applicant as constituting an accurate account of his evidence in this respect .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge then commented on that evidence . He noted , inter alia , that the applicant did not mention the names of or attempt to describe the CARDINAL detectives in respect of whom he complained to the doctor on TIME of CARDINAL DATE ; that the applicant had not mentioned to the doctor on TIME the \u201c cigarette treatment \u201d , which the applicant had submitted during the voir dire was the treatment which frightened him most ; that there were inconsistencies in the accounts of ill - treatment given by the applicant to the doctor on TIME and his evidence at trial ; that not CARDINAL single objective sign of the ill - treatment which the applicant alleged was found by any of the doctors who examined the applicant ; and that on TIME of DATE , the applicant did not make any complaint about ill - treatment despite the fact that he claimed he had suffered the worst treatment of all during DATE .", "CARDINAL . Although there had been a period when the monitoring screens ( which relayed pictures from cameras in the interview rooms to a central control room ) had not been monitored by the duty inspector on that DATE TIME , the trial judge found that this did not coincide with the applicant 's evidence as to when he was ill - treated on DATE and the trial judge found it impossible to accept that ill - treatment of the nature alleged by the applicant could have gone on without it being picked up by the cameras in the room where the applicant was questioned . On the question of general credibility the judge found that the applicant had repeatedly lied to the court , whereas the detectives involved were not at all shaken by a rigorous cross - examination in their firm denials of the allegations made by the applicant . As to the ORG evidence , the trial judge found that it did not substantiate the applicant 's submission as to the lack of authenticity of the interview notes .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the trial judge rejected the applicant 's allegations of ill - treatment and found that there was no reason to exclude the applicant 's admissions or statement made during his detention in GPE police station . As to the probative value of the applicant 's statement , the trial judge found that it was sufficiently detailed to establish the several charges against the applicant and that he was fully entitled to convict the applicant on that basis . On DATE the applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's appeal against conviction , challenging the trial judge 's conclusions as to the allegations of ill - treatment and as to the ORG evidence , was heard by ORG of GPE . That court noted that in such cases the question to be answered is whether the court is satisfied that it is not a reasonable possibility that the accused was ill - treated . It noted , inter alia , that the trial judge had had the great advantage of seeing the applicant give evidence , that both an accused and the police officers involved can equally have an incentive to lie and that many facts are capable of being looked at in CARDINAL or more ways , but they must be considered sensibly and realistically . Having reviewed the applicant 's evidence and the trial judge 's conclusions in that respect , that court concluded that it was satisfied that the applicant had not been ill - treated and that his conviction was neither unsafe nor unsatisfactory . Accordingly , on DATE the applicant 's appeal was rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's appeal against his sentence was rejected .", "CARDINAL .

The relevant provisions at the time of the applicant 's trial governing the right of access to legal advice were contained in section CARDINAL of GPE ( Emergency Provisions ) Act DATE , of which the relevant parts provided :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A person who is detained under the terrorism provisions and is being held in police custody shall be entitled , if he so requests , to consult a solicitor privately .", "( CARDINAL ) A person shall be informed of the right conferred on him by subsection ( CARDINAL ) as soon as practicable after he has become a person to whom the subsection applies .", "( CARDINAL ) A request made by a person under subsection ( CARDINAL ) , and the time at which it is made , shall be recorded in writing unless it is made by him while at a court and being charged with an offence .", "( CARDINAL ) If a person makes such a request , he must be permitted to consult a solicitor as soon as practicable except to the extent that any delay is permitted by the section .", "...", "( CARDINAL) An officer may only authorise a delay in complying with a request under subsection ( CARDINAL ) where he has reasonable grounds for believing that the exercise of the right conferred by that subsection at the time when the detained person desires to exercise it -", "...", "( d ) will lead to interference with the gathering of information about the commission , preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism ; or", "( e ) by alerting any person , will make it more difficult -", "( i ) to prevent any act of terrorism ; or", "( ii ) to secure the apprehension , prosecution or conviction of any person in connection with the commission , preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The delay had to be authorised by a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) ) and the detained person had to be told the reason for the delay ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) ) . The courts in GPE have taken the view that the DATE Order should not be read subject to section CARDINAL of GPE , since the CARDINAL Order had come into force after LAW , and ORG had not intended that an inference which was permitted by LAW could not be drawn because of the withholding of the right of access to legal advice given by LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c CPT \u201d ) , following a visit to places of detention in GPE in DATE , made the following conclusions on ORG in its published report .", "\u201c ORG was located in a motley collection of prefabricated buildings , within the perimeter of FAC . The Centre gave the general impression of being in need of some repair .", "CARDINAL . The ORG had CARDINAL cells , CARDINAL of which were located in a distinct section for women detainees . In addition , there were CARDINAL interview rooms , CARDINAL rooms for consultations with lawyers , a doctor 's surgery , and a scenes of crime unit ( the so - called ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The cells measured CARDINAL and were equipped with a metal frame bed ( with mattress and blankets ) and a chair . Artificial light was adequate and there was an effective dimmer system , controlled from outside the cell . However , the cells did not benefit from natural light . Further , the ventilation system appeared to function only moderately well and created a rather intrusive level of noise in certain cells . The cells were not fitted with a call system ; however , uniformed officers were apparently always on duty in the cell block when persons were being detained . Toilet and shower facilities were located nearby and were in a satisfactory state of cleanliness at the time of the visit ; no complaints were heard from detainees about access to those facilities .", "CARDINAL . The interview rooms were divided CARDINAL set of CARDINAL , located adjacent to the cells , and another set of CARDINAL in a separate building . The interview rooms adjacent to the cells measured CARDINAL and were equipped with a table , CARDINAL chairs , and CARDINAL wall - mounted cameras ... Like the cells , they did not benefit from natural light . The second set of CARDINAL interview rooms were equipped in a similar manner ; however , they were considerably larger and did benefit from natural light .", "CARDINAL . On examining the main cell / interview room block from outside , it could be seen that the windows had been covered with plyboard , apart from CARDINAL section of each , which had been fitted with a cowl , allowing some fresh air , but no natural light , to enter the cells and rooms . Questioned about the design of these window coverings , the officer in charge stated that they had been installed for ' security reasons ' .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has already expressed the view that police cells should preferably enjoy natural light . This is even more desirable when , as at GPE , persons may be held in custody for an extended period . Further , the absence of natural light in the cells is all the more regrettable given that the majority of the interview rooms at GPE also lacked natural light . Taking into account , in addition , the absence of exercise facilities ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL ) , the net result was that a person detained at GPE could effectively be deprived of natural light for DATE or more ( the only exception being time spent in consultation with his lawyer ) .", "In the ORG 's view such a situation is not acceptable . The ORG would add that it is confident that means could be found of providing access to natural light to detainees without compromising legitimate security needs .", "CARDINAL . The delegation was told by police officers that there were no facilities for DATE either outdoor or indoor DATE for persons detained at GPE . This is another serious shortcoming in an establishment in which persons can be held for DATE .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , the existing material conditions of detention at ORG render it inappropriate as a place in which to detain persons for extended periods . The deficiencies as regards access to natural light for detainees and the absence of exercise facilities were the principal failings , but the mediocre ventilation system and the cramped and rather dilapidated nature of the facilities should also be mentioned . All these factors contributed to create a distinctly claustrophobic atmosphere .", "The ORG recommends that the conditions of detention at ORG be substantially improved without delay , taking into account the above remarks . If such an improvement were not to prove possible , ORG should be relocated elsewhere , in premises capable of offering better detention facilities .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... Even in the absence of overt acts of ill - treatment , there is no doubt that a stay in a holding centre may be DATE and is perhaps designed to be DATE a most disagreeable experience . The material conditions of detention are poor ( especially at GPE ) and important qualifications are , or at least can be , placed upon certain fundamental rights of persons detained by the police ( in particular , the possibilities for contact with the outside world are severely limited throughout the whole period of detention and various restrictions can be placed on the right of access to a lawyer ) . To this must be added the intensive and potentially prolonged character of the interrogation process . The cumulative effect of these factors is to place persons detained at the holding centres under a considerable degree of psychological pressure . The ORG must state , in this connection , that to impose upon a detainee such a degree of pressure as to break his will would amount , in its opinion , to inhuman treatment . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
