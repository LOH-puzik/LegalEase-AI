The new managing director had been informed about the alleged offence DATE . On DATE the disciplinary board terminated ORG \u2019s employment on the grounds that she had seriously breached her employment obligations . An appeal lodged by ORG against that decision was dismissed . On DATE ORG brought a claim before ORG , requesting that the termination of her employment be declared null and void . She alleged , inter alia , that the disciplinary proceedings against her were time - barred .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s request . Having considered that the applicant company \u2019s former managing director had not had sufficient knowledge of the acts constituting the disciplinary offence , ORG concluded that the DATE time - limit for the institution of disciplinary proceedings had started to run from the date on which ORG \u2019s disciplinary offences had been discovered by the new management of the applicant company . The court therefore held that disciplinary proceedings had not been time - barred . ORG appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Higher Labour and ORG , sitting in a panel of CARDINAL judges , which included judge PERSON , upheld ORG \u2019s appeal and ordered the applicant company to reinstate her . Relying on a statement made by the applicant company \u2019s former managing director , it concluded that he had had sufficient knowledge of ORG \u2019s actions to be able to institute disciplinary proceedings against her if he had considered that to be necessary . Accordingly , the higher court held that the disciplinary proceedings against ORG had in fact been time - barred . The applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant company \u2019s appeal on points of law , as the higher court had established the facts differently from the first - instance court without having conducted an oral hearing . ORG therefore found that the adversarial principle had been breached in the appeal proceedings and set aside the second - instance judgment . The case was remitted to ORG for fresh consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in a panel presided by judge PERSON , held that the facts which had affected the expiry of the statutory limitation period for commencing disciplinary proceedings had not been duly established , and remitted the case to the first - instance court for fresh consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rendered an interim judgment , finding again that the disciplinary proceedings had not been time - barred and thus dismissing ORG \u2019s request for annulment of the decision to terminate her employment .

On DATE the Higher ORG again established quite the opposite , namely that the disciplinary proceedings had been time - barred , and upheld ORG \u2019s appeal . Judge PERSON did not take part in the proceedings . The applicant company appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again upheld the applicant company \u2019s appeal on the grounds that the adversarial principle had been breached in the appeal proceedings . The case was remitted for fresh consideration to ORG , sitting in a panel composed of different judges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Higher Labour and ORG found that the facts of the case had still not been sufficiently established , and remitted the case to the first - instance court for fresh consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found , in its third consideration of the case , that the disciplinary proceedings had been time - barred , as the former managing director had been fully informed about ORG \u2019s actions that had constituted the disciplinary offence . Accordingly , the court granted ORG claim and declared the termination of her employment null and void . The decision on her compensation claim against the applicant company was postponed . Both parties appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Higher ORG upheld the appeal lodged by ORG and dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal in which it contended , inter alia , that the statements made by the former managing director of the applicant company in the later stages of the proceedings had conflicted with his earlier accounts of the facts and had obviously been made in order to exculpate ORG , with whom he had close personal ties .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal and reaffirmed the judgment of the lower courts that the disciplinary proceedings had been time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company , represented by a lawyer , lodged a constitutional appeal alleging , inter alia , that in the determination of whether disciplinary proceedings against ORG had been time - barred , the principle of equality of arms had been breached . In addition , the applicant company contended that the labour courts\u2019 position regarding the limitation period for commencing disciplinary proceedings in the particular circumstances at issue had contravened its free economic initiative enshrined in the LAW . It argued that if the former managing director had known about ORG \u2019s actions , that in itself had constituted a disciplinary offence and should not have been interpreted in her favour . On CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant company that its constitutional appeal had been assigned to judge rapporteur PERSON", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG decided on ORG \u2019s claim for compensation for the unlawful termination of her employment . It ordered the applicant company to pay ORG compensation for lost wages and various benefits for the period when she had not been employed or had been paid a lower salary by other employers .
