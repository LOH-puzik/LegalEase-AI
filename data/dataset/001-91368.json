According to the applicant , at TIME on DATE he was arrested on suspicion of incitement to murder and taken to LOC , where he was severely ill - treated by some QUANTITY police officers until he confessed to the offence on CARDINAL DATE . In particular , he alleged that the police officers had handcuffed and kicked him and fractured his ankle with a crowbar . He had lost consciousness and , on coming round , had found himself suspended from a crowbar with his hands locked under his knees . After he had signed the confession , the officers had contacted his wife and requested her to bring fresh clothes and a coat , on which he was then carried down to a police cell . Afraid that the staff of ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) would not admit the applicant on account of his injuries , the officers left him in a cell at the police station , unable to walk and without even the most basic care .", "CARDINAL .

The ambulance paramedic found that the applicant had suffered a severe chest contusion and arranged for his admission to ORG , where he was treated until DATE .

On DATE the Vatutinsky District ORG rejected a request by the applicant to initiate criminal proceedings against the police officers on account of his alleged ill - treatment , as it found his complaint unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case - file concerning the murder charges was sent with the bill of indictment to ORG for examination on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held the first hearing .", "CARDINAL . DATE the court held some QUANTITY hearings . At the trial all the defendants retracted their initial confessions . CARDINAL witnesses also complained that they had been ill - treated by the police , who had incited them to give evidence against the defendants , who were friends of theirs . The applicant further alleged that the police officers had drafted a confession which they had forced him to sign .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the defendants guilty as charged and sentenced the applicant to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment . It rejected the GPE allegations of ill - treatment , primarily on the strength of the testimony of QUANTITY police officers who had denied the allegations while admitting that force had been used to arrest the defendants . The court further referred to the ORG office \u2019s decision of DATE , dismissing the applicant \u2019s request to institute criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a new request with the ORG office for a criminal investigation into his alleged ill - treatment . This was rejected on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following complaints by the defendants and several witnesses involved in the proceedings of ill - treatment , the Deputy Head of ORG , NORP , sent a letter to the Prosecutor General requesting a criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of DATE the Deputy ORG requested ORG to include his letter in the case - file and informed NORP that no investigation had been possible at the material time , as the case had been pending before the judicial authorities , which prevented the prosecution from having access to the relevant materials annexed to the case - file .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case for additional pre - trial investigations . It found it peculiar that the applicant \u2019s confession was dated CARDINAL DATE , while the official record stated that he had first been questioned and arrested on DATE . Further , it noted that the trial court should have ordered a medical report on the applicant in order to obtain objective information concerning his injuries and an assessment by a handwriting expert to verify his allegation that his confession had not been drafted by him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigators decided to resume the criminal proceedings against the applicant , ORG and ORG on suspicion of arson in connection with the torching of ORG \u2019s car in DATE . Subsequently , the applicant was formally charged with arson .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal cases concerning both the arson and murder charges were joined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the medical records of the applicant \u2019s injuries were assessed by a medical expert , who confirmed that in DATE the applicant had suffered a haematoma to his right ankle joint .

On DATE the police instituted criminal proceedings against ORG , the applicant \u2019s wife on the grounds that , while working as a nurse , she had forged , in particular , a certificate that purported to have been issued by the Vatutinsky District PERSON on DATE .

It noted , in particular , that the applicant had been arrested on DATE and that , as the arresting officers had been aware that the applicant , a former sportsman , was well - built , might have been armed and was implicated in a serious offence , they had had to use force to arrest him . In doing so , they had tripped him up , thrown him against the bonnet of a car , and handcuffed him . ORG considered that this was what had caused the applicant to suffer the haematoma . As regards the other injuries noted in the applicant \u2019s medical records , they had not been confirmed by the recent medical expert report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found it probable that the applicant \u2019s confession had been dictated by a professional , skilled in the preparation of procedural documents , to an individual , who had written the text under stress , possibly on account of physical pain . No assessment was carried out to determine whether the statement had been written by the applicant \u2019s hand .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the criminal case concerning the murder and arson charges was sent to ORG ( the former ORG ) for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court decided that further pre - trial investigations were necessary . It found , inter alia , that the investigation had not fully complied with ORG instructions . In particular , it had not been established why the applicant \u2019s confession had been dated DATE , while no other procedural documents had been executed on that date ; nor was there any indication as to where the applicant had been held between TIME and DATE and why he had arrived in the ORG only on DATE . The court further noted that the officers manning the LOC where the applicant had been kept before DATE should have been questioned about his state of health during that period . Finally , the investigation should have established whether it was likely that the applicant \u2019s injuries had been caused in the manner he had described .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG remitted the case for a pre - trial investigation in respect of the murder charges . It found , in particular , that the materials relating to the applicant \u2019s first interrogation , in which he had confessed to the murder , were inadmissible as evidence , as he had been questioned as a witness in the absence of a lawyer , whose presence was obligatory in view of the gravity of the alleged offence . Furthermore , the court referred to the failure of the investigation to establish the facts concerning the drafting of the applicant \u2019s confession and the other circumstances of his arrest and initial interrogation , including DATE . It noted , in particular , that the investigator had alleged that he had been unaware of the applicant \u2019s detention on DATE . According to him , the applicant had confessed on DATE . At the same time , several police officers had submitted that the investigative and prosecuting authorities had been fully aware of the applicant \u2019s arrest on CARDINAL DATE . The court also noted that the expert who had carried out the applicant \u2019s medical assessment had not made any findings concerning certain of his injuries , including the wrist injury and CARDINAL abscesses that had been noted in various medical records . Moreover , the assessment had not been carried out by a panel of experts as required , but by a single expert .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court found the applicant , ORG and GPE guilty of arson and sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision of DATE and judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigators ordered the applicant \u2019s medical assessment by a panel of experts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the diagnosis of the closed chest injury unfounded . They confirmed , however , that on CARDINAL DATE the applicant had had the following injuries : a haemorrhage of the left ankle and contusion of soft tissue on the left arm , which qualified as light bodily injuries , and a haemorrhage of the right ankle and a closed fracture of the right ankle , which qualified as bodily injuries of \u201c intermediate \u201d gravity . Based on the available documents it was not possible to establish the exact date of the infliction of these injuries , however , their infliction in the period between CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE was not improbable .", "CARDINAL .
