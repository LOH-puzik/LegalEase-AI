The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in PERSON . He is the father of the child PERSON , born out of wedlock on DATE . The applicant and the child \u2019s mother , PERSON , lived together at the time of the child \u2019s birth . They separated in DATE .", "ORG mother married in DATE and ORG family name was changed to her mother \u2019s new family name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided that the applicant should be entitled to visit his daughter . These visiting arrangements were confirmed in a court settlement between the parents in DATE . Under the terms of this settlement , the applicant was entitled to visit the child DATE . After some first visits , the applicant did no longer exercise his right of access to his daughter .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the child \u2019s mother applied with ORG for an amendment of the above settlement to the effect that the applicant should no longer be allowed access to his child . It was stated that the applicant had not exercised his right of access for DATE so that J. had completely forgotten him . His wish to see her again was not in J. \u2019s interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Jugendamt ) , having regard to a report by ORG , a NORP welfare organisation , recommended that the applicant should not be granted access to his child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that a medical report be prepared on the question of access . The report dated DATE recommended that contact between the applicant and J. be build up carefully and gradually , despite of the risk for J. \u2019s emotional balance . The established sound emotional ties between J. and her mother and the relationship of trust with the mother \u2019s partner should , however , not be upset .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a further report of CARDINAL DATE , ORG recommended that the applicant should meet PERSON in a child guidance centre ( ORG ) . If these contacts developed positively , they should be extended or , in the event of a negative experience , access should be stopped . ORG shared this assessment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG confirmed that , DATE and DATE , J. had met the applicant CARDINAL times in the centre in her mother \u2019s presence . It was stated that J. had sensed the conflicts between her parents and was under mounting emotional strain as a result .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard the applicant and PERSON \u2019s mother . In these and the following proceedings , both parties were represented by counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard the then DATE child in the absence of her parents . She stated that she had not recognised her natural father and that she did not want to see him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set aside its earlier decision of DATE and the court settlement of DATE .", "The court noted inter alia that the applicant had not exercised his right to visit his daughter since DATE and that ORG mother was opposed to the applicant \u2019s request . The court found that the applicant was not entitled to have access to his daughter .", "Referring to section DATE of LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) , the District court observed that the mother , in the exercise of her right to custody , determined the child \u2019s relations with third persons , and that therefore her will was decisive . The father could only be granted a right of access by court order if this was in the interest of the child . According to the court \u2019s findings , these conditions were not met in the applicant \u2019s case . The court considered that , as the parents separated when PERSON was only one and a half years old and as he did not exercise his right of access for DATE , he was a stranger in respect of the child . No bonds existed between her and the applicant and she did not regard him as her father .", "ORG further considered that the attempt to overcome this situation had failed . It noted that , in the course of several meetings between the applicant and his daughter at an educational assistance office in DATE and DATE , he had remained a stranger to J. who did not wish to have contacts with her father . In the court \u2019s view , it was not in ORG interest to act contrary to her wish . After several changes , her mother \u2019s new husband had become a person exercising parental functions ( m\u00e4nnliche PERSON ) . J. \u2019s stable position and emotions would be shaken if contacts with a stranger were forced . In this context , the court considered that PERSON was very sensitive and vulnerable and therefore needed stable living conditions and a family life free of conflict . Her physical and emotional well - being could be easily affected and she had difficulties in concentrating and learning . Her wish not to have any contacts with her father had , therefore , to be accepted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "ORG endorsed ORG findings under section CARDINAL of LAW . ORG further found that the applicant \u2019s appeal submissions did not disclose any new elements that were relevant . His argument that it had not been his fault that he had not been able to exercise his right of access since DATE was irrelevant , as the child \u2019s interests were decisive . His criticism of section DATE was irrelevant as this provision was the applicable legislation according to which granting access contrary to the mother \u2019s will was only possible in the interest of the child . However , in the applicant \u2019s case ORG , on the basis of an expert opinion , had correctly found that ORG wish not to have contacts with the applicant had to be accepted . Moreover , even assuming that PERSON was influenced by her mother , such influence could not justify to force her to have contacts with the applicant . In this respect , ORG again noted the expert \u2019s findings that PERSON was very sensitive and vulnerable and that any forced contacts would certainly harm her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s further complaint inadmissible , pursuant to section CARDINALa of LAW ( Gesetz \u00fcber die Angelegenheiten der freiwilligen PERSON ) . ORG considered that the prevailing legal situation , excluding a further appeal in proceedings concerning a father \u2019s access to his child born out of wedlock , could not be objected to from a constitutional point of view . Even if the criteria established in ORG decision of DATE on the necessity to abolish discrimination against children born out of wedlock were applied to procedural rules , the general standards as to the period left to the legislator for the purpose of amending the relevant legislation did not yet permit the conclusion that the existing legislation was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional complaint with ORG , complaining that the refusal of access to his daughter infringed his parental rights and amounted to discrimination , as well as about the refusal of his further appeal . ORG of the First Senate of ORG acknowledged receipt on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that it was dealing with a further case concerning section DATE of LAW which had already been submitted . A decision in that case was envisaged for DATE . The processing of the applicant \u2019s case was therefore postponed . On DATE , upon the applicant \u2019s inquiry , the Judge at ORG dealing with the applicant \u2019s case informed him that a decision on the other case was envisaged for DATE . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s representative was informed that the date of a decision upon his complaint could not be foreseen . The applicant was subsequently informed that , in the light of the legislative reforms , a decision on his constitutional complaint did no longer appear necessary and the applicant agreed to consider the complaint as settled .", "The applicant \u2019s renewed request for access to J. remained unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL .

Moreover , the parents must not do anything that would harm the child \u2019s relationship with the other parent or seriously interfere with the child \u2019s upbringing .

The family courts can , however , restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child \u2019s welfare . A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if otherwise the child \u2019s well - being would be endangered .
