She witnessed her parents being crushed by the aircraft , but did not sustain any physical injuries herself . Subsequently , she underwent psychological rehabilitation programmes intended to help her recover from her emotional trauma .", "CARDINAL . On various dates several concurrent investigations were opened to establish the circumstances of the accident , including investigation by a special ORG set up for this purpose , ORG , ORG , ORG , and PERSON , a non - governmental organisation founded by survivors of the accident and those who had lost relatives at the air show .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of GPE set up a special ORG for the investigation of the causes of the catastrophe of the military aircraft of ORG of GPE ; \u201c the ORG \u201d ) with a specific mandate to investigate the circumstances of the accident and coordinate assistance to its victims . The Commission was chaired by the President of ORG . Other members of the Commission included senior officials from ORG , Interior and ORG , officers of ORG of GPE , ORG of ORG , ORG , and ORG . ORG also engaged several experts from the \u201c LOC construction bureau ( the SU-CARDINAL aircraft manufacturer , GPE ) and CARDINAL test pilots from GPE as aviation experts .", "CARDINAL . Following the investigation , which included inspecting the accident site , interviewing individuals involved in the organisation of the air show and examining the relevant documents , as well as deciphering data from the flight data recorders , on an unspecified date in DATE ORG reported on the facts as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE Colonel - General MONEY ( ORG ) authorised the aerobatics show at the request of ORG ( the CARDINALth Corps Commander ) . ORG appointed a mixed team of officers from different units , including Colonel PERSON , from GPE , GPE as the first pilot ; Colonel GPE , of ORG , stationed in GPE , as the second pilot ; and Lieutenant - Colonel PERSON . , stationed in GPE , as the aerobatic performance director . Lieutenant - General PERSON and ORG PERSON , both stationed locally in GPE with ORG , were also designated to join the mission , one as \u201c air show flights director \u201d and the other as \u201c chief safety officer \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE , GPE and GPE . carried out their only training flight as a team . On the orders of ORG , the flight took place at a military aerodrome in GPE , near GPE . According to ORG , that flight could not qualify as a rehearsal for the performance at the air show , as it included a different sequence of manoeuvres ; its purpose was rather to improve and practise piloting techniques . The ORG also established that ORG had requested an additional training flight in GPE and that his request had been turned down by the command , citing a shortage of fuel . Although the air show preparation programme included an on - site rehearsal flight on DATE , the CARDINALth ORG Commander decided to cancel it for the same reason . The pilots were not formally apprised of the boundaries of the aerobatics zone or the placement of spectators .", "CARDINAL . Before the show , the pilots were provided with a different aircraft from the one in which they had carried out their training flight . There was a certain asynchronism in the performance of the right and left engines of this aircraft . Overall , however , it was in an acceptable technical condition and remained fully operational until it crashed . The aircraft had been supplied with extra fuel in order to enable the pilots to return to GPE without landing at the site of the air show . The fact that the pilots had trained in a different aircraft and with less fuel had a negative impact on their readiness for performing aerobatic displays . For unspecified reasons , the pilots decided to take off without the mandatory anti - gravitation suits ( \u201c g - suits \u201d ) . On arrival at the PERSON aerodrome , the pilots immediately started the performance , without taking any time to familiarise themselves with the site , which was new to them . During the performance , the aircraft exited the designated aerobatics zone , the boundary of which was QUANTITY from the spectators\u2019 area . Neither PERSON nor GPE . , directing the flight from the ground , warned them of that fact or directed them to return to the designated zone . Still outside of the zone , ORG decided to perform a certain aerobatic display ( called \u201c the trunk \u201d ) , which he had never practised before and which was not included in his mission order . He made a technical mistake in its performance and , as the second pilot did not intervene when appropriate , the pilots lost control of the aircraft and it started falling . Subsequent efforts by the crew to regain altitude were futile . Accordingly , ORG concluded that the principal cause of the accident was a technical mistake on the part of the first pilot in performing a manoeuvre which he had not been commissioned to perform . It also noted that the prompt and appropriate intervention of the second pilot could have saved the situation and that loss of life and damage to health could have been avoided had the ground crew properly guided the pilots to stay within the aerobatics zone .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted serious shortcomings in the organisation of the air show , including poor coordination between various officers and authorities involved in its preparation ; unsatisfactory crew training , and lack of appropriate emergency and spectator - safety planning , which contributed to the disaster . The Commission noted , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c The serious consequences of the aviation catastrophe ... were the result of irresponsibility , negligence , lack of discipline , official neglect and breach of applicable regulations ... on the part of many leading officers of ORG , in particular , the generals and officers of ORG .", "The tragedy was also the result of the absence of a system of effective supervision of the execution of orders ... by the respective air force officials DATE from its Commander - in - Chief to the members of the crew of the SU-CARDINAL . As a result , the generals and officers involved in the preparation and staging of [ the air show ] were not apprised of the real state of affairs concerning the necessary measures to be carried out , while the immediate participants in the aerobatic performance proved to be ill - prepared for it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Special Commission criticised , in particular , PERSON ( the ORG Commander - in - Chief ) and his colleagues from ORG responsible for the military training \u2013 Lieutenant - General PERSON and ORG for not having developed appropriate specific normative guidelines for the aerobatic performances . In the ORG \u2019s view , these were much needed given the lack of general regulations on the relevant matters . ORG also criticised PERSON and his colleagues for not having ensured a proper distribution of tasks between their subordinates engaged in the show and their direct supervision on behalf of ORG . In ORG opinion , such supervision was particularly important in view of the involvement in the show of officers from different military units that were not subordinate to each other and not accustomed to performing any tasks together . It also noted that Lieutenant - General S.O. ( the CARDINALth ORG Commander ) and his subordinates , in particular ORG and Colonel PERSON ( the CARDINALth ORG chief flight safety officer ) , had failed to put in place any meaningful land - and - air safety precautions plan . In addition , ORG regretted ORG \u2019s decision to cancel the on - site rehearsal flight and concluded that the officers designated to direct the flight as ground crew ( ORG and GPE . ) had had no relevant experience or clearance for such a mission .", "CARDINAL . ORG also reported on numerous procedural breaches on the part of the local administration and municipal authorities in authorising the air show . In particular , PERSON , deputy mayor of GPE with responsibility for humanitarian issues , had exceeded his authority in authorising it instead of the mayor himself . The mayor , having learned of the military authorities\u2019 initiative to organise the air show , took little action to coordinate the relevant preparatory activities . The show was authorised without the involvement of the competent officers and services legally responsible for carrying out assessments of the relevant safety risks and for taking the necessary prevention and response measures . The local authorities also failed to set up a necessary air show coordination committee and to organise a safety inspection of the aerodrome site before the show .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG produced a Report on the internal investigation , largely reiterating the findings of ORG . In particular , it concurred that the immediate cause of the accident was the first pilot \u2019s unforeseen misconduct , whose grave consequences could have been avoided or mitigated , were it not for the second pilot \u2019s and the ground crew \u2019s failure to intervene in good time . It also recognised that the organisation of the air show had been marked by significant shortcomings , including an unsatisfactory land and air safety precautions plan ; refusal to arrange CARDINAL training flight for the crew over the PERSON aerodrome ; and poor supervision by ORG and ORG of the preparatory activities . In addition , it was noted that the necessary regulatory framework was missing , and the organisers had drawn guidelines from the regulations on ordinary military training , which were not adapted for staging air shows for civilian spectators .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the conclusions of the investigation , on DATE the Minister of Defence issued order no . CARDINAL ( On the unsatisfactory organisation of the demonstration flight and the SU-CARDINAL aircraft disaster at the PERSON aerodrome ) , whereby a number of officers engaged in the organisation of the show were subjected to disciplinary sanctions . In particular , Lieutenant - General PERSON ( the CARDINALth Corps Commander ) was demoted ; Lieutenant - General O.V. , ( Deputy ORG Commander - in - Chief on military training ) was dismissed from the military \u201c for unsatisfactory performance of service duties in respect of the preparation for and supervision of the air show at the Sknyliv aerodrome , and for personal irresponsibility \u201d ; ORG was dismissed from the military \u201c for a negligent attitude to the performance of service duties and low personal executive discipline \u201d ; and CARDINAL other high - ranking ORG officers received warnings and were subjected to other sanctions . In addition , ORG , the ORG Commander - in - Chief , was also dismissed from the military service on disciplinary grounds , and the new ORG Commander - in - Chief was instructed to impose disciplinary sanctions on \u201c other officers guilty of breaches of duty during the preparation and staging of the air show \u201d . The issue of disciplinary responsibility for the pilots of the crashed aircraft and the ground crew which had operated their flight , was reserved pending a criminal investigation of the accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its report . It stated that numerous authorities shared , to various extents , common responsibility for the poor organisation of the show . It noted , in particular , that :", "\u201c DATE . ... in the course of the preparation and staging of the demonstration flights ... the military establishments , the specialised central ORG aviation facilities and departments , the municipal authorities and their particular officers failed to comply with a number of provisions of the current law , governing the procedure of preparation and staging the events of such a scale , which failures , to various extents , resulted in the catastrophe and such a major loss of human life ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Commission concluded that the local authorities had played an ancillary role in the organisation of the air show . However , they had acted negligently in authorising it in breach of formal procedures and without soliciting all relevant information from the military authorities . They had also failed to develop an appropriate emergency prevention and response plan for the air show . According to the ORG , the municipal authority had been completely disengaged from any safety - related decision - making and its overall performance had been marked by \u201c ... a certain confusion and lack of clear understanding by the higher officers of the scope of their responsibilities . \u201d In view of this , the ORG recommended that ORG evaluate the performance of the Mayor and other municipal officers and clarify its policy concerning the distribution of functions between them . It also invited the Mayor to impose disciplinary sanctions on his staff members who were at fault for breach of duty .", "CARDINAL . The Commission next concluded that the negligence of the city authority had not been a direct cause of the accident , and attributed the primary responsibility for it to the military authorities , having provided the following overall political assessment of the accident :", "\u201c [ the accident is ] ... a consequence of the generally irresponsible policy of ORG , which has neglected reformation of the ORG and the ORG , leading to a loss unprecedented for a civilised country ... of military efficiency and patriotic spirit , criminally negligent performance of their official duties by the military command at all levels , loss of pride in the military service and marginalisation of the material and technical procurement of the armed forces and military servicemen ...", "\u201c ... [ the accident ] ... demonstrated the inadequacy of the current legal framework , the inadequacy of the ORG control system in respect of flight safety ; irresponsible and negligent performance by officers at all levels of their duties under the law in force ; the need to establish civilian control over the activities of the army ; and the need to modernise and effectively reform the armed forces of GPE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Sknyliv Tragedy Lviv - based ORG founded by the relatives of the accident victims and its survivors published its own investigation report based on interviews and other information collected from public and private sources . In addition , the report featured an assessment of ORG piloting techniques by PERSON , a civil aviation pilot , who had lost family members at the PERSON air show .", "CARDINAL . Similarly to the reports produced by the governmental authorities , the authors of this report concluded that the immediate cause of the crash was error by the first pilot in performing a manoeuvre , which had been neither envisaged by his mission order nor practised by him before the show , while the second pilot and ground crew did not take the opportunity to intervene in respect of the first pilot \u2019s conduct . In addition to that , in the opinion of the authors of the report , ORG Commander - in - Chief and the CARDINALth ORG Commander , who had been watching the performance from the VIP lounge , had also failed to act to prevent the accident , as they had had direct radio connection with the ground crew and could have intervened at any moment .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding the aforementioned findings , in the opinion of the authours of the report , the accident had largely resulted from a structural problem . The responsibility for it had to be borne by numerous entities , including ORG , ORG , the authorities of the CARDINALth ORG , the GPE city and regional authorities , and the civil aviation authorities ( ORG and ORG ) , which had given permission for the aerobatic performance without checking its terms of reference .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the authors of the report considered that the GPE mission had been poorly developed and had not been properly communicated to all parties involved . The mission order approved on DATE by Lieutenant - General PERSON of ORG was at variance with the aircraft specifications . A subsequent explanatory document to the mission order approved by Colonel PERSON , the first pilot \u2019s direct supervisor , was inconsistent with these specifications and with the aforementioned mission order . None of these documents specified such important parameters of the mission as engine performance mode , attack angles and acceleration coefficient to be observed during particular manoeuvres . Marginal flight parameters , such as minimum speed and height and maximal attack angle , which had been developed by ORG officers , were unsuitable for the performance of most of the manoeuvres which formed part of the event programme .", "CARDINAL . The authors of the report also criticised ORG for designating too small an aerobatics zone , ( QUANTITY , when CARDINAL xCARDINAL,CARDINAL metres would have been required ) . They noted that it was technically impossible for the pilots to perform their programme within the boundaries of this zone and not to find themselves above the spectators\u2019 heads .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the report also attributed part of the responsibility for the accident to the local municipal and regional authorities , which had disengaged themselves from any safety - related and emergency - prevention planning as well as to the civil aviation authorities ( the NORP and ORG agencies ) for giving authorisations for the air space to be used in breach of the relevant procedural rules .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instituted criminal proceedings to investigate the circumstances of the accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was transferred for investigation to ORG and assigned to the Deputy Chairman of ORG of ORG for Military ORG . The team of some CARDINAL investigators and other officers from the military prosecutor \u2019s office dedicated to the case was supplemented by CARDINAL civilian investigative officers from ORG , department of the interior and ORG . The composition of the team was modified on several occasions , each time consisting of both military and civilian officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution commissioned an aviation expert assessment , which was carried out by a group of CARDINAL ORG officers in active service , a retired ORG flight safety specialist and a civilian aviation expert .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the group produced its report , in which it concurred with the earlier findings made by ORG and other entities concerning the principal causes of the accident . As regards the quality of the organisation of the show , the experts found that the GPE mission as such had not been incompatible with the SU-CARDINAL specifications , and that the size and location of the aerobatics zone had been acceptable . At the same time , in the experts\u2019 view , the organisational flaws had included , among others , a failure on the part of the superior officers to draw up comprehensive documents and guidelines in order for the crew to understand the scope of their mission , and to supervise more closely the execution of orders .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the civilian expert engaged in the above assessment issued a separate opinion in which he stated , inter alia , that in his view the aerobatics zone had been too small ; its location had been inherently dangerous and the GPE mission order had been incompatible with the SUCARDINAL specifications .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office solicited an opinion from CARDINAL other experts , both retired ORG officers , who at the material time had been on the staff of ORG scientific centre for combat application , to clarify the matters in dispute and other questions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation obtained a conclusion by these CARDINAL experts , in which they reported of numerous shortcomings in the air show organisation . In addition to the shortcomings pointed in the earlier ORG report , they concluded that the aerobatics zone was too small ; the boundaries of the zone were not clearly marked on site so as to be visible from the aircraft , which factor impaired the ORG ability to orient themselves ; the location of the aerobatics zone was potentially dangerous in case of any unforeseen situation ; the airfield \u2019s preparation for the show was carried out without any account being taken of the possibility of pilot error or any other emergency ; the crew did not receive a single mission order defining its mission according to all applicable standards ; various documents defining its flight parameters were not comprehensive and not fully consistent with each other ; the officers of the flight safety service failed to reveal the above shortcomings ; the pilots were allowed to take off without g - suits and their preparedness being checked by any competent authority ; the position of \u201c air show flights director \u201d assigned to ORG , which did not feature in any military training documents , appeared to be redundant ; it paralleled that of the ordinary aerodrome flights director , with a lack of clarity as to the distribution of authority between the CARDINAL officers ; neither ORG nor Colonel GPE . , who directed the flight , had the proper clearance , experience , and qualifications ; and there was no assessment of the quality of the first pilot \u2019s piloting technique during the training flight in GPE on DATE . In practice , the pilots\u2019 training was coordinated and supervised only by Colonel PERSON , stationed at the NORP aerodrome , who had neither the authority nor the qualifications to assess their preparedness . The experts also noted that , regard being had to the army hierarchy , it was for ORG Commander - in - Chief to issue an appropriate formal order clearly designating the officers responsible for the mission and determining their personal responsibilities , as well as to bear responsibility for their proper training , since the programme envisaged the involvement of crew members and the use of equipment from various military units .", "CARDINAL . According to the experts , these and other shortcomings constituted breaches of numerous provisions contained in the relevant regulatory framework , including special military aviation guidelines , in particular : Guidelines for execution of flights for ORG , enacted by order no .

Similarly to the findings contained in other reports , the experts concluded , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c ... CARDINAL of the reasons for the emergence of the ... incident ... was the existence of significant shortcomings in the ... preparation and staging of the ... air show and lack of clear distribution of duties between the officers ... which , in turn , led to lack of coordination between ... the persons engaged in the preparation , as well as to the absence of effective control over their activity . \u201d", "If the foregoing normative acts had been unconditionally complied with , the breaches in the organisation of the demonstration flight could have been detected and remedied , and the grave consequences avoided ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On an unspecified date in DATE S.O. , previously demoted from his post as CARDINALth ORG Commander , was appointed first deputy ORG Commander - in - Chief .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General disjoined the criminal proceedings against GPE , ORG and ORG and referred their case ( hereafter referred to as \u201c the ORG case \u201d ) for additional investigation . He found , in particular , that it was necessary to clarify whether there was a causal link between the omissions imputed to those officers and the aircraft crash .", "CARDINAL . For that purpose , on DATE CARDINAL civilian experts were commissioned to carry out an additional assessment . The CARDINAL defendants challenged that appointment , alleging that the experts concerned were not competent to evaluate their performance . PERSON proposed CARDINAL other candidates in their stead . The prosecutor \u2019s office dismissed the challenge to the civilian experts , but agreed to include CARDINAL of the candidates proposed by ORG in the group , having found that they were sufficiently independent . It rejected the other CARDINAL candidates , citing possible conflict of interest in view of their current or former employment with ORG . Subsequently , CARDINAL more retired military officers were included in the group , which finally consisted of CARDINAL civilian experts and CARDINAL retired military officers . CARDINAL of the military officers ( including the CARDINAL candidates proposed by ORG ) were serving at the material time in the faculty of ORG and the fifth expert was deputy director for flight safety at a military aircraft repair company belonging to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL military experts produced a report in which they concluded that all CARDINAL defendants had duly fulfilled their responsibilities in respect of the organisation of the air show and that none of them had breached any service duty or other applicable provisions . The group also concluded that the applicable legal framework governing the staging of military air shows and the organisation of aerobatic performances had been adequate and sufficient and that there had been no need for the defendants to develop any additional rules or guidelines before the air show . In the group \u2019s view , the misconduct by the first pilot was the sole cause of the accident . Their conclusion , insofar as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c The only reason for the crash of the SU-CARDINAL aircraft was the execution by the pilot of an unplanned piloting manoeuvre , in the course of which he committed grave errors in piloting technique , which caused the falling of the aircraft and the catastrophic consequences . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

During the trial , the defendants pleaded innocent of any wrongdoing . In particular , ORG noted that there had been no normative document defining the responsibilities of an \u201c air show flights director \u201d . Having been appointed to this position created by order of the CARDINALth ORG Commander , he had developed his own reference document listing his duties for the Commander \u2019s approval and had done his best in performing them . In his opinion , the appointment could not have made him responsible for direct supervision of the ORG training at a different airfield and ensuring their readiness , as neither of them had belonged to the CARDINALth ORG or been placed under his command . He considered that regard being had to their position in the military hierarchy , the pilots had to report directly to the ORG Commander - in - Chief .", "CARDINAL . Colonel PERSON of the CARDINALth Corps flight safety service likewise asserted that he had properly performed his service duties and had prepared sufficient documentation concerning flight safety during the air show . He had submitted the relevant documents for review by ORG as well as by the relevant sectors in ORG , and had not received any negative feedback . Colonel PERSON further admitted that he had never personally instructed the pilots on the safety measures and had never checked on their readiness for the flight . In his view , such responsibilities fell outside his authority and had to be carried out by the ORG direct superiors , who did not belong to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Lieutenant - Colonel PERSON . , the aerobatic performance director , asserted that , having been informed of the size and boundaries of the aerobatics zone on DATE , he had warned ORG and the pilots of his doubts concerning its safety . However , having been told that the relevant parameters had been approved by the higher command and it was too late to change anything , he had executed the orders of his superiors and directed the flight as best he could .", "CARDINAL . Colonel PERSON ( the first pilot ) alleged , in particular , that during the flight the aircraft had become uncontrollable due to forces beyond his control . He denied an accusation that he had deviated from his mission order , and submitted that in his view the way to perform the disputed manoeuvre was a matter for the pilot \u2019s discretion , particularly as his mission order had no specific instructions to this end . Moreover , prior to the flight , he had discussed the disputed manoeuvre with Colonel PERSON ( the second pilot ) , who he had considered to be the crew captain , as he was higher in the military hierarchy , and the latter had no objections to his choice . Colonel V.T. also noted that the documents defining his mission had not defined the boundaries of the aerobatics zone . He had been taken by surprise when he saw on arrival on site that the spectators were to the left of the runway , as according to his orders , his manoeuvres were also to be carried out to the left . In any event , he considered himself obliged to carry out his orders without arguing .", "CARDINAL . NORP Colonel GPE ( the second pilot ) submitted that he had considered the first pilot to be the crew captain and that he himself was obliged to refrain from interfering with his actions .

On DATE ORG , sitting in a panel of CARDINAL military judges and acting as a first - instance court , acquitted all CARDINAL defendants of the above charges , largely relying on the expert conclusions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . It found that the provisions of LAW ORG did not apply to ORG and GPE , as they had not operated the flight and had not been directly involved in its preparation . Other charges were dismissed as unsubstantiated . In particular , all the defendants were found to have carried out their service duties properly . The court noted that they had taken numerous measures to ensure proper organisation of the show and had produced a large volume of documents correctly delegating tasks to different officers . They had also reasonably trusted the pilots , the supporting crew and other officers to carry out the tasks assigned to them . No legal act could be interpreted as conferring on the defendants a different range of duties or imposing an obligation to act in a different manner . The relevant allegations of the prosecution , as well as the conclusions of ORG and the expert findings dated DATE in respect of the defendants were incorrect , being based partly on an overly broad interpretation of the applicable legal provisions and partly on references to provisions that were wrongly applied in the context . The court did not refer to the internal investigation of ORG in its judgment . The relevant excerpts of the court judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ... the members of the [ ORG ] concluded that the immediate cause of the catastrophe ... derived from mistakes in the piloting technique ... outside the designated aerobatics zone ... The same conclusion was adopted by the court , which examined the criminal case concerning [ V.T. ] and others . All other circumstances connected to the organisation of the show in the court \u2019s view did not in any way affect the wrongdoings by [ the first pilot ] and , moreover , they could not have been foreseen or taken into account by the organisers of the show ...", "... As far as the size of the aerobatics zone was concerned , which , according to the experts , was insufficient for the performance of the mission ... this breach was not the cause of the catastrophic situation , since the SU-CARDINAL aircraft was practically never within its boundaries ...", "Reports on the crew \u2019s readiness for the flight were produced properly , and it was following their receipt that [ V.S. ] as well as [ S.O. ] gave permission for the flight to go ahead ;", "The decision to hold the show was taken by the CARDINALth ORG Commander [ S.O. ] : this decision was coordinated by him with the ORG Commander - in - Chief [ V.S. ] , and they acted within the scope of their authority . With a view to preparation of the festivities and organisation of the flight by TIME ORG jointly with ORG took a number of relevant measures : orders were issued ; show plans were drafted ; agendas were put in place ; and air and static display schemes were developed ... The CARDINALth Corps Commander performed his duties with respect to the preparation of the show in accordance with the applicable law , having properly distributed duties among his subordinates ... Issues concerning preparation of the show and supervision over the performance of the delegated tasks were discussed at meetings organised by [ S.O. ] ...", "The court \u2019s conclusions ... are also not affected by the cancellation of the [ on - site ] ... rehearsal flight ... In the court \u2019s view , this fact did not affect the cause of the disaster , which was deviation by [ V.T. ] from his mission ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor \u2019s Office and numerous injured parties appealed against this verdict before ORG of ORG . In its appeal , the prosecution asserted , in particular , that the preparation for the show was based exclusively on the military training documents , which took no account of the specifics of an aerobatic performance involving civilian spectators . Lacking a body of relevant legislation and regulations , ORG had been obliged to develop specific documents adapting the military training rules for this purpose before planning the show . As an aerobatics performance could not be equated to an ordinary military training flight , a special training programme had to be set up , and the crew had to have special clearance . However , the reports by ORG , ORG and the aviation experts indicated that not only did the defendants fail to act in developing relevant rules and regulations , but they also failed to supervise compliance with the existing general rules . The court \u2019s findings were at odds with the findings by these authorities , and no justification was provided for them . Moreover , they were inconsistent with the court \u2019s own position adopted in the judgment of DATE , where it heavily relied on the conclusions of ORG and the aviation expert assessment in examining various aspects of the case and had referred to the relevant findings concerning poor organisation of the show in its reasoning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG of GPE rejected the appeals and upheld the acquittals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the first and second applicants lodged civil actions within the aforementioned criminal proceedings . They claimed CARDINAL NORP hryvnias ( ORG ) and ORG CARDINAL respectively for non - pecuniary damage inflicted by the deaths of ORG and PERSON . Subsequently they increased their claims , seeking ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL in non - pecuniary damages respectively . No claim for damage on account of the second applicant \u2019s presence at the scene of the accident was submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , contemporaneously with the verdict in the \u201c performers\u2019 case \u201d , the court awarded each applicant UAH CARDINAL in nonpecuniary damage , to be paid by ORG .

These allowances were to be paid by ORG until the second applicant \u2019s eighteenth birthday . ORG was also obliged to pay lump sums of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and UAH CARDINAL,CARDINAL in back payments under the first and second judgments respectively . These judgments were not appealed against and became final .", "CARDINAL . Enforcement proceedings were initiated with respect to both judgments , however , according to the applicants , only the second of them was being enforced . They submitted that the debt under the first judgment amounted to the hryvnia equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) at the time of the exchange of observations between the parties .", "CARDINAL .
