The applicant was born in GPE in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , the applicant completed DATE of schooling and subsequently held various jobs in GPE . After leaving the country , he lived in GPE from DATE , living at first on social security and later working as a DATE - labourer on several farms . In DATE he arrived in GPE , where he applied for asylum under a different identity . His application was finally rejected in DATE . He left GPE for GPE with a NORP national with whom he had started a relationship . In DATE he moved on to GPE , where he worked as a cook and waiter in various restaurants .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant re - entered GPE . On DATE his daughter , from his above - mentioned relationship , was born . The applicant \u2019s daughter is a NORP national .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicant and the child \u2019s mother lived together . From the outset they had , and continue to have , joint custody . On DATE , ORG issued the applicant a residence permit based on family ties , valid until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence under LAW ( Bet\u00e4ubungsmittelgesetz ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for drug trafficking on a large scale . It observed that the applicant had recruited and instructed the child \u2019s mother as a drugs runner for CARDINAL separate consignments of cocaine from LOC to LOC in DATE and in DATE . It considered , in favour of the applicant , that this was his first criminal conviction , that the first delivery had failed ( the drugs did not actually enter the distribution system ) , and that the applicant had been detained on remand since DATE . ORG held against the applicant that he had used as drugs runners CARDINAL young women who were adolescents at the time the offences were committed , and who ran the risk of a lengthy prison sentence in LOC ; that he had exploited the naivety of his daughter \u2019s mother ; that a large amount of cocaine was meant to be smuggled in the first case and that QUANTITY of cocaine were smuggled into LOC in the second case ; and that the entire undertaking had been handled very professionally . In addition , ORG considered that a conviction for a third case of drug smuggling could not be envisaged for the sole reason that the precise amount of cocaine transported in a suitcase from GPE to GPE could not be determined .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that his daughter and her mother had visited him in prison DATE and that he had sought a court ruling on contact with his daughter , when the child \u2019s mother discontinued the visits . On DATE , the applicant and the child \u2019s mother agreed before ORG that supervised meetings between him and his daughter would take place as soon as he was released from prison . As of DATE , the daughter visited the applicant regularly in prison DATE every four weeks for TIME at a time \u2013 in the company of a priest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released , after having served his entire sentence . He was placed under supervision of conduct ( F\u00fchrungsaufsicht ) until DATE .", "CARDINAL . After his release , the applicant was granted exceptional leave to remain ( PERSON ) under LAW of LAW \u2013 according to the information available to ORG this was granted most recently in DATE and would last until DATE . It meant that enforcement of the expulsion order was temporarily suspended , being impossible to execute as the applicant did not have a valid passport ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . He began occupational re - training as a management assistant in marketing communication in DATE , which he successfully completed in DATE , but was not allowed to engage in gainful employment since his release .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has not lived with his daughter and her mother since his release . Since DATE they have been living in different cities , with distances between their homes varying QUANTITY and the travelling time varying TIME . The applicant sees his daughter on a regular basis and maintains close contact with her . It is not disputed between the parties that she spends DATE with him . According to a social worker \u2019s statement , he has become an important contact person for her . Both the applicant \u2019s daughter and her mother explicitly wish the applicant \u2019s contact with his child to continue .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since his release , the applicant was convicted of CARDINAL offences by ORG , of fraud in DATE and of theft in DATE and DATE . He was sentenced to CARDINAL , thirty and ninety day - fines , respectively . By being present on NORP territory without having a passport , he committed an ongoing offence under LAW . Criminal proceedings in this connection were discontinued by the public prosecutor in DATE because the applicant \u2019s guilt was considered to be of a minor nature and because prosecution was not in the public interest . The matter was referred to the administrative authority for treatment as an administrative offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Authority of the City of GPE refused to renew the applicant \u2019s residence permit and ordered his expulsion . It held that the applicant \u2019s expulsion was mandatory pursuant to LAW of LAW ; since DATE : Section CARDINAL of LAW ) which foresaw the mandatory expulsion of an alien if he or she were sentenced to either CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for a criminal offence , or to any period of imprisonment ( not on probation ) for an offence under LAW . The authority examined whether the applicant enjoyed special protection against expulsion because he was the father of a NORP child . It found that the applicant had lived with his daughter only for a short time prior to his imprisonment , she had thus experienced separation from the applicant and that , in the light of the applicant \u2019s very serious criminal offences , the ORG \u2019s interest in removing the applicant prevailed over his interest in enjoying family life with his daughter . He could remain in contact with her by letter or telephone and could apply for permission to enter GPE for specific periods of time ( NORP ) . It considered that the applicant \u2019s expulsion was in conformity with LAW . This decision , which also contained an unlimited re - entry ban and notice that he would be deported to GPE if he did not leave GPE voluntarily within DATE after being released from prison , became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant had served CARDINAL of his prison sentence , the authorities envisaged his expulsion as of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant introduced another asylum application ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE , ORG dismissed his application as manifestly illfounded under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and , finding that there were no impediments to his return to his country of origin , ordered his expulsion . The decision again contained notice that he would be deported to GPE if he did not leave GPE voluntarily within DATE after the decision became final . On DATE , ORG granted suspensive effect to the applicant \u2019s appeal in the asylum procedure . On DATE it dismissed his appeal in the main procedure , also finding , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s ties to his daughter could not be taken into account in the asylum procedure . This decision became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for a residence permit based on family ties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Authority of the City of GPE rejected his application , holding that there was a final expulsion decision ( of DATE ) against the applicant , which precluded granting him a residence permit . No impediments arose from the fact that his daughter was a NORP national . The applicant could maintain contact with her through letters , telephone calls and occasional visits . His daughter was accustomed to a long - distance relationship with him . He was responsible for the renewed separation and the purpose of the expulsion order had not yet been achieved . At the same time , it reduced the re - entry ban to DATE and ruled that the applicant could , starting DATE after his actual expulsion , apply for permission to enter GPE DATE for a total of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that decision and ordered the administrative authority to issue a residence permit . It noted that the applicant met the requirements for a residence permit based on family ties , but that granting such a permit was precluded by the final expulsion decision . However , the applicant was entitled to a residence permit on humanitarian grounds in accordance with LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , with the margin of appreciation inherent in this provision being reduced to CARDINAL . LAW of LAW was not applicable to this provision and the applicant \u2019s departure was impossible in law due to his family life with his daughter , which was protected , inter alia , by LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that , despite the serious nature of the criminal offences the applicant had committed , there was no public interest that outweighed the child \u2019s best interests and the applicant \u2019s interest in having contact with his daughter . The relationship between the applicant and his daughter had the quality of a \u201c family \u201d and their ties were of benefit to the child . It considered that they could only live together in GPE , as the child could not be expected to relocate to GPE ; that the applicant had committed the criminal offences prior to the birth of his daughter ; that he had made considerable efforts as a father , as was also evidenced by his choice to remain imprisoned in GPE and to have supervised meetings with his daughter as of DATE rather than having his sentence suspended and being expelled as of DATE ; that the latter event marked a turning point , which occurred after the expulsion order had become final in DATE and which had not been taken into account by the administrative authorities ; that the child had already been deprived of a relationship with her father for DATE during his imprisonment ; that the material assessment with a view to the applicant \u2019s expulsion had been conducted on DATE , DATE before the developments in the fatherdaughter relationship and the moment the expulsion order would be enforced ; and that the enforcement of the expulsion order in connection with a re - entry ban would deprive the child of the possibility of a normal father - daughter relationship for the remainder of her childhood .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overturned that judgment and denied the applicant \u2019s right to a residence permit . It considered that his asylum application had been rejected as manifestly ill - founded under LAW of LAW and that , therefore , in accordance with LAW , second sentence , of FAC , he could not be granted a residence permit prior to leaving GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The exception to this rule , foreseen in the third sentence of this paragraph , was not applicable because the applicant did not have a claim to a residence permit within the meaning of that provision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . First , a claim to a residence permit based on family ties under Sections CARDINAL et seq . of FAC was precluded by LAW of LAW due to the final expulsion order of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Second , a claim to a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under LAW of LAW was proscribed because the applicant did not have a valid passport , which was a general requirement for the granting of a residence permit ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As the decision to waive this requirement in cases concerning residence permits on humanitarian grounds was a discretionary one , the applicant did not have a claim to a residence permit within the meaning of LAW , third sentence , of FAC , not even if the margin of appreciation were reduced to CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Third , the court found that the applicant could not base a claim to a residence permit on impediments to his return to his country of origin either , referring to the outcome of the asylum proceedings in DATE and DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG concluded that , under these circumstances , it was not decisive whether the ties between the applicant and his daughter were such that the requirements for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW were met , if the applicant \u2019s asylum application had not been dismissed , and refrained from elaborating on this aspect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an action to be granted leave to appeal on points of law , arguing that his case raised a matter of fundamental importance . He submitted that he should be granted a residence permit under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW because , as the father of a minor child of NORP nationality for whom he had joint custody , he did , in principle , have a claim to a residence permit based on family ties . The purpose of LAW of LAW was to sanction abuse of the asylum procedure , but an abusive asylum application should not bear negative consequences where the foreigner had a claim , within the meaning of that provision , to a residence permit . In that regard , it should be decisive whether or not the substantive requirements of the respective provision for a residence permit were met , as in his case with regard to the permit based on family ties , and that the reason for the claim not being realised , in his case the final expulsion order against him , should not be relevant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s action . It noted that , according to the case - law of the domestic courts , the exception foreseen in LAW , third sentence , of FAC only applied to claims that followed directly from legislative provisions and in respect of which all requirements , general and specific , were met . A residence permit based on family ties was precluded because of the final expulsion order against the applicant . Under these circumstances , granting a residence permit on humanitarian grounds was to be considered . However , as the applicant did not have a valid passport , which was a general requirement for the granting of a residence permit from which derogations were , in cases concerning LAW of LAW , possible only by way of a discretionary decision , the exception foreseen in LAW , third sentence , of FAC was not applicable . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG , alleging that the decisions of ORG and of ORG violated his right to respect for his family life with his daughter . On DATE ORG declined to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint without providing reasons ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . After the Authority of GPE , on DATE , had ordered the applicant to present himself to ORG in GPE so that a passport for the upcoming expulsion could be issued , the applicant refused to do so and filed an action against this order with ORG . During the court hearing on DATE , the applicant and the immigration authorities agreed to the following :", "\u201c - The effect of the re - entry ban will be limited to DATE after leaving GPE .", "- The immigration authorities will give their consent for a visa to enter GPE based on family reunion . If the applicant by then still has joint custody with the child \u2019s mother , a residence permit on the grounds of family ties will be issued . If the applicant no longer has joint custody for his daughter , the immigration authority will use its discretion regarding the issue of a residence permit in favour of the applicant .", "- All of this applies only if the applicant can show that he has not committed further criminal offences and if no other reasons for his expulsion emerge .", "- A timelimit for leaving the country is set at DATE . \u201d", "In the light of this agreement , the applicant withdrew his action , and the proceedings before ORG were discontinued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE declared that it would not issue a passport to the applicant as long as the proceedings before this Court were pending . On DATE the applicant informed the immigration authorities that he would not leave GPE , contrary to his initial plans and to his declaration before ORG . As a result , the agreement concluded before that court became void ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
