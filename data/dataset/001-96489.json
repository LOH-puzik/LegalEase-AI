In DATE her claim was only allowed in respect of QUANTITY of the plot as the authorities found that in respect of QUANTITY the applicant \u2019s father had soon after the expropriation been compensated with other land .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant brought a rei vindicatio action against the GPE municipality , claiming that the latter was unlawfully in possession of QUANTITY of land in respect of which restitution had been refused . The applicant alleged that her rights to the property at issue had been restored ex lege by virtue of the denationalisation legislation .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the claim , finding that the applicant \u2019s rights had not been restored ex lege as her father had , at the relevant time , received compensation for the lands at issue . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment .", "On DATE the applicant appealed in cassation . As she had failed to justify her appeal in view of the requirements of LAW DATE ( see Relevant domestic law below ) , she was instructed to do so by a judge of ORG .", "Within the time - limit given , the applicant submitted a written statement concerning the grounds for cassation under LAW , and not the admissibility criteria under LAW . Finding that she had failed to comply with the aforementioned instructions , on DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings . On an appeal by the applicant , on DATE that decision was upheld by ORG , which confirmed the lower court \u2019s conclusion that she had failed to comply with the relevant procedural requirements .", "The Code of Civil Procedure , adopted in DATE and in force since DATE , introduced new requirements for the admissibility of cassation appeals .", "Pursuant to LAW , as worded initially , ORG was competent to examine cases where the court of appeal has ruled upon \u201c a material question of law or procedure \u201d , and where , in addition , one of the following CARDINAL situations has occurred : ( a ) the question has been decided not in conformity with the practice of ORG ; ( b ) there have been conflicting decisions of the national courts ; and ( c ) the question is of importance for the accurate application of the relevant law or for the development of the law .", "In a decision of DATE ORG found that these new requirements for the admissibility of cassation appeals did not , in principle , run contrary to the right to access to a court , as guaranteed in LAW . Their exact content and meaning would be clarified in judicial practice . However , ORG found that the requirement of LAW that the court of appeal must have ruled on \u201c a material question of law or procedure \u201d ( see above ) unnecessarily restricted the access to cassation and , accordingly , struck down as being anti - constitutional the word \u201c material \u201d ( see ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE , constitutional case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "The Code of Civil Procedure DATE further provides that it is incumbent on the party seeking cassation to justify , in view of the requirements of LAW , that the cassation appeal merits examination . Failure to put forward arguments in that regard will result in the discontinuation of the proceedings ( LAW and CARDINAL of the Code ) .", "Under LAW , the grounds for seeking cassation remained the same as those under LAW , namely material breaches of law and procedure , nullity and ill - founded conclusions ( LAW of LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
