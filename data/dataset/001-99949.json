GEORGIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Kristina Pardalos;Nona Tsotsoria", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON PERSON GPE , lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant 's father , a member of the NORP aristocracy , was deprived of his land and other assets by ORG during DATE and DATE .", "On DATE the applicant brought an action against the relevant local authority , seeking restitution of his ancestral lands . In support of his claim , the applicant submitted archives confirming his father 's title to the claimed land and , as a legal basis , referred to general rules on the protection of property and inheritance contained in LAW , the LAW and the international human - rights treaties ratified by GPE . The action was registered by ORG on DATE .", "According to the file as it stands at present , the restitution proceedings are still pending at first instance ; no hearing has been held so far .", "Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code bearing on the protection of ownership reads as follows :", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL", "\u201c CARDINAL . The owner can claim the asset back from the possessor unless the latter is entitled to possess it .", "CARDINAL . In the event of interference with the exercise of ownership other than the taking of the asset , the owner may request the trespasser to put an end to such an action . If the interference persists , the owner may bring a court action against the trespasser . \u201d", "By passing the LAW of DATE , ORG recognised that NORP nationals were subjected to political persecution by GPE DATE and DATE , entitling the victims to seek rehabilitation .", "The LAW defined the notion of a victim of political persecution and created a procedure by which to obtain that status . In particular , section CARDINAL of the LAW provided that only a court could declare a person to be a victim . Section CARDINAL specified that the next of kin of a direct victim was also entitled to seek rehabilitation .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) stated that , once recognised as a victim of political repression , the person in question would automatically have his or her political and civil rights reinstated . This excluded the reinstatement of any property rights , in so far as subsection CARDINAL of the same section specified that \u201c the means for the restitution of property of victims of political repression shall be governed by a separate LAW \u201d .", "No act concerning the restitution of property of victims of NORP repression has yet been passed .", "In a decision of DATE , the ORG reinstated the ownership rights of the claimant PERSON over her late parents ' land expropriated by GPE in DATE . PERSON had previously been recognised as a victim of NORP repression within the meaning of LAW of DATE .", "Likewise , in a decision of the Krtsanisi - Mtatsminda District Court in GPE of DATE , PERSON and PERSON , the claimants , were declared the owners of assets once belonging to their ancestors who had been recognised as victims of NORP repression .", "Another similar case was that of Mr PERSON , who , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE of ORG , was granted title to land expropriated from his grandfather by GPE in DATE and DATE . The only difference between this and the CARDINAL above - mentioned cases was that , prior to the restitution of the property , neither Mr ORG , the claimant , nor any of his ancestors had been recognised as victims of GPE within the meaning of LAW of DATE .", "In all CARDINAL above - mentioned cases , the claimants were excused from having missed the statutory time - limit for recovery of property , in view of the fact that the expropriation of their ancestors ' property had been carried out by force and the respondents were either private persons or public agencies . The domestic courts ' reasons underlying their decisions to allow restitution were based on the general principles of protection of property and the inheritance rules contained in LAW , the LAW and international human - rights treaties . Certain other general principles of law , such as equity , were also relied on .", "As acknowledged by the President of ORG in his foreword to its ORG , CARDINAL of the problems of the NORP judiciary was the lack of consistent case - law on similar disputes . Consequently , ORG deemed it necessary , for the purposes of harmonising judicial practice , to advise the lower courts on how certain types of dispute should be resolved . The President noted that the ORG were not of a mandatory nature but emphasised their significance .", "LAW of the ORG advised the courts that they should declare claims for restitution of property expropriated by GPE in DATE and DATE admissible but refuse them on the merits in view of the absence of a right to restitution under NORP law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
