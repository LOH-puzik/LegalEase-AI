She is a regular warrant officer in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a regular member of the armed forces and has been married to CARDINAL of her colleagues since CARDINAL DATE . Since joining the army she has received an \u201c unmarried person \u2019s \u201d service allowance which is designed to compensate for the unique requirements that service life imposes on military personnel .", "After she married she requested her service allowance to be re - calculated at the higher \u201c head of the family \u201d rate paid to her husband . She relied on the LOC judgment of CARDINAL DATE in which the ORG d\u2019Etat had declared obsolete the reference to the notion of head of the family in the light of the provisions of LAW of DATE . This judgment had had the effect of making servicewomen married to servicemen eligible for the \u201c head of the family \u201d service allowance instead of the \u201c unmarried person \u2019s \u201d service allowance for the same family situation .", "Relying on that case - law authority , the applicant asked the military authorities to bring her service allowance into line with the higher allowance paid to her husband . Her request was refused .", "On DATE she appealed to the Chief of ORG of ORG .", "Basing his decision on the decree of CARDINAL DATE governing service allowances , the Chief of ORG dismissed her appeal on DATE on the ground that , where a serviceman and servicewoman were married to each other , family expenses could not be taken into account twice and the \u201c head of the family \u201d allowance paid to both spouses .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG for judicial review of ORG decision . In her submission , no provision of the DATE decree supported the ministry \u2019s refusal to grant her a \u201c head of the family \u201d allowance and the ministry \u2019s interpretation of the decree had been discriminatory .", "On DATE the court set aside the ministry \u2019s decision on the following grounds :", "\u201c Firstly , the provisions of LAW of DATE have rendered otiose the notion of head of the family referred to in the aforementioned decree of CARDINAL DATE governing service allowances and secondly , ORG has no legislative or regulatory power to treat PERSON as an \u2018 unmarried person\u2019 for the purposes of the aforementioned provisions in refusing her the allowance requested . It follows , without there being any need to examine the ground submitted under LAW of DATE , that PERSON is justified in requesting judicial review of the aforementioned decision of CARDINAL DATE refusing her a \u2018 head of the ORG service allowance from DATE . \u201d", "On DATE ORG passed LAW for DATE , which came into force on the date of its publication in ORG ) on DATE .

It held that the ground of appeal based on the submission that the notion of the \u201c head of the family \u201d referred to in the decree of CARDINAL DATE had become obsolete was no longer valid following the enactment of the legalising LAW DATE . The ORG d\u2019Etat noted , among other things , that", "\u201c The effect [ of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the decree of CARDINAL DATE ] is that any married member of the armed forces , regardless of sex , may receive the \u201c head of the family \u201d service allowance but , where both spouses are members of the armed forces , the higher family allowances are non - cumulative and are paid to the head of the household alone . PERSON and her husband \u2019s entitlement to a service allowance was determined on that basis . It is not disputed that the applicant \u2019s husband has already received the \u201c head of the family \u201d allowance . The Minister of Defence \u2019s subsequent dismissal of the applicant \u2019s claim for the head of the family allowance on the ground that her husband had already received it does not in itself infringe the principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It follows that PERSON , n\u00e9e GPE , is justified in maintaining that , in the decisions complained of , ORG wrongly refused to award her the flat - rate supplement to the service allowance . \u201d", "In the Minister of Defence v.

Neither the aim of preventing military personnel serving abroad from maintaining the benefits in question during the transitional period preceding publication of the decree of DATE , nor the aim of avoiding any discrimination arising between civil servants and members of the armed forces or between servicemen and women who have taken legal proceedings and those who have not , nor the concern to avoid the financial consequences of the aforementioned decision of the ORG d\u2019Etat qualify as grounds of public interest of a kind to justify the interference with PERSON ORG \u2019s possessions brought about by the retroactive deprivation of the bonus for skills and meritorious service to which he was legally entitled during his postings abroad .
