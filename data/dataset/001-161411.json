The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant married in DATE . He separated from his wife in DATE . On DATE he issued an application in ORG for contact with CARDINAL of his CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his wife divorced on DATE . His legal aid certificate was withdrawn following a financial award made as part of the divorce .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile the contact proceedings continued . The applicant \u2019s former wife alleged that he had harassed her and applied to ORG for protection . On DATE the applicant gave an undertaking to ORG :", "\u201c Not to contact , or communicate with , [ his former wife ] , [ her ] mother or father , nor her solicitors in any way whatsoever ... except through his own solicitors . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s former wife an injunction which inter alia prevented him from using or threatening violence towards her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s former wife issued an application for him to be committed to prison for breach of the undertaking and injunction .", "CARDINAL . His Honour Judge PERSON , sitting in ORG , chose to hear the applicant \u2019s application for contact and his former wife \u2019s application for him to be committed for contempt at the same time . He heard the applications on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was unrepresented during the proceedings before Judge PERSON . His position as regards legal aid was due to be reviewed shortly after the hearing . The judge made no inquiries into why the applicant was unrepresented or whether he wanted representation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge made an order for indirect contact . He also committed the applicant to prison for DATE because he had breached the undertaking and the order and was therefore in contempt of court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contacted lawyers from prison in order to appeal his committal but , having accepted instructions , they failed to assist him . He subsequently lodged a complaint against them and received MONEY ( \u201c GBP \u201d ) in compensation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE , after CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , pursuant to provisions permitting early release .", "CARDINAL . On around DATE the applicant lodged an appeal out of time against the finding that he had been in contempt of court . He subsequently obtained legal aid and legal representation to pursue those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed both the finding of contempt and the sentence imposed . It found that ORG errors of procedure were grave ones . Lord Justice PERSON , delivering the first judgment , began by setting out a number of well - established principles relevant to committal hearings . The need to observe LAW DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) was central to the practice direction on committal proceedings , which had applied to the proceedings before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Such proceedings concerned a \u201c criminal charge \u201d for the purpose of LAW and the defendant therefore benefited from the right to legal assistance set out in LAW ) . A defendant to committal proceedings was not obliged to give evidence and enjoyed a right against selfincrimination and , referring to LAW , the burden of proving guilt lay on the person seeking committal .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s case , PERSON observed that these matters had not been drawn to the attention of the judge . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Untutored and unassisted as the judge was , matters went wrong from the beginning . The judge noted , at the outset , that Mr PERSON was acting in person . He made no comment about it whatever . In particular , he did not ask anything as to the circumstances in which he was unrepresented . Had he done so , he would have learnt that earlier legal representation had been withdrawn by ORG after he received a sum of money on his divorce ... That was the subject matter of a review panel which was due to sit DATE . This emerged at the outset of the cross - examination by counsel for PERSON on DATE of the hearing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Moses LJ considered that once the judge had learnt that the issue of legal aid was the subject of an imminent review panel , there was no reason why the committal hearing should not have been adjourned until the issue of legal representation had been resolved . He was of the view that the judge had been obliged to ask appropriate questions and to consider , at the very outset of the hearing , whether there should be an adjournment so as to enable the defendant to be represented . In the absence of evidence of intransigence on the part of the applicant , and he noted that there was none , there was no reason why the applicant should not be represented .", "CARDINAL . Moses LJ further found that the decision to hear the application for committal at the same time as the application for contact led to inescapable errors in procedure . He noted that it was for the applicant to establish his claim for contact , and for his former wife to prove breaches of the undertaking and the court order . The applicant should have been warned that he did not need to give evidence ; he received no such warning .", "CARDINAL . Moses LJ concluded that the decision of the judge to hear both applications at the same time had placed the applicant in an impossible position , noting that there was no hint at any stage in the transcript of the proceedings of anyone advising the applicant of his rights in respect of the committal proceedings , nor of the judge reminding himself of the different burden and standard of proof in the CARDINAL applications . Further , the judge had given no explanation as to why he considered it essential to deal with both applications at the same time .", "CARDINAL . Finally , PERSON considered that the judge again fell into error at the sentencing stage . He noted that the judge never paused , even at that stage , to consider whether the applicant should have legal representation or to remind himself of the relevant principles . He observed that the judge had paid no heed to the purpose of punishment in contempt proceedings . Since he had not been represented and had never been given an opportunity to mitigate , the sentencing phase of the committal was \u201c fatally flawed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Moses LJ then assessed whether it was necessary for the court to consider whether legal representation would have made a difference in the applicant \u2019s case . He commented that it was almost impossible to envisage a case where such representation would not be needed , if only , as this case demonstrated , to remind a judge of the principles which applied . Even in a case where a defendant admitted every breach alleged , representation would be needed so as to assist the judge in considering the appropriate disposal . The case was certainly not one where the court would decline to take action despite a violation of LAW . There was ample material to suggest that legal representation would have made a difference . Quite apart from the question of the appropriate sentence , there was material relevant to the facts of the breaches to which the judge \u2019s attention ought to have been drawn .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON fully agreed with PERSON , noting :", "\u201c DATE . There are , of course , many cases in the books in which this court has upheld committal orders even although they have been made in proceedings which were procedurally flawed ... Provided the contemnor has had a fair trial and the order has been made on valid grounds , the existence of a defect in the committal application or in the order served will not result in it being set aside except in so far as the interests of justice require that to be done ...", "CARDINAL . The instant case , however , is plainly not in that category , and I am in complete agreement with PERSON that the defects in the process in the instant case are so serious that the interests of justice plainly require both the committal order and the consequential sentence of imprisonment to be set aside . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Specifically on the question of access to legal advice , he added :", "\u201c DATE . ... Even more important , however , in my view is the proposition that in the absence of exceptional circumstances , it is a breach of a party \u2019s ECHR Article CARDINAL rights to be sent to prison for contempt of court without the benefit of legal representation . No GPE court would impose a custodial sentence on an unrepresented defendant , and in my judgment , no family court should send a litigant in person to prison for contempt without first making arrangements for that litigant to be legally represented . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant commenced proceedings for damages under common law for the tort of wrongful imprisonment and under LAW DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , relying on DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention . He sought an extension of time for lodging his claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his claim and refused the extension of time . However , Mr PERSON made it clear that had he considered there to be merit in the claim , he would have extended time . He had therefore considered the merits of the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . PERSON noted at the outset that ORG had identified CARDINAL main errors in the applicant \u2019s case : the failure to inquire into why he was not represented and to consider whether to adjourn the committal proceedings to enable him to obtain representation ; the joinder of the committal proceedings and the contact order application , which undermined the burden of proof and the applicant \u2019s right not to give evidence in the committal proceedings ; and the fact that he was not given the opportunity to mitigate before sentence was passed . PERSON considered it plain from the judgment of ORG that although it had granted no formal declaration that the committal hearing had breached the applicant \u2019s human rights , it had been of the view that it had and that had been the tenor of its findings .", "CARDINAL . As to the false imprisonment claim , PERSON referred to the longstanding recognition in the case - law that there was immunity from suit for a claim based on alleged errors of a circuit judge of competent jurisdiction that resulted in detention , in the absence of malice . The applicant \u2019s claim accordingly failed .", "CARDINAL . He considered equally hopeless the applicant \u2019s claim that any violation of an LAW right gave rise to a right to damages under LAW DATE . He found that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , which precludes damages in respect of a judicial act done in good faith , with the exception of damages required by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , was inconsistent with the applicant \u2019s claim . He also referred to the fact that just satisfaction under the ORG was a matter of discretion .", "CARDINAL . As to the claim under LAW , PERSON referred to this ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of PERSON v. the GPE [ ORG ] , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL , Perks and Others v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and others , DATE and ORG v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL and others , DATE . He decided that the applicant \u2019s claim that his detention was a violation of LAW because any hearing in which a violation of LAW occurred was not in accordance with law was :", "\u201c a slightly more modest reworking of the article CARDINAL submission that has been already considered and summarily rejected . Again I reject this reworking of the submission for similar reasons to those already given , but more particularly for the principles spelt out in the trio of Community charge cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON concluded that the applicant \u2019s detention pursuant to the order of Judge PERSON was not so gross or obvious an irregularity , within the meaning of \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s judgment in ORG , cited above , as to be not in accordance with the law . In reaching this conclusion , he noted , inter alia , that ORG was a court of competent jurisdiction ; that proper notice of the hearing and of the committal application had been given ; that the record of proceedings did not appear to reveal any application by the applicant for an adjournment to seek legal representation ; that there was no failure to follow a statutory prerequisite because the general requirement to observe LAW by LAW DATE was not the same as a precise rule prohibiting committal unless a condition was complied with ; that , similarly , the practice direction ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which set out the need to observe LAW , was in general terms and did not amount to a condition precedent ; that ORG , at the time of ORG decision , had not made an unambiguous finding that a lack of representation at a committal hearing would always violate LAW , although its finding in the present case meant that LAW might be considered a condition precedent in future cases ; and that there was no hint of malice or bad faith by the judge .", "CARDINAL . PERSON also found that ORG CARDINAL principal criticisms all suggested that ORG had erroneously exercised its judgment . Erroneous exercises of judgment did not make decisions not in accordance with law or arbitrary in the sense indicated in LAW case - law .", "CARDINAL . Having thus concluded , PERSON explained that , had he reached the contrary conclusion , it would have been necessary to consider what the causal nexus between the unfairness and the detention resulting from the unfairness was . He accepted that where detention was in violation of LAW it was necessary and appropriate to visit it with a measure of damages , however modest . He found that , if the family - law applications had been separated correctly and the applicant had been represented , a finding of contempt would nevertheless have been inevitable . However , whilst custody was the more probable outcome , the length of sentence would have been significantly shorter and DATE , so the applicant would not have served DATE in prison . He indicated that , had a violation of LAW been established , he would have awarded damages in the sum of GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL , on an equitable basis .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal out of time . On DATE leave to appeal was refused on the papers . The judge commented that he might consider extending time if there was a real prospect of success , but in his view the judgment would be upheld ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-a"]}
