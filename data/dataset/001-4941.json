{"ITEMID": "001-4941", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "MARIC v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , presently resides in GPE , GPE . In his application form , he states that he has NORP nationality .", "a.", "", "On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE . He requested asylum DATE . He stated that he is an ethnic NORP from NORP in GPE . As from DATE he served in the NORP army . In DATE he was taken prisoner by NORP troops and held in captivity for DATE . In DATE Kakanj was occupied by NORP troops who started an ethnic cleansing of the village . In DATE he deserted from his military unit and travelled to PERSON where he joined another unit . In DATE he absconded also from that unit and left for GPE . He arrived in GPE via GPE . During his journey he used his NORP passport which he tore apart upon arrival in GPE . The applicant claimed to be a citizen of GPE only . He feared that , if deported to GPE , he would be sent back to GPE .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG invandrarverk ) rejected the applicant 's request and ordered his deportation to GPE . Finding that the applicant held both NORP and NORP citizenship , the ORG referred to a decision concerning asylum seekers with such double nationality taken by ORG on DATE . According to the decision , the prevailing situation in GPE rendered deportations to that country impossible . Consequently , in assessing applications from these asylum seekers , the crucial question was whether they could be afforded protection in GPE . ORG noted that , according to available information , there was no reason to assume that GPE would not afford the applicant protection . Further , persons in the applicant 's situation did not risk to be sent from GPE to GPE against their will . Neither was there any risk that NORP citizens in general would be forced to take part in armed conflict . Moreover , the applicant had failed to show that he would risk persecution or other harassment if deported to GPE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) . On DATE ORG granted the applicant a temporary residence permit until DATE and quashed the deportation order . In so doing , the ORG referred to a Government decision of CARDINAL DATE according to which the worsened situation in GPE constituted an impediment to the deportation of asylum seekers to that country .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a new application for a residence permit . He referred to his previous statements and added that , being an ethnic NORP , he could not return to the NORP - dominated Kakanj or to any other part of GPE . He risked punishment for having deserted from the NORP army . Moreover , he could not go to GPE where he had no place to live . His NORP passport did not entitle him to full civic rights in GPE and he would thus be forced to return to GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's new application and ordered his deportation to GPE . ORG had regard to guiding decisions taken by ORG and found that the applicant should not be sent back to PERSON . With regard to the possible deportation to GPE , the ORG noted that no circumstances had been invoked by the applicant which could lead to the conclusion that he was unable to go to GPE . Consequently , ORG reiterated the conclusions drawn in its previous decision concerning the applicant . Furthermore , ORG found that there were no reasons of a humanitarian nature to grant the applicant a residence permit .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision .", "In medical certificates issued by the psychiatric clinic at the hospital in GPE on DATE and DATE physicians ORG and ORG stated that the applicant suffered from anxiety and suicide thoughts . He had been treated with antidepressant medication . As from DATE he had been treated at the clinic for a post - traumatic stress syndrome . ORG found that the applicant was in need of qualified psychiatric care and that there was a considerable risk that he would commit self - destructive acts . The clinic submitted the certificate of DATE to ORG and requested that the enforcement of the deportation order be suspended .", "On DATE ORG decided not to suspend the enforcement of the deportation order .", "Relevant domestic law", "Under LAW of LAW ( Lagen om psykiatrisk tv\u00e5ngsv\u00e5rd , DATE ) , such care shall be terminated at the request of the competent police authority whenever the person placed in care is ordered to be deported . This presupposes , however , that the chief physician finds that the alien 's condition allows that the deportation takes place . According to LAW , no appeal lies against the chief physician 's decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
