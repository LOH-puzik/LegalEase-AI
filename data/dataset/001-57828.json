SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr PERSON is a NORP national and lives in GPE . He obtained his diploma in medicine in DATE and has since practised mostly as an assistant doctor ( GPE ) , for which activity he does not require an authorisation in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he received the authorisation to practise independently in the canton . The authorisation was , however , withdrawn by ORG ) on DATE on the ground that , having moved to another canton , he had not used it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an administrative appeal ( PERSON ) which ORG ( NORP ) of GPE rejected on CARDINAL DATE for the following reasons : the possibility that a new authorisation would be granted as soon as he returned to GPE was not sufficient to confer on the applicant a legally protected interest ; in any event the authorisation in question was not of general validity , but related to a specific activity ; as it was , Mr PERSON no longer lived in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant worked as an assistant doctor in the emergency service of LOC ( \u00c4rztlicher Notfalldienst des \u00c4rzteverbandes des Bezirks Zurich ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he fetched a partially paralysed patient from a private old peoples\u2019 home and took her back to her flat , where he treated her . Shortly afterwards he drew up a bill on an emergency service form for MONEY and sent it to the guardian ( gesetzlicher PERSON ) of the patient , who had been placed in guardianship on a temporary basis on DATE . The sum in question was to be paid directly into the applicant \u2019s post office account and not that of the medical association .", "A prosecution was subsequently brought against Mr Kraska for fraud and various infringements of ORG ; in particular it was alleged that he had treated the patient without being in possession of an authorisation to practise medicine independently as was required under section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( a ) of that Act .", "ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) acquitted him on DATE , finding inter alia that the indictment had not indicated in sufficiently specific terms the medical treatment involved .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had attempted to obtain a new authorisation . On DATE ORG had refused his request on the ground that he was not \" trustworthy \" within the meaning of section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It took the view that he had infringed section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( a ) of the LAW by submitting a bill for the treatment in question and that his acquittal by ORG made no difference in this respect . ORG noted in particular that in his bill the applicant had himself classified the treatment as medical acts .", "CARDINAL . In an appeal ( Beschwerde ) to ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) the applicant again sought the authorisation to practise his profession independently . The court dismissed his appeal on CARDINAL DATE . It also directed that he should wait until DATE before re - applying .", "CARDINAL . By a memorial of CARDINAL pages Mr PERSON \u2019s lawyer lodged with ORG ( PERSON ) a public - law appeal ( staatsrechtliche Beschwerde ) , on which CARDINAL judges deliberated at a public hearing on DATE ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ) . The applicant \u2019s lawyer was present in the courtroom , but was not allowed to address the court . Judge PERSON submitted his report ; Judge Y , who did not in fact have the status of co - rapporteur attributed to him at paragraph CARDINAL of the Commission \u2019s opinion , stated that he was unable to accept the conclusions of the report and proposed a solution contrary thereto . During the discussion which followed , a third judge put forward a counter proposal , which was adopted by the majority .", "In a letter to his client , the lawyer described the course of the deliberations . According to him , Judge PERSON had proposed that the applicant \u2019s public - law appeal should be allowed in full and that he should be granted the authorisation to practise . Judge Y had stated that he had been irritated by the length of the memorial , of which he had been able to read TIME or so pages , and had complained that it had not been possible for him to study the file because , owing to an error on the part of the registry , he had not received it until DATE before the hearing ; he had then called for the dismissal of the appeal , basing his view exclusively on the above - mentioned decisions of DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE . By CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , that of Judge PERSON , it quashed the decision in so far as it imposed a waiting period on the applicant but dismissed the remainder of the appeal .", "It first declared a number of the applicant \u2019s complaints inadmissible . It stated , nevertheless , that in cases of this kind , in the event of the appeal \u2019s succeeding , it could by way of exception not only quash the contested decision , but also grant the authorisation sought , if all the other conditions were satisfied .", "ORG then noted that , according to its case - law , the right to freedom of commerce and industry , guaranteed by LAW , embraced the right to practise medicine on a professional basis .", "Having examined the criticisms levelled by the health authorities , it formed the opinion that CARDINAL of them appeared material to assessing the applicant \u2019s honesty : he had carried out a medical act without the necessary authorisation ; in addition , the bill relating thereto dealt with both medical and non - medical acts and he had drawn it up on an emergency service form , thereby giving the impression that it concerned only the former .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the GPE of GPE granted Mr PERSON \u2019s third application for a new authorisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON requested ORG to re - examine its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , complaining that it had given its decision without sufficient knowledge of the file .", "His application was dismissed on DATE on the ground , inter alia , that there was no legal basis for reopening the proceedings . ORG summarised the contested deliberations as follows :", "\" On the occasion of the public deliberations CARDINAL judge expressed his dissatisfaction that the documents had not been available for a sufficiently long time ( they had been sent first to a substitute judge ) ; he had therefore been able to read thoroughly only the first CARDINAL pages of the - much too long - appeal memorial which comprised CARDINAL pages . \"", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON subsequently filed CARDINAL other applications for the reopening of the proceedings in ORG ; they were dismissed on DATE and CARDINAL DATE and on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
