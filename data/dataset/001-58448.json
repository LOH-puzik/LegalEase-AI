Relying on LAW , the applicant made an urgent application to ORG for an order requiring ORG to comply with the court decisions in which a residence order had been made in her favour and the children 's return ordered .", "CARDINAL . The court delivered its judgment on DATE . It noted , firstly , that ORG , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , had ordered that the children should live with their mother and that the GPE courts had ordered the return of the children . It went on to note that ORG had abducted the children in breach of those judgments and that he had been sentenced to a DATE 's imprisonment for failure to hand over a child . It held that the applicant 's application satisfied the requirement of urgency , as her right might be irreparably affected in the event of delay . Moreover , the measure sought was a precautionary one , which did not prejudge the merits of the case but was designed to protect the applicant 's right , which any delay would have jeopardised .

On DATE ORG asked ORG to carry out a social inquiry at ORG home .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the mayor of GPE informed ORG that a social inquiry had been carried out by ORG second district of GPE in DATE . The mayor of that district submitted the findings of the inquiry , signed by him , the town clerk and an inspector . They read as follows :", "\u201c The children PERSON and GPE ... live with their father and his wife in an CARDINAL - room house , and each girl has a room of her own .", "Their father looks after them very well , as regards both their physical and their mental welfare , providing the best conditions for their upbringing .", "It is evident from conversations with the girls in LANGUAGE \u2013 they have a command of the language \u2013 that they are intelligent , sociable and at ease and that they lead a normal life , read , write and work hard at school .", "There is an atmosphere of harmony and friendship and plenty of affection between the girls , their father and his wife .", "The girls do not want to go and live with their mother in GPE , whom they remember as a cold and indifferent person . They say that they have always found their father understanding , warm and affectionate .", "They are very impressed by GPE and the NORP , among whom they have made many friends . During DATE they went to the countryside and they felt wonderfully well there .", "When asked to say whether or not they wanted to see their mother or go and live with her , they replied categorically ' no ' and insisted that any decision concerning them should take their wishes into account .", "In conclusion , we consider that in GPE the children PERSON and GPE have the best conditions for their upbringing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed ORG appeal against the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

After having taken evidence from the children , who reiterated their wish to stay with their father , ORG Instance dismissed the objection on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by ORG against that decision , ORG affirmed it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged an application with ORG to be given exclusive parental responsibility . He argued that since DATE he had been living in GPE in a spacious CARDINAL - room house which afforded the children exceptional conditions . They did not want to go to live with their mother , who belonged to a sect .", "The court , informed by ORG that the applicant 's address for service was the address of PERSON , caused the date of the hearing to be served only on him . It is clear from documents available to the ORG that neither at that stage of the proceedings nor later was the applicant informed that she had been summoned to appear before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of ORG , ORG second district of GPE carried out a social inquiry . Following that inquiry , the mayor of GPE informed the court that the QUANTITY girls were well developed , both physically and psychologically , that they led normal lives , had friends at school and in the neighbourhood and were very attached to their father and his wife , who both looked after them very well and with whom they wished to live .", "CARDINAL . After holding CARDINAL hearings in the absence of the applicant on CARDINAL and DATE and interviewing the children in private on DATE , the court delivered its judgment on DATE , likewise in the applicant 's absence . Emphasising that the children 's interests were paramount and basing its judgment on documents drawn up by the children 's teachers attesting to their good performance at school , on a letter from ORG to the effect that the sect to which the applicant belonged was not recognised in GPE , and on the social inquiry carried out by ORG , the court allowed ORG 's application , holding that he was providing the best living conditions and upbringing for the children , whom he had , moreover , brought up on his own since the divorce .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set aside that judgment on appeal because of an irregularity in the service of notice on the applicant , and remitted the case to ORG . It noted that the applicant lived in GPE , that she had given PERSON special authority to represent her in another set of legal proceedings and that consequently , in the absence of special authority in the case before the court , the summons should have been served at her permanent address in GPE .", "CARDINAL . D.Z. challenged that decision on the ground that the applicant had given PERSON general authority to act for her and that consequently the service of the court documents at his address was valid .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , delivered in the absence of either the applicant or any representative of hers , ORG allowed the appeal on the ground that the applicant had given PERSON general authority to act on her behalf . It set aside the decision of DATE and remitted the case to ORG for reconsideration of the appeal .", "CARDINAL . The case was set down for hearing in ORG on DATE . According to the record of the hearing made on DATE , the hearing was attended by ORG , his lawyer and the assistant of ORG , the lawyer who , according to the court , was supposed to be acting on behalf of the applicant . The ORG can not determine from the documents submitted to it which of ORG and PERSON was regarded by ORG as having been appointed by the applicant .", "The assistant pointed out that PERSON was absent and sought an adjournment of the hearing . That application was refused after the court had heard the submissions of counsel for ORG It gave its decision on DATE , in the absence of the applicant or a representative . Without mentioning the issue of the applicant 's representation , the court dismissed the appeal and thus upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , noting that the children wished to stay with their father , who was affording them the best living conditions .", "CARDINAL . It appears that an appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE was lodged on behalf of the applicant . It can not be determined from the documents submitted to the ORG whether the applicant herself entered the appeal . However that may have been , ORG dismissed the appeal for lack of grounds on CARDINAL DATE . As was apparent from that decision , which the ORG did not file with ORG until DATE , only ORG attended the hearing on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In an application dated DATE PERSON applied to the family judge of the PERSON tribunal de grande instance for an order transferring the children 's residence to his address and granting him exclusive exercise of parental responsibility .", "CARDINAL . After many adjournments the tribunal de grande instance delivered a judgment on DATE . It held firstly that it was unnecessary to take account of the judgment of ORG of DATE because that court had no jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the custody of the children , since the NORP courts could only deal with an application for the return of the children under LAW . The tribunal de grande instance then declined to take evidence from the children . It found that since DATE ORG had prevented them from seeing their mother and that he had brought them up to feel hatred for her . In letters of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , in which they spoke of their mother , the girls had used terms such as \u201c idiot \u201d and \u201c my ex - mother \u201d and had hoped that \u201c her house or her flat [ would catch ] fire and that she [ would be ] in it when it happen[ed ] \u201d , terms which the tribunal de grande instance found particularly shocking coming from children of CARDINAL and CARDINAL . The tribunal de grande instance concluded that the intolerance , intransigence and hatred found in those letters adequately demonstrated that the upbringing the children had received and the surroundings in which they lived had deprived them of all judgment .", "CARDINAL . The application for transfer of residence was dismissed by the tribunal de grande instance in the following terms :", "\u201c The Family Judge must rule in the interests of the children when determining their place of residence .", "ORG held in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE that it was in the children 's interests to live with their mother , in GPE , in their native PERSON , both their parents having opted for NORP nationality .", "Since that date the mother has had no further contact with her children because of the father 's actions .", "PERSON filed with the ORG the various records of proceedings drawn up in GPE when attempts were made to obtain execution of the decision to return the children , letters from ORG to ORG , from which it appears that PERSON is hiding the children , has acquired a dog which he has trained to attack anyone who approaches the children , and removed the children from school in DATE to avoid their whereabouts being discovered .", "He maintained that his behaviour was justified because PERSON Ignaccolo belonged to a sect and had not looked after the children when they cohabited . However , he did not in any way substantiate his complaints but did no more than make allegations or produce testimony from persons living in GPE or GPE who did not personally know the children 's mother .", "The educative abilities of a father who totally denies the image of the mother , who brings the children up to hate their mother and does not even allow them to form their own opinion by affording them the opportunity to meet her and who has not hesitated , in order to evade enforcement of court decisions , to completely uproot the children for a second time in order to settle in a country whose language they are not familiar with are seriously in doubt .", "The children 's interests in such a situation are intangible and indefinable , regard being had , firstly , to the pressure and conditioning they undergo with their father and , secondly , to the fact that for DATE they have been away from their mother , whom they no longer know .", "The children 's wish to stay and live with their father , as expressed both in their letters and when they were interviewed by the NORP court , can not on its own determine their interests since , if it did , that would amount to laying upon children of CARDINAL and CARDINAL the responsibility of deciding where they should live .", "PERSON can not secure ratification of a factual situation that has arisen from the use of force by merely relying on the passing of time . That being so , his application must quite simply be dismissed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has gone to GPE CARDINAL times in the hope of meeting her children .", "CARDINAL . Several attempts were made to execute the decision of DATE but without success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bailiff went to ORG 's home , accompanied by the applicant , her lawyer , a locksmith and CARDINAL policemen . Only PERSON 's wife ORG and a guard dog were at the house . ORG , a NORP national , indicated that she would only allow the bailiff to inspect the house if a representative from the NORP embassy was present . The applicant and her lawyer therefore went to the NORP embassy , where the NORP consul , T. , and an interpreter agreed to accompany them to ORG home .", "CARDINAL . During the applicant 's absence , but while the policemen and the bailiff were still on the spot , ORG and an uncle of his , PERSON , entered the house . When the applicant returned , accompanied by ORG and the interpreter , ORG allowed those present , with the exception of the applicant , to search the LOC . As the dog was very fierce , the search was carried out hastily and the girls were not found . PERSON remained out of sight during the search .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the NORP Minister of Justice to complain of the course of events on DATE . She requested the Minister to lodge a criminal complaint against ORG for failure to comply with a court decision . Asserting that she had no news of her daughters , she also asked him to institute criminal proceedings against GPE , ORG and PERSON for ill - treatment of minors , false imprisonment and , if applicable , homicide .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bailiff , the applicant , her lawyer and CARDINAL police officers again went to ORG 's home . Finding no one there , they spoke to a neighbour , who told them that ORG had left with the children on DATE . The group then went to the home of G.A. , an uncle of ORG , with whom ORG and the children sometimes lived . There they found PERSON and the same guard dog . PERSON told them that he had not seen either ORG or the children since DATE . As to the dog , he told the bailiff that ORG had bought it to protect his daughters .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant that ORG had lodged a criminal complaint against ORG with the appropriate public prosecutor 's office .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE ORG informed ORG that numerous approaches had been made to the police to locate the children , but to no avail , as ORG had withdrawn the children from school . The letter also stated that the NORP authorities had lodged a criminal complaint against ORG ill - treatment of minors . Lastly , ORG acknowledged that PERSON 's bad faith was obvious and gave an assurance that it would continue to support the applicant in her endeavours .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a group composed of the applicant , her lawyer , a representative from ORG , CARDINAL bailiffs , QUANTITY police officers and an official from the NORP embassy in GPE went to ORG 's home . The group was able to inspect the house but did not find the children there . During the TIME discussion which followed , ORG stated that the girls were in GPE , but he refused to say more . He nevertheless promised to produce them to ORG on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . A report drawn up by the NORP embassy in GPE on the visit of CARDINAL DATE states :", "\u201c Contrary to what had been announced by PERSON [ of ORG ] before this search , PERSON was not arrested by the police for failure to return the children . In the course of the intervention the public prosecutor 's office , with which Mrs. PERSON was in touch by telephone , reconsidered its position and refused to have ORG brought before it . This change of mind was probably due to an intervention by Mr. PERSON , a very influential lawyer , after he had been alerted by his client GPE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Neither PERSON nor the children kept the appointment on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence , ORG received an official request to report to ORG with his children on CARDINAL DATE , with a view to interviewing the children in the presence of their mother . On CARDINAL DATE only PERSON , PERSON 's lawyer , went to ORG and reiterated his client 's refusal to produce the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a fresh attempt to execute the judgment was made . The applicant , her lawyer and a bailiff went to ORG 's home . Only the bailiff and the applicant 's lawyer were allowed in by the CARDINAL policemen from the sixth district who were already on the spot , the applicant being requested to stay outside . According to ORG and the policemen , the children were not in the house . The bailiff , however , was not allowed to check those assertions for himself . Shortly afterwards a police inspector whom neither the CARDINAL police officers nor the bailiff knew arrived and asked GPE to produce the children to him on DATE . PERSON finally accepted a proposal from the applicant 's lawyer that he should produce the children at TIME DATE at the bailiffs ' office at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff , the applicant and her lawyer waited for ORG in vain . A report was drawn up on that occasion .", "DATE . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the NORP Minister of Justice informed his NORP counterpart of the applicant 's fears that the NORP police were turning a blind eye to PERSON 's conduct . He therefore asked him to intervene with the NORP police to ensure that they did everything possible to secure the children 's return to their mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant met her daughters for the first time for DATE . The meeting lasted TIME and took place in GPE in the staffroom of the children 's school , where GPE was himself a teacher .", "CARDINAL . The meeting was attended by a bailiff , CARDINAL senior officials from ORG , the NORP Consul - General in GPE , CARDINAL officers from police headquarters , the headmaster and deputy headmaster of the school and the girls ' CARDINAL form teachers . According to the report drawn up by the bailiff on that occasion , the purpose of the meeting was to convince those present of the girls ' refusal to return to their mother .", "CARDINAL . When she saw the applicant , PERSON tried to run away and threatened to throw herself out of the window if she was compelled to have dealings with her mother . There followed , without the applicant being present , a discussion in which PERSON stated that her mother had lied to them and done a great deal of harm . She reiterated her wish to stay with her father and never to see her mother again .", "CARDINAL . As to PERSON , she began to cry and shouted to the applicant to go away , saying that she never wanted to see her again . Her form teacher took the initiative of terminating the interview so as not to traumatise the girl . Once the girls had been removed by the form teachers , the applicant said she no longer insisted on execution of the order of DATE and asked the headmaster to keep her regularly informed of her daughters ' performance at school .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG , GPE 's ORG , informed ORG , GPE 's ORG , of its decision to order that the children should not be returned . The reason for that decision was the children 's obstinate refusal to see their mother again , which had been apparent at the meeting of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG sent the applicant the girls ' average marks for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE to ORG the applicant complained that the headmaster had not honoured his promise to keep her regularly informed of her daughters ' school results and expressed her disappointment at the paucity of the information supplied on DATE .
