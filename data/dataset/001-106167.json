The applicants , husband and wife , were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At QUANTITY on DATE ORG , the wife of PERSON ( the applicants\u2019 son ) and PERSON , a family acquaintance , informed the police that PERSON had committed suicide by hanging himself in the bathroom in his flat .", "CARDINAL . Having arrived at ORG flat , the police examined the scene of the incident and drew up a report , noting that by the time of their arrival PERSON \u2019s body was lying on the bathroom floor , fully dressed in outdoor clothes without any recent damage to them . He had no visible injuries , except strangulation marks on his neck and an abrasion on his hand . The strangulation marks were uneven ( CARDINAL on the right side and CARDINAL on the left ) and particularly visible on the front of the neck . A self - tightening loop of grey synthetic cord was found near the body and another fragment of analogous cord was tied to the middle of a horizontal water supply pipe QUANTITY above the floor . The flat was in good order and no signs of any struggle could be found either on the body or anywhere in the flat . Following the examination , the police took away the cord .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police also took written statements from GPE ( the family acquaintance ) and PERSON ( a neighbour whose telephone had been used to call the police ) . PERSON told the police that he knew PERSON and his family and lived in the neighbourhood . At QUANTITY N.K. ( ORG wife ) had rung his door and requested his help in breaking into her locked bathroom . She explained that her husband had come home drunk at TIME , had locked himself in the bathroom and had been crying loudly . She had attempted to break the door open with an axe , but to no avail . PERSON had then followed ORG to her flat , broken open the bathroom door with a chisel , and had seen PERSON suspended by his neck from the pipe . PERSON and PERSON had cut the cord and had placed ORG body on the floor . They had called the police and an ambulance and had attempted to resuscitate PERSON However , PERSON had already died . PERSON ( the neighbour ) stated to the police that at TIME had asked him to call an ambulance , as her husband had hung himself . He had entered the flat at ORG \u2019s invitation and had seen the body already placed on the floor .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE , an autopsy of PERSON \u2019s body took place . According to the resulting findings , he died of mechanical asphyxia caused by hanging .", "CARDINAL . On DATE further results of the forensic examination of PERSON \u2019s body were received , according to which PERSON had been moderately intoxicated by alcohol ( PERCENT ) at the time of his death . The expert report stated that there had been no other injuries or abnormalities on his body .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON ( PERSON wife ) stated that shortly before his death her husband had shared with her that he had a lover , who had fallen pregnant , and that he was worried about the debt owed by his father to company S. On DATE of the incident , he had come home at TIME with FAC . , an acquaintance . They had both been rather drunk . After a little while , ORG , GPE and PERSON ( their DATE daughter ) had accompanied D.Sh . out and had returned home . The daughter had gone to bed , while PERSON and PERSON had been drinking coffee in the kitchen until TIME At some point in time , they had been interrupted by a visit from ORG , another acquaintance , who had been looking for FAC . , and , having learned that he had already gone , ORG had left immediately . Subsequently , PERSON had gone to the bathroom . Worried about his long absence , ORG had called for him and had received no answer . She had attempted to break into the bathroom with a kitchen axe , but had been unsuccessful . Thinking that PERSON may have fallen asleep , she had gone to get the help of PERSON , who lived nearby and who was well respected by her husband .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigative department of ORG in PERSON ( \u201c ORG Office \u201d ) decided not to institute criminal proceedings into the circumstances of PERSON \u2019s death , having found it sufficiently established that he had deliberately taken his own life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG requesting further investigation . They noted , in particular , that they had suspected ORG , allegedly their son \u2019s wife \u2019s lover and who had visited the family shortly before PERSON \u2019s death , of having strangled PERSON , potentially in connection with a property dispute between the spouses , who had been planning to divorce . They drew the prosecutor \u2019s attention to certain facts which appeared peculiar to them : in particular , PERSON \u2019s being dressed in a jacket after having allegedly been home for TIME ; contradictory evidence as to the existence of an abrasion ( possibly from the cord ) on PERSON \u2019s hand ; and the failure of the investigative authorities to examine the cord and to take away the axe and the chisel . Subsequently , on many occasions throughout the investigation , the applicants continued to suggest that PERSON could have been intentionally strangled with the cord and then placed in the bathroom , the hanging being imitated . Alternatively , he could have been poisoned by narcotic or psychotropic substances and incited to commit suicide . They alleged that the persons potentially implicated in the murder included his wife , her parents , and her lover ( FAC ) and subsequently GPE , a neighbour who had been on bad terms with PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c ORG Office \u201d ) quashed the decision of DATE and ordered additional inquiry . It reprimanded ORG , in particular , for not having served the applicants with its decision of CARDINAL DATE and not letting them access the inquiry materials . They further instructed the investigators , in particular , to question : the applicants in order to verify the probability of the applicants\u2019 assertions concerning the murder being correct ; the CARDINAL acquaintances , who visited the family before PERSON \u2019s death ( PERSON . and ORG ) ; relatives of ORG ; and CARDINAL neighbours who had acted as lay witnesses during the examination of the scene of the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new decision not to institute criminal proceedings was taken , the text of which did not reflect whether ORG Office \u2019s instructions had been carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG annulled this decision , having found that the investigation had been perfunctory . On DATE it further addressed a letter to ORG , noting that the case - file documents had not been kept in order , as required by the applicable document processing rules , which also stipulated procedures regarding stitching and numbering . In addition , it gave detailed instructions as to further investigative actions to be taken . It ordered , in particular , that : the cord be examined and where PERSON had taken it from be determined ; PERSON \u2019s colleagues be questioned concerning his moods and affairs ; his wife \u2019s allegations about his involvement with his father \u2019s alleged debts and his alleged lover \u2019s pregnancy be investigated ; why PERSON had been wearing a jacket be determined ; and whether PERSON wife and ORG had had a love affair and whether this could have played a role in PERSON \u2019s death be assessed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took a fresh decision not to institute criminal proceedings . It noted , in particular , that PERSON wife had stated during additional questioning of her that she had never had an affair with ORG and that there had been no conflicts in the family in this respect , while PERSON wearing of a jacket was explained by his regular habit of dining in outdoor clothes . The prosecutor \u2019s office further referred to a statement of ORG minor daughter ( PERSON ) confirming that FAC , who had indeed visited them during TIME , had left the flat long before her father \u2019s death . In addition , it found that the first applicant had not had financial problems involving his son in any way .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG annulled this decision , having found that its instructions had not been duly carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator , PERSON , reported to ORG that it had not been possible to examine the cord , as , contrary to his expectations , for unexplained reasons it was absent from the safe and could not be found anywhere .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a fresh decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings was taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to court . They noted that the investigation had failed to examine whether the pipe had contained any friction marks attesting to the suspension of a heavy , jerking body from it and whether the bathroom door could have been locked from the outside after the dead body had been placed within it . It had further failed to reconcile contradictions between various data concerning an abrasion on PERSON hand . In addition , the applicants alleged that their granddaughter had initially told them that FAC ( ORG \u2019s alleged lover ) and PERSON ( a neighbour , with whom PERSON had allegedly been on bad terms ) had been in their house shortly before PERSON \u2019s death , and that she had heard sounds of an argument , followed by a cry and then the sound of running water .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants amended their appeal , submitting that they had been unable to present full arguments earlier , having been denied access to the case file . They further pinpointed various contradictions between ORG \u2019s , ORG , ORG and Y.M. \u2019s statements and suggested that they had earlier seen a cord , similar to that by which PERSON had been strangled , near ORG \u2019s car . They further noted that the case file had not contained their son \u2019s wife \u2019s and their granddaughter \u2019s statements which had been given shortly after the incident , and that the investigation had baselessly affirmed that there were no traces of narcotic or psychotropic substances in PERSON \u2019s blood , while in fact this point had never been examined . They further contended that the information concerning an abrasion on PERSON \u2019s hand , together with the finding that there were CARDINAL strangulation marks on CARDINAL side and CARDINAL on the other side of PERSON \u2019s neck , could signify that PERSON had attempted to defend himself from an intruder trying to strangle him . The applicants also alleged that they had been called on the phone and threatened by strangers , and that the people involved in their son \u2019s death could have included his wife , her lover and her parents , and PERSON ( a neighbour ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in PERSON annulled the decision of DATE . It noted , in particular , that ORG had failed to examine all relevant facts and collect evidence in accordance with the instructions of ORG , and it remitted the case for additional inquiry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took a fresh decision not to institute criminal proceedings , relying , in essence , on the same arguments as in the previous decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG annulled this decision , noting that no additional actions had been carried out .", "CARDINAL . Following this decision , in DATE the investigative authorities carried out additional questioning of various witnesses , including PERSON daughter ( PERSON ) , who confirmed her mother \u2019s statements , and PERSON ( the acquaintance , who helped to open the bathroom door and take PERSON off the pipe ) , who noted that when he had entered the bathroom , PERSON had been suspended from the pipe , his legs QUANTITY above the floor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE ORG took fresh decisions not to institute criminal proceedings , all of them subsequently being quashed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG annulled the lastmentioned decision , having found that the investigation was incomplete . In particular , it noted that there were still contradictory sources of evidence with regard to the hand injury . The case was transferred to ORG for further handling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again decided not to institute criminal proceedings . However , the applicants continued to lodge various complaints with the authorities , including complaints that they had been unlawfully denied access to the case file and that the investigation had failed to properly examine an audio - recording of a conversation they had had with their granddaughter and to incorporate it into the body of evidence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to their complaints , some additional actions were carried out , including : a request that PERSON wife to allow the re - examination of her home , which she refused on the basis that she had already renovated the bathroom ; and an additional questioning of the medical expert , who had recorded that PERSON had not had any injuries on his hand . The authorities further noted that the questioning of another expert witness involved was no longer possible , as that expert witness had died .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused an application by the applicants for reopening of the investigation , having informed them , in particular , that no statements by PERSON wife and daugther were missing from the case file , as they had first been questioned on DATE and DATE respectively . It also noted that in accordance with LAW of DATE , the cord had been deliberately destroyed .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ordzhonikidzevskiy ORG in GPE quashed the preceding decision not to institute criminal proceedings . It noted , in particular , that the investigation had been onesided ; the authorities focusing entirely on whether the explanation of suicide was probable . There had been no comprehensive and coherent analysis of the probability or improbability of the ORG allegation of imitated hanging preceded by intentional strangling . In particular , the investigative authorities had failed to establish the manner of PERSON \u2019s hanging and had not reconciled various contradictions in the evidence in this respect . Information which had not been uncovered included details of the position of PERSON \u2019s body ; the capacity of the water supply pipe to withstand the weight of his body being suspended from it , particularly with regard being had to its sudden jerk from the bathtub edge ; PERSON \u2019s technical ability to prepare and complete the hanging , given the level of alcohol in his blood ; and the nature and origins of the abrasion on his hand . The court also noted that the authorities had negligently failed to take away and examine the chisel and the axe .", "CARDINAL . On DATE TIME . , CARDINAL of the lay witnesses who had signed the report of the examination of the scene on DATE , refused to report for questioning , alleging , in particular , that he was very ill and could no longer recall the relevant details .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a fresh decision not to institute criminal proceedings was taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the decision , having found that its previous instructions had remained largely not followed and that the manner of PERSON hanging had not been established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new decision not to institute criminal proceedings was taken . As noted in that decision , it had been no longer possible to examine relevant physical evidence , as the bathroom had been renovated and such objects as the axe , the chisel , and the cord had not been available . However , regard being had to the available materials , particularly to the witness statements , it was found that it would not have been possible to place a strangled body into the bathroom and lock the door from the outside . Rather than jumping from the bathtub edge , PERSON had either leaned against it or touched the floor with his feet , his incomplete hanging explaining the distribution of his weight , which would have been able to be supported by the water supply pipe . His alcohol intoxication being moderate , he ought not to have lost his judgment to the point of not being able to hang himself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision , having noted that he had lodged it outside the statutory time - limit without having a valid justification for his failure to meet the deadline . In any event , the court held that the investigative authorities had used up all the means reasonably available to them to examine the situation and that it was not likely that any further investigation would bring new results or secure evidence in support of the ORG allegation that PERSON could have been murdered .", "CARDINAL . NORP The parties did not inform the ORG whether this decision was appealed any further .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the LAW and LAW can be found in the judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no .
