The purpose of the operation was to arrest PERSON and an accomplice , PERSON . There was an exchange of fire during which PERSON and a police officer were killed and another police officer and a railway employee were wounded . PERSON was arrested . Afterwards PERSON \u2019s body was taken to ORG , where he was pronounced dead .", "On DATE Professor PERSON of ORG submitted his autopsy report to ORG . He stated in his report that PERSON had died from a bullet which had passed through his brain from right to left and from loss of blood due to CARDINAL other bullets fired through his abdomen .", "On DATE the applicants filed an application to join criminal proceedings ( PERSON ) against persons unknown for the murder of their son .", "The public prosecutor \u2019s office then instructed Professor PERSON to prepare CARDINAL further expert reports on the firearms used during the operation in question and on certain particular aspects of PERSON \u2019s wounds . Those reports were submitted DATE .", "On DATE Professor PERSON of ORG in GPE submitted a second autopsy report ( ORG ) , at the request of PERSON \u2019s parents , in which he too concluded that PERSON had died as a result of a shot fired through his head . He also agreed with the conclusions of the first autopsy report .", "On DATE the GPE police submitted an interim ballistics report .", "ORG also instructed Professor PERSON of ORG to prepare CARDINAL further interim expert reports on ORG \u2019s injuries and imprints ( Spurengutachten ) . Those reports were filed DATE .", "On DATE ORG began an investigation in respect of CARDINAL members of ORG who , according to a witness named PERSON , had been right next to PERSON when he was lying on one of the tracks at Bad PERSON station after falling to the ground .", "On DATE Professor PERSON submitted a supplementary expert report on the marks found on the clothes of the police officers who had taken part in the operation ( Spurengutachten ) . According to him , CARDINAL jacket had traces of ORG \u2019s blood on it , but it had not been possible to determine with certainty how they had appeared .", "On DATE and CARDINAL and DATE the GPE police forensic laboratory submitted interim reports on , among other things , the projectiles found at the place where the operation had been carried out and the cause of PERSON \u2019s wounds .", "On DATE Professor PERSON submitted his general report in which he addressed , among other things , the question whether the fatal gunshot had been fired by PERSON himself or by another person . He concluded that the trajectory of the bullet was typical of a suicide and that the evidence did not point to an accident ( unfallbedingte LOC ) . In his opinion , the fact that there were very few traces of blood on PERSON \u2019s gun , from which the fatal shot had been fired , meant that it had fallen to the ground before it could be sprayed with the blood and tissue ( Spray aus Blut- und Gewebsteilen ) caused by the penetration of the bullet . It necessarily followed that his hand had been immediately paralysed , as was usual after this type of suicide . Furthermore , if the fatal shot had been fired by another person , that person \u2019s clothes would have been spattered with blood and tissue , whereas the investigations had not yielded any findings of that kind .", "In a letter of DATE Professor ORG , a ballistics expert , stated that the bullets which had hit PERSON in the abdomen had been fired from a distance of QUANTITY . In a further expert report ( of DATE ) he concluded that the grazes found on the victim \u2019s hand had in all likelihood been caused by the ballast on which he was lying .", "On DATE Professor PERSON , Director of ORG , submitted an expert report in which he concluded that , having regard to the results of the autopsy carried out on PERSON , he would still have been capable , after falling onto the track , of shooting himself in the head with the bullet which killed him .", "On DATE the GPE police forensic laboratory submitted a full expert report on the circumstances of PERSON \u2019s death .", "On DATE ORG decided to discontinue the proceedings under LAW of LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . It drew the conclusion that the police officers had shot PERSON in self - defence and that PERSON had himself fired the bullet which went through his head , with the intention of killing himself . The public prosecutor \u2019s office based that conclusion on a CARDINAL-page report ( Abschlu\u00dfvermerk ) in which the special unit in charge of investigating the case had given an account of all its inquiries . The report stated , among other things , that during the course of those inquiries evidence had been heard from CARDINAL witnesses .", "On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG of ORG ( \u201c the Principal Public Prosecutor \u201d ) against the decision to discontinue the case . On DATE they filed pleadings in support of their appeal , attaching CARDINAL expert reports prepared at the request of the applicants by Professor PERSON , Director of ORG .", "In the first report , dated DATE , Professor PERSON concluded that as a result of a certain number of serious flaws in the investigation it was no longer possible to determine with certainty whether the fatal shot had been fired by PERSON himself or by another person . With regard to the arguments advanced by Professor PERSON , he considered that , since the gun in question had indeed been spattered with blood after the shot had been fired , it was scientifically impossible to conclude that ORG had committed suicide ; as for the finding that no clothes had been spattered with blood or tissue , this had been contradicted by Professor PERSON . In short , it was impossible to prove that PERSON had committed suicide and impossible to rule out the theory that another person had fired the fatal shot . As the evidence stood , it was not possible to reach a definite conclusion . Lastly , Professor PERSON suggested examining how the grazes on the back of PERSON \u2019s right hand had been caused and checking how the distance from which the shots had been fired had been measured , as this appeared open to criticism from a scientific point of view .", "In his second expert report ( ORG ) , dated DATE , Professor PERSON concluded that the grazes and redness found on the back of PERSON \u2019s right hand could have been inflicted by the tip of the hammer of PERSON \u2019s gun while someone was attempting to wrest it from him ( streifender FAC Hahnende i MONEY ) .", "Furthermore , in their pleadings filed in support of their appeal , the applicants complained of certain flaws in the investigation which proved , in their opinion , that there had been a deliberate attempt to cover up evidence as to what had actually happened . They gave as examples the fact that ORG \u2019s hands had been washed on his arrival at FAC , that an analysis of the fingerprints on PERSON \u2019s gun had been ordered too DATE after they had been obliterated DATE and that the jacket of CARDINAL of the police officers , which had bloodstains on it , had disappeared .", "On DATE Professor PERSON made observations , at the request of ORG , on the expert reports submitted by Professor PERSON on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . According to Professor PERSON , Professor PERSON had based his conclusions on numerous inaccurate findings ( Ankn\u00fcpfungspunkte ) and there were a number of contradictions in his reasoning , so there were no grounds for revising the conclusions of the expert report of DATE .", "On DATE the applicants sent ORG observations ( PERSON ) by Professor PERSON , dated DATE , on the expert report submitted by Professor PERSON on DATE . Professor PERSON confirmed his previous conclusions that it was impossible to prove that it had been suicide just as it was impossible to rule out the theory that another person had been involved . He also maintained that someone could have wrenched PERSON \u2019s gun out of his grasp .", "On DATE ORG confirmed the decision to discontinue the case . For murder to be made out , it would , in his opinion , have been necessary for CARDINAL of the police officers to have grabbed hold of PERSON \u2019s gun during the exchange of shots between PERSON and the police quad chasing him . None of the witnesses , however , had made a statement to that effect . Despite the fact that the evidence of certain police officers had to be treated with care and despite a number of residual doubts , the conclusion drawn by ORG , namely that PERSON had committed suicide , appeared not only possible , but highly probable . It did not , in any event , contradict the available evidence . Moreover , the investigation had not revealed any evidence on which to bring a charge against CARDINAL of the police officers or any other person . Lastly , there was nothing to suggest that a further investigative measure DATE and , in particular , a further expert report DATE would reveal conclusive fresh evidence .", "With regard to Professor PERSON \u2019s conclusions in particular , ORG considered that they were not such as to justify reopening the investigation . The forensic experts disagreed about the course of events and Professor PERSON himself had merely stated that his conclusion was more likely than the others , without thereby suggesting that the others were wholly improbable . Given those reservations , the situation did not merit reversing the decision of ORG to discontinue the case .", "ORG acknowledged that the statements of the police officers heard as witnesses contradicted each other on many points , but considered that the situation could no longer be remedied at that stage by ordering a further investigative measure . He also accepted that an error had been committed in not ordering a thorough examination of PERSON \u2019s hands , which had instead been washed as soon as he had arrived at the hospital . Likewise , an inquiry as to why PERSON \u2019s hands had been washed before they could be examined should have been ordered . However , a further investigative measure would not , in ORG view , remedy the consequences of those errors .", "The same was true of the fact that a biological test had been carried out on PERSON \u2019s gun before the fingerprints had been taken , since a further investigative measure could not bring back fingerprints which had disappeared as a result of an error . Lastly , ORG did not consider it conclusive that the jacket of one of the police officers had disappeared from the premises of the GPE police laboratory since it had disappeared after that department had carried out all the scientific tests .", "On DATE Professor PERSON made observations , at the request of ORG , on the expert reports submitted by Professor PERSON . According to Professor PERSON , the grazes found on PERSON \u2019s hand could not have been caused merely by someone seizing his gun . They were more likely to have been caused by sharp objects , in this case the ballast on which PERSON had been lying after his fall and against which his hand had rubbed while he was being picked up so that he could be taken to hospital .", "On DATE Professor PERSON made observations on the decision of ORG upholding the decision to discontinue the case . He explained and confirmed the theories set out in his previous expert reports .", "On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG under LAW ORG against the decision of ORG . They requested that CARDINAL members of ORG be charged .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal . It pointed out that under LAW ORG there had to exist a sufficient suspicion ( hinreichender PERSON ) against a person for a prosecution to be brought . For that to be established there had to be a greater probability , in the light of the results of the preliminary investigation , that the person in question would be convicted than acquitted , which was not so in the present case .", "ORG took as the point of departure for its reasoning the fact that the victim had been killed by a shot fired from his own gun , which had been placed against the victim \u2019s right temple or in that immediate area . For murder to be made out , someone would have to have seized the gun . There was nothing in the investigation to show that that had happened . The investigation had established that throughout the police ORG pursuit of PERSON they had been at a distance of QUANTITY from the victim . The gun could not therefore have been seized from him during that stage of the events . Furthermore , it had not been established that someone had seized the gun while PERSON was lying on the track following his fall after the shots had been fired at him : none of the witnesses had seen anyone take hold of the victim \u2019s gun and none of the experts \u2013 who had , moreover , come to diverging conclusions \u2013 had been able to state , on the balance of probabilities ( mit der hier erforderlichen \u00fcberwiegenden GPE ) , that that was what had happened . Whereas Professor PERSON had ruled out the possibility that the grazes on the back of PERSON \u2019s hand had been caused by someone violently seizing his gun , Professor PERSON had come to the opposite conclusion , while acknowledging that another possible explanation for the wounds was that in order to take PERSON to the hospital it had first been necessary to free his right hand , which was trapped between the ballast and his buttocks . Professor PERSON , for his part , had mooted a third explanation relating to a subsequent phase in the events , while Professor PERSON had concluded that it was \u201c highly unlikely \u201d ( h\u00f6chst unwahrscheinlich ) that someone had violently seized PERSON \u2019s gun .", "Even if it were conceded , ORG went on , that someone had violently seized the gun , it would still be necessary , in order to explain the injury to PERSON \u2019s temple , for that person to have shot him by placing the barrel of the gun against his temple while he was lying on the track , a scenario which had not been confirmed by the investigation either . Most of the witnesses had stated that after the exchange of shots between the police officers and PERSON and PERSON \u2019s fall they had heard no further shots . Moreover , the investigation had revealed that the victim had been hit by CARDINAL bullets fired from a distance of QUANTITY : CARDINAL bullets had gone through the victim horizontally and CARDINAL had travelled upwards through his body . In order to have fired the shot which hit the victim \u2019s temple , a police officer would have to have been right next to him on his left - hand side after he had fallen down . None of the witnesses , however , had seen a police officer bend down to the left of PERSON at that moment . On the contrary , all of them had stated that the QUANTITY police officers posted next to PERSON at that moment had been holding their guns well above PERSON \u2019s head .", "Admittedly , CARDINAL witnesses claimed to have seen those QUANTITY police officers use their guns at that moment . Their evidence , however , was both incomplete and in blatant contradiction with other aspects of the investigation and therefore unreliable . This was particularly the case of witness PERSON , who , during questioning , had given CARDINAL different and contradictory versions of events . Furthermore , each version had contained elements which were incompatible with objective and verified evidence gathered in the investigation . With regard to witness J. , whose statement had consisted merely in a telephone call to ORG , it had not been possible to establish his identity with certainty and it had therefore not been possible to check his evidence , parts of which , moreover , blatantly conflicted with some of the objective evidence . Lastly , witness PERSON claimed to have seen everything without , however , being able to give a plausible explanation for his presence at Bad PERSON station at the material time . The explanation he had given , namely that he was on his way to a friend \u2019s house , had been contradicted by the friend .", "ORG held , on the other hand , that all the evidence in its possession supported the conclusion that PERSON had committed suicide . This was borne out by , among other things , the quantity of blood found on the gun and the position of PERSON \u2019s head . Furthermore , the traces of blood on the victim \u2019s temple suggested that the shot had been fired before he was lying completely flat , which supported the supposition that he had killed himself while falling backwards under the effect of his wounds . That theory was confirmed by the fact that , according to all the witnesses , PERSON had remained motionless after his fall . The fact that none of the witnesses had seen the victim shoot himself in the head could be explained by the fact that many events had been happening at the same time ( PERSON ) and that from where they were standing the witnesses could see only the victim \u2019s left arm whereas he had used his right hand to fire the shot .", "Lastly , ORG considered that even if PERSON \u2019s hands had been examined , that would not have provided evidence on which to bring a charge of murder since they had necessarily borne the traces ( PERSON ) of the CARDINAL shots he had fired at the police officers . As for any fingerprints which might have been found on PERSON \u2019s gun , they would not necessarily have proved that someone had shot him because they might also have been placed there while the gun was being carried away . Lastly , it was of no consequence that the jacket of one of the police officers had disappeared in GPE since the other evidence gathered during the investigation had ruled out the possibility that the shot could have been fired by a person other than PERSON himself .", "In conclusion , ORG found that it had been proved with a degree of probability approaching certainty ( mit an Sicherheit grenzenden PERSON ) that PERSON had killed himself as he fell onto the track . The argument advanced by the applicants therefore lacked the degree of probability necessary for a reopening of the investigation to be ordered .", "On an appeal by the applicants , ORG decided on DATE not to examine the case .", "Under LAW and LAW ( GPE \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) the public prosecutor \u2019s office must prosecute ( ORG ) a suspect if the results of the investigation justify instituting criminal proceedings . It does so by lodging an indictment ( PERSON ) with the appropriate court . If the results of the investigation do not justify instituting criminal proceedings , the public prosecutor \u2019s office discontinues the case ( Einstellung des PERSON ) .", "Article CARDINAL ORG governs appeals which , in proceedings to enforce a prosecution ( ORG ) , can be brought by a civil party against a decision to discontinue a case . The civil party can first lodge an appeal ( Beschwerde ) with the member of the public prosecutor \u2019s office immediately superior to the one who decided to discontinue the case . If that appeal is dismissed , the civil party can request ORG to rule on whether a charge can be brought ( Antrag auf gerichtliche GPE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
