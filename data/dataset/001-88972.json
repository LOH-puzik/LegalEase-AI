NORP The experts inspected the file on the criminal proceedings and ORG medical records . On DATE they submitted their report , concluding as follows :", "\u201c The medical records as a whole and the interviews of those who came into contact with Mr Renolde indicate the following :", "\u2013 He had acute psychotic disorders at the time of his arrival in GPE d\u2019Arcy , and those disorders seem to have receded fairly quickly as a result of the medication prescribed . In any event , there is little mention of these delusional factors in later observations , although a prison warder observed that Mr Renolde talked to himself at TIME ( hallucinatory dialogue ? ) . The PERSON team found his psychiatric condition to be compatible with detention , not requiring admission to a psychiatric institution . The letter which the prisoner sent his parents on DATE shows that he retained a certain degree of coherence , although he may have been keeping his delirium or hallucinatory disorders to himself .", "\u2013 There is no evidence in the file indicating the presence of a depressive syndrome as such : no sign of carelessness , no expression of suicidal thoughts , no manifest sadness , apart from , of course , a legitimate gloom or sadness linked to incarceration , separation from his children , etc . ...", "Having regard to the context and to the information in our possession , we consider that his committing suicide was more the consequence of a psychotic disorder than of a depressive syndrome . The act may have taken place in a hallucinatory state ( it appears that he sometimes heard voices telling him to kill himself ) , especially if the medication had not been correctly taken , as the toxicological examinations show .", "It is to be noted that the response of the PERSON team , which intervened from the outset following a suicide attempt , was to prescribe neuroleptics and not antidepressants , which confirms the psychotic nature . These disorders could perhaps have called for a discussion of the advisability of admission to a psychiatric unit if the hallucinatory , dissociative and delusional aspects had been prominent and hence incompatible with continued detention . However , seeing that the disorders rapidly improved , it may be felt that continued detention remained possible in so far as the ORG kept the prisoner under very close observation , although supervision of his DATE taking of medication would also have been helpful .", "Conclusions :", "( CARDINAL ) Mr PERSON was suffering from psychotic disorders at the time of his arrival in FAC . His psychotic disorders were described as an acute delirious episode by the PERSON team and he made an initial suicide attempt on DATE by phlebotomy . The suicide attempt may have taken the form of self - mutilation in a delusional state . It is also legitimate to wonder whether his assault on a warder , in DATE that followed , was not likewise part of a pathological acting - out process . A course of neuroleptic treatment was immediately started , which seems to have been effective in that PERSON speech became more coherent . At the same time , he was placed in the punishment block . If his state of health was compatible with detention , we do not consider that placement in the punishment block could actually have worsened his psychological condition , since the dominant disorders were not depressive but psychotic . It remains to be determined whether such disorders could have been treated satisfactorily in detention , bearing in mind that the medication was handed to the prisoner only twice a week and thus left at his disposal . In view of his lack of awareness of the disorders , it would perhaps have been preferable to have supplied him with the medication every day and to have supervised his taking it .", "( CARDINAL ) If no medicinal substance was found in the toxicological examinations , it can only be concluded that the prisoner refrained deliberately ( or in a state of delirium ) from taking his medication ( anxiolytics and neuroleptics ) . It can not therefore be ruled out that this poor medicine compliance might have contributed to the suicide , which may have been committed in a state of delirium . However , even if PERSON was no longer under medication , none of the members of the team , including the nurse who met him on DATE of his suicide , noted any resurgence of delirium , any incoherent behaviour or any major signs of dissociation . The suicide attempt can not be solely ascribed to psychotic disorders . It may quite conceivably have taken place at a time of legitimate despair or sadness in a person who readily resorted to acting - out ( suicide attempt on DATE , assault on DATE , suicide on DATE ) .", "( CARDINAL ) On DATE the ORG team treated an injury which ORG had intentionally inflicted to his forearm with a razor blade in a moment of delirium . The practitioners attending to PERSON did not observe any sign of depression but manifest psychotic disorders involving delirium , hallucination , the listening attitude , etc ...", "( CARDINAL ) Having regard to the information in our possession , we did not consider it necessary to meet the ORG staff and the members of the PERSON team .", "( CARDINAL ) This prisoner \u2019s suicide was not foreseeable , at least in the short term , in so far as he did not display any suicidal intentions , no manifest depressive syndrome was present , and he was regularly monitored by the ORG staff and had been seen DATE by a nurse , who did not report anything abnormal in his behaviour . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

He was seen nearly CARDINAL times by that service DATE . His suicide attempt on DATE prompted the ORG team to intervene and to prescribe medication , which alleviated Mr Renolde \u2019s psychotic disorders . The ORG staff found his psychiatric condition to be compatible with detention , including in a punishment cell , since it did not decide to admit him to a psychiatric institution .", "The experts did not find any evidence in the subject \u2019s psychiatric records suggesting the presence of a depressive syndrome .

In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the ruling that there was no case to answer , holding as follows :", "\u201c Following the prescription of neuroleptic medication by the medical service , no further signs of aggression towards others or himself were observed on the part of ORG after the incident of DATE until TIME DATE . The medication prescribed was therefore effective during that period .", "It was decided by the medical authorities in the present case that ORG should be allowed to administer his own treatment after being supplied with several days\u2019 medication . There was a distribution on DATE . The expert toxicological report established that the prisoner had not taken the medication supplied to him .", "ORG medication was thus administered in accordance with the regulations set out in the circular of CARDINAL DATE on the provision of health care for prisoners . Since the principle that medication is taken freely by the prisoner was observed in ORG case , it can not be concluded on the basis of the evidence available prior to the TIME of DATE that the failure to depart from this principle constituted negligence within the meaning of Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW on the part of any doctor or member of the medical staff of FAC . Since the time of ORG placement in a punishment cell , no suicide risk or serious behavioural disorder had been identified ; nor was there any suspicion of incorrect use of medication .", "Accordingly , as regards the actions of the prison staff , neither the investigation nor the additional inquiries have found any potential evidence of negligence within the meaning of Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW .", "Nor did the imposition of a disciplinary sanction on ORG constitute a manifestly deliberate breach of a special statutory or regulatory duty of safety or care exposing the prisoner to an immediate risk of death or injury . The same applies to the fact of not checking that the medication was taken . No provision prohibited the imposition of a disciplinary sanction in ORG case or [ dictated ] that he should be compelled to take his medication .", "Lastly , no evidence from the investigation or the additional inquiries supports the conclusion that anyone deliberately refrained from providing or ensuring the provision of assistance to ORG , who had been prescribed medication and had not caused any particular incident for DATE . \u201d", "The civil parties did not appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL .
