The applicant was born in DATE and lives in LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment for serious crimes including attempted murder , which carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment . Under the legislative regime applicable at the time , he became eligible for release on parole on DATE and entitled to release on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG recommended the applicant 's release on parole on the grounds that the risk to the public had been significantly reduced ; that the proposed resettlement plan would secure his rehabilitation ; and that the applicant would comply with the licence conditions .", "CARDINAL . Under the legislation in force at the time , the final decision on early release in cases involving prisoners serving determinate sentences ( i.e. fixed - term sentences ) of DATE imprisonment lay with the Secretary of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . For prisoners serving determinate sentences of DATE and for prisoners serving indeterminate ( i.e. life ) sentences , the approval of the Secretary of ORG following a positive recommendation of ORG was not required . On DATE the Secretary of ORG rejected the recommendation of ORG in the applicant 's case , concluding that the release of the applicant would present an unacceptable risk to the public . As a result , the applicant was not released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was granted leave to bring judicial review proceedings in respect of the decision of the Secretary of ORG to refuse his early release . His principal ground of challenge was that it was a breach of LAW taken together with LAW that the Secretary of ORG should retain the power to determine the release on parole licence of CARDINAL group of prisoners , i.e. those who were serving determinate terms of imprisonment of DATE or more ( see paragraphs DATE below for details of the law in force at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG subsequently reconsidered the applicant 's case and on DATE did not recommend release . The ORG has not been provided with details of the reasons for this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's judicial review claim . For the purposes of the proceedings , the Secretary of ORG accepted that the question of early release from a determinate sentence fell within the ambit of LAW and that LAW was therefore engaged . PERSON found that there was differential treatment between analogous groups , namely those serving sentences of DATE or more and those serving sentences of DATE , in that prisoners serving sentences of DATE or more had to secure a recommendation from ORG and approval from the Secretary of ORG whereas those serving DATE needed only a recommendation from ORG . However , he considered that the differential treatment pursued the legitimate aim of reserving to a politically and democratically accountable minister the power to control the release of those serving long determinate sentences . He further considered that the power was proportionate in light of the problems posed by such prisoners for public safety and public order . Accordingly , he found that there was no violation of LAW together with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was granted leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG subsequently reconsidered the applicant 's case and on DATE once again recommended the applicant 's release . On this occasion the Secretary of ORG accepted the recommendation , and on DATE Mr PERSON was released on licence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG endorsed the judgment of ORG and dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It found the question of release from a determinate sentence to be arguably within the ambit of LAW and agreed with ORG that although there was differential treatment CARDINAL comparable groups , this difference in treatment was objectively justified in that it pursued a legitimate aim and was proportionate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , their Lordships unanimously dismissed the applicant 's appeal . They agreed that the right to seek early release , where domestic law provided for such a right , was clearly within the ambit of LAW . Lord PERSON of PERSON noted ( at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The ORG does not require member states to establish a scheme for early release of those sentenced to imprisonment . Prisoners may , consistently with the LAW , be required to serve DATE of the sentence passed by the judge , or be detained until a predetermined period or proportion of the sentence has been served , if that is what domestic law provides . But this is not what the law of GPE and GPE provided , in respect of long - term determinate prisoners , at the times relevant to these appeals . That law provided for a time at which ( subject to additional days of custody imposed for disciplinary breaches ) a prisoner must , as a matter of right , be released , and an earlier time at which he might be released if it was judged safe to release him but at which he need not be released if it was not so judged .", "A number of grounds ( economy and the need to relieve over - crowding in prisons ) have doubtless been relied on when introducing pre - release schemes from determinate sentences such as those under consideration here . But CARDINAL such consideration is recognition that neither the public interest nor the interest of the offender is well served by continuing to detain a prisoner until the end of his publicly pronounced sentence ; that in some cases those interests will be best served by releasing the prisoner at the earlier , discretionary , stage ; and that in those cases prisoners should regain their freedom ( even if subject to restrictions ) because there is judged to be no continuing interest in depriving them of it . I accordingly find that the right to seek early release , where domestic law provides for such a right , is clearly within the ambit of article CARDINAL , and differential treatment of CARDINAL prisoner as compared with another , otherwise than on the merits of their respective cases , gives rise to a potential complaint under LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , unlike the lower courts , and with some hesitation , their Lordships did not find the difference in treatment in the applicant 's case to be the result of his \u201c status \u201d , such as to fall within the prohibition on discrimination in LAW . Lord PERSON said ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c I do not think that a personal characteristic can be defined by the differential treatment of which a person complains . But here Mr PERSON does not complain of the sentence passed upon him , but of being denied a definitive ORG recommendation . Is his classification as a prisoner serving a determinate sentence of DATE or more ( but less than life ) a personal characteristic ? I find it difficult to apply so elusive a test . But I would incline to regard a life sentence as an acquired personal characteristic and a lifer as having an ' other status ' , and it is hard to see why the classification of Mr PERSON , based on the length of his sentence and not the nature of his offences , should be differently regarded . I think , however , that a domestic court should hesitate to apply the Convention in a manner not , as I understand , explicitly or impliedly authorised by the GPE jurisprudence , and I would accordingly , not without hesitation , resolve this question in favour of the Secretary of ORG and against Mr PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope of PERSON made similar observations ( at paragraphs DATE ) :", "\u201c It could be said in Mr PERSON 's case that the length of his sentence did confer a status on him which can be regarded as a personal characteristic . This is because prisoners are divided by the domestic system into broadly defined categories , or groups of people , according to the nature or the length of their sentences . These categories affect the way they are then dealt with throughout the period of their sentences . As a result they are regarded as having acquired a distinctive status which attaches itself to them personally for the purposes of the regime in which they are required to serve their sentences . This is most obviously so in the case of prisoners serving life sentences and where distinctions are drawn between short - term and long - term prisoners serving determinate sentences . It is less obviously so in the case of long - term prisoners serving determinate sentences of different lengths .", "It must be accepted , as Lord PERSON points out , that a personal characteristic can not be defined by the differential treatment of which a person complains . It is plain too that the category of long - term prisoner into which Mr PERSON 's case falls would not have been recognised as a separate category had it not been for the Order which treats prisoners in his group differently from others in the enjoyment of their fundamental right to liberty . But he had already been sentenced , and he had already acquired the status which that sentence gave him before the Order was made that denied prisoners in his group the right to release on the recommendation of ORG . The question which his case raises is whether the distinguishing feature or characteristic which enables persons or a group of persons to be singled out for separate treatment must have been identified as a personal characteristic before it is used for this purpose by the discriminator .", "The function of article CARDINAL , read with LAW , is to secure to everyone within the jurisdiction of the High Contracting Parties the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in CARDINAL of the LAW without discrimination on grounds which , having regard to the underlying values of the LAW , must be regarded as unacceptable . This suggests that a generous meaning should be given to the words ' or other status ' while recognising , of course , that the proscribed grounds are not unlimited . It seems to me , on this approach , that the protection of article CARDINAL ought not to be denied just because the distinguishing feature which enabled the discriminator to treat persons or groups of persons differently in the enjoyment of their LAW rights had not previously been recognised .", "But the GPE jurisprudence has not yet addressed this question and , as my noble and learned friend Baroness PERSON of GPE points out , it is possible to regard what he has done , rather than who or what he is , as the true reason for the difference of treatment in Mr PERSON 's case ... [ T]he duty of national courts is to keep pace with the GPE jurisprudence as it evolves over time . A measure of self - restraint is needed , lest we stretch our own jurisprudence beyond that which is shared by all GPE Parties to the Convention . I am persuaded , with some reluctance , that it is not open to us to resolve the second agreed issue in Mr PERSON 's favour . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Baroness PERSON of GPE considered ( at paragraphs DATE ) that :", "\u201c it is plain ... that a different parole regime for foreigners who are liable to deportation from that applicable to citizens or others with the right to remain here , falls within the grounds proscribed by LAW and thus ... requires objective justification . The same would surely apply to a difference in treatment based on race , sex or the colour of one 's hair . But a difference in treatment based on the seriousness of the offence would fall outside those grounds . The real reason for the distinction is not a personal characteristic of the offender but what the offender has done .", "The result is that the difference of treatment between Mr PERSON and people sentenced either to shorter determinate sentences or to life imprisonment is not covered by LAW at all . The law may look odd . But not every apparent anomaly is a breach of Convention rights . This one is the result of what the ORG Secretary chose to do in relation to people sentenced to shorter terms of imprisonment and what he was obliged by the terms of article CARDINAL itself to do in relation to life imprisonment . The law has since been changed and one can well understand why . But it is not for us to declare legislation which ORG has passed incompatible with the Convention rights unless the ORG and its case law require us so to do . For the reasons given above , in amplification of those given by my noble and learned friend , Lord GPE of Cornhill , we are not required to do so in this case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding the conclusion of the ORG as to the applicability of LAW of ORG - under - Heywood went on to consider whether , had there been \u201c status \u201d , the difference in treatment would have been objectively justified . Lord PERSON ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) was of the view that :", "\u201c When , in DATE , the Secretary of ORG rejected ORG recommendation that Mr PERSON be released on parole , discretionary lifers and ORG detainees had already been brought within the definitive jurisdiction of ORG , and GPE v GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL , requiring the same procedure for mandatory lifers , had already been decided . The differential treatment of prisoners serving DATE or more had , in my opinion , become an anomaly . That would not , in itself , be a ground for holding it to be unjustified . Anomalies are commonplace . But by DATE it had , in my opinion , become an indefensible anomaly because it had by then come to be recognised that assessment of the risk presented by any individual prisoner , in the application of publicly promulgated criteria , was a task with no political content and one to which the Secretary of ORG could not ( and did not claim to ) bring any superior expertise . I would accordingly resolve this issue in favour of PERSON and against the Secretary of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON agreed with the conclusion of Lord PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Under sections CARDINAL of LAW DATE , all determinate and indeterminate sentence prisoners were eligible for discretionary release on licence after serving specified minimum amounts of their sentences . In both cases , once ORG had recommended release , the Secretary of ORG had discretion to decide whether to release a prisoner .", "CARDINAL .
