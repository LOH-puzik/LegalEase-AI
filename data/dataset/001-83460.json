The court has not established the role , the degree and the manner [ of involvement ] of [ the applicant ] in :", "- the founding and heading of the criminal gang ;", "- the commission of the murders ;", "- the commission of the attempted murders ;", "- the illegal deprivation of liberty ;", "- the possession of drugs ;", "Nor has it established the nature of the [ structure of the ] criminal relationship between him and the rest of the convicted persons .", "[ The applicant ] 's accusation in respect of the above offences relies in essence on the declarations of [ co - accused ] S. The latter did not incriminate [ the applicant ] as being a co - participant in the commission of the offences by the criminal gang . His declarations do not confirm the facts and the circumstances which result from the totality of the evidence from the case file in respect of [ the applicant ] . They represent suppositions or are based on hearsay statements , which in their turn have not been confirmed by the alleged sources .", "It is important to note that the court gave different assessments of similar evidence concerning the possession of a gun and the possession of drugs during [ the applicant ] 's arrest in a pharmacy on DATE ....", "I express my conviction that it was not correct to sentence [ the applicant ] to life imprisonment without hearing evidence from him in person , in the circumstances in which he was acquitted [ by the judgment of DATE ] and was remanded in custody [ prior to his conviction by ORG ] . This is all the more so since the judgment of ORG is final and there is no appeal against it .", "In the light of the above , I believe that ... the provisions of LAW were disregarded ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW in force at the material time read as follows :", "\u201c ...", "The founders and the heads of a criminal gang are responsible for ... all the offences committed by the criminal gang .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows :", "\u201c After examining an appeal on points of law ( recurs ) [ in respect of certain offences there is CARDINAL level of appellate jurisdiction ( recurs ) , rather than CARDINAL levels ( PERSON followed by recurs ) , before a final judgment is delivered ] , the court shall adopt one of the following decisions :", "...", "CARDINAL ) allow the recurs , set aside the judgment entirely or partially and adopt CARDINAL of the following solutions :", "a ) order the acquittal of the accused person and the termination of the criminal proceedings in his or her respect ;", "b ) re - examine the case and adopt a new judgment ;", "c ) order a re examination of the case by the first - instance court if ORG allows the recurs and it is necessary to examine new evidence . \u201d", "According to Article CARDINAL the procedure of re - examination is regulated by LAW . The latter LAW states that after the setting aside of a judgment in recurs , the re - examination shall be carried out in accordance with the general rules of examining a criminal case .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE addressed by a Deputy Prosecutor General to ORG , it was stated , inter alia , that due to lack of funds the NORP prisons were not sufficiently provided with meat , fish and dairy products .", "CARDINAL . The relevant findings of the ORG , ( unofficial translation ) read as follows :", "\u201c", "CARDINAL . Conditions of detention .", "a. Institutions of ORG", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , when it first visited GPE , the ORG has serious concern for the conditions of detention in the institutions of ORG .", "The ORG notes that CARDINAL out of CARDINAL EDPs have been subjected to \u201c cosmetic \u201d repair and that CARDINAL have been equipped with places for DATE walks . Nevertheless , the DATE visit did not allow the concern of the ORG to be alleviated . In fact , most recommendations made have not been implemented .", "CARDINAL . Whether CARDINAL refers to the police stations or EDPs visited , the material conditions are invariably subject to the same criticism as in the past . Detention cells had no access to daylight or a very limited access ; artificial light \u2013 with rare exceptions \u2013 was mediocre . Nowhere did the persons obliged to spend TIME in detention receive mattresses and blankets , even those detained for prolonged periods . Those who had such items could only have obtained them from their relatives ...", "CARDINAL . As for food ... in the EDPs the arrangements made were the same as those criticised in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report on that visit ) : generally CARDINAL modest distributions of food per day including tea and a slice of bread in the morning , a bowl of cereal at TIME and tea or warm water in TIME . Sometimes there was CARDINAL distribution of food per day . Fortunately , the rules for receiving parcels have been relaxed , which allowed detainees with relatives outside to slightly improve these meagre DATE portions .", "...", "CARDINAL . In sum , the material conditions remain problematic in the police stations ; they remain disastrous in EDPs , continuing in many aspects to amount , for the detainees , to inhuman and degrading treatment . \u201d", "\u201c PERSON Establishments visited", "... - EDP of ORG", "... b. PERSON remand centres ( EDPs )", "CARDINAL . In its report on the DATE visit ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , the ORG was forced to conclude that material conditions of detention in the remand centres ( EDPs ) visited amounted in many respects to inhuman and degrading treatment and , in addition , constituted a significant risk to the health of persons detained . While recognising that it was not possible to transform the current situation in these establishments TIME , the ORG recommended a certain number of immediate palliative measures to guarantee basic conditions of detention that respect the fundamental requirements of life and human dignity .", "CARDINAL . Unfortunately , during the DATE visit , the delegation found barely any traces of such palliative measures , in fact quite the opposite . For example , the renovation and reconstruction of the cells of the ORG of ORG for the fight against organised crime and corruption in PERSON ( reopened in DATE ) , which were supposed to reflect the ORG 's DATE recommendations , turned out to have had quite the contrary effect . All the conceptual and organisational shortcomings highlighted by the ORG at the time had been faithfully reproduced : cells without access to natural light , artificial lighting of low intensity and permanently switched on , inadequate ventilation and furnishings consisting exclusively of platforms without mattresses ( although certain prisoners did have their own blankets ) . A similar conclusion can be drawn about the new section of ORG set aside for administrative detainees .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL can only regret that in their efforts to renovate these premises - which under the current economic circumstances deserve praise - the NORP authorities have paid no attention to the ORG recommendations . In fact , this state of affairs strongly suggests that , setting aside economic considerations , the issue of material conditions of detention in police establishments remains influenced by an outdated concept of deprivation of liberty .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the other EDPs visited across GPE , with very few exceptions the delegation observed the same types of disastrous and insalubrious material conditions . A detailed description is superfluous , since it has all been highlighted already in DATE of the report on the DATE visit .", "In PERSON ORG , these conditions were exacerbated by serious overcrowding . At the time of the visit , there were CARDINAL prisoners for CARDINAL places , requiring QUANTITY persons to cram into a cell measuring QUANTITY into cells of CARDINAL m\u00b2 .", "CARDINAL . The delegation also received numerous complaints about the quantity of food in the EDPs visited . This normally comprised tea without sugar and a slice of bread in the morning , cereal porridge at lunch time and hot water in TIME . In some establishments , food was served just once a day and was confined to a piece of bread and soup . ...", "... Concerning the issue of access to toilets in due time , the ORG wishes to stress that it considers that the practice according to which detainees comply with the needs of nature by using receptacles in the presence of CARDINAL or several other persons , in a confined space such as the ORG cells which also serve as their living space , is in itself degrading , not only for the individual concerned but also for those forced to witness what is happening . Consequently , the ORG recommends that clear instructions be given to surveillance staff that detainees placed in cells without toilets should DATE if they so request \u2013 be taken out of their cell without delay during DATE in order to go to the toilet .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also recommends that steps be taken to :", "- reduce the overcrowding in PERSON as rapidly as possible and to comply with the official occupancy level ;", "- supply persons in custody with clean mattresses and clean blankets ;", "- authorise persons detained in all EDPs to receive packages from the outset of their custody and to have access to reading matter .", "In the light of certain observations made , particularly in the ORG of ORG , the ORG also reiterates its recommendation concerning strict compliance , in all circumstances , with the rules governing separation of adults and minors . \u201d", "CARDINAL . One of the applicant 's co - accused , ORG , who was also sentenced to life imprisonment , ORG , escaped from GPE and currently resides in GPE . On an unspecified date the GPE authorities requested the NORP authorities to extradite him in view of serving the sentence . The application for extradition was examined by the NORP courts and a final verdict was adopted by ORG in a judgment of DATE .", "The court decided to reject the application for extradition on grounds of serious suspicion that the proceedings leading to ORG 's conviction had not complied with the basic rules of fairness . In particular , the court found that the applicant and other co - accused were subjected to torture and pressure in order to confess to the offences imputed to them or to incriminate other co - accused . In finding the above , the court relied on witness testimonies to the effect that ORG had signs of violence on his body during the court hearings . The allegations of ill - treatment were consistent with reports of NORP and ORG bodies specialised in the protection of human rights . The court relied , inter alia , on a report of ORG concerning GPE , in which it was stated that the NORP justice system lacked independence from the Government and that ill - treatment and torture by police was a wide spread practice in GPE . The court also relied on several other reports from ORG and ORG and ORG bodies specialised in the prevention of torture with similar allegations concerning GPE . The court also noted that the judge of ORG who acquitted PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was subsequently dissmissed .", "The court also expressed concern about ORG 's conviction by ORG in his absence but only on the basis of the documents in the file and expressed the view that there were no guarantees that if extradited to GPE , PERSON would not be subjected to inhuman treatment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "6-1", "6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
