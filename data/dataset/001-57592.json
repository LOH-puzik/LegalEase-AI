THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection rejected (victim);Violation of Art. 5-3;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON , Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON , who were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively , reside in the GPE . In DATE , after being forcibly drafted as conscript soldiers in ORG , they each refused , on account of their beliefs as conscientious objectors , to obey specific orders deriving from their obligation to perform military service . They were placed in detention by the competent military officers for suspected offences against LAW ( Wetboek van Militair Strafrecht ) . They were kept in custody and referred for trial before a military court .", "CARDINAL . Exemption may be obtained from compulsory military service on the ground of conscientious objection , both before and after active military service has begun . The procedure for requesting such exemption is laid down in ORG ( Wet Gewetensbezwaren Militaire ORG ) and a Ministerial Decree of DATE . In particular , where military criminal proceedings are in progress against a conscript serviceman who has applied for the status of conscientious objector , they may be stayed before , and must be stayed once , ORG on Conscientious Objectors has commenced its enquiries ( section CARDINAL sub - section CARDINAL of the Act ) . After ORG has stated its opinion , the Minister of Defence may grant recognition as a conscientious objector ( section CARDINAL ) . The entitlement to conduct criminal proceedings for failure to obey orders or military regulations or for failure to report for enlistment lapses automatically upon recognition of the accused \u2019s conscientious objection ( section CARDINAL ) .", "In the present case , Mr. PERSON requested to be granted the status of conscientious objector only in the final stages of his appeal before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , whereas Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON never at any moment did so ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Criminal procedure for the military land and air forces , including in particular the matter of arrest and detention on remand , is governed by the ORG and Air Force Code of Procedure ( Rechtspleging bij de Land - en Luchtmacht - \" LAW \" ) , as last amended on DATE . Offences under military criminal law , which applies equally to conscript servicemen such as the applicants and to volunteers , are tried at first instance before a Military Court ( PERSON ) . There may be an appeal to ORG ( PERSON ) and ultimately a ( cassation ) appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) of the GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Every officer and non - commissioned officer is empowered to arrest military personnel of lower rank suspected of a serious offence provided the circumstances require immediate deprivation of liberty ( LAW ) . The resultant detention is not to exceed TIME ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "The commanding officer may order a suspected serviceman to be placed or kept in custody on remand if ( a ) there is a serious risk of absconding or ( b ) there are important reasons of public safety requiring immediate deprivation of liberty or ( c ) this is necessary in connection with the maintenance of military discipline among other servicemen ( DATE paragraph ) . Such a detention order may be made against a serviceman suspected of any offence set out in LAW or any offence in respect of which detention on remand is permitted under LAW , with the exception of those offences of which ORG takes no cognisance ( DATE paragraph ) . An order may not be issued if the suspect is unlikely to be penalised by unconditional imprisonment or by any other measure restricting his freedom , or is likely to be given a sentence of shorter duration than that of the detention on remand ( ibid . ) . Detention must be terminated once the grounds for it cease to exist ( LAW paragraph ) . All cases of detention exceeding DATE shall be reported by the commanding officer to the commanding general ( LAW paragraph ) .", "Where detention has lasted DATE , the suspected serviceman may petition the competent ORG to fix a term ( liable to extension ) within which the commanding general must either decide whether the case is to be referred to a ORG or else terminate the detention . ORG has to rule on the petition without delay , after hearing the authority empowered to refer the case , the auditeur - militair ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and the suspected serviceman , who may have the assistance of an adviser ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG If , after receiving the advice of the auditeur - militair and , \" if possible \" ( \" zo mogelijk \" ) , after the suspected serviceman has been heard , the commanding general or a senior officer ( hoofd officier ) designated by him to act on his behalf considers that the case should be tried by ORG , the serviceman shall be referred for trial before that ORG ( LAW ) . On the other hand , the commanding general or the designated officer may in appropriate circumstances leave the case to be dealt with as a disciplinary matter ( LAW Regulation No . CARDINAL of ORG explained the effect of these provisions as follows ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" In military penal procedure , as distinct from civilian procedure , the decision to prosecute in a case is not taken separately by the prosecuting authority , the auditeur - militair , but by a military authority . That authority is the commanding general or the senior officer he has appointed to act on his behalf , i.e. the referring officer ... Thus , the auditeur - militair is merely an advisory body at this stage , although the obtaining of his advice and the giving of that advice by him are mandatory . \"", "Any decision to refer for trial must be in writing and state whether the suspected serviceman is to be released or kept in custody ; the grounds for detention set out in the second and fourth paragraphs of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) apply pari passu ( Article CARDINAL ) . If , against the advice of the auditeur - militair , the commanding general or designated senior officer chooses not to refer a suspected serviceman for trial , the auditeur - militair may take the matter to ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) . No appeal is provided for in the contrary case .", "According to the Government , it has now become standard procedure to apply the above provisions of LAW in the following manner . Where detention on remand has been ordered , the suspected serviceman is always heard by the auditeur - militair and any referral to ORG takes place shortly thereafter , on DATE after the arrest . In view of the requirements of LAW , the auditeur - militair \u2019s assessment of the circumstances and his advice to the commanding general or designated senior officer cover not only referral for trial but also the question whether the conditions for detention on remand set out in LAW fulfilled . Thus , the standard written form used by the auditeur - militair for the purposes of transmitting his advice to the referring officer contains , inter alia , a paragraph as to whether the suspect should \" be released or be placed or kept in custody \" . Practice has evolved to the point where the advice of the auditeur - militair is invariably followed and generally regarded as binding .", "CARDINAL . Detention maintained or ordered in the decision referring the serviceman for trial may not exceed DATE unless extended , by terms of DATE , by ORG at the request of the auditeur - militair ( DATE ) . Every accused detained by virtue of the referral decision must be heard by the officier - commissaris ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as speedily as possible and in any event within DATE of referral ; in this connection , the accused may be assisted by an adviser ( Article CARDINAL , first paragraph ) . Before extending detention , ORG must give the accused or his adviser the opportunity to submit argument ( Article CARDINAL , second paragraph ) .", "As soon as the grounds for the detention cease to exist , release must be ordered ( LAW , first paragraph ) . In the period between referral and commencement of the trial , power to order release is exercisable by the auditeur - militair , or by ORG at the request of either the officier - commissaris or the detained serviceman himself ( Article CARDINAL , second paragraph ) . ORG , in deciding on such requests , will hear the auditeur - militair and also the detained serviceman or his adviser where the serviceman is requesting release for the first time ( DATE paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG If the accused is in custody at the first hearing , ORG will decide , after being addressed by the auditeur - militair , whether or not the nature and circumstances of the case require his continued detention during the trial ( LAW . The ORG may direct the accused \u2019s release from detention on remand at any later stage in the proceedings , either of its own motion or at the request of the auditeur - militair or the accused himself ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG A serviceman in custody may request release or suspension of his detention under LAW in proceedings before ORG pending the decision on his appeal , and under LAW ) in proceedings before ORG pending the decision on his appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . ORG The auditeur - militair has the function of prosecuting authority before ORG ( Article CARDINAL , first paragraph ) . No serving member of the armed forces may appear as auditeur - militair or substitute auditeur - militair ( LAW paragraph ) . The auditeur - militair and his substitute may be replaced by an acting auditeur - militair ( plaatsvervanger - LAW paragraph ) who may be a military officer , but such replacement was said by the Government to occur only in exceptional circumstances . Auditeurs - militair ( including substitutes and acting ones ) are appointed , and dismissed , by the Crown on a joint proposal from the Ministers of Justice and Defence ; they must possess a law degree ( LAW paragraphs ) . Under the terms of LAW , second paragraph , of LAW , they are obliged to comply with instructions given to them in their official capacity by the Minister of ORG . However , according to the Government , this latter provision serves as no more than the legal authority for issuing general guidelines on prosecution policy and , at least in DATE , no Minister of ORG has acted or interfered in a concrete case on the basis of LAW .", "The auditeur - militair is bound by his oath to act honestly and impartially ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . He must attend the hearings of ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) but he does not take part in the ORG \u2019s deliberations . He is under a general duty to assist ORG , as well as the commanding general , with reports , observations and advice in relation to military justice when required to do so ( Article CARDINAL ) . He is not under the supervision of ORG or ORG in the discharge of his duties , save that ORG has the power to reprimand him should he fail strictly to observe statutory time - limits ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Attached to each Military Court is CARDINAL officier - commissaris who is in charge of the preliminary investigation of cases ( DATE ) . An officier - commissaris is an officer or former officer of the armed forces with the rank of captain or higher and is appointed for a fixed term of DATE by the commanding general ( ibid . ) . While he may at the same time be a member of ORG , this is not usually the case . His task of preliminary investigation involves gathering the facts and hearing witnesses and the accused when necessary ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ) . A hearing by the officier - commissaris has the same force as a hearing by ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) . During his enquiries , he is under a duty to apply himself equally to discovering the accused \u2019s innocence and to obtaining proof or admission of guilt ( Article CARDINAL ) .
