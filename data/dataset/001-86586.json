There appeared to be delays as regards transferring inmates for treatment to hospital facilities and access to medical specialists outside the penitentiary system . The procedure for transferring inmates from prisons other than GPE and GPE to the CARDINAL prison hospitals involved a recommendation by the prison doctor which had to be approved first by the prison director and then by the medical division of ORG , following which the prison had to organise transportation . A random examination of medical files revealed that this chain of administrative decisions could take quite a long time ( DATE ) . The ORG would like to receive the comments of the NORP authorities on this question .", "...", "CARDINAL . Medical examination on admission generally took place on DATE of arrival or the following day , but there were a few isolated cases of delays of DATE , undoubtedly a reflection of the meagre staff resources . Further , during DATE spent in the reception unit , newly arrived prisoners underwent a number of examinations ( including of suicidal risk ) .", "As regards screening for transmissible diseases , it varied from CARDINAL prison to another . At FAC , newly arrived prisoners were screened on admission for syphilis and HIV ; the delegation was told that prisoners verbally gave consent to HIV testing . At FAC , screening for HIV was carried out by an NGO on a voluntary basis . As regards screening for tuberculosis , a mobile X - ray unit visited the prisons once a year and all prisoners were screened . There was no screening for hepatitis at either prison .", "The ORG recommends that measures be taken to ensure that all newly arrived prisoners are seen by a healthcare staff member within TIME of their arrival . The medical examination on admission should be comprehensive , including appropriate screening for transmissible diseases . Further , prisoners should be provided with counselling before ( and , in the case of a positive result , after ) any screening test as well as with information concerning the prevention of transmissible diseases .", "...", "CARDINAL . The ORG remains concerned about the handling of medical data . All inmates had individual medical files ; however , the delegation observed that the medical information contained in them was far from being comprehensive . Further , the confidentiality of medical examinations was not always observed , nonmedical prison staff often being present during such examinations .", "The ORG recommends that steps be taken to ensure that :", "\u2013 prisoners\u2019 individual medical files are properly kept and prisoners are entitled to receive copies of medical documents ;", "\u2013 all medical examinations are conducted out of the hearing and \u2013 unless the doctor concerned expressly requests otherwise in a particular case \u2013 out of the sight of non - medical prison staff and law enforcement officials ;", "...", "CARDINAL . More generally , it would appear that the difficulties in recruiting medical specialists to work in prisons and the other related failings referred to above are part of the wider problem that prison health care is not integrated into the national health - care system . This results in a failure to comply with the principle of \u201c equivalence of care \u201d , according to which prisoners should benefit from the same level of medical care as persons living in the community at large .", "During the visit , the delegation received a copy of a draft Ordinance on prison healthcare prepared by a joint working group from ORG , which addresses many of the problematic areas mentioned above . In particular , it establishes the principles of equivalence of care and ORG professional independence . Other provisions concern the supply of free - of - charge medication to prisoners and ORG responsibility for providing methodological guidance to and control of health care in prisons . As regards screening for HIV , the ORG recommendations concerning confidentiality , informed consent and pre- and post - test counselling are to be observed . The LAW also stipulates that whenever signs of violence are observed , health - care staff should immediately notify the prison director and issue a medical certificate ; however , as regards the contents of the latter , reference is only made to a detailed description of the injuries observed ( in this context , see the recommendations [ made earlier in the report ] ) .", "Pursuant to LAW , prisoners with medical training who have not been deprived of the right to practise can be employed in their speciality under the supervision of a medical member of staff . The ORG has already expressed in the past its concern about the employment of inmates as orderlies ( see paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) ; the same goes for the employment of prisoners on other health - care related jobs . As a matter of principle , prisoners should not be put in a position to exercise control over other prisoners .", "The ORG recommends that the NORP authorities take into consideration the comments and recommendations made in this report in the new regulations on the provision of health care to prisoners . More generally , the ORG invites the NORP authorities to review their strategy for implementing healthcare policy in prisons with a view to ensuring harmonisation with the national health - care system and respect of the principles of equivalence of care and professional independence .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prison hospital at FAC had CARDINAL wards : surgery , internal medicine and neuropsychiatry ; in addition , there was a section for female prisoners and an area for infectious diseases . At the time of the visit , CARDINAL prisoners were being treated at the hospital ; the delegation was informed that , on average , CARDINAL prisoners were hospitalised on DATE . The hospital also performed outpatient consultations of prisoners from FAC .", "CARDINAL . Living space in the ORG rooms was satisfactory ( e.g. CARDINAL prisoners in a room measuring CARDINAL m\u00b2 , including a sanitary annexe ) . The rooms had good access to natural light , artificial lighting and ventilation ; however , they were in a rather poor state of repair and cleanliness .", "As for the medical equipment , it was antiquated . The hospital urgently needed new equipment , in particular for Xrays , GPE ultrasound scans and endoscopy , as well as surgical instruments .", "The ORG recommends that steps be taken at FAC to :", "\u2013 substantially upgrade the medical equipment ;", "\u2013 improve the state of repair and the level of hygiene in GPE rooms .", "CARDINAL . Although there were practically no unfilled posts , the delegation was informed that the hospital needed CARDINAL nurses , CARDINAL GPs and an urologist ; however , there was no budget for hiring more staff . The ORG would like to receive the comments on the NORP authorities on this issue . ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
