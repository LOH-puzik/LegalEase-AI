At the same time , it again dismissed the applicant on the same grounds as in DATE - having interviewed him again and consulted ORG in the meantime - with effect from DATE . On DATE , ORG accordingly stayed ( einstellen ) the proceedings before it , holding that the issues raised had been settled .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON lodged an objection against his second dismissal , arguing , inter alia , that the criticisms levelled at him had been unjustified . He asserted that it was common knowledge that he had personally and actively upheld the free democratic system . Since becoming a teacher he had resigned from several of his ORG posts , including those of chairman of ORG branch , district agent for GPE and member of ORG responsible for university matters . In addition , he had deliberately restricted his political activities in the ORG area and had not appeared there in public . His membership of a party with aims allegedly inimical to the LAW was no reason for dismissing him . ORG and ORG had supported him and had testified to his personal and professional abilities . Finally , the probationary period was now over : the period which he had previously spent as a temporary civil servant should be added to DATE which he had spent as a probationary civil servant .", "On DATE , ORG and Culture rejected his objection , mainly on account of the major role he had played in ORG activities . It also referred to ORG ruling that mere membership of an unconstitutional party might justify a civil servant \u2019s dismissal ; that being so , it was unnecessary to establish whether the applicant had restricted his political utterances , and his professional qualifications were immaterial . Finally , probation did not end automatically under civil - service law ; as he had not been established , Mr. PERSON was still a probationer and could therefore be dismissed under LAW of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant challenged the ORG \u2019s decision before ORG , claiming that no definite proof had been adduced therein that his attitudes had been inimical to LAW . In NORP case - law , membership of an organisation regarded as being inimical to the LAW was merely a possible reason for doubting a civil servant \u2019s constitutional loyalty , and every case had to be examined in detail . The ORG \u2019s overall judgment did not satisfy this requirement . The applicant had always actively upheld the free democratic system - in DATE , for example , when ORG had been occupied ; or in DATE in GPE , when he had retrieved the flag of GPE and handed it over to the public prosecutor ; or again , as a member of ORG . The same was true of his writings . He could not be held responsible for ORG statements or actions which might be regarded as inimical to LAW . In any case , the party approved of the free democratic system within the meaning of LAW . When the Land Minister appointed him as a probationary civil servant , he knew that he had been a member of ORG ( since DATE ) , a member of ORG ( since DATE ) , ORG district agent for GPE ( since DATE ) and chairman of ORG branch of the ORG ( since DATE ) . It was thus illogical that his commitment to the ORG should be seen as making him personally unsuitable and justifying his dismissal . The same inconsistency was apparent in earlier statements by the Minister . In DATE , he had repeatedly stated - in ORG , on television and in interviews with the press - that Mr. PERSON was not opposed to the LAW and that his DATE record in ORG showed as much .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG set aside the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "The court held that the law and general principles precluded dismissing a probationary civil servant on grounds which had been known - and should have been taken into account - when he was appointed .", "The ORG had based its decision on facts already known in DATE which it had not regarded at the time as indicating personal unsuitability . It had been aware from the decisions of the Conference of Land Ministers of the Interior ( DATE ) , quoted in the disputed decision of DATE , that the ORG was regarded as having aims inimical to LAW , and it had also known that the applicant was an influential member of the party and an ORG member of ORG .", "The fact that the ORG had nonetheless appointed Mr. PERSON showed that it regarded his personal conduct , notwithstanding his commitment to the ORG , as affording the necessary guarantee of allegiance to LAW . This had been clear from the Minister \u2019s reply to a question put to him in FAC in DATE . Thus , when it was being determined whether the applicant had proved himself during his probation , his political conduct was relevant only in so far as it had changed in the meantime . The applicant \u2019s continuing commitment to his party could not be judged any differently from before , as the ORG \u2019s aims had not changed in the meantime . As for his book \" PERSON ? PERSON ! \" , which ORG had not originally been aware of , it was not sufficient proof of opposition to the LAW .", "The court had beforehand called the applicant to give evidence explaining a number of passages in his book . It had sought such evidence notably in order to establish whether his theory of genetic and biological inequality in humans was based on racist views and whether Mr. PERSON drew from it conclusions which were incompatible with the principles of equality and respect for human rights enshrined in LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Ministry appealed against this judgment on DATE . It contended that it must be free to rectify any error made during the appointment procedure ; it could not be compelled to establish a probationary civil servant who lacked CARDINAL of the requisite qualifications . Moreover , it had since been found that the ORG did not accept LAW but was actively opposed to it and the lawful institutions . The applicant \u2019s new book , \" PERSON in seiner PERSON \" , confirmed his personal views of LAW ; ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been right to conclude from it that he did not recognise GPE and its LAW as positive values , but extolled ORG .", "Mr. PERSON contended that a book which had not appeared until DATE could not be taken into account in the present proceedings . In any case , it did not give any grounds for doubting his allegiance to the LAW ; ORG had incorrectly summarised it and had totally distorted the views he had expressed in it ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . For the rest , he essentially repeated the arguments he had adduced at first instance .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG of ORG allowed the appeal and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . In the light especially of the case - law of ORG , particularly its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it ruled that the impugned decisions were lawful .", "After reviewing in detail the ORG \u2019s arguments and evidence , the ORG held that it had not been proved that the ORG was pursuing aims inimical to LAW , that is to say , was systematically ( planvoll ) and actively seeking to undermine the free democratic constitutional system , bring about its abolition or jeopardise the continued existence of GPE ( LAW ) . Mere membership of the ORG could not therefore be construed as a sign of doubtful allegiance . Many ORG statements nonetheless did indicate a worrying tendency , and , that being so , a political party \u2019s constitutionally suspect ( verfassungsrechtlich bedenklich ) views might give grounds for ascertaining the personal views of a civil servant who was a party member . A civil servant , who was bound actively to uphold the free democratic system , might accordingly be required to dissociate himself explicitly from the objectionable views of his party .", "Mr. PERSON had failed to dispel the suspicion that he approved the ORG line . On the contrary , he had identified himself with it by his many militant activities . These , and the personal views he had expressed in his book \" PERSON in seiner PERSON \" , cast serious doubts on his loyalty to LAW . In his book , which could legitimately be taken into consideration , he had played down or indeed praised , without the least reservation or criticism , circumstances and events that had marked ORG . In this respect , ORG shared the views of ORG , which had analysed the book in detail ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Admittedly , the applicant maintained that he had written in appreciative terms only of the first phase of ORG , but this showed merely that there were at least some aspects of National Socialism of which he approved , not that he disavowed it . As early as CARDINAL , the most important fundamental rights had been suspended , separation of powers abolished , political parties disbanded , trade unions broken up and ( what marked the beginning of the persecution of the NORP ) \" non - Aryan \" civil servants dismissed . Without any reservation or criticism the applicant judged the circumstances , events and ideas of ORG preferable to the current situation . It was thus impossible to believe that he also endorsed the fundamental views and principles of LAW as being a priceless asset to be protected .", "ORG had rightly concluded that Mr. PERSON did not give any guarantee that he would at all times uphold the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of LAW , and that he had accordingly failed to prove himself during his probation . It mattered little whether he had the necessary professional qualifications and had refrained from expressing any political views at ORG . Before appointing him the Minister had certainly been aware of his prominence in the ORG , but this did not make the disputed revocation of his appointment unlawful . Performance of duties as a probationary civil servant was of vital importance for determining whether a probationer could be relied on to be loyal to LAW . The applicant should have expected the Ministry to carry out , at DATE , a further thorough and final assessment of matters already known to it .", "CARDINAL . ORG With leave of ORG Mr. PERSON applied for review on points of law , but ORG ( ORG ) found against him on DATE .", "The Ministry \u2019s doubts about the applicant \u2019s loyalty to the LAW - prompted by his active membership of the ORG - were justified . In this connection , ORG had erred in regarding membership of a party as relevant only if the party deliberately sought to undermine or destroy the free democratic system - in other words , was liable to banning by ORG under LAW . It was in fact sufficient if the party pursued aims that were incompatible with that system . The ORG did ; and the applicant , far from repudiating its aims , had approved of them . The ORG \u2019s doubts had consequently not been prompted , as ORG had held , by statements in the applicant \u2019s book \" PERSON in seiner PERSON \" but had been corroborated and strengthened by them .", "Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , which was relied on by the applicant and protected freedom of art , science , research and teaching , did not lead to any different conclusion . Academics had a large measure of professional independence but that did not absolve them from their duty of loyalty to LAW . Notwithstanding the first sentence of LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , they remained civil servants , and a university lecturer with the status of probationary civil servant could be dismissed for unsuitability .", "The Ministry had been entitled to base its decision on Mr. PERSON \u2019s involvement with the ORG , notwithstanding that it had been aware of this at an earlier date , and on the content of the aforementioned book , which had been published only in DATE and mentioned in the appeal proceedings .", "Lastly , ORG dismissed various procedural complaints which had been raised before it .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON applied to ORG to have the judgments of ORG and ORG set aside , on the ground that they contravened various Articles of LAW .", "In particular , he challenged the objectivity and relevance of the evidence used against him and contended that the judgments complained of had been arbitrary . The courts which had given those judgments had made no attempt to establish whether the ORG and he had , by their statements , attacked the principles of LAW . The ORG and he were not in fact pursuing aims that were incompatible with LAW . The views expressed in his book were covered by freedom of expression and none of them bore on any principles of the free democratic system . Moreover , they were in line with the views of most present - day historians . The judgments in issue had accordingly infringed his right , secured in LAW , not to be discriminated against on account of his opinions . In penalising a political opponent for holding views that were not directed against the democratic system , the authorities had disregarded his right to freedom of conscience and opinion , secured in LAW . His dismissal and the criticisms of his book amounted to unlawful interference with his freedom of expression , contrary to LAW ) . He had also been banned from his profession ( Berufsverbot ) , a measure which was incompatible with LAW , since he could no longer find a university lectureship at his age . In dismissing him , the Land , in defiance of LAW ) , had deprived him of rights recognised by all the other ORG ( except GPE ) , which did not harass ORG members . Despite his suitability , professional qualifications and efficiency , he was being arbitrarily refused access to a civil - service post , or prevented from remaining in one , contrary to LAW . Lastly , his dismissal - based on circumstances which were both lawful and known at the time of his appointment - was contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG Sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , ORG decided on DATE not to entertain the constitutional complaint , on the ground that it had insufficient prospects of success .", "Citing its own case - law ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) , it recalled firstly that the duty of loyalty to the ORG and the LAW was one of the traditional principles of the civil service ( LAW . Anyone who was not clearly prepared at all times to uphold the free democratic constitutional system was thus unfit to hold a civil - service post . Any probationary civil servant who could not be relied upon to do so must therefore be dismissed on grounds of personal unsuitability . In this connection , membership of a party whose aims were incompatible with the free democratic system was a relevant consideration .", "In the particular case , examination of the judgments challenged did not disclose any breach of constitutional law . Neither the findings of fact nor the conclusions of ORG and ORG were tainted by arbitrariness . The applicant \u2019s dismissal did not breach any of the rights he relied on .", "CARDINAL . ORG As his appeal against dismissal had a suspensive effect , Mr. PERSON was able to continue teaching at ORG , but the dismissal became final after ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . He was accordingly notified on DATE that his employment was at an end ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
