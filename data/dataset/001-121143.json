The first applicant is ORG , ORG ( \u201c the POA \u201d ) , a listed and certified trade union in GPE . The other applicants are NORP nationals : PERSON , born in DATE , and Mr PERSON , born in DATE . They are both resident in GPE and are employed as prison officers , PERSON in a ORG - run prison and Mr LOC in a prison that was transferred to private - sector management in DATE . They are members of the ORG . PERSON indicated she is the chair of the union branch in her establishment , and Mr PERSON indicated that he is secretary to the union branch in his place of employment .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were represented by PERSON of ORG , a law firm in GPE , and advised by Mr PERSON and Professor PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agents , PERSON and PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . A joint submission was received from ORG ( ORG ) and ORG ( ORG ) , which had both been given leave by the President to intervene CARDINAL parties in the written procedure ( LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE it was established that prison officers were forbidden by law to take industrial action . The issue arose in the context of injunction proceedings taken against the ORG to prevent it organising industrial action ( ORG v. PERSON , DATE , unreported ) . ORG ( DATE J ) ruled that since prison officers were vested with the \u201c powers or privileges of a constable \u201d ( Prisons Act , DATE , section CARDINAL) , they were for this reason expressly excluded from the terms \u201c employees \u201d and \u201c workers \u201d within the meaning of the statutory provisions governing lawful industrial action ( ORG , DATE , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . DATE , legislation was introduced to restore to prison officers the status of workers for the purpose of employment law , while maintaining the ban on industrial action ( ORG and LAW , DATE , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . The parties expressed contrasting views on these developments . For the applicants , the PERSON ruling was \u201c an unintended legal anomaly \u201d , and section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW a sudden change of long - standing policy by fixing in legislation what was a surprising and unheralded court decision \u201d . The ORG rejected that view , stating that it was the intention of ORG to give a clear statutory basis to the ban on industrial action by prison officers , rendered necessary by the willingness of the ORG to take such action .", "CARDINAL . Industrial relations in the prison service are conducted in various formats and in accordance with a variety of procedures . As in other parts of the public sector in GPE , there are in the prison service what are known as \" ORG \" , at both local and national level . These are joint bodies , made up of representatives of management and staff , whose purpose is to facilitate co - operation . Acting principally as forums for consultation and dialogue , they do not encompass binding dispute settlement mechanisms . For this reason , the applicants considered that the dialogue that takes place within ORG is not true collective bargaining . They held the same view in relation to the establishment - level disputes procedure ( ORG . CARDINAL ) , which details the procedure to be followed in such situations but does not lead to a resolution binding on management .", "CARDINAL . There have been successive industrial relations - agreements within the prison sector . In DATE , the ORG and the prison service entered into LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . The ORG , which did not apply to the issue of remuneration , included a legally binding prohibition on strike action . The applicants described the ORG as \u201c asymmetric \u201d in this regard , as there was no equivalent binding obligation on the part of the ORG . There were disagreements between the CARDINAL sides over the precise scope of application of the ORG . On DATE the ORG served notice of their intention to withdraw from the ORG , which terminated DATE .", "CARDINAL . A new agreement , ORG ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) , was reached in DATE . It too contained an undertaking by the ORG not to take industrial action . The ORG , which did not apply to remuneration , took effect in DATE . At the same time , the statutory prohibition on industrial action was disapplied . Formal assurances were given to ORG that it would be reactivated in the event of the ORG being terminated . According to the applicants , there was again repeated disagreement between the CARDINAL sides as to the scope of the ORG , leading the ORG to give notice of termination in DATE , effective DATE . The ORG stated that on the whole the ORG operated successfully , as shown by the number of new policies introduced within the prison service and the number of changed policies , which were adopted without dispute . They added that , notwithstanding the undertaking given , the ORG threatened industrial action in DATE , DATE and DATE . A special delegates\u2019 conference of the ORG voted in DATE not to accept any further agreement that included a no - strike undertaking . With the termination of the FAC on DATE , the statutory prohibition on industrial action was brought back into force . A new provision was added to the DATE Act empowering the Secretary of ORG to suspend and revive the prohibition ( section CARDINALA ) .", "CARDINAL . A new agreement within the prison service took effect in DATE , ORG for Changes for Specified Terms and Conditions ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and is currently in force . It provides for binding arbitration , but , like previous agreements , does not apply to pay . The situation in GPE is different . There the Voluntary Industrial Relations Agreement for the NORP prison service provides that , in the absence of agreement , pay disputes are to be resolved by binding independent arbitration .", "CARDINAL . The issue of remuneration of prison officers employed in ORG - run prisons in GPE , GPE and GPE comes within the remit of ORG ( \u201c PSPRB \u201d ) , created in DATE . For private - sector prison establishments , remuneration and other employment matters are agreed contractually .", "CARDINAL . Composed of independent members , the function of the ORG is to make recommendations DATE on prison - officer pay to the Secretary of ORG for ORG . At the outset of each exercise , the Secretary of ORG may give directions , in the form of a \u201c remit letter \u201d , to the ORG setting out the considerations to which they are to have regard ( Regulation CARDINAL , ORG ( Pay Review Body ) Regulations DATE ) . This power has been used repeatedly . In addition , the Chair of the PSPRB meets with the Chancellor of the ORG or the Chief Secretary of the ORG prior to the start of each review exercise to discuss the general economic context . Trade union involvement in the process takes the form of submitting evidence and making representations to the PSPRB ( Regulation CARDINAL ) . The ORG \u2019s recommendations are not binding on the Secretary of ORG , who may accept them , or \u201c make such other determination ... as he thinks fit \u201d ( Regulation CARDINAL , Prison Service ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG brought a complaint before ORG alleging that the statutory prohibition of industrial action by prison officers constituted a breach of the right to strike under ORG No . DATE . The ORG \u2019s conclusions on the case are set out below ( at paragraphs CARDINAL and following ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants stated that industrial action , including strike action , occurred from time to time in the prison service before DATE . They provided examples of strikes at local level and , at national level , of other forms of industrial action in DATE . On DATE the ORG organised , for the first time , a national strike by prison officers , in protest against the ORG \u2019s decision to stage DATE pay rise . According to the Government , notice of the strike was given by telephone TIME before the strike commenced at TIME lawyers obtained an injunction against the ORG by TIME that day . Prison officers returned to work that TIME , TIME after the strike began . The strike disrupted the normal operation of the prison service , and in CARDINAL institute for young offenders the absence of prison officers led to serious disorder that lasted for DATE and caused extensive material damage . The applicants countered that DATE had passed without incident in CARDINAL other prison establishments affected by the strike . As for the establishment referred to by the Government , an official report into the incident had noted that the rationale for the violence was complex , the strike by prison officers being just CARDINAL contributing factor , amplified by negative reporting on television . The report had considered that the indiscipline was spontaneous , and so could not have been foreseen or avoided .", "CARDINAL . The Government maintained that the ORG was intent on withholding its ORG services as part of a general public service strike on CARDINAL DATE , and that it had sought to rely on health and safety concerns which the Government described as spurious . The situation was ultimately resolved DATE before under threat of legal action . The applicants rejected the ORG \u2019s account , asserting the validity of their concerns at the time , given that other categories of prison staff would be on strike , as well as fire services and ambulance crew . On DATE of the strike , ORG members had merely held lunchtime meetings , with management permission , so as to demonstrate their support for the aims of the strike . Another public - sector strike took place on DATE . According to the Government , the ORG indicated beforehand that its members would just attend lunchtime meetings . Despite this , ORG members stayed away from work for TIME in over CARDINAL establishments , necessitating the intervention of prison service lawyers . The applicants denied that the actions of ORG members on DATE amounted to industrial action . They noted that while here had been correspondence from prison - service lawyers , no proceedings had been issued and that the ORG leadership had ordered its members to resume work at lunchtime . The action taken DATE had not led to any danger to persons or property .", "CARDINAL .

DATE ) ( see \u201c Giving globalisation a human face \u201d , ORG , DATE , at paragraph CARDINAL ) . This Convention was ratified by GPE on DATE .

Considering that the prison service constitutes an essential service in the strict sense of the term and that prison officers , as well as prisoner custody officers to the extent that they perform the same functions , exercise authority in the name of the ORG , the ORG is of the view that it is in conformity with freedom of association principles to restrict or prohibit the right to take industrial action in the prison service . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
