The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the editor - in - chief of a publishing company and of an aviation magazine . He is also the chairperson of the GPE branch of ORG , an NGO monitoring the state of media freedom in the NORP regions , which promotes the independence of the regional mass media , freedom of speech and respect for journalists\u2019 rights , and provides legal support , including through litigation , to journalists .", "CARDINAL . He was subscribed to the services of several mobile network operators .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he brought judicial proceeding against CARDINAL mobile network operators , claiming that there had been an interference with his right to the privacy of his telephone communications . He claimed that pursuant to Order no . CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL below ) of ORG predecessor , ORG , the mobile network operators had installed equipment which permitted ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to intercept all telephone communications without prior judicial authorisation . The applicant argued that Order no . DATE , which had never been published , unduly restricted his right to privacy . He asked the court to issue an injunction ordering the removal of the equipment installed pursuant to Order no . CARDINAL , and to ensure that access to mobile telephone communications was given to authorised persons only . ORG ( hereafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) and GPE and ORG of the ORG were joined as a third party to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims . It found that the applicant had not proved that the mobile network operators had transmitted any protected information to unauthorised persons or permitted the unrestricted or unauthorised interception of communications . The equipment to which he referred had been installed to enable law - enforcement agencies to conduct operational - search activities in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law . The installation of such equipment had not in itself interfered with the privacy of the applicant \u2019s communications . The applicant had failed to demonstrate any facts which would warrant a finding that his right to the privacy of his telephone communications had been violated .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed . He claimed , in particular , that ORG had refused to accept several documents in evidence . Those documents had included CARDINAL judicial orders authorising the interception of mobile telephone communications retrospectively and an addendum to the standard service provider agreement issued by CARDINAL of the mobile network operators . CARDINAL of the judicial orders in question , issued on DATE , authorised the interception of several people \u2019s mobile telephone communications during the periods from CARDINAL to DATE , from DATE , from DATE to DATE and from CARDINAL DATE . The other judicial order , issued on DATE , authorised the interception of a PERSON mobile telephone communications during the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . As to the addendum , it informed the subscriber that if his number were used to make terrorist threats , the mobile network operator might suspend the provision of the telephone service and transfer the collected data to the law - enforcement agencies . In the applicant \u2019s opinion , the judicial orders and the addendum proved that the mobile network operators and law - enforcement agencies were technically capable of intercepting all telephone communications without obtaining prior judicial authorisation , and routinely resorted to unauthorised interception .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE upheld the judgment on appeal . It confirmed ORG finding that the applicant had failed to prove that his telephone communications had been intercepted . Nor had he shown that there was a danger that his right to the privacy of his telephone communications might be unlawfully infringed . To establish the existence of such a danger , the applicant would have had to prove that the respondents had acted unlawfully . However , mobile network operators were required by law to install equipment enabling law - enforcement agencies to perform operational - search activities and the existence of that equipment did not in itself interfere with the privacy of the applicant \u2019s communications . The refusal to admit the judicial orders of DATE and DATE in evidence had been lawful , as the judicial orders had been issued in respect of third persons and were irrelevant to the applicant \u2019s case . ORG further decided to admit in evidence and examine the addendum to the service provider agreement , but found that it did not contain any information warranting reconsideration of ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . It can be seen from a document submitted by the applicant that in DATE an NGO , \u201c Civilian Control \u201d , asked ORG office to carry out an inspection of ORG in the sphere of interception of communications in order to verify their compatibility with federal laws . In DATE an official from ORG office telephoned \u201c ORG \u201d and asked for copies of the unpublished attachments to Order No . DATE , saying that the prosecutor \u2019s office had been unable to obtain them from ORG . In DATE the Prosecutor General \u2019s office refused to carry out the requested inspection ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
