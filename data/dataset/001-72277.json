FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Director in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant sustained injuries to his shoulder , arms and wrists in an accident on DATE while driving a kick sledge . An insurance company granted the applicant a DATE allowance ( p\u00e4iv\u00e4raha , dagpenning ) for CARDINAL % reduction of his working capacity from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "As the applicant apparently had continued problems , especially with his right wrist , he submitted medical opinions to the insurance company , applying for a continued DATE allowance / accident pension for DATE . On DATE the insurance company rejected his application and denied the compensation claim for loss of income , considering that the applicant \u2019s working capacity was reduced by CARDINAL PERCENT and that he was able to work at his post as technical director in a company .", "The applicant sought medical help in DATE and participated , inter alia , in a rehabilitation examination . Right elbow nerve damage and signs of damage to the right wrist as well as depression were diagnosed in a medical opinion dated DATE . The applicant also underwent an isotope survey on DATE and submitted to the insurance company a medical opinion dated DATE regarding his hands and wrists .", "On DATE the insurance company upheld its previous decision and decided not to grant the applicant a DATE allowance for DATE .", "On DATE the insurance company corrected its previous decision of CARDINAL DATE so as to grant the applicant an accident pension for CARDINAL % reduction of working capacity from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( tapaturmalautakunta , olycksfallsn\u00e4mnden ) requesting an accident pension ( tapaturmael\u00e4ke , olycksfallspension ) as of DATE . He relied , inter alia , on a medical opinion in which he was regarded as unfit to work until DATE ; on a medical opinion of DATE , in which he was regarded as unfit to work for DATE ; and on documents from the rehabilitation examination in DATE .", "The insurance company submitted in its observations that the applicant was not entitled to compensation after DATE . It maintained that the accident had caused impact injuries to the applicant \u2019s left shoulder joint , left forearm and both wrists . The applicant claimed that he had sustained injuries in addition to his shoulder , neck , right shoulder joint and right forearm , requesting an accident pension as from DATE with interest .", "The insurance company further adduced a medical opinion dated DATE in which the applicant was regarded as unfit to work due to depression until DATE . The company maintained that the applicant \u2019s neck strain and depression were not caused by the accident of CARDINAL DATE and that the elbow nerve damage , which was caused by the said accident , was so mild that it did not render the applicant incapable to work .", "On DATE ORG upheld the insurance company \u2019s decision of DATE . It reasoned its decision as follows :", "\u201c Based on the medical evidence submitted [ the applicant ] has sustained impact injuries to both his wrists , left shoulder area and left forearm area as well as damage to his right elbow nerve as a result of the accident on DATE . These injuries have not reduced his working capacity by CARDINAL PERCENT as from DATE and [ the applicant ] is therefore not entitled to an accident pension pursuant to section DATE , subsection CARDINAL of GPE . [ The applicant ] must be regarded as capable of working as a managing director / technical director at his post . ORG holds that [ the applicant \u2019s ] present difficulties with his right hand and arm are to a high degree of probability not caused by the accident on DATE , given that hardly any tissue damage has been found in the magnetic scan of his right hand or in the ORG - examination . The left elbow nerve damage , for which the applicant has received compensation from the insurance company , is mild and ORG holds that it is probably sickness - related . ORG further finds that [ the applicant \u2019s ] depression , which reduces his working capacity , was neither caused by the accident of DATE , or by the subsequent injuries . Initially no neck strain was found and neither had any damage to [ the applicant \u2019s ] right shoulder joint been reported in connection with the accident . \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG requesting an accident pension as from DATE with interest . He submitted to ORG CARDINAL medical opinions dated DATE and DATE supporting his claims and a certificate indicating that the applicant had tried to find employment on DATE . According to ORG decision it invited observations from both parties and received letters from the applicant dated DATE . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal and upheld ORG decision . ORG reasoned its decision as follows :", "\u201c Reasons mentioned in ORG decision . The submitted new evidence does not give rise to different conclusions . \u201d", "The applicant sought leave to appeal from ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) . ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal on DATE .", "Following an appeal on DATE ORG Health ( sosiaali- ja terveysministeri\u00f6 , social- och h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rdsministeriet ) maintained that the insurance company had in some of its observations by mistake mentioned nerve damage in the applicant \u2019s left elbow whereas the nerve damage was in fact in the right elbow . It however noted that the mistake had not affected the outcome of the case as the appellate bodies had had access to the original medical opinions which described the injuries correctly .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of LAW ( hallitusmuoto , regeringsform , CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , as in force at the relevant time , provided that everyone should have the right to have his case considered appropriately and without undue delay by a lawfully competent court of justice or other public authority as well as the right to have a decision concerning his rights and obligations reviewed by a court of justice or other independent judicial organ . LAW said section provided that the publicity of proceedings and the right to be heard , to receive a decision with stated grounds and to appeal against the decision as well as other guarantees of a fair trial and of good public administration were to be secured by ORG .", "At the relevant time chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) provided that a judgment had to be reasoned , indicating the facts and the legal argumentation on which it was based and the grounds which had led the court to hold a disputed issue established or unsubstantiated .", "Section CARDINAL of the Decree on ORG ( asetus tapaturmalautakunnasta , f\u00f6rordningen om olycksfallsn\u00e4mnden ; CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that ORG functions as the first appellate body in matters concerning obligatory accident insurance .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( tapaturmavakuutuslaki , lag om olycksfallsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring ; DATE ) provides that appellate bodies in accident insurance matters are ORG , ORG and ORG .", "On ORG there are a full - time president , CARDINAL vice - presidents and CARDINAL lawyer and medical doctor members as well as CARDINAL members representing labour market organisations . They all bear the responsibility of a judge . The president , the vice - presidents and the lawyer members must be qualified to sit as a judge and they must have a good knowledge of accident insurance . The medical doctor members must be registered and have a good knowledge of insurance medicine . All the members and their personal substitutes were at the relevant time appointed by ORG for a fixed term of DATE . The labour market members were appointed on a proposal by the ORG and GPE organisations .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of GPE ( tapaturmavakuutuslaki , lag om olycksfallsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , DATE ) an accident pension is paid on condition that an employee \u2019s working capacity because of the injury or illness caused by an accident is estimated to have been reduced by PERCENT ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
