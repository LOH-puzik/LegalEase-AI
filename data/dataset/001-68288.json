He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE", "The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE a new concept called \u201c tax asset stripping cases \u201d ( selskabst\u00f8mmersager ) came into existence in GPE . It covered a criminal activity by which the persons involved committed aggravating debtor fraud by buying up and selling numerous inactive solvent private limited companies within a short period , and for the sake of their own profit , \u201c stripping \u201d the companies for assets , including deposits earmarked for payment of corporation tax . Often the persons involved systematically acquired the inactive , solvent companies for the companies ' own fund . The persons involved were usually intricately interconnected and collaborated about their economic criminal activities , which concerned very large amounts . According to surveys made by the customs and tax authorities , CARDINAL companies with a total tax debt exceeding MONEY ( ORG ) were stripped in the period from DATE until DATE . Following a number of legislative amendments , the trade in inactive , solvent companies largely ceased in DATE .", "On DATE the tax authorities sent a letter to the police in GPE and requested assistance to investigate a case of tax asset stripping involving CARDINAL NORP nationals . The preliminary investigation , which was undertaken in secret , began in DATE and revealed that the applicant and many other NORP nationals were also involved .", "Behind closed doors and thus unknown to the applicant , on DATE ORG in GPE ) , henceforth referred to as ORG , granted warrants to the police to search the premises of the applicant , but also those of a number of banks , accountants ' firms , law firms and companies that had been used by the applicant and others in relation to the tax asset stripping .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested and charged with tax asset stripping of CARDINAL companies in the period DATE . At the same time the police carried out a search at his LOC in accordance with the above court order . The applicant was released DATE .", "ORG issued a discovery order on DATE with regard to a specified bank and its documents relating among others to the applicant .", "Subsequently , on DATE the applicant was arrested anew , still charged with tax asset stripping relating to CARDINAL companies . Also , his premises were searched anew . Subject to court orders , the applicant was detained on remand in the period from DATE until DATE when , on appeal , ORG of Eastern Denmark ( PERSON Landsret ) , henceforth referred to as ORG , released him stating that there was no reason to suspect that he would be able to hamper the on - going investigation if set free .", "In the period from DATE until DATE ORG issued numerous search warrants and discovery orders concerning banks , lawyers , state - authorised public accountants , credit card companies and other companies .", "Thus , court orders relating to the above residing in GPE were issued by ORG on DATE , DATE and DATE ; on DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ; on DATE and CARDINAL DATE ; and on DATE .", "Court orders relating to the above residing outside GPE and corresponding international letters of request were issued by ORG on DATE as to a number of companies on GPE and in GPE ; on DATE as to a credit card company in GPE ; on CARDINAL DATE as to CARDINAL banks in GPE in LOC ; on DATE as to a bank and a company in GPE ; and on DATE as to a bank in GPE .", "In the same period , as part of their investigation , the NORP police also required assistance from various individuals and institutions in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "Furthermore , in order to assist the police in processing the material obtained from the searches and the discovery orders a firm of stateauthorised public accountants was hired to untangle the intricate corporation structures and ownership structures of the companies , as well as the problems of tax technicalities posed by the case and the CARDINAL of financial transactions . Hence , in the period from DATE until DATE audit reports were drawn up for each of the CARDINAL companies that had been stripped of their assets as well as an additional number of companies that had been used as intermediaries and buyers and a seemingly fictitious bank registered in GPE . The accountants also made a statement on financial transactions concerning the companies involved .", "In the meantime , by judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the CARDINAL NORP nationals , who in DATE had been reported to the police by the tax authorities . They were both convicted in accordance with their confessions and sentenced respectively to DATE imprisonment .", "In DATE the public prosecution informed ORG that an indictment in the applicant 's case was expected to be ready in DATE . At the same time it was emphasised that the CARDINAL NORP nationals , who had been convicted by ORG , were to be heard as witnesses on the prosecution 's behalf . Accordingly , in order to avoid issues of impartiality , the presiding judge of ORG in a letter of CARDINAL DATE requested the President of ORG to appoint a substitute judge in the case against the applicants and the co - charged . The presiding judge of ORG pointed out that dates for the hearings needed to be scheduled as soon as possible , and that it should be taken into account in this respect that each of the CARDINAL defendants had their own chosen counsel , some of whom were already busy with other cases in DATE to come .", "In DATE , ORG ( with a substitute judge appointed ) , the public prosecutor , counsel for the applicant and counsel for the CARDINAL cocharged agreed on provisional dates for scheduling court hearings .", "As the trial would take up a lot of space , ORG had to rent suitable facilities to accommodate all the persons involved and all the documents . In DATE ORG signed a lease contract for appropriate facilities which , however , needed to be refurbished before the trial could begin .", "By indictment of DATE , submitted to ORG , the applicant was indicted inter alia pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) cf . section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , and cf . section CARDINAL of seventytwo counts of fraudulent preference of a particularly aggravated nature involving tax asset stripping of CARDINAL companies , having been committed in collaboration with the CARDINAL coaccused and others .", "Pre - trial reviews were held on DATE , DATE and DATE , during which it was decided inter alia that the trial commence on DATE and that DATE each week should be scheduled for the trial . CARDINAL court hearings were fixed for the period from DATE until DATE ; CARDINAL hearings were fixed for DATE ; and CARDINAL hearings were fixed for the period from DATE until DATE , reserving DATE for closing speeches . Also , ORG appointed back - up counsel for the applicant and the co - accused .", "Another pre - trial review was held on DATE . Furthermore , during DATE and DATE , procedural questions were determined e.g. as to whether CARDINAL audit reports and various other reports concerning the financial transactions of the companies and persons involved were admissible as evidence during the trial . This was answered in the affirmative by ORG on DATE , a decision that was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE , and by ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) on DATE . A decision of CARDINAL DATE , according to which ORG judge did not have to vacate his seat on the bench due to disqualification , was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE .", "The proceedings began as planned before ORG on DATE .", "Thereafter approximately CARDINAL court hearings took place DATE , except from DATE when the parties involved took DATE . Altogether , CARDINAL whole court days were used before ORG for the trial , including DATE of pre - trial review .", "In DATE additional dates for hearings to be held during DATE were scheduled . On DATE dates for CARDINAL additional hearings were scheduled for DATE , and DATE additional hearings for DATE .", "In DATE , ORG allowed that CARDINAL of the co - accused change counsel , provided that such would not entail any delay of the trial . Also , ORG stated that the trial had to be brought to an end within the dates previously scheduled and that no extension would be permitted .", "In the period from DATE until DATE , the applicant , the CARDINAL coaccused , and CARDINAL witnesses were heard , including CARDINAL state - authorised public accountants , who gave evidence over DATE in which they collaborated on the audit reports , etc . In addition , statements of accounts and a considerable amount of other documentary evidence were presented about e.g. corporate structures involving NORP and foreign companies and money transactions in NORP and foreign banks .", "Each exhibit for the case took up CARDINAL ACARDINAL binders and contained MONEY pages of documentary evidence , including the CARDINAL audit reports concerning the solvent companies that had been stripped of their tax assets and CARDINAL audit reports concerning companies used for emptying the solvent companies and a statement of financial transaction .", "On CARDINAL , DATE And DATE the public prosecutor gave his closing speech . Counsel for the applicant gave his closing speech on CARDINAL DATE . Counsel for the CARDINAL co - accused gave their closing speeches on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE .", "On DATE a hearing was held at which the applicant and the coaccused were given an opportunity to make a statement . The proceedings were then adjourned pending ORG deliberations .", "The court records of the proceedings ran to CARDINAL and CARDINAL pages .", "By judgment of DATE , which ran to CARDINAL pages , ORG convicted the applicant of inter alia tax assets stripping in respect of the said CARDINAL counts of the indictment . The court found that the applicant was CARDINAL of the principal offenders and that he had been involved with tax asset stripping concerning an amount of MONEY equal to MONEY CARDINAL . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . In addition , for an indefinite period , he was deprived of his right to establish or to become manager and/or member of a director 's board in a private limited company , or in a company or an association which would require public approval .", "By the same judgment CARDINAL of the coaccused were convicted and CARDINAL of them acquitted .", "As to the length of the proceedings ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c The [ applicant and the co - accused ] were charged in the period from DATE , and prosecution was initiated by indictment of DATE . The trial started in DATE .", "There is no basis for establishing that the investigation has been unnecessarily inactive during any period , nor is there any reason to criticise the scope or length of the investigation in view of the nature and magnitude of the case . Thus , there is no violation of LAW .", "However , when imposing the sentence ORG stated :", "\u201c Although the public prosecution can not be blamed for the length of the proceedings , nevertheless , in metering out the sentence the court has taken into consideration the strain inflicted on [ the applicant and the co - accused ] , due to the fact that the proceedings have extended over so many years \u201d .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG and LAW cross - appealed on DATE . The judgment was also appealed against by CARDINAL of the co - accused , in respect of whom the public prosecution served a cross - appeal during DATE and DATE .", "On DATE the ORG appointed back - up counsel for the applicant and the co - accused during the appeal proceedings and in agreement with the parties scheduled a pre - trial review to take place on DATE . According to the court records of DATE , ORG tried to commence the hearings in DATE , but that this was not possible as several of the counsel chosen by the co - accused had to appear as counsel in other prolonged proceedings . They were therefore unable to attend the appeal proceedings until DATE . This also applied to CARDINAL of the applicant 's counsel , who could not attend the appeal proceedings because he had to appear for the defence in CARDINAL other comprehensive criminal proceedings which would take up DATE in the period from DATE until DATE . In addition , he had to attend a number of hearings in other less comprehensive cases in the same period . Thus , the proceedings were scheduled to begin on DATE and , at the request of the parties involved , ORG fixed CARDINAL hearings to take place . In the meantime practical and procedural matters were dealt with e.g. , in respect of the latter , ORG intention to lift a prohibition against disclosure of names .", "The trial commenced on DATE , and thereafter CARDINAL court hearings took place DATE .", "On DATE ORG requested that the proceedings against CARDINAL of the co - accused be separated for a special hearing and that a judgment to acquit him be passed immediately because some conditions of ORG relating to the indictment had not been satisfied . ORG passed judgment accordingly .", "On DATE CARDINAL of the co - accused withdrew his appeal . As ORG withdrew his cross - appeal ORG dismissed the case as to this co - accused .", "On DATE the prosecution submitted an amended indictment of DATE . Notably , the description of the time of the alleged crime was changed from periods into exact dates in each count of the indictment , and CARDINAL sentence was inserted as to the counts concerning aggravated debtor fraud so that not only the loss actually caused by the applicant was included , but also the obvious risk of a loss that he had inflicted the private limited companies . Furthermore , the prosecution withdrew CARDINAL counts of the indictment . Counsel for the applicant and the co - accused claimed dismissal or further corrections of the amended indictment , which was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "In the period DATE and DATE the proceedings were adjourned due to illness on behalf of CARDINAL of the co - accused .", "On DATE the case was set down for judgment .", "In the period DATE and DATE , altogether CARDINAL court hearings were held , during which the applicant , the coaccused and witnesses were heard , including CARDINAL of the stateauthorised public accountants . In addition , audit reports , statements of accounts and a considerable amount of other documentary evidence were presented .", "By judgment of DATE , which ran to CARDINAL pages , the applicant was convicted in accordance with the indictment of DATE , but for CARDINAL counts , including the CARDINAL counts that the prosecution had already withdrawn . Thus , the applicant was found guilty of CARDINAL counts , in which the total sum of unpaid taxes amounted to approximately DKK CARDINAL equal to CARDINAL .", "The sentence was increased to DATE imprisonment and the deprivation of his right to become manager etc . was confirmed . As to the length of the proceedings ORG stated :", "\u201c The acquisitions of the CARDINAL companies originally comprised by the indictment took place from DATE until DATE . In DATE [ the applicant ] and [ CARDINAL of the co - accused ] were charged with fraudulent preference in relation to the acquisition of CARDINAL inactive , solvent companies which had made claims against the tax authorities for payments of tax compensation of just over DKK MONEY . A report was lodged with the police in DATE . The indictment was drafted in DATE , ORG trial commenced in DATE , and judgment was passed on DATE . ORG trial commenced in DATE after a pre - trial review had been held with the then CARDINAL counsel in DATE .", "Although proceedings lasting DATE in a criminal case must be considered , in principle , as a violation of the right to a \u201c hearing within a reasonable time \u201d afforded by LAW , no violation is found to have occurred in this case in respect of any of the defendants . [ When reaching this ] decision it has been found of importance that the case turned out to involve a far larger number of company acquisitions than originally assumed , that the company acquisitions took place by means of a large number of companies , both as intermediaries and as buyers , that the various tax elimination initiatives made it necessary for ORG to gather [ information on ] and elucidate a large number of intricate corporate structures , several of which were domiciled in or connected with foreign , sometimes exotic tax havens where investigation had to be made , and that consequently extremely comprehensive audit work was required to elucidate each individual company 's money transactions , which were normally pure book entries without any real content . It can not be attached importance that the ORG proceedings lasted DATE and at that time concerned CARDINAL defendants , as the relevant crime was a new form of complex economic crime involving examination of a considerable number of witnesses and production of substantial documentary evidence , and each defendant 's role in the group had to be clarified . Moreover , no inactive periods are found to have occurred during the proceedings \u201d .", "When metering out the sentence ORG stated :", "\u201c ORG ... has taken into account that [ the case ] concerns aggravated and systematic offences against property involving very substantial amounts and committed by several offenders jointly under cover of highly non - transparent transactions . The length of the time elapsed since the offences were committed has also been taken into account . In view of the nature and the scope of the offences , ORG has found no basis for suspending the sentences imposed in full or in part . \u201d", "The applicant 's request of DATE for leave to appeal against the judgment to ORG was refused by the Leave to Appeal Board ( Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet ) on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
