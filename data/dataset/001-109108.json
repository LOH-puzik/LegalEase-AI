At this time she also submitted an occupational injury report ( arbetsskadeanm\u00e4lan ) to ORG ( F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ) in PERSON .", "In DATE ORG granted her an early retirement pension on the ground that she had permanently lost her work capacity because she suffered from hypertension and burnout .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant filed an application for life annuity ( livr\u00e4nta ) with ORG , claiming that her burnout and hypertension had been directly caused by her work .", "In DATE the applicant submitted a medical certificate from her doctor , PERSON , which stated that she suffered from burnout and hypertension and that her work situation had caused or worsened these conditions . However , on DATE , PERSON , one of ORG own medical doctors ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsl\u00e4kare ) , made the assessment that the applicant \u2019s work had involved such a high level of stress that it had worsened her hypertension but that it had not caused it . As concerned the burnout , there was a lack of scientific consensus that burnout could be caused by factors such as those to which the applicant had been exposed at her work .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant that it was considering rejecting her application for life annuity . It sent her a copy of the case - file and asked her to submit any comments she might have .

By decision of CARDINAL DATE , the court granted leave to appeal . Subsequently , in DATE , the applicant , who was now represented by legal counsel , requested that an expert opinion be obtained from a psychiatrist .

According to LAW of that chapter , acts or omissions by a public authority may give rise to an entitlement to compensation in the event of fault of negligence .", "An individual who wants to claim compensation from the ORG may proceed in either of CARDINAL different ways : He or she may either petition the Chancellor of Justice ( NORP ) in accordance with LAW on ORG against the ORG ( ORG om handl\u00e4ggning av skadest\u00e5ndsanspr\u00e5k mot staten , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , or bring a civil action against the ORG before a district court , with the possibility to appeal to a court of appeal and ORG . No appeal lies against a decision of the Chancellor of ORG . However , if the claim is rejected , the claimant still has the possibility to institute civil proceedings before the courts . In such proceedings , the ORG is represented by the Chancellor of ORG ( LAW [ GPE med instruktion f\u00f6r NORP , DATE ] ) .", "In a judgment of DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) ORG dealt with a claim for damages brought by an individual against the NORP State , inter alia , on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW . The case concerned the excessive length of the criminal proceedings and ORG held that the plaintiff \u2019s right under LAW to have the criminal charges against him determined within a reasonable time had been violated . Based on this finding , and with reference , inter alia , to ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention and the ORG \u2019s case - law under these provisions , in particular the case of GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXI ) , ORG concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation under NORP law for both pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage . With respect to the level of compensation for non - pecuniary damage , ORG took note of the criteria established in the ORG \u2019s case - law stating that the ORG \u2019s practice constituted a natural point of departure in this regard .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the principle concerning a right to damages established in the above - mentioned case of DATE also applied with regard to the rights contained in LAW . ORG stated that the plaintiff \u2019s right to damages on account of a violation of Article CARDINAL should be assessed in the first place under LAW ( Skadest\u00e5ndslagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) and LAW and Other Coercive Measures ( NORP om ers\u00e4ttning vid frihetsber\u00f6vanden och andra tv\u00e5ngs\u00e5tg\u00e4rder , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . To the extent necessary , the relevant provisions of domestic law should be interpreted in accordance with the LAW . If GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW could not be met by such an interpretation , the domestic courts should award compensation without the support of specific legal provisions . As concerned the determination of the level of compensation , ORG repeated that the ORG \u2019s case - law was a natural point of departure but also noted that account must be taken of the fact that different national conditions may lead to variations from CARDINAL country to another in what should be regarded as a reasonable level of compensation .", "In a judgment of DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to respect for their private life under LAW had been violated on the basis that a police decision on a medical examination of some of them had not been \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d . Having found that compensation for the violation could not be awarded directly on the basis of LAW , ORG held that there was no reason to limit the scope of application of the principle established in the above - mentioned cases of DATE and CARDINAL September CARDINAL to violations of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . In view of this and with reference to , inter alia , LAW and the ORG \u2019s case - law under these ORG , ORG concluded that the plaintiffs should be awarded non - pecuniary damages for the violation of LAW . With regard to the levels of compensation , ORG concluded that they should not be too far removed from the levels which applied when awarding damages under LAW . Generally speaking these levels should , however , be compatible with the case - law of the Court . In the same case , ORG had also concluded , in a judgment dated DATE , that there had been a violation of Article CARDINAL and that an award for non - pecuniary damage should be made on the basis of the principle established in the case of DATE .", "A further ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) concerned a claim for damages against the NORP State on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW relating to the suicide of the LAW father while in detention . ORG concluded that the case revealed no violation of LAW . However , in its reasoning leading to this conclusion , ORG noted , inter alia , that according to the ORG \u2019s case - law there was a right to an effective remedy under LAW connected to the ORG \u2019s duty under the ORG to take measures to protect the lives of individuals in custody or who were otherwise deprived of their liberty , which should , in principle , include a possibility of obtaining compensation for damage . ORG referred in particular to the judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL ) .", "In a judgment of DATE ( NJA DATE N CARDINAL ) , ORG confirmed its previous case - law in a case concerning claims for damages against the NORP State on account of excessive length of tax proceedings . The court affirmed that it is now a general principle of law that to the extent that GPE has a duty to provide redress to victims of Convention violations through a right to compensation for damages , and that this duty can not be fulfilled even by interpreting national tort law in accordance with the LAW f\u00f6rdagskonform tolkning ) , compensation for damages may be ordered without direct support in law .", "Lastly , on DATE ORG ordered compensation for non - pecuniary damage to be paid to an applicant for proceedings which had complied neither with the \u201c reasonable length \u201d requirement in Article CARDINAL nor the right to an effective remedy in LAW . The proceedings in question had concerned a claim for damages against the ORG .", "In DATE the ORG decided to set up a working group on tort liability and the ORG to study the current legal situation . In DATE the working group submitted its report ( PERSON , ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) to the Government . In the report it is proposed that LAW be amended in order to allow natural and legal persons to obtain damages from the ORG or a municipality for violations of the LAW . Such an action against public authorities would be examined by a general court which would need first to establish that a right provided by the ORG has been violated . The aim of the proposal is to provide a legal basis for granting non - pecuniary damages arising from disregard of the LAW and to fulfil , together with the other already existing legal remedies , GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW .", "In its comments on the above report ORG , on DATE , stated that , since the autumn of DATE following ORG case - law developments ( as set out above ) , it had dealt with a large number of requests from individuals for compensation on the basis of violations of the Convention . It estimated that it had dealt with CARDINAL cases over DATE . During this time the Chancellor of ORG had also represented the NORP State in a number of cases before the civil courts concerning alleged violations of the Convention . A majority of the cases that the ORG had dealt with had concerned non - pecuniary damages for excessive length of proceedings under LAW . Since DATE , it had received CARDINAL such complaints and in CARDINAL of them , the Chancellor of ORG had found a violation and granted compensation . The level of compensation for non - pecuniary damage had been determined with reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law and varied CARDINAL and SEK CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and LAW ) . Furthermore , the Chancellor of ORG had dealt with a substantial number of cases ( CARDINAL ) concerning the registration of individuals in the register of ORG . These cases had concerned one or more of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Convention . There had also been other individual cases relating to alleged violations of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , among others ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
