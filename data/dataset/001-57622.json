ORG The first applicant , PERSON , is a director of a mining concern and lives with his family at GPE , GPE , in a house which he bought in DATE . The property is situated QUANTITY from FAC , GPE . Since DATE it has lain under a flight departure route from FAC in operation for CARDINAL of the year , usually during DATE . Following objections to the level of noise disturbance , the route was divided into CARDINAL sections in DATE . At least until DATE Mr PERSON \u2019s home fell just within the CARDINAL Noise and Number Index ( ORG ) contour , which is considered to be a low noise - annoyance rating ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . CARDINAL other people live within this contour area . Since DATE the house has been within a lower ORG contour .", "CARDINAL . ORG The second applicant , PERSON , farms together with other members of his family lands situated in PERSON , GPE , which have been in his family for some generations . He lives in a bungalow at ORG acquired by his family as part of its land - holding in DATE . The applicant took up residence there in DATE on the occasion of his marriage . The bungalow is situated CARDINAL and a third QUANTITY west of , and in a direct line with , FAC \u2019s northern runway . It is regularly overflown during DATE and to a limited extent at TIME . It falls within a CARDINAL ORG contour , which is regarded as an area of high noise - annoyance for residents . According to the statistics supplied by the Government , the average height of arriving aircraft over Mr PERSON \u2019s property is QUANTITY and the average height of departing aircraft varies between CARDINAL and QUANTITY according to aircraft type . CARDINAL people around FAC experience a noise exposure equal to or greater than that suffered by Mr PERSON and his family .", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG is a long - term average measure of noise exposure which is used in GPE to assess the disturbance from aircraft noise to communities near airports . It takes account of CARDINAL features of the noise , namely the average noisiness and the number of aircraft heard during DATE . The flights which determine the ORG at any point on the ground are those which take place TIME Greenwich Mean Time during DATE to DATE and which make a peak noise level exceeding CARDINAL perceived noise decibels ( ORG ) at that point . The purpose of the ORG is to represent community reaction to the level of aircraft noise so as to guide planning , development and noise control . Thus , the ORG is amongst the criteria applied in planning controls , so that land within the CARDINAL to CARDINAL NNI contours may be used for residential development , planning permission not being refused on noise grounds alone . However , land within DATE ORG contours ( moderate noise - annoyance zone ) will not be given over to development , except for the infilling of existing built - up areas on condition that appropriate sound insulation is used . No development whatsoever is permitted within the CARDINAL ORG and over contours ( high noise - annoyance zone ) . It is to be noted that the ORG calculation reflects a logarithmic element in the ORG scale , which has the result that every increase of CARDINAL in that scale represents approximately a doubling of the loudness .", "CARDINAL . FAC was formally opened in DATE . In DATE the first scheduled air services using jet airliners were inaugurated . CARDINAL terminals were opened in DATE , DATE and DATE . After a public inquiry which lasted for DATE and heard CARDINAL witnesses , a fourth terminal was opened in DATE . As regards future expansion , the ORG \u2019s policy , as stated in the DATE \" Airports Policy \" White Paper , is that they are \" not prepared to make any commitments at this stage on the question of a fifth terminal at FAC but will keep the matter under review \" ( Command Paper , ORG , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG FAC is CARDINAL of the busiest international airports in the world . The FAC handled CARDINAL passengers in DATE , CARDINAL passengers during DATE , CARDINAL passengers on international routes and CARDINAL passengers on domestic routes in DATE , and CARDINAL passengers on international routes and CARDINAL passengers on domestic routes in DATE . There has been a corresponding increase in aircraft movements over DATE . PERCENT of passengers use the airport as an interchange point . It is currently used by CARDINAL airlines and serves CARDINAL destinations worldwide . It is GPE leading port in terms of visible trade and in DATE handled cargo valued at MONEY . FAC contributes MONEY to GPE balance of payments , provides direct employment for CARDINAL persons , in addition to the substantial number of workers employed locally in servicing the industry , and pays MONEY in local rates and rents .", "CARDINAL . Compensation for the loss of value of houses and land as a result of airport noise is provided for by LAW DATE . However , such compensation is payable only in respect of new or altered public works first brought into use after DATE . Intensification of an existing use is , for reasons of principle and practice , not compensatable . PERSON and PERSON would have no entitlement to compensation under this LAW , there being no relevant new or altered development in the case of FAC .", "CARDINAL . ORG , being a public statutory body , did not have power to acquire property near an airport unless it could show that the acquisition of the property was necessary for the proper performance of its function . In DATE , after the completion of the fourth terminal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and privatisation of the ORG , the successor company to the ORG announced a scheme for the purchase of noise - blighted properties close to FAC . This scheme provided for purchase by the company of property severely affected by aircraft noise at FAC ( within the CARDINAL ORG contour ) where the owner had acquired the property before DATE and wished to sell but could not do so except at a deflated price . Claims had to be made DATE and DATE . By virtue of the contour limitation the applicants\u2019 properties were excluded from the scheme .", "CARDINAL . ORG An action will lie at common law for nuisance in respect of an activity which unreasonably interferes with the use and enjoyment of land , for example an activity causing annoyance through noise . If liability is established , damages may be awarded or , in certain circumstances , an injunction granted . However , LAW DATE specifically exempts aircraft noise from its protection . The liability of aircraft operators is further limited by LAW ) of LAW DATE , which reads :", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW in turn provides for strict liability - that is , liability without proof of intention or negligence - where material loss or damage to any person or property on land or water is caused by , inter alia , an aircraft in flight or an object falling from an aircraft . Provisions equivalent to section DATE existed in earlier civil aviation legislation ( for example , section CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) .", "Section CARDINAL is comparable to LAW Damage Caused by ORG Parties on the Surface , which reads :", "\" Any person who suffers damage on the surface shall , upon proof only that the damage was caused by an aircraft in flight or by any person or thing falling therefrom , be entitled to compensation as provided by this Convention . Nevertheless there shall be no right to compensation if the damage is not a direct consequence of the incident giving rise thereto , or if the damage results from the mere fact of passage of the aircraft through the airspace in conformity with existing air traffic regulations . \" ( LAW , DATE , vol .

Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW does not exclude all liability on the part of aircraft operators for trespass and nuisance caused by aircraft in flight . In the first place , the exemption applies only in respect of aircraft flying at a reasonable height above the ground . What is reasonable is a question of fact depending on all relevant circumstances . Secondly , for the exemption to apply there must be compliance with the statutory provisions referred to in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . In practice this means LAW DATE as amended , ORG ( General ) Regulations DATE as amended , LAW DATE as amended and , of especial importance in this connection , ORG DATE ( and the corresponding provisions of earlier orders and regulations applicable from time to time ) . Thus , if , for example , an aircraft flies in a manner which is not in accordance with the applicable regulations or takes off or lands in contravention of ORG , its operator will not be entitled to rely upon section DATE as a defence to any action for trespass or nuisance .", "CARDINAL . ORG The main forum for international co - operation seeking to make aircraft quieter is ORG ( ICAO ) . The broad thrust of ORG \u2019s work has been towards the development of a series of standards , leading to the phasing out of aircraft unable to meet them . These standards are not operative within the ORG member GPE unless and until they are given effect in national legislation . In the GPE effect is given to them by means of an ORG .", "Orders of DATE and DATE reflected the first ORG standards developed concerning subsonic jet aircraft . A DATE Order gave effect to new ICAO standards and to regulations based upon recommendations of ORG . In doing so , the DATE Order also implemented the requirements of ORG of DATE on \" Limitation of Noise Emission from ORG \" . It was , however , more stringent in its application inasmuch as non - compliant subsonic jets were banned from the domestic register DATE than required by the DATE Directive . Orders of DATE and DATE introduced further ICAO standards .", "CARDINAL . ORG In structuring its landing charges , ORG has taken account of ICAO noise certification standards to encourage the use of quieter aircraft .", "CARDINAL . ORG Since DATE restrictions have been placed on night movements of jets , with the aim of phasing out night flights of noisier aircraft . These measures have been adopted in the light of research into the relationship between aircraft noise and sleep disturbance and after consultation of all interested parties , including ORG to which the applicants belong .", "CARDINAL . Monitoring of aircraft noise on take - off from FAC was first carried out in DATE . Since DATE automatic equipment , consisting of CARDINAL noise monitoring terminals linked to a central processing and control unit , has been used . The positioning of these terminals is designed to protect the first built - up area reached after take - off from noise levels in excess of the statutory limits of CARDINAL ORG DATE ( TIME local time ) and CARDINAL ORG by TIME ( TIME local time ) . In the event of an infringement of the noise limit , the FAC informs the airline by letter and sends a copy to ORG . According to the Government , the effect of recent bans on non - noise - certificated aircraft has been to keep the rate of compliance to PERCENT by DATE and PERCENT by TIME . The Secretary of ORG is empowered by section CARDINAL of LAW to deny FAC \u2019s facilities to operators who fail to comply with noise abatement measures , but to date it has not been found necessary to invoke this provision . On the other hand , night flight quotas have been reduced for infringing operators .", "CARDINAL . Aircraft taking off from FAC are statutorily required to remain on a small number of specified routes , known as noise preferential routes . These routes are designed to avoid as far as possible the major built - up areas .", "CARDINAL . Approach procedures said to result in lower noise levels in comparison with traditional approach procedures are now standard practice . Furthermore , minimum height requirements on approach to land as well as on take - off are laid down in the regulations . In addition , since DATE a system of regularly alternating the landing runway has been implemented at FAC during westerly operations , the main objective being to achieve a fair sharing of periods of relative quiet among the communities of LOC affected by noise from landing aircraft .", "CARDINAL . ORG A helicopter link between FAC and FAC was introduced in DATE . However , after public inquiries in DATE and DATE , the Secretary of ORG gave directions in DATE for the operator \u2019s licence to be revoked for environmental reasons .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following earlier schemes in DATE , DATE , and DATE , a scheme for sound insulation of dwellings was introduced for FAC in DATE . Under this scheme , which cost ORG MONEY , over CARDINAL house owners or occupiers applied for grants . The scheme concentrated on those localities that would still be experiencing comparatively high noise levels in the mid DATE \u2019s and on localities where there is the greatest degree of disturbance due to aircraft noise at TIME . Within this area the amount of grant provided was intended to cover PERCENT of the reasonable costs incurred . The boundary was based on the forecast CARDINAL ORG contour for DATE and the composite of the CARDINAL ORG noise footprint for quieter aircraft . CARDINAL ORG is the exterior noise level below which current evidence suggests that the average person in an uninsulated room is unlikely to be awakened . After consultation and in line with a commitment by the Government to review the boundaries once the actual noise climate was known , an extension scheme to include additional areas was brought into operation in DATE at an estimated cost of MONEY .", "In common with other persons living within the CARDINAL ORG contour , Mr PERSON qualifies for a full noise - insulation grant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
