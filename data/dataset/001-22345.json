She had sex with them and smoked cannabis . On DATE , she took an overdose of paracetamol tablets following an argument with her mother . She was seen by an adolescent psychiatrist who found no ascertained evidence of mental illness and attributed her conduct to \u201c rebellion in the context of a liberal household \u201d .", "On DATE , PERSON was referred to the social services .", "The applicant \u2019s mother sought the help of ORG and ORG repeatedly in relation in particular to her concerns about PERSON \u2019s contacts with B and PERSON Though she told the police after each occasion that she was aware that PERSON had passed the night at the men \u2019s flats , she stated that she was told that they could do nothing as PERSON refused to complain .", "On DATE , a case conference was convened by PERSON \u2019s social worker using child protection law . It was attended by CARDINAL social workers , CARDINAL police officers from the sexual offences and child abuse unit and the applicant . It was decided that , first , the police officer would liase with ORG about PERSON \u2019s exposure to drugs and talk to T to reinforce concern about his relationship with PERSON and , secondly , the social worker would continue working with PERSON in the hope that the latter would begin to recognise the risks to which she was exposed because of her relationship with T.", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s mother wrote to the police and received a reply to the effect that \u201c her comments had been passed on to the officers in the case \u201d .

The inquest was not resumed in the light of the criminal proceedings .", "In DATE D pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s mother wrote to the Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police raising various questions about the lack of police action before PERSON \u2019s death , including a specific question as to why LAW had not been used . On DATE she received a reply in which a representative of the police referred to the difficulties of applying various provisions of the criminal law in this case , but acknowledged \u201c with the benefit of hindsight that more could have been done to prevent < PERSON > from being drawn into the maelstrom of drugs and vice . \u201d", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s mother issued a writ in ORG against ORG and ORG claiming damages for negligence . She applied for legal aid , submitting a statement of case in which she alleged that the police and social services had been aware of her daughter \u2019s connection with CARDINAL men with criminal records and had been warned that she was being led into underage sex and drugs . It was argued that there was no absolute immunity against suing the police , this depending on sufficient proximity existing between the parties , and that in this case the police and social services should have taken decisive action to protect PERSON from these men and prevented her from drifting into prostitution with its inevitable consequences . On the form where it was required to estimate prospects of success of the action , the solicitor indicated that it was not possible to say .", "On DATE , ORG area office refused the applicant \u2019s mother legal aid for these proceedings , stating that \u201c on the information submitted it is considered that you are unlikely to succeed in establishing negligence either in relation to your daughter \u2019s death or in relation to your own post - traumatic stress \u201d .", "On DATE , after a hearing at which the applicant \u2019s mother and her legal representative had attended to make representations as to why legal aid should be granted , the ORG area committee rejected her appeal on the ground that it had no reasonable prospects of success .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s mother was advised by counsel that the common law position was such as to preclude her from pursuing a claim for damages in the domestic courts .", "The applicant \u2019s mother made requests to various authorities for information about the background to and circumstances of PERSON \u2019s death . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG informed her that PERSON \u2019s file would have been destroyed in DATE , pursuant to a DATE rule applying to persons who were not on a child protection register or otherwise in the care of the social services .", "By letter dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s mother was informed by ORG that records existed holding details of the enquiry into PERSON \u2019s murder , but that they were not in a position to give any information additional to the extensive material provided during the police investigation by the Senior Investigating Officer . By letter dated DATE , the solicitors for the Chief Constable of GPE Police disputed that they were under an obligation to provide any further information or documents , and stated that the Chief Constable would however do so if ordered by a court .", "Following further requests to the social services , documents from ORG , including the case conference TIME , were given to the applicant \u2019s mother on DATE .", "In GPE and GPE , there is no single tort which imposes liability to pay compensation for civil wrongs . Instead there are a series of separate torts , for example , trespass , conversion , conspiracy , negligence and defamation . Negligence arises in specific categories of situations . These categories are capable of being extended . There are CARDINAL elements to the tort of negligence : a duty of care , breach of the duty of care and damage . The duty of care may be described as the concept which defines the categories of relationships in which the law may impose liability on a defendant in damages if he or she is shown to have acted carelessly . To show a duty of care , the claimant must show that the situation comes within an existing established category of cases where a duty of care has been held to exist . In novel situations , in order to show a duty of care , the claimant must satisfy a CARDINAL test , establishing :", "\u2013 that damage to the claimant was foreseeable ;", "\u2013 that the claimant was in an appropriate relationship of proximity to the defendant ; and ,", "\u2013 that it is fair , just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant .", "These criteria apply to claims against private persons as well as claims against public bodies . The leading case is ORG v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL ) .", "If the courts decide that as a matter of law there is no duty of care owed in a particular situation , that decision will ( subject to the doctrine of precedent ) apply in future cases where the parties are in the same relationship .", "In PERSON v. Chief Constable of GPE ( DATE A.C. CARDINAL ) , the mother of a victim of the PERSON instituted proceedings against the police alleging that they had failed properly to exercise their duty to exercise all reasonable care and skill to apprehend the perpetrator of various murders and to protect members of the public who might be his victims . Lord PERSON in ORG found that there was no sufficient foreseeability of harm to this victim , there being no general duty of care to protect all young females from a risk at large and that the imposition of liability was also excluded by strong policy reasons relating to the operational efficiency of the police . Exceptions to this approach arose in later cases ( e.g. FAC and another v. the Chief Constable of GPE [ DATE ] Q.B. CARDINAL ) .", "In X and Others v. ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL ) , ORG held that local authorities could not be sued for negligence or for breach of statutory duty in respect of the discharge of their functions concerning the welfare of children . In subsequent cases , it was not excluded that in certain circumstances a duty of care might arise ( see e.g. PERSON v. ORG of GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
