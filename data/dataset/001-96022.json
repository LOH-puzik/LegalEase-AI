He was born in DATE and is represented by Mr PERSON , a solicitor with ORG , a non - governmental civil liberties organisation based GPE . The second applicant is PERSON . She is represented by PERSON of Bindmans Solicitors , GPE . Both are NORP nationals and live in GPE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "s", "On DATE the first applicant participated in a demonstration , which he had organised , in GPE opposite FAC , a \u201c designated area \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act CARDINAL ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The second applicant also participated in it .", "Prior to DATE the first applicant had informed the police orally that the demonstration was going to be held , he gave the time , date and place of the demonstration and ( politely ) informed the police that an authorisation would not be sought . He had also posted information DATE before the demonstration on a website confirming that it was not authorised so that the risk of arrest was high and that , in fact , he had been informed by the police that he would be arrested under LAW . The second applicant was also aware prior to the relevant date that authorisation had not been sought so that demonstrating in that area would be an offence . ORG later noted that the demonstration was just as much a demonstration against the requirement for an authorisation under LAW as against the NORP conflict . ORG ( in its case stated to ORG in the first applicant \u2019s case ) noted police evidence to the effect that , had authorisation been sought , no conditions would have attached to it .", "At the demonstration , the first applicant read out names of NORP citizens killed in the NORP conflict and the second applicant read out names of NORP soldiers killed in that conflict . Placards were displayed about the GPE conflict and a bell was rung at regular intervals . The applicants behaved in a peaceful and orderly manner throughout . The police attended at the demonstration and warned the applicants that they would be arrested and charged if they continued given the lack of an authorisation . The police then withdrew to enable the applicants to stop the demonstration . They chose to continue .", "The first and second applicants were therefore arrested , detained in the police station for a number of TIME and charged : the first applicant for having organised an unauthorised demonstration in a designated area contrary to section CARDINAL ) of LAW and the second for having participated in the same demonstration contrary to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of that Act . It appears that both were granted police bail : the documents submitted do not indicate that bail was subject to any conditions ( apart from appearing before ORG on the relevant date ) .", "Before ORG the applicants argued that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( a ) and ( b ) of the DATE Act were not compatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . Unless those provisions were interpreted compatibly with those ORG , their convictions would be unlawful . ORG found that the relevant sections were necessary and proportionate restrictions of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . In any event , additional words could not be read into the sections as that would run counter to legislative intent . The convictions would not therefore be unlawful under LAW . The applicants were convicted as charged on DATE and DATE , respectively . The first applicant was sentenced to a fine of QUANTITY ( GBP ) and ordered to contribute to prosecution costs in the sum of GBPCARDINAL and the second applicant was sentenced to a conditional discharge of DATE and to contribute to costs in the sum of GBPCARDINAL .", "The applicants appealed by way of a case stated to ORG . They conceded that section CARDINAL ) and ( b ) was not incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention but argued that the relevant State actors ( the police , ORG and the courts ) should have been required to justify the necessity to act ( arrest , prosecute and convict ) on the facts of each individual case . Accordingly , those authorities should have looked not merely at whether there was an authorisation but also at the later peaceful conduct of the actual demonstration . Since ORG had not considered the justification for their conviction along those lines , their arrest , prosecution and conviction were contrary to their Convention rights .", "By judgment dated DATE , ORG dismissed the ORG appeals ( and the appeals of CARDINAL others , PERSON and Others v Director of Public Prosecutions [ CARDINAL EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) ) . It noted that the only charge against the applicants was demonstrating without an authorisation . ORG considered that the reasoning in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) was compelling . Nothing in the other Convention or domestic jurisprudence opened to ORG undermined that reasoning . Those Convention and domestic cases rather raised various public order , safety and security issues ( NORP \u201c FAC f\u00fcr das PERSON \u201d v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; and PERSON and ORG v. GPE , ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIX , as well as PERSON v. ORG , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , CARDINAL Decisions and Reports ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) , CARDINAL ; and PERSON v. GPE , No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission Decision of DATE , PERCENT DATE ) . Accordingly , once it was accepted that the section requiring the authorisation was compatible with LAW ( as the applicants did ) , ORG was not required to look at the nature of the activity actually pursued thereafter without authorisation in order to determine whether a sanction should be imposed . Once an authorisation procedure was LAW , ORG was entitled to impose sanctions for a failure to obtain authorisations . ORG refused to certify a point of law of general public importance for ORG .", "B.
