They are NORP nationals and they are currently detained at FAC . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE with ORG , assisted by Mr PERSON FAC and Mr A. Dos Santos , counsel .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE Mr PERSON was shot and killed in the car park of the Talisman public house in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The present application concerns the applicants\u2019 conviction for the murder of PERSON . They were tried together with a third man , PERSON , who was acquitted by the jury . Their main ground of complaint to this ORG is that , at the men \u2019s trial , the trial judge ( GPE J ) allowed the statements of CARDINAL people to be read to the jury because he was satisfied either that they had been kept away through fear or that they could not be found and reasonable steps had been taken to trace them .", "CARDINAL . The circumstances of Mr ORG murder , the trial and the ORG subsequent , unsuccessful appeal to ORG may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . As stated above , ORG and PERSON are brothers . Their halfbrother , PERSON , was a friend of PERSON . PERSON girlfriend was PERSON . PERSON girlfriend , PERSON , was PERSON niece . PERSON , a friend of PERSON , had been in a relationship with PERSON , which ended before the shooting . It was the statements of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( together with that of a fourth person , PERSON ) which came to be read at trial in the circumstances described in paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below . PERSON gave live evidence , but as a hostile witness for the prosecution : see paragraph CARDINAL below .", "CARDINAL . It was the prosecution \u2019s case that PERSON was the gunman . His motive for shooting PERSON was that the deceased was a rival drug dealer and , just before the shooting , PERSON had found out that PERSON had slept with PERSON . The prosecution also alleged that PERSON was PERSON \u2019s partner in drug dealing , that he drove PERSON to the murder scene and that he provided the murder weapon . Mr GPE was alleged to have been present at the scene as part of the joint enterprise of murder . It was also the prosecution \u2019s case that , after the shooting , the CARDINAL men had met PERSON , PERSON and PERSON at a hotel where they discussed the shooting and how to ensure no one talked about it .", "CARDINAL . PERSON \u2019s defence was that he had been ill in bed at the time of the shooting . PERSON \u2019s defence was that he was not present at the shooting and had no knowledge that it would take place . Mr GPE \u2019s case was that he was present at the scene of the shooting but did not know it would take place and was not a party to it .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the investigations , the police obtained the following witness statements .", "CARDINAL . PERSON \u2019s statements were made to the police after he had been arrested for conspiracy to murder PERSON . He stated that he had been involved , with LAW and PERSON , in buying crack cocaine from Mr Chambers . In DATE before the shooting , the brothers had owed GBP CARDINAL PERSON , which PERSON wanted paying . He also stated that , DATE before the shooting , PERSON and PERSON had rowed because PERSON had told PERSON that she had slept with Mr Chambers . On DATE of the shooting he , PERSON , had spoken to Mr Chambers about the money owed and learned that he would be at the Talisman that evening . He had told Carlo this and later telephoned Carlo from the pub to say that PERSON was there . He had then left the pub for PERSON flat . He returned to the pub with PERSON when told about the shooting .", "In the telephone calls after the shooting he had asked ORG what was going on ; ORG had told him to make sure no one saw anything . When PERSON asked how he could do that , PERSON told him to sort himself out or he would get the same . ORG had also asked him whether PERSON was dead or alive . The following day , PERSON called him to tell him to book them into a hotel . When PERSON , PERSON and Mr GPE arrived there , PERSON said \u201c it was not supposed to happen like that \u201d . ORG said ( referring to Mr GPE ) \u201c How do you think he feels ? He only came along for the ride \u201d .", "In the course of his statements PERSON also told the police that he was scared , not only for himself , but for his family and for PERSON . Later he also said that he was frightened for his safety and for any revenge PERSON and PERSON might take against him , but he was willing to go to court .", "CARDINAL . PERSON in her statements also said that , before the shooting there had been a row at her flat between PERSON and PERSON in which PERSON had used considerable violence on PERSON . Her account of events at the hotel was similar to PERSON account . She agreed that , if asked by the police , she would limit her account to events in the car park after finding PERSON collapsed . She did so out of fear for herself , PERSON , PERSON and her children . PERSON also stated that she too was scared and that she \u201c had her children to think about \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In her statement PERSON stated that the CARDINAL brothers had dealt in drugs and that she understood that PERSON and PERSON obtained their supplies from PERSON . Her relationship with ORG ended before the shooting . After it she had seen PERSON with a black eye . There had been an occasion in DATE when ORG had asked her to hide a balaclava and gun for him .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , an ex - girlfriend of PERSON , provided a statement as to the types of car that he drove .", "CARDINAL . After making their statements , PERSON and PERSON were admitted to the witness protection scheme . On an unspecified date they left the scheme and returned to GPE , only to then disappear . When the matter came to trial at ORG , neither PERSON nor PERSON could be found , despite witness summonses being issued for their attendance . The prosecution took the view that there had been a concerted attempt to subvert the trial and that this had been done on behalf of the defendants by members of their extended family . Accordingly , it applied for the statements of PERSON and PERSON to be read to the jury pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Before determining that application , the trial judge heard evidence in chambers from PERSON mother , PERSON , and from CARDINAL police officers who had attempted to trace Mr GPE and PERSON . CARDINAL of the police officers gave evidence as to a conversation with PERSON in which she recounted an incident where family members of the applicants approached her outside her son \u2019s school and told her that \u201c she should not be a grass \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Having heard that evidence , the trial judge allowed the statements to be read . He ruled :", "\u201c Having heard and seen the witnesses called in this application , I am satisfied so that I am sure of the following ORG", "( CARDINAL ) Following the arrest of the defendants in DATE , both PERSON and PERSON were made subjects of a witness protection scheme ;", "( CARDINAL ) Both PERSON and PERSON voluntarily withdrew from that scheme in DATE and returned to the LOC area where the murder had been committed . They were then living together and continued to live together until DATE ;", "( CARDINAL ) PERSON and PERSON were informed in writing of the date of this trial in DATE and DATE and were notified on those occasions that they were required to attend as witnesses ;", "( CARDINAL ) On DATE , PERSON attended Billeston Street Police Station where she spoke to ORG . In that conversation , she described an incident which had taken place outside her son \u2019s school when members of the PERSON family , associates of the defendants , told her she should not be a grass ;", "( CARDINAL ) PERSON told ORG on DATE that she felt intimidated by the approach made to her by the PERSON family and that she anticipated that that intimidation would become more intensive as the trial date approached . ORG believed , from what PERSON said to him and her general demeanour , that the PERSON connection was capable of intimidating her and that she was fearful for her own safety and that of her family ;", "( CARDINAL ) In DATE , PERSON and PERSON both knew of the trial date , the place of trial and that they were required to attend to give evidence at trial ;", "( CARDINAL ) From DATE , police officers have made repeated attempts to find PERSON and PERSON . Police officers have visited all addresses in any way associated with either witness and have pursued all available avenues of enquiry . Despite all those efforts , neither witness has been found ;", "( CARDINAL) The mother of PERSON , PERSON , has not seen her daughter for DATE . PERSON has left her home and her children , CARDINAL boys aged DATE , and effectively disappeared . The children are being cared for by PERSON . PERSON has no knowledge of her daughter \u2019s whereabouts and does not know how to get in touch with her . Since PERSON left , her younger child was admitted to hospital but even that event , of which PERSON learned through telephone contact with her grandmother , did not prompt her to reappear ;", "( CARDINAL ) PERSON told ORG Pearson that PERSON was staying away from her children for DATE until the trial was over to avoid getting killed and putting her children in danger ;", "( CARDINAL ) PERSON told ORG Pearson that PERSON was frightened and thought he would be killed whether he gave evidence or not . He had tried to commit suicide ;", "( CARDINAL ) PERSON herself is a very frightened woman . She refused to make a written statement about the events surrounding the disappearance of her daughter . Her attendance at court had to be secured by a witness summons and a threat of arrest . The public gallery had to be cleared before she was prepared to give evidence .", "...", "I am satisfied so that I am sure that all reasonable steps have been taken by the police to find both PERSON and PERSON but neither witness can be found . I reject the suggestion that the police should have done more to keep in contact with the witnesses in DATE leading up to the trial . I am satisfied that the steps taken by the police were appropriate and reasonable in the light of the information available to them .", "...", "There is , in my judgment , clear admissible evidence that both witnesses were in fear at the time they made their witness statements to the police . There is further admissible evidence that PERSON was fearful about giving evidence in DATE . There is , however , no admissible evidence that PERSON was in fear of giving oral evidence and whilst it would be possible for me to infer from all these circumstances that he was , I am not able , in his case , to exclude the reasonable possibility that other factors may have influenced his disappearance . It is highly probable that fear of the consequences of giving evidence against the defendants and that alone has prompted him to disappear but I can not be sure of that conclusion . However , in the case of PERSON , I am entirely satisfied that fear for her own safety and fear for the lives of her children have driven her to behave as she has , abandoning her own children even when CARDINAL of them was admitted to hospital . I am further satisfied , in the case of both witnesses , that no adjournment will secure their attendance .", "...", ", in my judgment , wholly credible . The defendants are all in a position to controvert the contents of the statements if they dispute them . I accept , however , that there is a disadvantage to the defence if the statements are read and if they are admitted , the jury must receive clear directions emphasizing that disadvantage . Further , so far as PERSON is concerned , the defence point to a number of features which they submit undermine his credibility . However , LAW of schedule CARDINAL of the DATE Act [ see relevant domestic law and practice at paragraph CARDINAL below ] provides a wholly sufficient remedy for that concern .", "Having taken into consideration all the submissions made and given full weight to the provisions of LAW , I am of the clear view that the statements made by PERSON and PERSON ought to be admitted in the interests of justice . I so rule . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After the trial had started , the prosecution applied for leave to have the statements of PERSON and PERSON read . They again relied on statements of police officers who had sought to trace the women . The trial judge allowed each woman \u2019s statement to be read . In the case of PERSON he found the evidence was \u201c quite overwhelming \u201d that she had been intimidated and that it was not possible to secure her attendance by any reasonable means . For PERSON , he was not satisfied that she was in fear , but was satisfied that all reasonable steps had been taken to find her . The statements were cogent , innately credible and , in each case , controvertible by evidence from the defendants and , indeed , by other possible means . It was in the interests of justice that the statements be admitted .", "CARDINAL . PERSON gave evidence as to the CARDINAL ORG drug dealing . She confirmed that she had slept with PERSON . PERSON had found out in the course of a row they had on DATE and he had hit her . The following night , they met in the Talisman . PERSON was angry and threatened to kill PERSON , and had said that this would be PERSON fault . She left the pub and had been in PERSON flat at the time of the shooting . At the hotel , PERSON said that no one would know who pulled the trigger except him and Carlo . If she told anyone she would get the same . Carlo also told her to keep her mouth shut . She had another conversation with PERSON on DATE in which he admitted to being the gunman . There had been a further conversation , when PERSON was in prison for other reasons , in which he said to her that the police had nothing on them . In crossexamination she accepted that her testimony was based on the account she had given to the police after she had been arrested for conspiracy to murder , but maintained that it was the truth .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL witnesses gave evidence that they had seen a group of men in the car park , had heard shots and had then seen CARDINAL people running to a car and driving away . A third witness testified that he had seen the deceased , heard a raised voice and then a bang , and that the deceased had then fallen over . A fourth witness testified that he had seen CARDINAL men joined by a third and had heard some discussion which could have been about drug dealing . Moments later he heard CARDINAL loud bangs .", "CARDINAL . The jury also heard evidence from a Mr PERSON , who testified that he had gone to PERSON flat after the shooting because he knew the person who had been with the deceased at the pub had gone to the flat with PERSON TIME before . PERSON , PERSON and another woman returned to the car park with him .", "CARDINAL . Evidence of mobile telephone traffic was also led by the prosecution , which showed that there had been calls between PERSON and PERSON after the shooting , that someone used a payphone at the hospital to call Carlo , PERSON and Mr GPE , and that Carlo \u2019s telephone had been in use near the Talisman prior to the shooting .", "CARDINAL . For each brother , the prosecution relied on the fact that they had , on the advice of their solicitors , made no reply to any of the questions put to them during his police interview . For PERSON , the prosecution also relied on the fact that , even by DATE , PERSON had stated that he was still unable to recall where he had been at the time of the shooting and that it was only by DATE that he had been able to say that he was in bed sick on TIME in question . For Carlo , the prosecution submitted that it was implausible for him subsequently to explain that his silence in interview was because he had been unable to recall driving to GPE DATE , not least because , on ORG \u2019s own evidence , PERSON had phoned him TIME to tell him about Mr Chambers\u2019 death .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the prosecution relied on covert recordings of conversations between the brothers while in their cells at the police station , which , the prosecution alleged , showed that they were plotting to subvert the evidence against them . The defence admitted the conversations but said that they were to wind the police up .", "CARDINAL . PERSON gave evidence in which he denied killing PERSON . He was not at the Talisman on TIME of the shooting ; he had been in bed sick , where he had found out about the shooting from the television news . His memory had been jogged by being shown his mobile phone records for DATE of the shooting .", "He said it was PERSON who had been dealing in drugs . He was unaware that PERSON had been unfaithful to him and had not assaulted her before the shooting . They had only rowed because he had slept with PERSON . He denied the conversation with PERSON in the pub after the shooting and had only gone to the hotel to drop off cannabis for PERSON . At the hotel he had rowed again with PERSON over PERSON and she had told him she would get him back . The only discussion of PERSON had been over hearing about the shooting on the news .", "CARDINAL . In his evidence ORG denied buying or selling drugs to or from Mr Chambers , but had been a heavy drug user himself . He too maintained that it was PERSON who had been dealing with PERSON and that , prior to the shooting , he had spoken to PERSON because PERSON was trying to borrow money . TIME of the shooting he and Mr Marandola had been driving to GPE in GPE to take cannabis to his uncle . When PERSON summoned them to the hotel , they had collected PERSON on the way back from GPE . There was no conversation or suggestion that ORG had been responsible for Mr ORG death .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE did not give evidence , although his police interviews were introduced . When first interviewed he said that he was at his girlfriend \u2019s at the time of the shooting but , in a subsequent interview , he said PERSON and PERSON had picked him up in a car and said they were going to meet someone . They told him to stay in the car . He did not and saw the brothers and a third man approach from the pub . He heard CARDINAL shots and then the brothers returned to the car , and the CARDINAL of them drove off .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge \u2019s summing up contained the following direction on the witness statements which had been read :", "\u201c You will , I am sure , recall that I told you when the first of those statements was read how you should approach their evidence but it is important that I remind you again of what I told you . Their statements are emphatically not agreed . The defendants would have wished that all of them should be called to give evidence before you . However , there are circumstances where I , as the judge , may permit the prosecution to read the statements of a witness even where the defence wish those witnesses to be called . That is a matter for my decision and you are not , please , to speculate on why I have reached that decision .", "You will , of course , immediately appreciate that the defence are disadvantaged by the course I have permitted to take place . You can not see the demeanour and appearance of the witness when assessing the extent , if at all , you are able to rely on the content of the statements . The defence can not cross - examine , can not test the accuracy and honesty of the evidence , can not suggest to the witness a different account or explore with the witness other matters to which the witness does not speak in his or her statement .", "Thus , when you consider this evidence , bear those observations clearly in mind and give the disadvantage arising from the procedure the weight you think right in determining whether you can rely in any way on the witness statements read to you and , if so , to what extent .", "In this connection bear in mind the submissions of the defence on the accuracy and reliability of the statements of those witnesses . It is suggested that each of them may have a sinister motive for not wanting to give evidence and their protestations of fear in their statement are , submit the defence ( my word not theirs ) simply weasel words designed to protect themselves , not from any of the defendants , but from the consequences of their own involvement in what occurred on TIME . You heard their submissions , you give them the weight you think right . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The trial judge also explained to the jury that PERSON statement had been given at the end of his interviews while he was under arrest for conspiracy to murder and that he had a substantial criminal record , including convictions for robbery . The trial judge instructed the jury that they could have regard to this background in assessing whether they could rely on his statements . When summarising PERSON evidence in respect of the gun Carlo had given her to look after , the trial judge also commented that , if the jury chose to accept that evidence , it went no further than showing that , DATE before the shooting , Carlo was in possession of a weapon of a broadly similar type as that used to shoot the deceased . The trial judge then asked the jury to bear in mind the criticisms that had been made of PERSON and her evidence by the defence .", "CARDINAL . Further directions were given in the usual terms as to the adverse inferences which could be drawn from ORG and PERSON \u2019s silence during their police interviews and that PERSON interviews were evidence only against him and not his co - accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the jury unanimously convicted PERSON and PERSON and acquitted Mr GPE . The brothers appealed against their conviction .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was dismissed on DATE . In considering the relevant case - law of this ORG , at paragraph CARDINAL of its judgment , ORG stated that what appeared from that case - law were the following propositions :", "\u201c i ) The admissibility of evidence is primarily for the national law ;", "ii ) Evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing and as a general rule Article CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL)(d ) require a defendant to be given a proper and adequate opportunity to challenge and question witnesses ;", "iii ) It is not necessarily incompatible with Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL)(d ) for depositions to be read and that can be so even if there has been no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the proceedings . Article CARDINAL ) is simply an illustration of matters to be taken into account in considering whether a fair trial has been held . The reasons for the court holding it necessary that statements should be read and the procedures to counterbalance any handicap to the defence will all be relevant to the issue , whether , where statements have been read , the trial was fair .", "iv ) The quality of the evidence and its inherent reliability , plus the degree of caution exercised in relation to reliance on it , will also be relevant to the question whether the trial was fair . \u201d", "ORG then stated :", "\u201c The question is whether there is a fifth proposition to the effect that where the circumstances justify the reading of the statement where the defendant has had no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the trial process , the statement must not be allowed to be read if it is the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant . Certainly at first sight paragraph CARDINAL of PERSON seems to suggest that in whatever circumstances and whatever counterbalancing factors are present if statements are read then there will be a breach of LAW , if the statements are the sole or decisive evidence . Furthermore there is some support for that position in the previous authorities . But neither PERSON nor any of the other authorities were concerned with a case where a witness , whose identity was well - known to a defendant , was being kept away by fear , although we must accept that the reference to ORG - type organisations and the trials thereof in paragraph CARDINAL shows that the court had extreme circumstances in mind .", "The question we have posed to ourselves is as follows . If ORG were faced with the case of an identified witness , well - known to a defendant , who was the sole witness of a murder , where the national court could be sure that that witness had been kept away by the defendant , or by persons acting for him , is it conceivable that it would hold that there were no \u2018 counterbalancing\u2019 measures the court could take which would allow that statement to be read . If care had been taken to see that the quality of the evidence was compelling , if firm steps were taken to draw the jury \u2019s attention to aspects of that witnesses\u2019 credibility and if a clear direction was given to the jury to exercise caution , we can not think that ORG would nevertheless hold that a defendant \u2019s LAW had been infringed . In such a case , as it seems to us , it is the defendant who has denied himself the opportunity of examining the witnesses , so that he could not complain of an infringement of LAW ) , and the precautions would ensure compliance and fairness in compliance with Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . We for our part see no difficulty in such a clear case .", "More difficulty arises in cases where it is not quite so clear cut , but the court believes , to a high degree of probability , that identified witnesses are being intimidated for and on behalf of the defence , and where the court is sure to the criminal standard of proof that witnesses can not be traced and brought before the court ( GPE J \u2019s state of mind on PERSON in the instant case ) . In our view , having regard to the rights of victims , their families , the safety of the public in general , it still can not be right for there to be some absolute rule that , where compelling evidence is the sole or decisive evidence , an admission in evidence of a statement must then automatically lead to a defendant \u2019s LAW being infringed . That would lead to a situation in which the more successful the intimidation of the witnesses , the stronger the argument becomes that the statements can not be read . If the decisive witnesses can be \u2018 got at\u2019 the case must collapse . The more subtle and less easily established intimidation provides defendants with the opportunity of excluding the most material evidence against them . Such an absolute rule can not have been intended by ORG in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG then gave the following guidance when dealing with applications for statements to be read under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE :", "\u201c Our view is that certainly care must be taken to see that sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and indeed the new provisions in LAW DATE , are not abused . Where intimidation of witnesses is alleged the court must examine with care the circumstances . Are the witnesses truly being kept away by fear ? Has that fear been generated by the defendant , or by persons acting with the defendant \u2019s authority ? Have reasonable steps been taken to trace the witnesses and bring them into court ? Can anything be done to enable the witnesses to be brought to court to give evidence and be there protected ? It is obvious that the more \u2018 ORG the evidence in the statements , the greater the care will be needed to be sure why it is that a witness can not come and give evidence . The court should be astute to examine the quality and reliability of the evidence in the statement and astute and sure that the defendant has every opportunity to apply the provisions of Schedule CARDINAL . It will , as section CARDINAL states , be looking at the interests of justice , which includes justice to the defendant and justice to the victims . The judge will give warnings to the jury stressing the disadvantage that the defendant is in , not being able to examine a witness . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , on the facts of the applicants\u2019 case , ORG concluded :", "\u201c This was a case in which the judge was sure that PERSON was being kept away through fear by virtue of the conduct of the appellants or those acting on their behalf . So far as PERSON was concerned , his view was that it was \u2018 highly ORG but he could not exclude the reasonable possibility that other factors may have influenced his disappearance . What he was sure of was that PERSON could not reasonably be found , and it was legitimate to make part of his reasoning the high probability .", "The judge was further sure that PERSON had been kept away through fear . He was simply sure so far as PERSON was concerned that she could not reasonably be found . So far as PERSON is concerned , her evidence was not of any great importance . Furthermore , so far as PERSON was concerned , she supported the fact that the appellants were involved in drug dealing and she provided some evidence that PERSON had had in his possession at one time a gun which was broadly similar to that which expert evidence had been indicated for the killing . But in relation to that evidence the judge gave a clear warning to the jury about the limitations of that evidence over and above reminding the jury to bear in mind the criticisms made of PERSON and her evidence ( see page CARDINAL ( c ) to ( e ) of the summing up ) . Thus the evidence of PERSON could certainly not be described as decisive .", "PERSON and PERSON certainly did give important evidence . It was however certainly not the sole evidence . PERSON , for example , gave evidence of a conversation with PERSON immediately after the shooting in which ORG told him \u2018 to sort himself out , get control or he \u2019d get the ORG , which the judge described as \u2018 very important evidence in the case of GPE . ( see page DATE of the summing up ) . Both PERSON and PERSON provided descriptions of the return of PERSON , PERSON and GPE to ORG .", "However , there was a great deal of circumstantial evidence , including the tracking of the mobile phones of the appellants and GPE . But , in particular , there was the oral evidence of PERSON . True , PERSON was treated as a hostile witness . True , also , that PERSON \u2019s evidence was strongest against PERSON , but it was powerful against Carlo too .", "We have no doubt that the judge properly exercised his discretion in this case . So far as PERSON and PERSON are concerned , they were witnesses kept away by fear , a fear for which the appellants were responsible . It should not be forgotten that part of the evidence against the appellants related to covert telephone calls in which they were seeking to subvert the trial . The statements originally taken from PERSON and PERSON contained statements to the effect that they were fearful of what might happen to them . PERSON , who gave evidence in chambers , was clearly a frightened woman . PERSON was clearly a frightened witness . This was a trial in which fear was being generated by the appellants or those acting for them in order to prevent evidence being given against them . Where the judge was sure of that it seems to us that the appellants can not complain that their LAW were being infringed simply by references to those witnesses not being at the trial .", "So far as PERSON is concerned , the circumstances in which he could not reasonably be found included all the above circumstances and the high degree of probability as to his fear . In his case it can not be said that the defendants lose their right to complain of an infringement under LAW , but even in his case , where the evidence was \u2018 LOC as against Carlo , even if that meant \u2018 ORG , our view is that provided counter - balancing procedures were properly in place the judge was entitled to admit his statement .", "Counter - balancing procedures clearly were in place in that the judge took account of LAW and Schedule CARDINAL [ of LAW DATE ] . PERSON was an identified witness and it was open to the appellants to attack the credibility of PERSON ; indeed they did so , suggesting that he was in fact himself responsible for the murder , that being the reason why he made the statement that he did . Furthermore , the judge warned the jury in relation to all the statements that were read in clear and unequivocal terms . He gave them a strong direction at the time the statements were read .", "...", "If we had formed the view that there was a breach of LAW , that would have rendered the trial unfair and we could not have , in those circumstances , upheld the conviction as safe and a retrial would have had to have been ordered . We are quite clear that the appellants\u2019 rights under LAW were in no way infringed in this case . We are equally clear that the convictions of these appellants are safe and this appeal must be dismissed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied for permission to appeal to ORG .
