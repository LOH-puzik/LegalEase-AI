The first applicant , Mr PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) , was born in DATE . The second applicant , PERSON ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) , was born in DATE . They are married and live in Gda\u0144sk .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant owns a plot of land and a house situated on it located in the suburbs of Gda\u0144sk . The major part of his property is classified as agricultural land . There are some other houses in the area , but a significant part of it is used for allotments .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the first applicant \u2019s father acquired the property in question in DATE . At that time , the property was classified as agricultural land and lay outside the perimeters of Gda\u0144sk . Subsequently , with the enlargement of the city , the property became located in the vicinity of a residential and allotments area .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the first applicant \u2019s father was twice refused planning permission on the ground that the plot had not been designated for construction of a house .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a local development plan for the area was adopted . The first applicant \u2019s plot was designated for the construction of a road .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified later date the first applicant acquired the property at issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a local development plan which stipulated that a road was to be constructed on the first applicant \u2019s plot .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the LOC informed the first applicant that his property was designated in the relevant local development plan for the building of a new road . Accordingly , the property could not be used for the purposes of constructing a new house or planting an orchard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested the Mayor of Gda\u0144sk to acquire his property as it had been designated for the building of a road . On DATE the Mayor transmitted that request to the Head of ORG ( ORG ) which was competent to decide on it . It appears that the request was never examined .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the first applicant petitioned the ORG . On DATE the ORG informed him that , following a number of similar complaints concerning the legal status of so - called \u201c frozen properties \u201d ( i.e. properties which were designated in a local development plan for public use at an undetermined future date ) , he had requested the Minister of ORG to adopt a general solution to the problem . In particular , the ORG called for a provision in the local planning bill which would impose an obligation on the local authorities to acquire \u201c frozen properties \u201d or offer an alternative plot to the owners concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a general local development plan . The plan maintained the provision that a road was to be constructed on the applicant \u2019s plot . Prior to the adoption of the new plan , PERSON and the Gda\u0144sk Governor had authorised the change of use of agricultural land for non - agricultural purposes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant inquired with the Gda\u0144sk Municipality about the conditions for construction of a temporary building ( zabudowa tymczasowa ) on his property . On DATE he was informed about the relevant conditions for properties designated in local development plans for future public use . He was also informed that he could continue using the property for agricultural purposes or , alternatively , he could construct a temporary storehouse . The municipality further explained that the planned road would not be constructed in the foreseeable future . The applicant was invited to submit concrete proposals for consideration by the municipality and informed that any temporary buildings would have to be removed at his own expense when the planned road was constructed . It appears that the first applicant did not submit any proposals to the municipality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Law of DATE on ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) entered into force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant \u2019s lawyer sent a letter to the Mayor of Gda\u0144sk , inquiring about his unanswered request of DATE for the acquisition of the property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was informed that due to the dissolution of the district offices it was not possible to establish the reasons as to why ORG had not taken any decision on his request . He was further informed that the local development plan of CARDINAL DATE , which had specified that a new road would pass through the first applicant \u2019s property , was still in force . Furthermore , the municipality \u2019s investment plan for DATE did not foresee the construction of the road in question . Accordingly , the first applicant could use his land as previously . In addition , the first applicant was informed that according to the DATE Act the municipality could not acquire his property since the relevant local development plan had been adopted DATE and that his use of the property had not become unfeasible . Consequently , his request could not be granted .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that decision to ORG . On DATE ORG ruled that the appeal was inadmissible in law . It observed that in accordance with LAW an appeal could be lodged only against an administrative decision . However , ORG noted that the provisions of the CARDINAL LAW ( section CARDINAL ) excluded the possibility of adopting an administrative decision in respect of the ORG request for the acquisition of their property by the municipality . Thus , the letter of the Mayor of ORG could not be considered as an administrative decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that decision to ORG , relying , inter alia , on LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed their appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the first applicant that according to the local development plan which would remain valid until DATE his property had been designated for a future thoroughfare .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the first applicant that the old local development plan designating his property for the construction of a road would remain valid until DATE . In addition , he was informed that the municipal investment plan for DATE did not foresee the construction of the road in question . He was also informed that a new local development plan was being drafted and that he was entitled to lodge his objections in that respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Law of DATE on ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) entered into force on DATE . It repealed LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the old local development plan expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested the municipality to provide him with information as to the future development of his land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was informed that pursuant to the DATE Act until the adoption of the new local development plan the manner of development of a particular property was to be determined by means of planning permission . However , such permission could only be granted if a number of conditions specified in LAW of the DATE Act were met , including that the property at issue did not have to be reclassified from agricultural to non - agricultural land . In connection with the last requirement , the first applicant submitted that he was prevented from developing his property until such time as the new local development plan had been adopted .", "CARDINAL . It appears that as of DATE GPE had not yet adopted a new local development plan in respect of the first applicant \u2019s land . According to the preliminary draft plan , the applicants\u2019 property will be designated in the major part for housing purposes and in the remaining part for housing and services purposes . The property will adjoin the planned road , but the road will not pass through the applicants\u2019 property .", "CARDINAL . As of DATE the applicant had not yet applied for planning permission .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE questions of land development were governed by LAW on ORG . Under this law owners of properties to be expropriated in the future were not entitled to any form of compensation for damage resulting from restrictions on the use of their property or the reduction in its value originating in expropriations to be carried out at an undetermined future date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new LAW was enacted ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . It entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act created for local authorities a number of obligations towards owners whose properties were designated for expropriation at an undetermined future date under land development plans adopted by the competent municipal authorities . The municipalities were obliged to buy such property , replace it with other land within DATE of an owner \u2019s request , or provide compensation for the damage caused by the designation .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , pursuant to section QUANTITY , these obligations and the corresponding claims of the owners applied only to plans adopted after LAW had entered into force , i.e. to plans adopted by local authorities after DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the DATE Act , plans adopted before its entry into force were to expire on DATE . In DATE an amendment to the DATE LAW was adopted under which the validity of such plans was extended for a further two years until DATE . Again , on DATE , ORG passed a law amending LAW which extended until DATE the validity of the land development plans adopted before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new ORG was enacted ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . It entered into force on DATE and repealed the DATE Act . Under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act , all local plans adopted before DATE remained valid , but not beyond DATE .", "CARDINAL . Compensation entitlements for owners , provided for by DATE Act , were in essence maintained by LAW . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , when , following the adoption of a new local land development plan , the use of property in the manner provided for by a previous plan had become impossible or had been restricted , it was open to the owner to claim compensation from the municipality , or to request the municipality to buy the plot . Any litigation which might arise in this respect between local authorities and owners could be pursued before the civil courts . It would appear that the operation of section DATE is not retroactive , thus limiting the scope of any such claims to the period after the adoption of the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provides , subject to certain conditions , for a possibility of developing a plot of land by way of planning permission in the absence of a local development plan .", "CARDINAL . Other relevant legislative provisions are extensively set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE in the case of GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of DATE , ORG examined the ORG \u2019s request to determine the compatibility with the LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Act insofar as it excluded the application of section QUANTITY to land development plans adopted before DATE . ORG referred to its established case - law to the effect that the right to property could not be regarded as ius infinitivum . Consequently , its exercise was restrained by many legal and practical considerations , including the necessity of balancing the ORG interests against those of other persons . Local land development plans were to be regarded only as a practical expression of restraints originating in numerous statutes regulating the lawful exercise of property rights . In particular , owners of properties \u201c frozen \u201d for the purpose of future expropriations as a result of the adoption of such plans could normally continue to use their properties as they had been using them prior to the adoption of such plans . This did not amount to such an interference with property rights that it could be regarded as being incompatible with their constitutional protection ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
