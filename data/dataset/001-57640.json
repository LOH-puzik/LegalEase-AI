Honey ( [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL and [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) that \" a convicted prisoner , in spite of his imprisonment , retains all civil rights which are not taken away expressly or by necessary implication \" . Thus , the general principle of NORP law that a person has a right not to be subjected , deliberately or negligently , to physical or mental harm remains applicable to a prisoner .

Chief Constable of GPE ( DATE ) , ORG , DATE ) .", "The Government cited a number of authorities in support of the proposition that treatment of prisoners which is so inhuman or degrading that it can not be regarded as having been authorised by ORG will be unlawful and actionable as a civil wrong . In the context of correspondence , they stated that a restriction that infringed a right retained by a prisoner , such as his right of access to a legal adviser relating to possible civil proceedings , would be considered to be unlawful ( NORP v. Home Secretary , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] ORG Reports CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The exercise by public authorities of statutory powers and duties is subject to judicial review . The grounds on which such review may be open are in substance the same in GPE as in GPE and GPE ( see PERSON v. ORG , DATE ORG CARDINAL , per Lord PERSON at CARDINAL ) . In particular , an exercise of discretionary power may be challenged on the grounds that the authority concerned has acted arbitrarily , in bad faith , unreasonably , for an improper purpose or otherwise outside its statutory powers ( see , for example , the speech of Lord PERSON in ORG Unions v. Minister for ORG [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL at CARDINAL and [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL at CARDINAL - CARDINAL , as quoted in the DATE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no .

Secretary of ORG for GPE DATE ORG CARDINAL applications for judicial review were brought by prisoners aggrieved by conditions in prisons to which they had been transferred .
