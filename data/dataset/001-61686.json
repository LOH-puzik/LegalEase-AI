As a conscientious official , PERSON went so far as to suggest : ' If there is a further rise in the number of internees , we should make plans to strengthen the security arrangements .

There had been communists , at the time of the breaking of the PERSON - Soviet pact . And there were foreign NORP . We did not know their ultimate destination . We only knew that they were going to PERSON . Rumour had it that they were being sent to work in salt mines in GPE . We obviously knew that they were not going off on a pleasant holiday .

At TIME on DATE the third applicant , who is a journalist with ORG ( a radio station controlled by the applicant company ) , broadcast the following report :", "\u201c According to the DATE magazine ORG , a former deputy mayor of GPE supervised the deportation of CARDINAL NORP and foreign NORP in DATE . PERSON , now aged DATE , was Deputy Prefect of Pithiviers at the time . He admits that he organised the departure of a transport of deportees to PERSON . PERSON , whom General PERSON removed from office at the end of the war , claims to have been in the Resistance and subsequently rose through the ranks of the civil service . In his defence , the former deputy mayor of GPE DATE maintains , like PERSON , that he knew nothing of the fate of the deported NORP and says that the discreet veil of history should be drawn over the crimes of DATE . \u201d", "The way in which ORG operates is for the presenter to broadcast live , with CARDINAL news bulletins and CARDINAL news flashes per TIME . He then breaks for TIME to update his information before going on air again . The above - mentioned broadcast was accordingly repeated by the third applicant and by other journalists CARDINAL times between TIME on DATE and TIME on DATE , in either the same or a slightly different form . However , the broadcasts systematically specified that the report was based on an article published in FAC . After TIME , a number of news bulletins and flashes mentioned the fact that , \u201c unlike PERSON \u201d , PERSON had never issued any orders for anyone to be arrested , interned or transferred to PERSON , sometimes adding that he was \u201c responsible only for keeping order \u201d .", "On DATE , from TIME , several news bulletins and flashes ( broadcast at TIME , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and TIME ) mentioned that Mr PERSON denied the allegations published in FAC . According to the applicants , this point was made systematically after CARDINAL a.m.", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON brought proceedings in ORG against the second applicant , who is publishing director of the applicant company ( the publisher ) , the third applicant and the applicant company as principal , accessory and civilly liable respectively for the offence of public defamation of a civil servant , contrary to sections CARDINAL , first paragraph , and DATE , first paragraph , of the Freedom of the Press Act of DATE ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) .", "In their defence , the applicants argued that the case under LAW was inadmissible , because PERSON had been retrospectively stripped of his status as a civil servant at the time of the ORG . They also contended that the prosecution 's case against the second applicant was inadmissible : the disputed statement had been broadcast live and its content could not therefore be construed as having been \u201c fixed prior to being communicated to the public \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Moreover , they submitted that the third applicant had acted in good faith . In that connection , they argued that public interest in DATE had been revived by the news of the Papon trial ; that the third applicant had been in possession of the article published in FAC on DATE along with CARDINAL agency dispatches ; that it had been reasonable to link the cases of PERSON and PERSON because both men had held high public office during the Occupation and had subsequently enjoyed brilliant political careers ; that the use of the conditional tense and the absence of any personal comment about Mr PERSON demonstrated the journalist 's caution ; and that ORG had reported Mr PERSON 's denials from TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG ( Seventeenth Division ) found the second and third applicants guilty as principal and accessory respectively of the offence of public defamation of a civil servant . It fined them MONEY ( ORG ) each and ordered them jointly to pay ORG CARDINAL in damages . It also found the applicant company civilly liable and ordered by way of civil remedy that an announcement informing the public of the content of its judgment be broadcast on GPE Info TIME during TIME period in DATE following the date on which the judgment became final .", "With regard to the defamatory nature of the disputed allegations , the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c Mr PERSON is alleged ... to have personally played an active role in the deportation of NORP in his capacity as Deputy Prefect of Pithiviers . This allegation , which undoubtedly damages the honour of the civil party , is moreover aggravated by the connection made between the case of Mr Papon \u2013 who has been committed for trial before ORG to answer charges that he participated in crimes against humanity DATE and that of PERSON , with the suggestion that the latter was seeking to evade responsibility for the crimes committed during that period , over which he believes that ' the discreet veil of history should be drawn ' .", "The fact that it was specified that , ' unlike PERSON , PERSON did not issue any orders for anyone to be arrested , interned or transferred to PERSON ' in no way detracts from the seriousness of the charge levelled at the civil party ; the same can be said of the use of the conditional tense throughout the broadcasts .", "The allegations in question also cast doubt on Mr PERSON 's membership of the Resistance , which was reported as a mere ' claim ' on his part , and suggested that he had been stripped of his status by General PERSON at the end of the war . These words also damage the civil party 's honour and reputation . \u201d", "The court found that Mr PERSON had never lost the rank of Deputy PERSON , and that he should be considered as having been acting in that capacity in Pithiviers at the time of the facts alleged against him and accordingly to have been exercising public authority . It found that section CARDINAL of LAW was therefore applicable .", "With regard to the good faith of the third applicant , the court found as follows :", "\u201c There being a presumption that defamatory statements are made in bad faith , it is for the defendants to prove their good faith .", "It should first be noted that the repetition of defamatory statements already published in another medium does not in any way provide the person who repeats them with a defence ; such journalistic practice is particularly to be deprecated , because it means that a statement that has not been verified by anyone subsequently reporting it acquires the appearance of an absolute certainty .", "This is what happened with Mr PERSON : having assumed that the enquiries made by his fellow journalists at FAC were reliable , PERSON simply repeated the magazine 's allegations against the civil party without checking them .", "As evidence that he had carried out a serious investigation , PERSON told the ORG that he had been in possession of the article published in FAC on DATE , and of CARDINAL agency dispatches ; however these dispatches , which simply quoted large sections of the magazine article , could not , without more , provide the journalist with a legal defence .", "The journalist also produced the documents mentioned in FAC : the ORG 's memorandum of DATE , PERSON notes of DATE and DATE and the DATE reports for DATE and DATE ; however , these documents did not give him grounds for asserting that PERSON , Pithiviers Deputy Prefect , had supervised the deportation of CARDINAL NORP or that he had admitted having organised the departure of a transport of NORP deportees .", "Neither the memorandum from the Prefect of PERSON dated DATE specifying that the Pithiviers Deputy Prefect must be copied in on all the instructions given to the camp commandant , nor the memorandum of DATE to the ORG signed by PERSON and expressing his concerns about keeping order on DATE in the event of communist demonstrations because all the gendarmes in the district had been drafted in to help with the ' entrainment of CARDINAL NORP ' , nor the report drawn up by PERSON on DATE on the events of DATE , which had been ' perfectly calm ' , prove that PERSON , Deputy Prefect , had played a personal part in the organisation and departure of that transport for PERSON . In fact , what these documents show is that he complained of having been notified only belatedly of the ' entrainment of CARDINAL NORP ' , that he did not receive copies of all the instructions sent to the camp commandant , a memorandum from the ORG having been required to ensure that he was not ' bypassed ' and that his concern was to maintain order outside the camps .", "PERSON DATE reports for DATE and DATE do not carry any more evidential weight in this respect ; while the first mentions that most of the NORP in the Pithiviers camp had been ' entrained ' on transports bound for GPE on DATE ; while both report on the occupancy rate of the CARDINAL internment camps situated in his district and thus establish his ' responsibility in principle ' for the camps ( using Mr PERSON 's formula ) ; while they keep the Prefect informed of relations with the NORP forces and the circumstances in which the anti - NORP laws were being applied and certainly show that Mr PERSON was performing his functions of Deputy PERSON under the Occupation with zeal and determination , and without being troubled by too many scruples , they nonetheless do not prove that he played a personal part in the deportation of NORP or that he organised the departure of a transport of NORP deportees .", "Turning to the other documents cited by the defence , namely a letter dated DATE from the secretary - general for the police on the PERSON d'Etat to ORG and the latter 's reply dated DATE , and a memorandum dated DATE from the Pithiviers Deputy Prefect to the captain of the gendarmerie and police superintendent , they can not be regarded by the ORG as having any evidential weight , since they are merely summarised on a plain sheet of paper .", "In short , the documents in PERSON possession did not give him grounds for alleging that Mr PERSON was guilty of having participated in crimes against humanity .", "Nor did these documents entitle the presenters who came on air after TIME on DATE to repeat the allegation that the plaintiff had supervised the NORP internment camps of Pithiviers and GPE - la - Rolande and the maintenance of order in both camps .", "Lastly , the testimony of PERSON recounting the dramatic circumstances of the various round - ups of NORP men , women and children , the conditions in which they were transferred to and arrived in the CARDINAL camps of Pithiviers and GPE - la - Rolande , and the dramatic change in public opinion which coincided with these events , does not prove that Mr PERSON played any part in the organisation of these deportations .", "While being aware of the professional constraints imposed by the need to break news rapidly , which is inherent in the very nature of radio , the ORG notes that the journalists , far from merely reporting raw news objectively , endorsed the interpretation adopted by some of their fellow journalists , while going further by making a connection with the ' Papon case ' , no doubt with the intention of making the story more sensational .", "The disputed broadcasts were therefore particularly careless and contributed to the spread of rumour by repeating defamatory allegations .", "In relation to the allegation that PERSON was not a genuine member of the Resistance , the ORG finds that the evidence produced by the defence is insufficient to cast doubt on his Resistance activities , which in any event have been vouched for by PERSON , the leader of the PERSON network , by Colonel PERSON and by several people of NORP descent who described the help he had given them during the Occupation .", "For all of the above reasons , the ORG is unable to accept that [ the third applicant ] acted in good faith . \u201d", "The court found the second applicant , in his capacity as publishing director , not liable for the first broadcast , which had been made live by the third applicant on DATE at TIME It found , however , that the same statement had been repeated either in full or in condensed form by the various presenters who subsequently went on air , and considered that such \u201c systematic repetition of the disputed statements \u201d should be construed as \u201c rolling broadcasting \u201d within the meaning of CARDINAL of LAW . The court concluded as follows :", "\u201c [ The second applicant ] , as publishing director , whose duty it is to control what is broadcast on the channel for which he is responsible , is therefore liable in law as principal for the offence of defamation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP On appeal by the applicants , ORG ( ORG ) upheld the judgment of DATE by a decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On the question of the defamatory nature of the offending bulletin 's content , it ruled as follows :", "\u201c Words may be defamatory as the result of an insinuation , a question or an assertion . In addition , words must be assessed both in terms of their intrinsic meaning and in the light of their context .", "Attributing to Mr PERSON responsibility for supervising the deportation of CARDINAL NORP and organising their despatch to PERSON was plainly an attack on his honour and dignity . The defence arguments ... tending towards proving the truth of the facts is not relevant here , quite apart from the fact that no evidence to that effect has been adduced . Moreover , comparing PERSON position to that of Mr Papon , who had indeed just been committed for trial in ORG , also necessarily had a defamatory resonance .", "The same defamatory classification must also be given to the passage ' [ Mr PERSON ] ... claims to have been in the Resistance ' . Coming as it does between the reference to his being sacked by General PERSON and the comparison to Mr Papon , this can only insinuate that Mr PERSON 's assertion was false . \u201d", "On the question of good faith , the judgment said :", "\u201c Calumnious imputations are deemed to be in bad faith unless it can be established that they were made in pursuit of a legitimate aim , without any personal animosity , after a serious investigation and in temperate language .", "There is no doubt that providing information about the attitude of administrative officials during the period of the Occupation , particularly as regards one of the main dramas of that time , the deportation and extermination of NORP , is perfectly legitimate .", "Nothing in the file reveals any particular animosity on the journalist 's part towards the civil party .", "On the other hand , the preliminary investigation was singularly lacking in rigour . The civil party has rightly observed that PERSON began to broadcast his remarks at TIME on DATE , in other words when the issue of FAC dated CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE had just come out .", "In seeking to establish their good faith the defence cite CARDINAL dispatches ( ORG , ORG and ORG ) which mentioned the article in FAC and the content of a television programme in which Mr PERSON had taken part . But the use of agency dispatches as one 's main source , especially when they are purely repetitive and reproduce an article that has already been published does not constitute evidence that an attempt has been made , if not to conduct an investigation , then at least to check the information . In addition , the wholly gratuitous assertion that Mr PERSON admitted his culpability is particularly reprehensible from both the criminal and the ethical points of view .", "As regards the debate about whether PERSON had been a member of the Resistance , ORG rightly noted that the documents produced by the defence were not sufficient evidence to the contrary , whereas his participation has been attested to by the leader of the ORG network , PERSON , by Colonel PERSON and by a number of persons of NORP origin who have drawn attention to PERSON courageous attitude .", "Moreover , the imputations contained in the message sent out were disproportionate in relation to the objective material that the accused maintained they had at their disposal , and here it should be noted , as clarification of this point may be helpful , that neither the use of the conditional tense pleaded in defence , nor the mention \u2013 very late in DATE of PERSON denials , affect the gravity of the allegations made in dispatches broadcast CARDINAL times .", "The content of the documents which the defendants learned of in FAC is not convincing in terms of the construction that has been placed upon them if they are to be considered to reflect Deputy Prefect PERSON 's attitude at the time of the departure of the last transport of NORP deportees on DATE .", "The memo of DATE from the deputy prefect to his prefect ... said : ' I have just been notified of the entrainment of CARDINAL NORP ... DATE ' , and he complained that he would therefore not have sufficient manpower to control a communist demonstration .", "The same deputy prefect sent a memo , dated DATE , informing the prefect that there had been no incidents on account of the demonstration and that the departure of the transport had been orderly .", "The memo of DATE from the Prefect of PERSON seems to echo his subordinate 's concerns about being informed in stipulating that the deputy prefect ' in his capacity as the government representative ... , has the right to monitor the proper functioning of the camps ' .", "The reports sent by PERSON to his prefect in DATE and DATE describe the situation in the camps but do not reveal that he had any power over them or initiative regarding them .", "The witness evidence heard in court did not provide any additional information about Mr PERSON 's duties .", "As to the other documents produced in court , ORG rightly found , for reasons which ORG endorses , that they did not appear to have been in the defendants ' possession at the time when the statement was broadcast . Moreover , they do not necessarily weaken PERSON argument , since they include one memo he wrote on DATE to the Prefect of NORP about improving the food and bedding in the camps . It ends with the following sentence : ' Although the management and administration of the camps does not form any part of my duties , I wish to bring this state of affairs to your attention ... '", "All these texts portray an official dedicated to fulfilling his functions of maintaining public order and defending the political interests of the government . They do not support , without overstating the case , an assertion that Mr PERSON supervised the camps or played a role in the deportation of the NORP .", "The plea of good faith is accordingly rejected . \u201d", "ORG noted the following in relation to the liability of the second applicant under LAW :", "\u201c ... This section is intended to absolve the publishing director of an audiovisual operator of liability for live broadcasts whose contents he is unable effectively to monitor and control . But this can not be said of a rolling news bulletin whose content may be monitored and controlled by making the necessary arrangements to that effect . It is significant in this respect that such steps were taken from TIME , when the content of the offending statement was amended . Moreover , it would be stretching the concept of prior fixing to contend that it must involve mechanical recording . Content may also be fixed by a communication method based on repetition which effectively requires it to be fixed but not necessarily by mechanical means . Therein lies the difference from ' live ' broadcasting involving no repetition . \u201d", "Moreover , by way of civil remedy , the court ordered the following announcement to be read out on GPE Info TIME during TIME period in DATE following the date when the judgment became final :", "\u201c By a judgment of ORG ( ORG ) , PERSON PERSON , journalist , and Mr PERSON , publishing director of ORG , were each fined ORG and ordered to pay damages for having defamed Mr PERSON , former Deputy Prefect of Pithiviers . This judgment follows the broadcasting , on DATE and DATE , of news bulletins falsely alleging that Mr PERSON had played a part in the deportation of CARDINAL NORP and wrongly casting doubt on his membership of the Resistance . \u201d", "On the subject of the broadcasting of the above announcement , the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The ORG is minded to uphold the order for the broadcasting of an announcement by ORG , which seems to be a remedy proportionate to the damage suffered but which the defence considers to be contrary to the provisions of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of [ the Convention ] ...", "The ORG does not agree , because freedom of expression under LAW [ the LAW ] may be subject to such restrictions as may be necessary ... for the protection of the reputation of others , which is the case here . It is true that the effect of this order , as indicated by the defence , will be to reduce the ' editorial space ' available to ORG , but the written press are already in the same position and it is difficult to find a justification for discriminating between the various media in that respect .", "Lastly , it would be wrong to deny the claimant , whose rights are equally important , the concrete remedy of broadcasting an announcement purely on the ground that the audiovisual medium is different from the traditional medium of the written press .", "Further , nothing in the order to broadcast an announcement may be construed as infringing the right to a fair trial within the meaning of LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law . They submitted that ORG had failed to apply the principle whereby the criminal law must be strictly interpreted , in that it had extended the scope of the presumption raised by CARDINAL of LAW ( whereby the publishing director is liable as principal where \u201c the content of the offending statement has been fixed prior to being communicated to the public \u201d ) to cover a \u201c communication method based on repetition \u201d . Relying in particular on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , they also complained of the order in the disputed ruling to broadcast the above announcement on ORG , the essence of their argument being that \u201c there [ was ] no basis in legislation for the publication of a judicial announcement , which [ was ] nothing less than punishment for a civil wrong \u201d .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG ) dismissed the appeal for the following reasons , inter alia :", "\u201c ... In finding the publishing director liable as principal for the offence created by LAW of DATE , ORG both for its own and for adopted reasons ruled that the broadcasts containing the offending remarks had been , with the exception of the first bulletin , systematically broadcast on a rolling basis in exactly the same or in condensed form over a TIME period .", "It further found that this type of broadcasting allowed the publishing director to exercise control over the content before it was broadcast to the public .", "The court applied the law correctly in so ruling .", "The content of an announcement which is broadcast on a rolling basis must properly be construed as having been fixed prior to being communicated to the public within the meaning of section CARDINAL [ cited above ] . ...", "... although the criminal courts may order the publication of their judgments by way of penalty only if they are expressly authorised to do so by law , they may issue such an order by way of a remedy at the request of the civil party .
