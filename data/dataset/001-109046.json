The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . The first applicant lives in GPE and the other applicants live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants , together with CARDINAL other persons , went to an upper secondary school ( gymnasieskola ) and distributed CARDINAL leaflets by leaving them in or on the ORG lockers . The episode ended when the school \u2019s principal intervened and made them leave the LOC . The originator of the leaflets was an organisation called ORG and the leaflets contained , inter alia , the following statements :", "\u201c Homosexual ORG ( NORP )", "In the course of DATE society has swung from rejection of homosexuality and other sexual deviances ( avarter ) to embracing this deviant sexual proclivity ( b\u00f6jelse ) . Your anti - NORP teachers know very well that homosexuality has a morally destructive effect on the substance of society ( folkkroppen ) and will willingly try to put it forward as something normal and good .", "-- Tell them that HIV and AIDS appeared early with the homosexuals and that their promiscuous lifestyle was one of the main reasons for DATE plague gaining a foothold .", "-- Tell them that homosexual lobby organisations are also trying to play down ( avdramatisera ) paedophilia , and ask if this sexual deviation ( sexuella avart ) should be legalised . \u201d", "CARDINAL . For distributing the leaflets , the applicants were charged with agitation against a national or ethnic group ( hets mot folkgrupp ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants disputed that the text in the leaflets expressed contempt for homosexuals and claimed that , in any event , they had not intended to express contempt for homosexuals as a group . They stated that the purpose of their activity had been to start a debate about the lack of objectivity in the education dispensed in NORP schools .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON found that the statements in the leaflets had clearly gone beyond what could be considered an objective discussion of homosexuals as a group and that the ORG intention had been to express contempt for homosexuals . It therefore convicted the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group , and sentenced the first and second applicants to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , the third applicant to a suspended sentence ( villkorlig dom ) combined with a fine , and the fourth applicant to probation ( skyddstillsyn ) combined with TIME of community service .", "CARDINAL . The applicants as well as the prosecutor appealed against the judgment to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) for ORG . The applicants requested the court to reject the charges , to consider the criminal act minor , or at least to reduce the punishments . The prosecutor appealed as regards the first CARDINAL applicants , requesting the court to consider the criminal act to be aggravated or at least to increase the punishments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , referring to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ( see below under \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d ) , rejected the charges against the applicants on the ground that a conviction would amount to a violation of their right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The Office of the Prosecutor - General ( Riks\u00e5klagaren ) appealed against the judgment to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) and requested it to convict the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group , arguing that it would not amount to a violation of LAW in the circumstances of the present case . The applicants disputed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group . The majority of judges ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL ) first considered decisive for the outcome of the case whether the interference with the applicants\u2019 freedom to distribute the leaflets could be considered necessary in a NORP society and whether the interference with their freedom of expression could be deemed proportionate to the aim of protecting the group of homosexuals from the violation that the content of the leaflets constituted . The majority then held :", "\u201c In the light of the case - law of ORG CARDINAL , in the interpretation of the expression \u201c contempt \u201d in the provision regarding incitement against a group , , where , in particular , the following should be considered . The handing out of the leaflets took place at a school . The accused did not have free access to the LOC , which can be considered a relatively sheltered environment as regards the political actions of outsiders . The placement of the leaflets in and on the ORG lockers meant that the young people received them without having the possibility to decide whether they wanted to accept them or not . The purpose of the handing out of the leaflets was indeed to initiate a debate between pupils and teachers on a question of public interest , namely the objectivity of the education in NORP schools , and to supply the pupils with arguments . However , these were formulated in a way that was offensive and disparaging for homosexuals as a group and in violation of the duty under LAW to avoid as far as possible statements that are unwarrantably offensive to others thus constituting an assault on their rights , and without contributing to any form of public debate which could help to further mutual understanding . The purpose of the relevant sections in the leaflets could have been achieved without statements that were offensive to homosexuals as a group . Thus , the situation was in part different from that in NJA CARDINAL p. CARDINAL , where a pastor made his statements before his congregation in a sermon based on certain biblical quotations . The above - mentioned reasons taken together lead to the conclusion that LAW , LAW , interpreted in conformity with the LAW , permits a judgment of conviction , given the present circumstances of this case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The minority ( CARDINAL judges ) found that convicting the applicants would not be proportionate to the aims pursued and would therefore be in violation of LAW . Hence , the minority wanted to acquit the applicants but gave separate reasons for this conclusion , at least in part . CARDINAL of them was of the view that the prosecution was not formulated in such a way that ORG could take into consideration that the leaflets had been distributed at a school and addressed to the pupils , while the other found it natural that the leaflets had been aimed at pupils and agreed with the majority that an overall assessment of the circumstances had to be made .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants were given suspended sentences combined with fines ranging from SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately LAW ) and the fourth applicant was sentenced to probation .", "CARDINAL . Chapter DATE , LAW ( ORG , ORG ORG ) provides that a person who , in a disseminated statement or communication , threatens or expresses contempt for a national , ethnic or other such group of persons with allusion to race , colour , national or ethnic origin , religious beliefs or sexual orientation , should be convicted of agitation against a national or ethnic group . The offence carries a penalty of up to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . If the offence is considered minor the penalty is a fine , and if it is considered to be aggravated the penalty is imprisonment for DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . Agitation against homosexuals as a group was made a criminal offence by an amendment of the law that came into effect on DATE . According to the preparatory work on that amendment , as reproduced in Government PERSON ( pp . DATE ) , homosexuals constitute an exposed group which is often subjected to criminal acts because of their sexual orientation , and national socialist and other racist groups agitate against homosexuals and homosexuality as part of their propaganda . The preparatory work also stated that there were good reasons to assume that the homophobic attitude that had caused certain offenders to attack individuals on account of their sexual orientation derived from the hate , threat and inflammatory propaganda against homosexuals as a group that was spread by the majority of NORP and other right - wing extremist groups in the country .", "CARDINAL . ORG , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( case ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) concerning statements made by a pastor during a sermon which were deemed to have expressed contempt for homosexuals as a group within the meaning of LAW , LAW , considered that the legislation was in accordance with the LAW . However , ORG found that , the word \u201c contempt \u201d in the provision regarding incitement against a group had to be interpreted more restrictively than the preparatory work appeared to indicate if an application of the provisions that was in line with the LAW was to be achieved . ORG then found that an application of the provision that was in line with the LAW would not permit a judgment convicting"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
