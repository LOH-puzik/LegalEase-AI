The court held that the statutory scheme governing drug licensing did not contain an implicit exemption for drugs intended for use by the terminally ill . In its view , the safety and effectiveness standards laid down in the legislation applied equally to such drugs , because the legislature could be regarded as intending to protect terminal patients from ineffectual or unsafe drugs . For such patients , as for anyone else , a drug was unsafe if its potential to cause death or physical injury was not offset by the possibility of therapeutic benefit . In relation to terminally ill people , unlicensed drugs carried a further risk , namely that the individuals concerned might eschew conventional therapy in favour of a drug with no demonstrable curative properties , with potentially irreversible consequences . In that connection the court noted , on the basis of expert evidence presented to it , that with diseases such as cancer it was often impossible to identify a patient as terminally ill other than in retrospect . It went on to say that acceptance of the proposition that statutory safety and efficacy standards have no relevance for terminal patients would be tantamount to denying the authorities\u2019 power to regulate any drugs , however toxic or ineffective , for such individuals , which would allow abusive marketing of many purportedly simple and painless cures . Lastly , the court observed that its ruling did not exclude all resort to experimental cancer drugs by patients for whom conventional therapy was inefficacious , because the statutory scheme exempted from pre - marketing approval drugs intended solely for investigative use if they satisfied certain pre - clinical testing and other criteria .", "CARDINAL .
