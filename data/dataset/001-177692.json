However , the confiscation decision dated DATE , on the basis of which the plot had been confiscated , had specified that the surface area of the confiscated land had been QUANTITY m. ORG also referred to evidence submitted on DATE by ORG , according to which the area of the plot had been CARDINAL shinik and had represented a part of a larger plot of land , the total surface area of which was QUANTITY . m. A further extract from a \u201c ORG of ORG and \u201c Review of old units of land area and their conversion into hectares , areas and sq . m \u201d , issued on the basis of a letter dated DATE , specified that CARDINAL shinik corresponded to QUANTITY . m. Lastly , the ORG relied on a cadastral plan drawn up by a licenced surveyor ( \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0440 ) made for a separate set of restitution proceedings ( instituted by the heirs of ORG ) , according to which the surface area of the land , formerly owned by the ORG predecessor , had been QUANTITY m. In such circumstances , the ORG found that the applicants had unlawfully obtained possession of CARDINAL sq . m of land , on the basis of the restitution order . For those reasons , the Commission held that the restitution order had been contrary to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and was legally unenforceable pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW . In respect of the latter section , the Commission held that the unenforceability of a decision concerned not only the factual ( \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 ) , but also the legal ( \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 ) impossibility of enforcement .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the second - instance commission dismissed the ORG appeals , endorsing the reasoning given by ORG . It held that ORG had been obliged , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , to declare the restitution order null and void .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an administrative action against the latter decision before ORG . They again referred to the judgement of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They further stated that the issue of nullity had already been finally resolved following the application lodged by ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld their action and annulled the decision of the second - instance commission . The court further rejected as inadmissible an application by PERSON and ORG , the legal successors of ORG ( \u201c the third persons \u201d ) , to intervene in the proceedings . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c ... In the court \u2019s opinion , there has been no breach of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW ... This section concerns the impossibility for factual enforcement and the legal impossibility for enforcement which would be in contravention of ... legislation . In the present case there is no such situation and therefore it can not be considered that LAW has been breached ... This is so because the evidence admitted in the course of the proceedings provides a certain basis for the court to conclude that in the present case the restitution order ... was adopted in accordance with LAW , which had been preceded by a correct and full establishment of the facts , thereby leading to the conclusion that in that case all statutory conditions had been fulfilled for [ the return of ] the property concerned .", "With regard to the application lodged by PERSON and ORG ... it is clear that [ they ] did not participate , nor could they have participated in the administrative proceedings initiated by other persons who claimed a right to restitution of a part of the property which had indisputably been in the possession of their legal predecessors . In view of that ... in the present case there is no possibility that third persons ( interested persons ) can have standing as parties to the restitution proceedings . However , that does not mean that those persons will be deprived of the right to protect their rights and interests ... a possibility remains for them to establish their rights by lodging a civil claim before a competent court within DATE of the finalisation of the restitution order ( section DATE , paragraph CARDINAL of the Act ) , against the persons to whom possession was restored or compensation was paid in accordance with the provisions of the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and the third persons respectively appealed against that judgment before ORG , which had in the meantime become competent to act upon appeals against judgments of ORG . In the appeal the third persons argued that the difference between QUANTITY . m and the surface originally granted to the applicants belonged to them and adduced evidence to this end . The applicants submitted observations in reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the appeal submitted by ORG and overturned the decision of ORG . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c In ORG opinion , which has been stated in several of this court \u2019s cases , a restitution order can be considered as legally impossible to enforce , if there are breaches of the law which can not be remedied with the application of other legal means , as is the situation in the present case . In particular , with the [ restitution ] order more was restored to the [ applicants ] than what they had been entitled to , having in mind the surface of the property which was in their legal predecessor \u2019s possession . In support of this , the ORG organs submit \u2018 ORG of ORG and \u2018 Review of old units of land area and their conversion into hectares , areas and sq . m\u2019 as evidence that CARDINAL shinik in the city of PERSON amounted to QUANTITY . m. This finds support in the expropriation decision of CARDINAL DATE where it was noted that the expropriated land had had a surface of QUANTITY m , which had been preceded by an accurate determination of the object of expropriation . The finding is further supported by a cadastral plan done by a licenced surveyor ( \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0440 ) on the basis of the limits and boundaries of the plots of land as laid out in the expropriation decision .", "... [ T]he conclusion is correct that in the present case , with the restitution order , the property registered as property of the ORG was restored contrary to the conditions specified in LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Since the ORG organs established that part of the concerned property was not in possession of the legal predecessor [ of the applicants ] , there is a legal obstacle for the exercise of a restitution right over that part of the property . Hence , such an order can not be enforced , which is grounds for the application of paragraph CARDINAL subparagraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of LAW , meaning that the decision is null and void ( \u043d\u0438\u0448\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e ) ...", "... In respect of the third persons , or the interested persons , LAW excludes the possibility for them to appear as parties to the restitution proceedings , but what remains for them is the possibility to claim their rights in a civil suit before a competent court within DATE after the finalisation of the restitution order ( section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of the Act ) , against the persons to whom possession was restored or compensation was paid in accordance with the provisions of this LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This decision was served on the applicants on DATE and DATE respectively . By decisions of DATE and DATE ORG rejected as inadmissible their applications for the reopening of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL .
