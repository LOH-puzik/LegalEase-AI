On DATE the NORP ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ordered that the applicant be placed in detention . The court noted , in particular , that the applicant was suspected of a particularly serious criminal offence and that , being a police officer , he could use his professional experience in order to influence witnesses and obstruct the investigation . The decision was upheld on appeal by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until DATE , stating that he was charged with serious and particularly serious offences and that , if at liberty , he could obstruct the establishment of the truth and influence witnesses . On DATE ORG upheld that decision on appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE of the period of his pre - trial detention authorised by ORG in its decision of DATE the authorities of a detention centre where he was being held at that moment refused to release him with reference to a letter of the PERSON prosecutor stating that on CARDINAL DATE the file of his criminal case had been sent to a court . In the applicant \u2019s submission , the case file was not in fact sent to the court until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG scheduled a hearing in the applicant \u2019s case and ordered that the applicant remain in detention . It did not specify the time - limit for the applicant \u2019s detention , nor did it give any reasons for that decision .", "CARDINAL .

By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG extended the term of the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial until DATE . It referred to the applicant \u2019s personality , the fact that he was charged with serious and particularly serious criminal offences and the fact that he had pleaded not guilty , which , in the court \u2019s opinion , suggested that he might obstruct the establishment of the truth , if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG further extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until DATE , relying on the same reasons as those indicated in the decision of CARDINAL DATE . That decision was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . That judgment was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At some point the applicant attempted to have criminal proceedings instituted against the GPE Town prosecutor who , according to him , had provided the authorities of a detention centre where he had been held at the material time false information stating that the file of his criminal case had been sent to a court on DATE , whereas in reality it had not been sent there until DATE .

On DATE the ORG of GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint against the decision of the prosecutor \u2019s office of LOC to dispense with criminal proceedings against the GPE Town prosecutor . This decision was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE . The courts confirmed that the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s decision was lawful and well - founded , since there was no evidence of any criminal offence in the actions of the official in question , as he had not breached any provisions of domestic criminal law , or law on criminal procedure , and there was no evidence of any unlawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention during the period complained of .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , criminal - law matters have been governed by LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . \u201c Preventive measures \u201d include an undertaking not to leave a town or region , personal surety , bail and detention ( Article CARDINAL ) . When deciding on a preventive measure , the competent authority is required to consider whether there are \u201c sufficient grounds to believe \u201d that the accused would abscond during the investigation or trial , reoffend or obstruct the establishment of the truth ( Article CARDINAL ) . It must also take into account the gravity of the charge , information on the accused \u2019s character , his or her profession , age , state of health , family status and other circumstances ( Article CARDINAL ) . In exceptional circumstances , and when there exist grounds provided for by Article CARDINAL , a preventive measure may be applied to a suspect , taking into account the circumstances listed in LAW . If necessary , the suspect or accused may be asked to give an undertaking to appear in court ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The Code makes a distinction CARDINAL types of custody : the first being \u201c pending investigation \u201d , that is , while a competent agency \u2013 the police or a prosecutor \u2019s office \u2013 is investigating the case , and the second being \u201c before the court \u201d ( or \u201c pending trial \u201d ) , at the judicial stage .", "CARDINAL . A custodial measure may only be ordered by a judicial decision in respect of a person who is suspected of , or charged with , a criminal offence punishable by DATE imprisonment ( LAW ) . The maximum period for detention pending investigation is DATE ( Article CARDINAL ) . A judge may extend that period DATE ( LAW ) . Further extensions may only be granted by a judge if the person is charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences ( LAW ) . No extension beyond DATE is permissible and the detainee must be released immediately ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . From the time the prosecutor sends the case to the trial court , the defendant \u2019s detention falls under the category of \u201c before the court \u201d ( or \u201c pending trial \u201d ) . The period of detention pending trial is calculated up to the date on which the first - instance judgment is given . It may not normally exceed DATE from the moment the case file arrives at the court , but if the case concerns serious or particularly serious criminal offences , the trial court may approve CARDINAL or more extensions of no longer than DATE each ( LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
