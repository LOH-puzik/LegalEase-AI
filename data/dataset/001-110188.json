THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for family life)", "JUDGES": "Ann Power-Forde;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Dean Spielmann;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Giorgio Malinverni;Jean-Paul Costa;Josep Casadevall;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Ledi Bianku;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch .", "CARDINAL . On TIME DATE , a man was shot and killed in a caf\u00e9 in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch by a person believed to be the applicant \u2019s unmarried life partner , PERSON The applicant was understood to have been in the company of PERSON at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , PERSON had been convicted of similar offences in DATE and DATE , and on the latter occasion of attempted manslaughter using a firearm . While serving his sentence for that offence , PERSON had been given DATE leave ; it was during DATE that the above - mentioned shooting took place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having been summoned as a witness in the criminal investigation that had been opened against PERSON , the applicant appeared but refused to testify before the investigating judge ( rechtercommissaris ) . She explained that , although they were not married and had not entered into a registered partnership ( geregistreerd partnerschap ) , she and PERSON had been cohabiting for DATE in a relationship out of which CARDINAL children had been born , both of whom had been recognised by PERSON The applicant argued that on the basis of this relationship she should be regarded as entitled to the testimonial privilege ( verschoningsrecht ) afforded to ORG spouses and registered partners under LAW , opening sentence and sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW ( PERSON ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Although being of the view that the applicant was not entitled to testimonial privilege , the investigating judge rejected the public prosecutor \u2019s request to issue an order for the applicant \u2019s detention for failure to comply with a judicial order ( gijzeling ) , finding that the applicant \u2019s personal interests in remaining at liberty outweighed those of the prosecution . The public prosecutor appealed against this decision to the \u2018 s - ORG ( rechtbank ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the \u2018 s - ORG , sitting in chambers ( raadkamer ) , quashed the investigating judge \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered the applicant \u2019s detention for failure to comply with a judicial order . It considered that it could reasonably be assumed that the applicant was able to convey what had occurred in relation to PERSON before , during and after the shooting . It noted that , according to the provisions of LAW , opening sentence and sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW as in force from DATE , the ( former ) spouse or the ( former ) registered partner of a suspect were competent but not compellable witnesses , that is to say , persons entitled to testimonial privilege . It further held :", "\u201c It follows from the wording and the legal history of [ Article CARDINAL , opening sentence and sub - paragraph CARDINAL , ] that the legislature has quite recently and unambiguously chosen not to include in the scope of [ the privilege set out in Article CARDINAL , opening sentence and sub - paragraph CARDINAL , ] any partners other than spouses and registered partners ( as well as former spouses and former registered partners ) . As it does not appear that [ the applicant ] and the suspect are or have been married or that they are or have been registered partners , ORG is of the view that [ the applicant ] can not claim an entitlement to the testimonial privilege laid down in LAW . This is not altered by the fact that [ the applicant ] and the suspect are engaged in another kind of longterm cohabitation . ORG rejects the argument raised by counsel for [ the applicant ] that it follows from ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention that the GPE legislature can not limit the group of persons ( related to a suspect ) entitled to testimonial privilege . An extension of that group must , also in view of the far - reaching consequences thereof , be decided by the legislature and for that reason goes beyond the judicial function ( rechtsvormende taak ) of the courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its subsequent balancing of the competing interests involved , ORG noted that the facts at issue concerned CARDINAL of the most serious crimes set out in LAW ( PERSON ) and concluded that the applicant \u2019s personal interests were outweighed by the general interest of the truth being uncovered . It further added that the circumstance that the applicant and PERSON were cohabiting as if they were in a marriage or a registered partnership could not lead it to balance the interests differently . Rejection of the request to issue a detention order on the basis of that circumstance would entail that the applicant was nevertheless , and in circumvention of LAW , granted a right to testimonial privilege , and that would be contrary to the legislature \u2019s choice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , at TIME , the applicant was taken into detention for failure to comply with a judicial order . As required by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant was heard on DATE by an investigating judge , who rejected a release request by counsel for the applicant and who notified ORG within the statutory time - limit of TIME after she was taken into detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in chambers , examined whether the applicant \u2019s detention should continue , and in that context it heard the applicant , who persisted in her refusal to give evidence in the criminal investigation against PERSON ORG agreed with the decision taken in chambers on DATE that the applicant was not entitled to testimonial privilege . Concluding that the interests of the investigation in obtaining the applicant \u2019s evidence outweighed the interests invoked on behalf of the applicant , ORG decided that the applicant was to be kept in detention for DATE , with a possibility of further extension . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in chambers , examined a request by the prosecution of DATE to extend the applicant \u2019s detention . After hearing the public prosecutor , the applicant and her lawyer ORG rejected the request and ordered the applicant \u2019s immediate release . It found that the interest of the truth being uncovered in the criminal proceedings against PERSON was outweighed by the applicant \u2019s personal interest in being released , also taking into account the fact that the applicant \u2019s detention entailed an interference with her rights under LAW ( \u201c mede gelet op het feit dat de vrijheidsbeneming van de getuige een inbreuk op artikel CARDINAL van het EVRM tot gevolg heeft \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the \u2018 s - ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal ( hoger beroep ) and upheld the impugned decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after noting that the applicant had been released on DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) declared inadmissible for lack of interest the applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) . ORG nevertheless saw fit to consider the applicant \u2019s first complaint that ORG had incorrectly upheld the ruling of ORG in which it was concluded that she was not entitled to the testimonial privilege of Article CARDINAL , opening sentence and sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , as well as her second complaint that to deny her this privilege was contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Having noted the wording of Article CARDINAL , opening sentence and subparagraph CARDINAL , of LAW as in force since DATE , ORG rejected the first complaint . As to the applicant \u2019s grievance based on ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , ORG held :", "\u201c Testimonial privilege as laid down in LAW , opening sentence and sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW seeks to protect the \u2018 family life\u2019 within the meaning of LAW that exists between the spouses and partners referred to in that provision . By granting this privilege to spouses and registered partners but not to other partners \u2013 even when such partners , like the applicant and her partner , cohabit in a sustained fashion \u2013 the law differentiates between the different forms of cohabitation at issue here . Even assuming that this can be said to constitute a difference in treatment of persons in the same situation , there is an objective and reasonable justification for this difference in treatment , having regard to the fact that the granting of testimonial privilege to spouses and registered partners is an exception to the statutory duty to testify , which exception makes the interest of uncovering the truth yield to the interests of those relationships , with the statutory arrangement delimiting this exception in a clear and workable manner , thus serving legal certainty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . Unlike the suspect , a witness in ( preliminary ) criminal proceedings is obliged to answer questions put to him or her when he or she is under oath , and any deliberate refusal to do so constitutes a criminal offence under LAW . However , LAW grants the right not to give evidence to certain relatives of the suspect .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides as follows :", "\u201c The following shall be excused the obligation to give evidence or answer certain questions :", "CARDINAL : NORP the relatives in the ascending or the descending line of a suspect or co - suspect , whether connected by blood or by marriage ;", "CARDINAL : NORP the relatives ex transverso [ i.e. siblings , uncles , aunts , nieces and nephews , etc . ] of a suspect or co - suspect , whether connected by blood or by marriage , up to and including the third degree of kinship ;", "CARDINAL : NORP the spouse or former spouse , or registered partner or former registered partner , of a suspect or co - suspect . \u201d", "The third sub - paragraph formerly applied only to the spouse and the former spouse of a suspect or co - suspect . It was amended to extend the testimonial privilege to the registered partner ( or former registered partner ) with effect from DATE , when LAW ( GPE geregistreerd partnerschap ) and LAW on the Adaptation of Legislation to LAW into Book CARDINAL of the Civil Code ( Wet tot aanpassing van wetgeving aan de invoering van het geregistreerd partnerschap in PERSON ) entered into force .", "CARDINAL . As can be inferred from the Explanatory Memorandum ( PERSON ) to LAW ( see Parliamentary Documents , ORG of ORG ( PERSON ) CARDINAL , CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , and from an advisory opinion of ORG endorsed by ORG in a judgment of DATE ( National LAW , published in PERSON ( GPE Law Reports ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , the basis for this testimonial privilege lies in the sphere of the protection of family relations . In accepting the right not to give evidence against a relative , spouse or registered partner , the legislature has acknowledged the important social value of those relationships in society and has sought to prevent witnesses from being faced with a moral dilemma by having to make a choice between testifying , and thereby jeopardising their relationship with the suspect , or giving perjured evidence in order to protect that relationship .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If , when questioned , the witness refuses without any lawful reason to answer the questions put to him or to make the required statement or take the required oath or affirmation , the investigating judge shall , if this is urgently required in the interest of the investigation , either proprio motu or if so requested by the public prosecutor or by the defence , order that the witness shall be detained for failure to comply with a judicial order until ORG has given a decision in the matter .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigating judge shall notify ORG within TIME after the detention has commenced , unless the witness is released from detention before then . ORG shall , within TIME [ from the notification ] , order that the witness be kept in detention or released . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG order for the witness to remain in detention shall be valid for no longer than DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , as long as the preliminary judicial investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) remains pending , ORG may , on the basis of the findings of the investigating judge or at the request of the public prosecutor , after having again questioned the witness , extend the validity of the order again and again ( telkens ) for DATE each time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The investigating judge shall order the witness released from detention as soon as he has fulfilled his obligation or his evidence is no longer needed .", "CARDINAL . ORG may at any time order the witness released from detention , whether on the basis of the findings of the investigating judge , proprio motu or if so requested by the public prosecutor or by the defence . The witness shall be heard or summoned beforehand .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the witness \u2019s request to be released from detention is refused , he may appeal within DATE of the official notification of the decision , and in the event that his appeal is dismissed , he may within the same time - limit lodge an appeal on points of law . ...", "CARDINAL . NORP In any event , the public prosecutor shall order that the witness be released as soon as the preliminary judicial investigation has been closed or discontinued . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A partnership is registered by means of a registration document drawn up by ORG , Deaths and Marriages ( ambtenaar van de burgerlijke stand ) ( LAW ) ; the formal requirements are similar to those of a marriage . It can be dissolved by mutual consent , by the registration of a statement to that effect signed by both parties and co - signed by an advocate or a notary , or by a court order at the request of CARDINAL of the parties ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The provisions of the Civil Code setting out the legal consequences of marriage apply by analogy to a registered partnership , with the exception of certain rules governing the establishment of legal family ties ( familierechtelijke betrekkingen ) with descendants ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to a request made during the ORG \u2019s hearing ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Government supplied the following information :", "\u201c In DATE article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( ORG ) was amended to the extent that the right to be exempted from testifying would also apply to a witness who had entered into a registered partnership with the defendant . This amendment in itself did not lead to any debate on the question whether other forms of relationships should be entitled to the same exemption .", "However , this amendment \u2013 among many others \u2013 was a consequence of the introduction of registered partnership , which in turn was preceded by a full survey ( concluded in DATE , [ Parliamentary Documents , ORG of ORG , DATE , no . CARDINAL ] ) of all legislation that made a distinction between married and unmarried couples . With regard to article CARDINAL ORG the survey mentioned that an amendment should be considered to the effect that the article would include a life partner ( p. CARDINAL ) .", "Following this survey the ORG committee [ a committee tasked with reviewing legislative projects , named after its chairman , Professor PERSON ] presented its report \u2018 Partnerships\u2019 ( ORG , DATE ) to the ORG . The committee was of the opinion that the best way to remove all existing distinctions would be to introduce CARDINAL new possibilities of registering partnerships in addition to marriage . Together these CARDINAL forms of registration could be used as categories in most legal provisions that attached legal consequences to different types of partnerships .", "Following further discussion in parliament ( [ Parliamentary Documents , ORG of ORG , DATE , ORG . CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ] ) the Government decided to introduce CARDINAL new form of registration , which then became known as registered partnership . In doing so , the Government accepted that in several instances , specific provisions might be required to accommodate situations of family life not covered by the accepted categories . However , in the context of article CARDINAL ORG this was not considered necessary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . All Council of Europe Member GPE have addressed in their legislation the question whether in criminal proceedings the spouse of the defendant can be compelled to give evidence . The following is a brief and necessarily condensed survey of the position in the various domestic legal orders . It is based on information available to the ORG at the time of its hearing ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In no ORG member ORG , with the exception of GPE and GPE , are spouses obliged to give evidence in criminal proceedings in which the other spouse is a suspect . In a few cases , namely GPE , GPE and GPE , exclusion of the evidence of the suspect \u2019s spouse is automatic ; in general , however , the spouse may opt to give evidence or claim a privilege or an exemption when called as a witness .", "CARDINAL . The possibility formally to register a partnership exists in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ( some of the autonomous communities ) , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . Some of these GPE allow such registration only if the parties are of the same sex ( including GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) ; the other member GPE concerned provide registration of a partnership as an alternative to marriage when the parties are a man and a woman .", "CARDINAL . Of the CARDINAL member GPE that allow the registration of partnerships , CARDINAL are prepared to exempt the suspect \u2019s registered partner from giving evidence : these are GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and the GPE , whose legislation explicitly so provides , and GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , whose laws assimilate registered partnership to marriage in this aspect as in others . GPE and GPE do not extend this privilege to registered partners ; GPE and GPE grant no testimonial privilege at all .", "CARDINAL . A minority of member GPE \u2013 namely GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE \u2013 exempt the person engaged to be married to the suspect from the duty to give evidence . However , apart from GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , these member States qualify this exemption by requiring evidence of the existence of a bond similar to marriage , such as stable cohabitation or a child born of the relationship .", "CARDINAL . Cohabitees who are not married , engaged to be married or in a registered partnership with the suspect appear to be dispensed from giving evidence unconditionally only in GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . By contrast , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , \u201c the Former GPE \u201d , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE require proof of the marriage - like nature of the relationship , usually in the form of children born of it , demonstrable financial arrangements or length of cohabitation . It would appear that the other ORG member GPE do not permit a person merely cohabiting with the suspect to withhold his or her evidence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
