The first applicant , an NORP national born in DATE and living in GPE , is a journalist by profession . The applicant company is the owner and publisher of the NORP DATE magazine News .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant published a CARDINAL - page article under the heading \u201c PERSON instead of Black and Red ? \u201d ( PERSON FAC ? ) in the applicant company 's magazine News . In the NORP political context , \u201c PERSON \u201d means a person or group having some affinity with ORG ideology , \u201c LOC refers to ORG ( ORG ) and \u201c Red \u201d to ORG ( ORG ) . The article discussed the question whether it was possible and desirable to form a coalition government with ORG ( ORG ) under the leadership of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant explained why , in his view , such a coalition government was not desirable . He gave CARDINAL reasons , each of which was dealt with under a separate subheading . Referring to statements by PERSON and other ORG members , he broached topics such as the ORG 's specific view of history , its NORP jingoism ( NORP ) , that is , its chauvinist and nostalgic affinity with GPE , its inclination towards racism , the opinion poll \u201c GPE first \u201d ( PERSON zuerst ) initiated by it , its political style and the possible negative reaction by foreign countries .", "\u201c CARDINAL . Violent Scene [ Gewaltszene ]", "Right - wing thugs [ Braune Schl\u00e4ger ] , fire - raisers and bomb - throwers have emerged from the ORG . Leading figures of brown terror , such as ORG , ORG , Honsik and ORG , started their career with ORG . Under PERSON the ' old closet NORP ' [ Kellernazi ] had left the party . Under PERSON they are returning and are even allowed to run for office . Names such as NORP , NORP . , NORP , PERSON . , PERSON , PERSON . , PERSON , Hat . , PERSON . , PERSON , ORG , GPE . and PERSON show that the dissociation [ GPE ] from the extreme right that is constantly being stressed by PERSON has in reality never taken place . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Her husband is a well - known right - wing politician and the editor of the magazine fakten , which is considered to be extreme right - wing .", "CARDINAL . PERSON filed a private prosecution for defamation ( \u00fcble GPE ) against the first applicant and a compensation claim against the applicant company under LAW ( Mediengesetz ) in FAC ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was convicted of defamation under LAW ) . The court sentenced him to DATE - fines ( PERSON ) of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) each ( that is , a total of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) or DATE imprisonment in default , suspended for a DATE probationary period . The applicant company was ordered to pay ORG CARDINAL in compensation to ORG pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court noted in its reasoning that the passage in issue was to be understood in the way it would be perceived by an average reader . The term \u201c closet NORP \u201d was used to describe a person who supported ORG ideas , not in public , but in private through clandestine activities . Belonging to such a circle of persons meant having a contemptible character and behaving in a manner contrary to honour or morality . According to the court , it could not be established that PERSON was a co - author of her husband 's magazine . Even assuming that she had contributed to certain passages of some of the articles published in it , as contended by the applicants , these were unproblematic in terms of the National Socialism Prohibition Act ( Verfassungsgesetz vom CARDINAL . DATE \u00fcber das NORP der ORG , GPE DATE \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . As regards a statement by PERSON in which she had said that she did not find her husband 's activities immoral , the court found that Mr ORG had so far not been convicted of contravening LAW . On the other hand , PERSON had not said that she supported her husband 's activities or identified herself with them . Moreover , a wife could not be expected to criticise her husband in public . Although she had criticised the National Socialism Prohibition Act in public statements , the court found that the applicants had failed to provide evidence of any clandestine ORG activities undertaken by PERSON that would justify calling her a \u201c closet NORP \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed , arguing that the term \u201c closet NORP \u201d had been coined by PERSON when he was Chairman of the ORG . It was meant to describe those of his party colleagues who , officially , demonstrated support for democracy , but who , unofficially or secretly , did not dissociate themselves from neo - NORP ideas or from contacts with the neo - NORP scene . Therefore , their relation to the extreme right appeared to be unclear . The applicants complained that the court had in fact failed to conclude that PERSON had contributed to the editing of her husband 's xenophobic magazine . They argued that PERSON , as a politician , exposed herself to public scrutiny and advocated views of a political nature . As a politician , it was part of her functions to participate in political debate . Therefore , in the light of the right to freedom of expression and information of citizens and the electorate , it was legitimate to expect her to take a stand also in regard to her husband 's political activities . Taking sides with her husband might do her credit as a wife , but , as a politician , she had to bear criticism under such circumstances , as her failure to dissociate herself from the extreme right could be perceived as an approval of her husband 's political activities . Had the court correctly assessed the meaning of the incriminated passage , it would have concluded that the applicants had furnished proof of its factual basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower court 's judgment .", "CARDINAL . It considered that ORG had correctly found that the term \u201c closet NORP \u201d was to be assessed from the point of view of an average reader , who could not be expected to know the original meaning given to it by Mr GPE DATE previously . Therefore , the article had insinuated clandestine neo - NORP activities on the part of PERSON that were not proved . Consequently , it was irrelevant to take evidence relating to possible extreme right - wing activities of her husband , as proposed by the applicants . Moreover , the first - instance court had correctly found that neither PERSON public speeches when compared to certain passages of articles in her husband 's magazine , nor her statement that she did not find her husband 's activities immoral warranted the conclusion that she supported ORG ideas . Therefore , the evidence the applicants ' proposed to adduce to the effect that PERSON ORG knew the contents of her husband 's magazine and that she in fact contributed from time to time to its editing was not sufficient to furnish proof of her clandestine support for ORG ideas .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation ; the victim can thus claim damages from him . Compensation up to MONEY ( ORG ) can be awarded . In this context , \u201c defamation \u201d is defined in LAW as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Anyone who accuses another , as it may be perceived by a third party , of having a contemptible character or attitude , or of behaviour contrary to honour or morality , and of such a nature as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem , shall be liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding DATE or a fine not exceeding CARDINAL day - fines .", "CARDINAL .

The person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true . As regards the offence defined in paragraph CARDINAL , he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
