NORP The relevant provisions , as worded at the material time , read as follows :", "\u201c Judgments of indictment divisions and judgments of the criminal courts against which no ordinary appeal lies may , in the event of a breach of the law , be set aside on an appeal on points of law to ORG lodged by the public prosecutor or by the party adversely affected , according to the distinctions made hereafter .", "The appeal must be lodged with ORG . \u201d", "\u201c Appellants in ORG may lodge a pleading bearing their signature and containing the grounds of their appeal with the registry of the court against whose judgment they are appealing either when giving notice of appeal or within DATE .

The parties ' lawyers shall make their observations after the report , if appropriate . The public prosecutor shall make his or her submissions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Current practice is for the advocate - general to inform the parties ' lawyers before DATE of the hearing of the tenor of his or her submissions and in cases where , at the request of the lawyers , there is an oral hearing , they are entitled to reply to his or her submissions orally or by a note sent to the court in deliberations ( see PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In cases in which representation by a member of the ORG d'Etat and ORG is not compulsory , an ordinance of DATE , LAW of which has not been repealed , lays down that the parties may make oral representations with the permission of ORG . On the basis of the ordinance of DATE ORG accepts that it is possible for it to give the parties leave to address it , or for a member of the ordinary bar to speak on their behalf . Although it is for ORG to decide whether or not to grant permission according to the circumstances ( Court of Cassation , ORG , CARDINAL DATE , ORG . crim . [ Criminal Bulletin ] no . CARDINAL ) , it appears that its practice is to refuse such applications ( see the period DATE and the judgments available on the L\u00e9gifrance Internet site ) in terms similar to the following :", "\u201c Regard being had to LAW DATE , which has not been repealed in so far as it concerns the procedure applicable before ORG ; as [ the appellant ] has set out his grounds of appeal against the impugned decision in a pleading which he has lodged in person , his appearance in person before ORG does not appear to be either necessary or appropriate ; it is not necessary to order it . \u201d ( judgment of DATE , appeal on points of law no .

As regards more particularly cases involving road - traffic offences ( such as parking or speeding offences ) , there have been numerous decisions in which applications made by members of the ordinary bar have been turned down , ORG holding as in the following decision :", "\u201c [ The appellant ] has requested permission to appear before ORG assisted by Mr [ ... ] , a member of ORG [ ... ] . As [ the appellant ] has set out his grounds of appeal against the impugned decision in a pleading which he has lodged in person , his appearance in person before ORG does not appear to be essential . \u201d ( judgment of DATE , appeal on points of law no .

Indeed , the Government acknowledge that such permission is rarely granted , the principle being that the members of the ORG d'Etat and ORG have a monopoly on making oral representations . They must consult the President of ORG beforehand regarding the ground of appeal on points of law for which they consider oral representations to be necessary . In DATE oral representations were only made in CARDINAL appeals out of a total of CARDINAL that were heard .", "CARDINAL . NORP The members of the PERSON d'Etat and ORG are the successors to the ORG attorneys , who practised during LOC Rights of audience before FAC were reserved to attorneys who were royal officers and owned their official appointment ( charge ) from DATE . By the time of the Revolution in DATE there were QUANTITY attorneys at FAC . The Revolution brought their activities to an end . They became counsel at the Tribunal of Cassation that was created in DATE , and subsequently , in DATE , members of ORG . Another group of lawyers practised at the ORG d'Etat . The CARDINAL groups were merged by an ordinance of DATE . That ordinance , which for DATE served as LAW , was amended by a decree of DATE ( which codified the conditions of access to the profession and has since undergone a number of subsequent amendments ; see also the law of CARDINAL DATE , which made women eligible to enter the profession , and the decree of CARDINAL DATE , allowing lawyers to practise in professional partnerships ) . The existence of a specialised bar is peculiar to GPE and GPE ( where only members of ORG belong to a separate bar council ) .", "CARDINAL . Members of the ORG d'Etat and ORG , unlike members of the ordinary bar , are ministerial officers . The number of official appointees has been irrevocably set at CARDINAL since DATE . The conditions of access require in principle the candidate to be a practising lawyer , to have undergone special training and to have passed a professional entrance examination organised by ORG ( the legislation nevertheless provides for a number of exemptions and special means of access ) . Appointments are made by order of the Minister of ORG , on the basis of a reasoned opinion issued by ORG , the Vice - President of the ORG d'Etat and the President of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In proceedings before ORG , representation by a member of the ORG d'Etat and ORG is in principle compulsory , particularly in civil proceedings , unless an exemption is obtained . Members of the ORG d'Etat and ORG can not represent the parties before the lower courts ( although they may give advice and appear before the administrative courts of appeal and administrative courts ) . In proceedings before ORG they are required to consult with the President of ORG before the hearing if they wish to make oral representations , in order to explain the points of law they wish to make orally and to determine by agreement the arrangements under which they will be allowed to do so .", "CARDINAL .
