On DATE ORG ( \u201c the second - instance court \u201d ) upheld the applicant \u2019s appeal and remitted the case for fresh consideration . It found that the first - instance court was bound by its enforcement order of CARDINAL DATE and that it was unclear why it had concluded that it was in the parties\u2019 interests for enforcement to be terminated . In this connection it noted that the enforcement order had been served on both parties , that neither party had appealed against it , and that the first - instance court could not assess the \u201c substantive legality \u201d ( \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442 ) of the enforcement order . The second - instance court added that the first - instance court , when considering the case anew , should assess whether any of the statutory conditions for the termination of the enforcement ( \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e ) had been met .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the president of the first - instance court granted a request by the applicant for the withdrawal of Judge PERSON and appointed Judge PERSON to sit in the case . On DATE the first - instance court again terminated the enforcement . It noted that it had received , on CARDINAL occasions , a notification from ORG that no funds had been available on ORG bank accounts to cover the applicant \u2019s claim . By citing provisions of the Act relevant to the courts\u2019 territorial competence for enforcement over funds , movable property and stakes in companies ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and by taking into account the provisions of LAW regarding ORG seats and legal status , the first - instance court concluded that the enforcement , as allowed by the enforcement order , was impossible . In this connection , it stated :", "\u201c ... the enforcement sought concerned moveable property outside ( the respondent ORG ) ... It is absolutely impossible for a court in ( the respondent ORG ) to carry out enforcement against property in a foreign ORG in which different rules apply . It is true that the enforcement in the present case was allowed and that the ( enforcement order ) became final ... the court has no jurisdiction to proceed with the enforcement against shares in a foreign company in a foreign ORG ... the enforcement concerns shares of a foreign company from GPE , which is absolutely impossible to carry out LAW of GPE . LAW clearly provides that the competent court ratione loci is the court in the place where the foreign company is registered . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed , arguing , inter alia , that there was no legal ground in the Act for the termination of the enforcement in the instant case . He further submitted that under the bilateral agreement applicable between the respondent ORG and GPE ( hereafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the enforcement order should have been transmitted through the respondent ORG \u2019s ORG to the competent NORP authorities , so that the latter could proceed further with the enforcement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and confirmed the lower court \u2019s decision . It held that the first - instance court had not terminated the enforcement proceedings , but had only terminated the enforcement . In this connection it observed that a distinction should be made between ( i ) the termination of enforcement proceedings ( \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0448\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430 ) as a final completion of enforcement proceedings and ( ii ) the termination of enforcement ( \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e ) as completion of only a stage of the enforcement proceedings , completely or regarding a particular object of enforcement . The court referred to the lack of funds in GPE \u2019s accounts in ORG and reiterated the reasons of the lower court that the NORP courts had no jurisdiction to proceed with the enforcement against funds and moveable property in foreign companies for which the power of enforcement was vested with the courts of the jurisdiction within which such assets were located . The applicant was served with this decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant asked the first - instance court to attest to the finality and enforceability of the enforcement order ( \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 ) . On DATE the applicant \u2019s request was dismissed . The first - instance court held that no such measure could be taken , since there existed a final decision on the termination of the enforcement . It further pointed out that no further enforcement measures could be taken on the basis of the enforcement order . On DATE the second - instance court dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and confirmed the first - instance court \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL .
