A passage of this article read as follows :", "\u201c ORG did not consult the public and is ignoring public opinion on the matter . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sued the applicants for libel and defamation in their capacity as authors and editor of the article published on DATE . It submitted that the defendants had attributed to it specific and unproved facts with the intention of destroying or reducing its reputation .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged this claim , submitting that the article complained of amounted to fair comment . They claimed that , even though they had put forward a motion to hold a public meeting , ORG had failed to hold a public consultation on the matter . In the applicants ' opinion , the efforts made by the ORG to analyse the controversy did not amount to a public consultation .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found in favour of ORG and ordered the applicants in solidum to pay CARDINAL NORP Liri ( Lm \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) for moral damage .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the article complained of had been written in the context of a political controversy which had also been discussed in the local press . It stated that there had been a misunderstanding between the labour councillors and ORG . The labour councillors had proposed that part of FAC should be CARDINAL - way . However , according to the article , this proposal had been rejected by ORG , ORG and ORG . The first CARDINAL applicants , in their capacity as nationalist councillors , wished to bring forward the commencement of the works and had asked the labour councillors to remove the political straightjacket . Finally , the first CARDINAL applicants had stated that ORG had omitted to consult the public and was ignoring public opinion on the HRP .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG found that , as highlighted by the plaintiff , a number of measures had been taken in order to submit the project to public scrutiny .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , both the Minister responsible for roads and the Director of ORG had expressed themselves publicly to the effect that discussions were being held with ORG regarding the matter . Moreover , it was not true , as claimed by the applicants , that the proposal that part of FAC should become one - way had been rejected . In fact , at the relevant time , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL authorities which had allegedly rejected the proposal had not yet been constituted . Notwithstanding that ORG was not bound to hold any public consultation , the matter had been brought up at a public meeting organised by it on DATE . There had also been public consultation since the project itself had commenced as a result of a public meeting held in DATE . A qualified \u201c urban planner \u201d had also been engaged to prepare a report on the road in question .

On DATE ORG had organised another public meeting with several bodies and on DATE had approved the conclusions of this meeting .", "CARDINAL . In ORG opinion , there had to be a clear distinction between an allegation of fact on which fair comment could be based and an allegation which was solely a malicious manipulation of the facts . According to the case - law of ORG , a comment was justifiable only if it were fair and made bona fide . Thus , it could only be based on a fact that was proved to be true . In the present case , however , the facts alleged by the first CARDINAL applicants had not been proved . From the outset of the trial , rather , it had been demonstrated that public consultation had taken place .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the fourth applicant , as editor of the newspaper , had been aware of the controversy and believed that the comment of the first CARDINAL applicants had been justified . Finally , he had also agreed to publish a response from ORG to the article in issue .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG . They claimed that the first - instance court had made a wrong assessment of the facts and had applied the law incorrectly . In any event , the amount awarded to ORG in damages was excessive .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG confirmed ORG finding that the publication had been libellous and defamatory . However , it decided to reduce the amount of the damages to Lm CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG recalled that , as ORG was a public organ , the limits of acceptable criticism directed at its acts could be wider . However , the establishment , assessment and evaluation of facts were for the first - instance judge and , unless this evaluation was arbitrary or illogical , ORG would not interfere . In the present case , on the basis of the evidence before it , ORG found that the facts stated in the publication did not reflect the truth .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a constitutional complaint with ORG ( FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . They claimed that the publication in question was a legitimate criticism of local government action which was permissible in a NORP society . Thus , the obligation to pay damages imposed on them had infringed their right to freedom of expression , as guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants considered that their statements were part of their duty as elected councillors and that they had the right to inform the public about matters of public interest . They emphasised that the libel proceedings had not been instituted by a physical person but by a local council and that the article complained of had criticised a local government and its administrative actions . Therefore , no restrictions on their freedom of expression could be imposed .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicants ' claim .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that according to the case - law of ORG , the right to freedom of expression was not absolute . In particular , the exercise of this right carried with it duties and responsibilities , which were particularly important when it came to attacking the reputation of private individuals and undermining the rights of others . Journalists had to act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information .", "CARDINAL . ORG also highlighted the importance of the balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to reputation , honour and good name . In the present case , there was no doubt that the interference with the applicants ' right to freedom of expression had a legal basis in LAW of the laws of GPE . Furthermore , it was proportionate and necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights of others . ORG referred , in particular , to the fact that the amount of damages had been reduced and had been imposed as a result of civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . They claimed that ORG had failed to examine the merits of the case . As the article complained of had contained criticism of a local government , the opinions expressed in it should enjoy a higher level of protection . Furthermore , according to the applicants , a local government did not have a reputation which required protection . Thus , statements made against it could not be held to be defamatory and libellous . The applicants finally argued that all they had done was to express their opinion that the consultation about the HRP had not been satisfactory .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the judgments given by ORG and by ORG , ORG found that the law had been applied both effectively and correctly .", "CARDINAL . Although the applicants had not previously raised the plea that a local council could not be defamed , ORG addressed the matter . It stated that a local council could both defame and be defamed . Furthermore , ORG held that although the limits of acceptable criticism were wider with respect to governments , the attribution of false facts was not protected under LAW .", "CARDINAL .
