The applicant had inherited CARDINAL a mine producing fluoride , which on CARDINAL DATE was assessed by an inspector . According to LAW , minerals are owned by the ORG and may be assigned by the ORG to any person , in accordance with the provisions of the law . The main obligation of a mine owner is the exploitation of the mine ( Articles CARDINAL and s. ) . When the competent public service establishes that no exploitation or mining research is carried out in a mine in accordance with the provisions of the law , it forwards the pertinent particulars to ORG which , after hearing the concerned parties , decides on the forfeiture of the right of ownership ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG not to declare that he had forfeited his rights over the mine . He claimed that the mine \u2019s production had dropped because its exploitation had provisionally become unprofitable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared that the applicant and the other CARDINAL owners of the mine had forfeited their rights over it because they had remained idle during DATE , DATE . During that period there was a crisis in the market as opposed to complete lack of demand for the mineral in question , as the applicant had claimed . The applicant was not given any compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the CARDINAL other owners lodged an appeal ( \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u03ae ) against the decision of ORG before the first - instance administrative court ( ORG ) of GPE . They alleged that the ORG \u2019s decision did not contain adequate reasons . They pointed out in this connection that DATE the mine was not idle . Its production had simply fallen because there was a crisis in the fluoride market . They also alleged that the inspector \u2019s report of DATE , on which the ORG \u2019s decision was based , had not examined their claims . Finally , they alleged that the decision was unlawful because they should have been given DATE in which to exploit the mine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court rejected the appeal on the grounds that the mine had indeed remained idle , that it was up to the appellants to prove that there was a crisis in the market and that the fact that they had not been given an extra year was an irrelevant consideration under the relevant rules . This judgment was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the CARDINAL other owners appealed . A hearing was set down for DATE . On DATE , on the applicant \u2019s request , the hearing was postponed for CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On CARDINAL DATE it rejected the appeal considering , inter alia , that the crisis in the relevant market could not justify the idleness of the mine , as the report of CARDINAL DATE had wrongly accepted . The idleness could be justified only if there was no demand for the mineral in question whatsoever , a fact which the appellants did not prove . Finally , there was no obligation under the law for the authorities to grant the applicant DATE . This judgment was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the CARDINAL other persons appealed in cassation . At first , the hearing was set down for DATE but it was continuously postponed . A hearing was set down for DATE . On DATE , the applicant appeared before the court and announced that CARDINAL of the other appellants had died . The hearing was postponed and was finally held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal considering , inter alia , that it was for the lower courts to assess the report of CARDINAL DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
