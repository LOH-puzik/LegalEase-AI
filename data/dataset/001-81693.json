NORP The applicants\u2019 predecessor , Mr PERSON Do\u011fan , was the owner of a plot of land in PERSON . On DATE he filed an action with ORG against certain third persons , whom he claimed were unlawfully occupying his land . He requested that the allegedly unlawful interference be halted .", "CARDINAL . As cadastral work by the authorities started in the area in DATE , the court decided on CARDINAL DATE that it no longer had jurisdiction and transferred the case to a court with special jurisdiction in the subject , ORG ( PERSON ) in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The cadastral work divided the land into CARDINAL parcels , the ownership of which was separately disputed between the applicants\u2019 predecessor and the occupiers . In DATE , ORG joined all CARDINAL cases .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout the proceedings , the applicants\u2019 predecessor on the one hand maintained that the new plots corresponded to the single piece of land already registered in his name .

Until DATE , the judge sitting on the bench of the court was changed CARDINAL more times and the hearings were mainly devoted to the new judges\u2019 gaining familiarity with the dispute .", "CARDINAL . Despite the fact that the court scheduled an on - site inspection several times , it was deferred for various reasons , including the lack of the necessary court stamps in the court \u2019s registry to notify experts and witnesses , the parties\u2019 failure to pay certain fees , the applicants\u2019 failure to bring their witnesses to the inspection site , the parties\u2019 mutual failure to attend the inspection , the judge \u2019s DATE leave , the lack of pertinent witnesses , unsuitable weather conditions , the ailing condition of a local witness , the court \u2019s search for suitable new witnesses , the court \u2019s shortage of time due to its hearing backlog and , finally , the GPE disorderly behaviour and contempt of court .
