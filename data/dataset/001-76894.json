It found that all CARDINAL passages in issue depicted the applicant as a criminal or a person with a reprehensible lifestyle . However , given , inter alia , the great general interest in these statements in GPE , the court found that it had been justifiable to publish the relevant statements and pictures . It further considered that the newspapers had had a reasonable basis for the published information . In the latter respect , the court had regard to how and from whom the information had been obtained and to the fact that , due to the nature of the information in question and the constraints of a fast news service , the possibility of checking the veracity of the statements had been limited .", "CARDINAL .

The information has been liable to expose him to the contempt of others and consequently , as such , constitutes defamation .", "The question then is whether there are grounds for excluding liability . Pursuant to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of the Freedom of LAW , and chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW , liability for defamation by means of printed matter is excluded if CARDINAL conditions are met : CARDINAL ) it would be justifiable to communicate the information , and CARDINAL ) the information should be correct or the communicator should have had a reasonable basis for the assertion .", "If the information is correct it may as a rule be communicated even if it is deprecatory , if this is justifiable with reference to the public news interest . However , there is no general right always to speak the truth if the statements are offensive . A balance has to be struck between the protection against offensive statements and the demands of freedom of speech . In certain situations the interest of protecting someone against offensive statements has to yield to the public interest .", "PERSON has claimed that , on account of the public interest \u2013 the murder of the country \u2019s prime minister \u2013 , it was justifiable to name and show a photograph of PERSON in the newspaper . Aftonbladet , for its part , has asserted that , in the circumstances , it was justifiable to describe PERSON personality and conduct .", "The question of who killed PERSON attracted at the relevant time and still attracts considerable public interest . As regards the question of whether in the circumstances it was justifiable to communicate the information , ORG agrees with ORG assessment that it was obviously legitimate to write about the so - called \u201c GPE trail \u201d and to present information in this regard . However , the question is whether it was justified to identify the plaintiff by name and picture in the manner employed and to publish statements to the effect that he was supposed to be guilty of large scale , serious criminality .", "[ The responsible editors ] have asserted that the publications in question were not remarkable in view of the fact that it was commonly known who PERSON was and of which crimes he was guilty . It emerges from the information that has come to hand in the case that , within certain groups in southern LOC and LOC , it was known that PERSON had engaged in the alleged activities . It has also been shown that books have been published in which PERSON has been named and his service as an elite soldier in the army unit PERSON , which has a dubious reputation , has been described . The information in the case reveals that PERSON has been much better known than he has wished to admit in southern LOC and among representatives of various organisations for the protection of animals and the conservation of nature in southern LOC as well as in LOC . PERSON does not therefore appear as an ordinary private person with regard to whom there is a particular interest of protection .", "In view of the above , and for the reasons given by ORG in this respect , ORG finds that it was justifiable in the circumstances to publish PERSON name and picture in PERSON and to publish information about the person PERSON in GPE . In so finding , ORG has also taken into account that PERSON had declined to comment on information presented by the journalists of Aftonbladet .", "With respect to the question of whether the information is correct , it is word against word . PERSON has asserted that he is innocent of all the accusations , that the information given about him was based on pure invention , that it is unverified or given by untrustworthy persons and that it was based on third or fourth generation hearsay , while [ the responsible editors ] appear still to assert that it can not be excluded that PERSON could be the person who murdered PERSON . ORG concludes , however , that [ the responsible editors ] , who have the burden of proof for their claims , have not shown that the disseminated information was correct .", "As regards the question of whether there has been a reasonable basis for the assertions , ORG takes account of the following considerations .", "In defence of the publications in question , [ the responsible editors ] have asserted , among other things , that PERSON name and picture have been published in international news media and on NORP television .", "In response to what has been stated in this respect , ORG would point out that each newspaper is responsible for its own publication . Consequently , the fact that the name and picture of the plaintiff had already been published by other news services has not relieved PERSON and Aftonbladet of the obligation to make their own assessment of the credibility of the information . The fact that the information had already been published by other media shows , however , that these news services might have considered that there was a reasonable basis for the information .", "In their defence , [ the responsible editors ] have also pointed out that , despite time constraints , they had careful checks made which gave an unequivocal picture of PERSON .", "It has been established that the main basis for the assertions in issue in the case was the statements made by [ the former senior official of the NORP security police ] PERSON and that the newspapers checked that information mainly by having the journalists who wrote the articles contact journalist colleagues , public servants [ and ] representatives of various organisations for the protection of animals and the conservation of nature . However , with a few exceptions , the persons contacted have not been named .", "The contents of the testimony given by [ the CARDINAL journalist witnesses ] before ORG show that each of them separately has had high ambitions to find out the degree of truth of PERSON statements and to check with reliable sources who the person PERSON was . What has come to hand in the case reveals that the witnesses , each one through their own work , have received concordant information . Checks have been made with several informants in different countries and in different capacities . ...", "Having regard to the above , in particular the checks made , and to the fact that the informant PERSON also here [ before ORG ] has given the impression of being a credible person , ORG considers that the communication of the identifying information does not appear unjustified . In ORG view , there has been a reasonable basis for the assertion and the reproduction of the picture in PERSON . ORG further considers that PERSON , in the circumstances , must be considered to have performed the checks that were called for . Having regard to this and the reasons given with respect to the publication in PERSON , ORG finds that there was also a reasonable basis for the assertions in Aftonbladet . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
