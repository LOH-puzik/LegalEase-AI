GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . His last known place of residence in GPE was in PERSON . He was represented before the Court by Mr M .- O. Nordhorn , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On an unspecified date , the GPE prosecution authorities started an investigation against the applicant and several co - suspects on suspicion of drug trafficking .", "On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant \u2019s GPE apartment be searched . The ORG found that on the basis of information obtained by means of surveillance as well as telephone tapping in the course of preliminary proceedings ( ORG ) instituted against the applicant , there were grounds for suspecting that drugs , implements used for drug trafficking and consumption , as well as cash proceeds from drug deals were being stored in the applicant \u2019s GPE flat . The search warrant stated that in the course of the investigations a suspicion had arisen that co - suspect ( Mitbeschuldigter ) PERSON was storing and trafficking drugs for the applicant \u2019s benefit . According to the information provided in the search warrant , on DATE , PERSON had received a telephone call from the NORP town of GPE by an unidentified male person who had informed him in NORP that on DATE at TIME a \u201c friend \u201d would arrive at PERSON \u2019s domicile . On the occasion of a telephone conversation on DATE at TIME , PERSON informed the applicant that nobody had yet come by . Later that day the applicant informed PERSON over the phone that the said friend would arrive that TIME . At TIME received a further telephone call by an unidentified person informing him that due to an accident the latter was unable to drop by . TIME the applicant phoned PERSON to inquire about his \u201c uncle \u2019s \u201d arrival and the \u201c entrusted items \u201d and said he would return DATE . During a further telephone conversation on DATE , the applicant informed PERSON that a search had been carried out at the \u201c friends\u2019 \u201d place and that their arrival was not to be expected until DATE . The search warrant indicated that on the basis of the aforementioned telephone ORG content the court found that there were grounds for suspecting that the delivery of drugs and the applicant \u2019s return were imminent . Furthermore , through surveillance of the applicant it had been established that he had frequently stayed for extended periods in his GPE apartment and that on DATE he had travelled with his father by car to the NORP town of GPE , presumably with a view to initiating a drug deal .", "On DATE ORG issued an arrest warrant ordering the applicant \u2019s detention on remand on suspicion of having imported drugs , an offence punishable under LAW ( Bet\u00e4ubungsmittelgesetz ) . In the detention order , running to CARDINAL pages , ORG found that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant - acting jointly with co - suspects PERSON , NORP , and PERSON - had coordinated the importation and delivery of QUANTITY of marijuana by NORP and NORP to PERSON \u2019s home address by means of several telephone conversations with PERSON The strong suspicion of the applicant having committed the offence resulted from the seizure of the drugs on the occasion of the search of his GPE apartment , the witness statements of CARDINAL police officers who had been involved in the search as well as from the information obtained in the course of police surveillance and the preliminary proceedings . The court further found that there was a risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding in view of an expected prison sentence of DATE . Since considerable amounts of money had been seized from the co - suspects , it had to be assumed that the criminal gang disposed of sufficient financial means to enable the applicant to abscond . Furthermore , the latter maintained good connections abroad , in particular in GPE , where he was presumably staying at present .", "By written submissions dated DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel informed ORG office that he had been mandated by the applicant and requested to be granted access to the file in the preliminary proceedings instituted against the applicant . He reiterated his request by letter of DATE .", "On DATE ORG informed counsel that for the time being his request to inspect the files had to be refused pursuant to LAW domestic law \u201d below ) on the ground that the preliminary investigations were ongoing and disclosure of the files might jeopardise the purpose of the investigations .", "By written submissions dated DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel applied for a court decision pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW to LAW ( Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz zum Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz , ORG ) as to whether access to the files should be granted . He claimed that for the time being he had only obtained knowledge of the search warrant \u2019s content but that his inquiry with ORG as to whether a detention order had been issued against the applicant had been to no avail . He contended that where an arrest warrant was issued , the suspect would at least have to be granted the right to examine the part of the file providing information as to the reasons for his detention in order to be able to mount an effective defence .", "The application was dismissed by ORG as inadmissible by a decision of CARDINAL DATE . ORG held that according to LAW , pending the termination of the preliminary investigation , it was for ORG to decide whether to grant access to the files or not and that therefore a disciplinary complaint ( Dienstaufsichtsbeschwerde ) against ORG would be the only appropriate remedy in the case at hand . Relying in particular on a statement obtained from ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE , ORG further found that the charges brought against the applicant were clearly set out in the search warrant dated DATE and the applicant himself had confirmed that he was aware of the search warrant \u2019s content . There existed thus no particular circumstances that would require an exceptional quashing of the ORG \u2019s decision to refuse access to the file .", "By a letter dated DATE ORG informed the applicant that access to the file was still restricted in accordance with LAW and that such restriction would remain valid as long as the applicant was on the run .", "A further request by counsel to inspect the files dated DATE was rejected by ORG on DATE with similar reasoning .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a disciplinary complaint with ORG stating that the only information he had received so far with respect to the investigations was a copy of the search warrant of DATE as well as the detention order of CARDINAL DATE . While reiterating the grounds for his request set out in his written submissions to ORG of DATE , he argued in addition that there was no longer an indication that the purpose of the investigations would be jeopardised . This was in particular true in view of the fact that since ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE had passed , the proceedings against the applicant \u2019s cosuspects had meanwhile been terminated and that the applicant had been abroad for a considerable time , which excluded any danger of collusion ( PERSON ) on his part .", "The complaint was dismissed by ORG ( Generalstaatsanwaltschaft ) by a decision of DATE holding in particular that according to counsel \u2019s own submissions he had at his disposal a copy of ORG detention order of DATE and that the files revealed that he had discussed with the competent ORG on several occasions what impact a possible pleading to the charge ( ORG . There were thus still grounds to believe that giving him access to the file might put the preliminary investigations , which had not yet been terminated , at risk .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint of DATE against the aforementioned decisions of ORG , ORG and ORG on the ground that it was inadmissible and lacked any prospect of success . ORG held in particular that due to DATE that had elapsed since the last decision of ORG on DATE rejecting the applicant \u2019s request , as confirmed by ORG decision of DATE , the conditions underlying the impugned decisions might meanwhile have significantly changed in the course of the preliminary proceedings , which had now lasted for DATE . Under these circumstances the applicant was advised to pursue his objective by having recourse to the most effective and rapid remedy available , which in the case at hand would be a renewed request with the competent ORG to inspect the file . For this reason he lacked a legitimate interest ( Rechtsschutzbed\u00fcrfnis ) in having his constitutional complaint examined . In the event of a further refusal by ORG and following an unsuccessful disciplinary complaint , a renewed constitutional complaint could be considered .", "On DATE defence counsel lodged a further application with ORG for permission to inspect the file in the preliminary proceedings . By a letter dated DATE his request was again refused pursuant to LAW grounds that the investigations were ongoing and that the reasoning provided by ORG in his decision of DATE was still valid . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , referring to the reasoning in the decision of DATE and confirming that the preliminary proceedings had not yet been terminated , rejected the applicant \u2019s related disciplinary complaint as unfounded . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "By a decision of DATE the ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint lodged on DATE without providing reasons . The decision was served on the applicant on CARDINAL DATE .", "It appears that the applicant is still at large .", "LAW provides that defence counsel is entitled to consult the files and to inspect the exhibits which have been presented to the trial court or which would have to be presented to the trial court in the event of indictment . LAW of this provision provides that access to part or all of the file or to the exhibits may be refused until the preliminary investigation has ended if it might otherwise be put at risk . However , in the event that the accused is remanded in custody or , in the case of provisional arrest , pre - trial custody has been requested , information of relevance for the assessment of the lawfulness of that deprivation of liberty shall be made available to defence counsel in suitable form and , as a rule , access to the files shall be granted .", "Pending the termination of the preliminary investigations , it is for ORG to decide whether to grant access to the files or not ; thereafter the decision rests with the president of the trial court ( LAW ) . The Public Prosecutor shall revoke an order refusing to allow inspection of the files upon conclusion of the investigation at the latest . Defence counsel shall be notified as soon as he once again has the unrestricted right to inspect the files .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW to LAW ( Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz zum Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz , ORG ) the ordinary courts shall decide , upon request , on the lawfulness of directives , orders or other measures taken by the judicial authorities with a view to regulating individual issues in the sphere of , inter alia , criminal law . The same applies to directives , orders or other measures taken by the law enforcement authorities regarding the imposition of detention on remand .", "Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafprozessordnung ) concern detention on remand . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code , a defendant may be detained on remand if there is a strong suspicion that he has committed a criminal offence and if there are grounds for arresting him . Grounds for arrest will exist where certain facts warrant the conclusion that there is a risk of his absconding ( LAW no . CARDINAL ) or of collusion ( LAW no . CARDINAL ) .", "LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that detention on remand must be ordered by a judge in a written detention order . The detention order must identify the accused , and specify the offence of which he is strongly suspected , including the time and place of its commission , and the grounds for the arrest ( nos . CARDINAL of LAW ) . Moreover , the facts establishing the grounds for the strong suspicion that an offence has been committed and for the arrest must be set out in the detention order unless national security would thereby be endangered ( LAW no . CARDINAL ) .", "Pursuant to LAW an appeal may be lodged with the competent court by the defendant or defence counsel against a detention order that has not yet been executed with a view to having it quashed ( Haftbeschwerde ) .", "Pursuant to LAW , NORP law , in principle , does not allow for an in - absentia trial . A limited number of exceptions to this rule are notably laid down in sections CARDINAL et seq . A hearing may , in particular , be held in the defendant \u2019s absence in cases in which he has been summoned correctly and only a fine of CARDINAL \u201c DATE rates \u201d ( PERSON , a unit based on the average DATE net income of the offender ) is to be expected ( section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
