SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by PERSON , their Agent , who was succeeded in that function by PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant \u2019s parents were members of an agricultural cooperative in which they had included their agricultural land . The applicant who inherited their ownership title to that land was also a member .", "The cooperative underwent a transformation under ORG ( Law no . PERSON . \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) so as to make it compatible with the new economic system and legal order . Former members who did not become members of the transformed ORG , like the applicant , were entitled to compensation in respect of their membership interest . LAW contained no express provisions as to the form of such compensation .", "In DATE the applicant lodged a demand with the cooperative for compensation in respect of his membership interest under LAW . Despite promises , the demand has not been satisfied .", "On DATE the applicant brought an action against the cooperative in ORG ( ORG s\u00fad ) . He sought a judicial order for a determination of his membership interest . The cooperative then provided assurances that it would settle the claim voluntarily . In response , the applicant withdrew the action and , on DATE , the proceedings were discontinued .", "On DATE the applicant re - submitted his claim to ORG arguing that the cooperative had not honoured its pledge .", "On DATE an amendment ( Law no . PERSON . \u2013 \u201c the DATE amendment \u201d ) to LAW entered into force which introduced special provisions concerning the form of compensation to be provided in respect of membership in ORG . Former members who had not been compensated in another form were to be issued shares ( dru\u017estevn\u00e9 podielnick\u00e9 listy ) in the cooperative in question .", "On an unspecified date the applicant extended the action in that he also sought financial compensation for the use of his land by the cooperative . This claim was the subject of a friendly settlement and ORG approved the settlement on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant further extended the action by seeking compensation under LAW ( Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) in respect of among other things livestock ( \u017eiv\u00fd a m\u0155tvy invent\u00e1r \u2013 \u201c the stock \u201d ) brought into the cooperative . He also claimed interest for the late payment of the compensation sought .", "On DATE ORG ruled that the remaining claims , that is to say the claims for compensation for membership and for the stock , would be determined in a new set of proceedings which was at the same time opened under a different file number . In DATE the action was registered again under a new file number .", "The action was determined on DATE by ORG and , on appeal , on DATE by ORG ( Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad ) . The courts established the financial value of the applicant \u2019s membership interest in the cooperative and found that he fulfilled all the conditions for being compensated . As to the form of the compensation , they relied on the DATE amendment and ordered that the cooperative was to choose between granting the applicant agricultural equipment , issuing him shares or paying him an amount of money corresponding to the value of his interest . The applicant \u2019s membership interest in fact represented his rights in respect of the estate of the cooperative . Although it could be settled in several ways , a share in the cooperative was the most appropriate way of compensating him for that interest . The nature of this claim was not financial and , therefore , no late payment interest could be imposed . The courts further established the financial value of the stock and ordered that the cooperative pay the relevant amount plus late payment interest to the applicant . The matter became res iudicata on DATE .", "The applicant filed a petition for judicial enforcement of the above judgments . The enforcement commenced but was subsequently stayed on the defendant \u2019s appeal on the ground that the judgments had been challenged by way of an extraordinary remedy ( see below ) .", "On DATE the Prosecutor General acceded to the defendant \u2019s request and exercised his discretionary power to challenge the judgments of DATE and DATE by means of an extraordinary appeal on points of law ( mimoriadne dovolanie ) on the defendant \u2019s behalf .", "On DATE ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) dismissed ORG appeal . Its judgment was final .", "The applicant then unsuccessfully sought the reopening of the proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
