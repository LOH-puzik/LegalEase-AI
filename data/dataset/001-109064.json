The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is currently detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was held in custody . It does not result from the case - file whether the applicant remains detained in this set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder , attempted robbery and drug trafficking committed in an organised criminal group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) remanded him in custody , relying on a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question . The court indicated that the evidence which had been gathered in the case , in particular the testimonies of witnesses and other suspects , showed that there was a sufficient probability that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged . It attached importance to the risk that he would attempt to induce witnesses to give false testimony or , by other means , would obstruct the proceedings . The latter risk was considered of the utmost importance in the light of the fact that the case involved a large number of alleged accomplices .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicant against the detention order , likewise his further appeals against decisions extending his detention and all of his subsequent , numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him , were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the investigation , the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was extended on several occasions , namely , on DATE ( to CARDINAL October CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to DATE ) , DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) and CARDINAL DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) . In their decisions , the courts stressed the fact that the applicant had been acting in an organised criminal group . They underlined the unique nature of the proceedings involving organised crime , in which the authorities had to determine the degree of alleged responsibility of each of the suspects . The courts attached importance to the seriousness of the charges and the likelihood of a severe sentence being imposed on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to extend the applicant \u2019s detention . It stated that the applicant had been held in pretrial detention since DATE and that this period should have been sufficient for the authorities to collect evidence in the applicant \u2019s case . In addition , it considered that the decision about the extension of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention beyond DATE should be taken by ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor lodged an interlocutory appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended the contested decision and extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention to CARDINAL DATE . The court argued that as the applicant was remanded in custody in the first set of criminal proceedings , his detention in the second set of proceedings was merely administrative . It further stated that the applicant was charged with serious offences committed in an organised criminal group and that there was a high risk that , if released , he would attempt to induce witnesses to give false testimony or , by other means , would obstruct the proceedings . Finally , the court observed that the Prosecutor could not have completed the investigation as evidence in proceedings involving organised crime often emerged gradually .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the Prosecutor requested ORG to extend the applicant \u2019s detention to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention to DATE . The court observed that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention had been extended for over DATE almost automatically and it did not seem that the investigation was reaching its final stage . It concluded that the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention for a shorter period than was requested by the ORG should prompt the authorities to accelerate the acts of investigation regarding the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against this decision claiming that he had been detained for DATE and that this period should have been sufficient for completing the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the contested decision . It stated that the decision about the extension of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention beyond the period of one year should be taken by ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court underlined the complexity of the case and the severity of the penalty to which the applicant was liable . Having regard to the organised character of the alleged criminal activities , it also held that the applicant \u2019s detention was necessary in order to prevent the applicant from interfering with the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor lodged an interlocutory appeal against this decision claiming that DATE would not be sufficient for collecting evidence in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG modified the contested decision and extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court observed that the applicant\u2019", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bill of indictment was lodged with ORG . The applicant was charged with murder , attempted robbery and drug trafficking committed in an organised criminal group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention to DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the case was referred to the PERSON ORG .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions the PERSON ORG applied to ORG , asking for the applicant \u2019s detention to be extended . ORG allowed all those requests extending the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention on DATE ( to DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) , DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to CARDINAL October CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) and CARDINAL DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
