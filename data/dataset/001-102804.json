The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants distributed CARDINAL - page folded pamphlets to passers - by in front of a GPE medical centre . The front page contained the following text :", "\u201c ' Killing specialist ' for unborn children Dr. PERSON [ is ] on the premises of the Northern medical centre , GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The middle pages contained information on the development of the human foetus and about abortion techniques . It further contained the appeals :", "\u201c Please support our struggle against the unpunished killing of unborn children \u201d", "and", "\u201c Therefore : No to abortion \u201d", "The verso read as follows :", "\u201c Support our protest and our work . Help to ensure that the Fifth Commandment \u201c Thou shall not kill \u201d and LAW are in future respected by all doctors in GPE !", "Stop the murder of children in their mother 's womb on the premises of the Northern medical centre .", "then : Holocaust", "DATE : Babycaust", "( damals : Holocaust heute : Babycaust )", "Whoever remains silent becomes guilty too ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . The pamphlet bore the name and address of the second applicant as the person legally responsible for its content .", "CARDINAL . On behalf of the medical centre and PERSON , GPE brought criminal charges against the applicants for defamation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) acquitted the applicants on the grounds that their action was justified under section CARDINAL of LAW ( Strafgesetzbuch , see Relevant domestic law below ) . According to ORG , the dissemination of the pamphlets was covered by the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by LAW , since the pamphlet , taken as a whole , was not intended to debase PERSON or the medical centre , but to express the applicants ' general rejection of the performance of abortions . ORG noted that the applicants considered the number of abortions performed in GPE to be crimes which were as abhorrent as the Holocaust . It was not up to the court to evaluate this statement , which was covered by the right to freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . Following an examination of the statements contained in the pamphlet , ORG considered that the applicant 's right to freedom of expression had to prevail over the doctor 's interest in the protection of his personal honour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Nuremberg - ORG ( Landgericht ) quashed ORG judgment and convicted the applicants of defamation to the detriment of the medical centre and of PERSON considered that the statement \u201c then : Holocaust / DATE : Babycaust \u201d , seen in the context of the other statements made in the pamphlet , had to be interpreted as putting the lawful activity performed by PERSON on a level with the Holocaust , a synonym for the most abhorrent and unjustifiable crimes against humanity . According to ORG , this statement was not covered by the applicants ' right to freedom of expression , as it debased the doctor in a way which had not been necessary in order to express the applicants ' opinion . While expressions of opinion which related to questions of public interest enjoyed a higher degree of protection than those relating to purely private interests , it had to be taken into account if and to which extent the person addressed had participated in the public debate . Furthermore , it had to be considered if the person expressing his thoughts could be at least expected to replace his statement by a statement which was less detrimental to the other person 's honour . Applying these principles , ORG considered that the applicants had failed sufficiently to take into account the doctor 's interests . It had to be conceded that the applicants , as anti - abortion activists , had a political aim which they were allowed to pursue even by use of exaggerated and polemic criticism . However , by putting the doctor 's legal actions on one level with the arbitrary killings of human beings performed by a regime of injustice , the applicants literally qualified him as a mass murderer . According to ORG , this statement amounted to unjustifiable abusive insult ( Schm\u00e4hkritik ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that the other statements contained in the pamphlet were covered by the applicants ' right to freedom of expression and had to be accepted . Having regard to all the factors of the case , ORG considered it appropriate to impose CARDINAL DATE fines of MONEY ( ORG ) each on the first applicant and CARDINAL DATE fines of CARDINAL ORG each on the second applicant , as the person having assumed legal responsibility for the pamphlet 's content .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) rejected the applicants ' appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged complaints with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , quashed ORG judgment insofar as the applicants had been convicted of defamation to the detriment of the medical centre and dismissed the remainder of the applicants ' complaints .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered , at the outset , that the criminal courts , when interpreting and applying the criminal law , had to respect the limits imposed by the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by LAW . The court further considered that ORG had respected these principles .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the applicants had not confined themselves generally to criticising the performance of abortions DATE which they remained free to do \u2013 but had directed their statements directly against PERSON It was clear from the overall context that the incriminated statement referred to PERSON , who was expressly mentioned on the front page . ORG further noted that the lower courts had assumed that the impugned statement put the doctor 's professional activities on the same level as the Holocaust . It further observed that ORG , in separate proceedings referring to the same pamphlet , assumed that the statement was meant to express the opinion that the abortions performed by the doctor amounted to mass homicide . However , this interpretation of the statement , which also contained the Holocaust reference , also contained a serious interference with the doctor 's personality rights .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further considered that the statement seriously infringed the doctor 's personality rights . While the applicants ' statement did not qualify as abusive insult , ORG decision was not objectionable as that court had duly weighed the conflicting interests \u2013 that is , the applicants ' right to freedom of expression and the doctor 's personality rights . In particular , ORG had taken into account that the doctor had practised within the framework of the law and had not actively participated in the public debate on abortion . Furthermore , the applicants could have been reasonably expected to express their general criticism without the serious violation of the doctor 's personality rights . This decision was served on the applicants ' counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following remittal , re - assessed the fines imposed as a penalty for defamation to the doctor 's detriment . On DATE ORG quashed this judgment and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG re - assessed the sentences and imposed CARDINAL DATE fines of CARDINAL ORG each on the first applicant and CARDINAL DATE fines of CARDINAL ORG each on the second applicant , thereby taking into account the second applicant 's previous convictions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL .

On CARDINAL DATE ORG , in separate proceedings , rejected the GPE clinic 's civil action for an injunction against the applicants to desist from further distributing the pamphlet which forms the subject matter of the proceedings before the ORG . ORG interpreted the statement \u201c then : Holocaust / DATE : Babycaust \u201d as expressing the opinion that the performance of abortions constituted a reprehensible mass killing of human life . ORG further considered that , in the context of the public debate on the fundamental question of the protection of unborn life , the clinic had to accept the applicants ' expression of opinion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in different proceedings ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , confirmed its previous case - law that , in examining criminal or civil law sanctions for expressions of opinion which were made in the past , the right to freedom of expression was violated if , in case of an ambiguous statement , the courts based their considerations on the meaning leading to a conviction , without having previously ruled out other possible meanings which could not justify the sanction .
