The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . They live in GPE and GPE respectively .", "CARDINAL . The applicants inherited plots of building land , located at PERSON and entered in the land register as folio CARDINAL , parcels CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , and folio CARDINAL , parcels CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL respectively . Each of the applicants has a holding of CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By a decree of the \u201c Bank for the LOC \u201d ( ORG ) of DATE and CARDINAL decrees by the President of ORG of CARDINAL and DATE , a project to build low - rent housing and leisure structures on the applicants ' land was approved .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL decrees , adopted on DATE and CARDINAL May and DATE respectively , the President of ORG authorised possession under the expedited procedure of part of the applicants ' land , namely QUANTITY , for a maximum period of DATE , with a view to its expropriation , in order to begin construction of the low - rent housing and leisure structures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE the authorities took physical possession of the applicants ' land .", "CARDINAL . By a writ served on DATE , the applicants brought an action for damages before ORG against GPE .", "CARDINAL . They alleged that the occupation of the land was illegal and that the construction work had been completed without there having been a formal expropriation of the land and payment of compensation . They claimed a sum corresponding to the market value of the land and a sum for loss of enjoyment of the land .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings an expert report and an additional report were submitted to the court registry on DATE and DATE respectively . According to the expert , a first section of the land had been irreversibly altered in DATE , and a second section in DATE , through the public works performed . The total market value of the occupied land in DATE and DATE was MONEY ( ORG ) , or ITL CARDINAL for each applicant . The expert assessed the compensation for possession of the land at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL , or ITL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL per applicant .", "CARDINAL . By a provisional judgment of DATE , ORG declared that the possession of the land , initially authorised , had become illegal as of DATE and DATE . It found that the land had been irreversibly transformed by the public works . As a result , in accordance with the constructive expropriation rule ( occupazione acquisitiva ) , the applicants had been deprived of their property , by virtue of its irreversible alteration , on the date on which the possession had ceased to be legal . In the light of those considerations , the court ordered the municipality to pay , as an advance , a sum equal to PERCENT of the market value of the land , namely ITL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL for each applicant , plus interest and adjustment for inflation , and compensation for occupation amounting to ITL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL for each applicant .", "CARDINAL . In the same judgment , the court ordered that the proceedings be continued in order to recalculate the final sum to be awarded to the applicants under PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE , which had entered into force in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipality paid the applicants the amounts due in application of the provisional judgment of DATE . Tax , at a rate of PERCENT , was deducted at source from these sums .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment filed with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , the PERSON court upheld its provisional judgment of DATE and held that the amount of compensation calculated under PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE corresponded to the amount already paid in application of the provisional judgment .", "CARDINAL . This final judgment became legal and binding on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under NORP law , the expedited expropriation procedure enables the authorities to occupy land and build on it before the official expropriation . Once a scheme has been declared to be in the public interest and the plans adopted , the authorities may make an expedited possession order , for a limited period not exceeding DATE , in respect of the land to be expropriated ( section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) . The order will lapse if physical possession of the land is not taken within DATE after its issue . Before the end of the authorised period of occupation , a formal expropriation order must be made .", "CARDINAL . The authorised occupation of land provides the right to compensation for occupation . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG recognised an immediate right of access to a court for the purpose of claiming compensation for occupation as soon as physical possession of the land occurs , without having to wait for a compensation offer from the authorities .", "CARDINAL . During DATE a number of local authorities took possession of land using the expedited procedure but failed subsequently to issue an expropriation order . The NORP courts were confronted with cases in which the landowner had de facto lost use of the land as it had been possessed and building works in the public interest had been undertaken . The question arose whether the mere fact that works had been carried out meant that the owner had also lost title to the land .", "CARDINAL . There was a substantial divergence in the decisions of ORG over the effects of carrying out building works in the public interest on land where possession had been taken unlawfully . Unlawful possession means possession that is unlawful from the start , in other words obtained without authority , or that is initially authorised but subsequently became unlawful , either because the authority is quashed or because possession continues beyond the authorised period without an expropriation order being made .", "CARDINAL . Under CARDINAL line of case - law , the owner of land that had been possessed by the authorities did not lose ownership after the completion of the works in the public interest . However , he could not request reinstatement of the land ; his only remedy was to bring an action in damages for wrongful possession . No limitation period applied to such actions as the unlawful nature of the possession was continuing . The authorities could at any time issue a formal expropriation order . If they did so , the action in damages was transformed into a dispute over the compensation for expropriation , with damages for the loss of enjoyment of the land being due only for the period prior to the making of the expropriation order ( see , among other authorities , the judgments of ORG nos . CARDINAL of DATE ; CARDINAL of DATE ; and DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Under a second line , the landowner did not lose property in the land and could request its reinstatement if the authorities had acted other than in the public interest ( see , for example , ORG judgments nos . CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Under a third line , an owner dispossessed by the authorities automatically lost title to the land as soon as it had been altered irreversibly , that is to say on completion of the works in the public interest . He was PERSON entitled to claim damages ( see Court of Cassation judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , resolved the conflict between the lines of case - law and adopted the third solution . In so doing , it established the constructive - expropriation rule ( accessione invertita or occupazione acquisitiva ) . Under the rule , the public authorities acquire title to the land from the outset before formal expropriation if , after taking possession of the land and irrespective of whether such possession is lawful , the works in the public interest are performed . If , initially , the land is possessed without authority , the transfer of property takes place when the works in the public interest are completed . If the taking of possession was authorised from the outset , property is transferred on the expiry of the authorised period of possession . In the same judgment , ORG stated that , on a constructive expropriation , the owner is entitled to compensation in full as the acquisition of the land has taken place without title ( sine titulo ) . However , compensation is not paid automatically : the owner must lodge a claim for damages . In addition , the right to compensation is subject to a DATE limitation period that applies to actions in tort ; the starting - point is the date the land is irreversibly altered .", "CARDINAL . Initially , it was held that no limitation period applied , since possession of the land without title was a continuing unlawful act ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In its judgment no . DATE , ORG stated that the right to compensation was subject to a DATE limitation period ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Subsequently , ORG said that a DATE limitation period should apply ( judgment nos . DATE ) . On CARDINAL DATE the full court of ORG decided the issue finally , holding that the limitation period is DATE and starts to run from the date the land is irreversibly altered .", "CARDINAL . In this judgment , ORG held that the constructive expropriation rule was compatible with LAW in so far as the rule was rooted in a legislative provision , namely section DATE of the Civil Code governing claims in tort . Under this judgment , the fact that the authorities had become owners of the land by taking advantage of their own unlawful conduct did not pose any difficulty under LAW , since the public interest in the preservation of works for the public good outweighed the individual 's interest , and therefore the latter 's interest in the right of property . ORG held that the application of the DATE limitation period laid down by LAW for claims in tort to actions for compensation was compatible with the LAW .", "CARDINAL . Recent developments in the case - law show that the mechanism whereby carrying out building works in the public interest operates to transfer property in the land to the authorities is subject to exceptions .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , the PERSON stated that there was no constructive expropriation where resolutions of the authorities and an expedited possession order had been quashed by the administrative courts , as otherwise the judicial decision would be devoid of purpose .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , said that the authorities did not acquire ownership of the land if their resolutions and the declaration that expropriation was in the public interest were deemed to have been null and void from the outset . In such cases , the owner retained title to the land and could claim restitutio in integrum . In the alternative , he could seek damages . The unlawful nature of the possession in such cases was continuing and no limitation period applied .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , said that there was no transfer of property where the declaration that expropriation was in the public interest had been annulled by the administrative courts . In such cases , therefore , the constructive - expropriation rule did not apply . The owner , who retained ownership of the land , was entitled to claim restitutio in integrum . If he brought an action in damages , that entailed a waiver of his right to restitution . The DATE limitation period started to run from DATE when the decision of the administrative court became final .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG followed the decision of the full court and held that there was no transfer of property by constructive expropriation where the declaration that the building works were in the public interest was deemed to have been invalid from the outset .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , reaffirmed that there was no transfer of property in the absence of a valid declaration that expropriation was in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . This case - law should be compared with Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) and with LAW , which entered into force on DATE ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW of this PERSON provides :", "\u201c Any person who owns land which is used for the construction of public buildings or social housing shall be entitled to compensation for damage sustained where the expropriation has been declared unlawful by a court decision which has become final , but such person may not claim restitution of his property . Further , such a person is entitled , in addition to compensation for damage , to sums payable in respect of monetary depreciation and to any other sums mentioned in LAW , such amounts being calculated from the date of the unlawful taking of possession . \u201d", "DATE . Interpreting section CARDINAL of the DATE Law , ORG stated in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c In the impugned provision , the legislature has given preference , as between the owner 's interest in obtaining restitution of his unlawfully - expropriated land , and the public interest - in this case the allocation of such land for building public , low cost or subsidised housing - to this latter interest . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under ORG DATE case - law on constructive expropriations , compensation in full , in the form of damages for the deprivation of the land , was due to the owner in consideration for the loss of ownership caused by the unlawful taking of possession .", "CARDINAL . LAW of DATE ( LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ) superseded that case - law by providing that the compensation payable on constructive expropriations could not exceed the amount due on formal expropriations . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG declared that provision unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . Under Finance Law no . CARDINAL of DATE , which amended the provision that had been declared unconstitutional , compensation in full can not be awarded for dispossessions effected before DATE . In such cases , the compensation is equivalent to the amount of compensation as would have been payable on a formal expropriation in the most favourable scenario for the owner , plus PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG held that such compensation was compatible with LAW . However , in the same decision , it held that compensation in full , up to the market value of the land , could be claimed where the dispossession and deprivation of the land had not been in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . In judgments nos . DATE and DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , again addressed the question of the constructive expropriation rule , with reference to the above CARDINAL judgments of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In view of the finding of a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL in the above cases , ORG affirmed that the constructive expropriation rule played an important role in the context of the NORP legal system and that it was compatible with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . More specifically , ORG \u2013 after analysing the history of the constructive expropriation rule \u2013 held that in view of the uniformity of the case - law in this area , the constructive expropriation rule should be regarded as entirely \u201c foreseeable \u201d as of DATE . For this reason , constructive expropriation must be considered as complying with the lawfulness requirement . ORG stated that possession of land having taken place without a declaration that it was in the public interest was not capable of transferring title to the ORG . As to compensation , it stated that , even if such compensation was lower than the damage sustained by the claimant , and , in particular , lower than the value of the land , the compensation due in the event of constructive expropriation was sufficient to guarantee a \u201c fair balance \u201d between the demands of the general interest of society and the requirements of the protection of the individual 's fundamental rights .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal seeking enforcement of a final judicial decision setting aside the declaration of public interest with regard to expropriation proceedings , and in view of the claimant 's request to obtain restitution of land that had in the meantime been occupied and altered , the Consiglio di Stato , in judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , delivered in plenary session , ruled on whether the irreversible alteration of the said land following the construction of \u201c public \u201d works could constitute a legal reason preventing restitution of the land . The PERSON answered this question in the negative . In so doing , it :", "( a ) acknowledged that the case - law rule on constructive expropriation was lacking in respect of the need for legal certainty , with regard , inter alia , to the issue of identifying the date on which the public works must be considered \u201c completed \u201d and therefore on what date title had been transferred to the ORG ;", "( b ) welcomed the ORG 's case - law , particularly the judgment in ORG v. GPE , by affirming that , faced with a request for restitution of property that had been unlawfully occupied and altered , the work performed by the public authorities can not , as such , constitute an absolute obstacle to restitution ;", "( c ) interpreted LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) to mean that failure to return a plot of land could only be accepted in exceptional cases , namely where the authorities invoked a particularly strong public interest in the preservation of the construction in question ;", "( d ) affirmed , in this context , that constructive expropriation could not be regarded as an alternative ( \u201c una mera alternative \u201d ) to duly conducted expropriation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , amended by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , and which governs expropriation proceedings , entered into force . It codifies the existing provisions and case - law in this area . In particular , it codifies the constructive expropriation rule . From its entry into force , the Code , which does not apply to cases of occupation which occurred prior to DATE and is not therefore applicable to the instant case , superseded all previous legislation and case - law in the field of expropriation .", "DATE . LAW provides that , in the absence of an expropriation order , or in the absence of a declaration stating that the expropriation is in the public interest , land that has been altered following the construction of public works passes into the ownership of the authorities which altered it ; damages are paid in consideration . The authorities may acquire a property even where the town planning documents or the declaration that the expropriation is in the public interest have been set aside . The owner may apply to the court for restitution of the land . The authorities in question may object . Where the court decides not to order restitution of the land , the owner is entitled to compensation .", "CARDINAL . In their observations on the merits , the ORG raised an objection , composed of CARDINAL limbs , that the application was out of time .", "CARDINAL . As to the first limb , the Government argued that the application was out of time in so far as it was lodged DATE after DATE , namely the date on which ORG provisional judgment of DATE became final .", "CARDINAL . The Government alleged that , through that judgment , ORG had decided on the issues concerning the transfer of ownership and the amount of compensation , calculated on the basis of the market value of the land .", "CARDINAL . In consequence , that judgment was the \u201c final domestic decision \u201d from which the DATE deadline laid down in LAW began to run .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the second limb , the ORG argued that the application had been introduced out of time in that the applicants complained that the amount of compensation had been calculated within the meaning of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE . According to the ORG , the DATE time - limit laid down by LAW had begun to run either on DATE , the date on which that PERSON entered into force , or on the date on which ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , by which the highest court had upheld the lawfulness of the provision in question , had been filed with the registry . In support of its allegations , the Government referred to the case of GPE v. GPE ( GPE v. GPE , ( dec . ) , no . PERSON , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants opposed the ORG 's objection . With regard to the second limb , they noted in particular that the ORG had already rejected similar objections in several decisions on admissibility ( they cited , among other authorities , PERSON , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ( dec . ) , CARDINAL DATE ; ORG and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ( dec . ) , DATE ; and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ( dec . ) , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the first limb of the objection , the ORG notes that it has already been rejected in its decision of DATE on the admissibility and that the Government were basing their objection on arguments that were not such as to call into question its decision on admissibility . In consequence , this limb can not be accepted .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the second limb of the objection , the ORG would recall that , according to LAW , \u201c any plea of inadmissibility must , in so far as its character and the circumstances permit , be raised by the respondent ORG in its written or oral observations on the admissibility of the application ... \u201d . The evidence before the ORG shows that that condition has not been satisfied in the instant case . The Government are consequently estopped from raising this objection . In the light of these considerations , the ORG considers that the second limb of the objection must be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The applicants alleged that they had been deprived of their land as a result of its occupation in the absence of an expropriation order and compensation . In their opinion , this situation had infringed their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions , as guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL , which provides :", "\u201c Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions . No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law .", "The preceding provisions shall not , however , in any way impair the right of a ORG to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Referring to the judgments in LOC and GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-VI ) and PERSON . v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG ) , the applicants noted that the application of the constructive - expropriation rule to their case did not comply with the principle of the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . NORP In this regard , the applicants pointed out that the land in question had been occupied and altered without the adoption of an expropriation order . It was only because they had brought proceedings for damages before the domestic courts that they had been able to obtain a judicial decision declaring the occupation unlawful , a decision which had simultaneously had the effect of declaring them retrospectively deprived of their property .", "CARDINAL . With regard to compensation , for which the onus was also on the landowner to submit a claim , the applicants argued that it had not been capable of making good the unlawful act , as the amount awarded was far lower than the damage sustained .", "CARDINAL . The Government observed that the applicants had been deprived of their property by virtue of constructive expropriation , which implied that the expropriation procedure was based on a declaration stating that expropriation was in the public interest but had not been implemented as provided for by law , in that the possession of the land had taken place without the appropriate order and no expropriation order had been adopted .", "CARDINAL . In the absence of such an expropriation order , the applicants had in any event been deprived of their property through the construction of the works in the public interest and the irreversible alteration of the land entailed by it . According to the Government , this deprivation of property was merely the consequence of the constructive - expropriation rule as applied by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government alleged that this situation was in compliance with LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , the public interest was involved , something that was not disputed by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . Second , the deprivation of property that resulted from constructive expropriation was \u201c provided for by law \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In this connection , the Government pointed out that , in PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Reports CARDINAL ) the ORG examined a case of constructive expropriation that came within the scope of law no . CARDINAL of DATE from the point of view of a fair balance , and held , with regard to the law as such , that \u201c the legislature might reasonably choose to give preference to the interests of the community in cases of unlawful expropriation or occupation of land . Full compensation for the damage sustained by the proprietors concerned constitutes sufficient reparation \u201d ( PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) .", "DATE . The Government noted that the ORG 's case - law had subsequently evolved , in that , in the next CARDINAL cases concerning constructive expropriation , it had found that the mechanism of constructive expropriation was incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness ( they referred to LOC and GPE , cited above , and ORG srl , cited above ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the constructive - expropriation rule should be considered as \u201c provided for by law \u201d , even if it had been developed through case - law in a \u201c civil - law \u201d rather than a \u201c common - law \u201d country .", "CARDINAL . In this regard , they noted that , in the CARDINAL judgments cited above , the ORG did not consider it necessary to decide in the abstract whether the role in the continental - law system of a rule , such as the constructive - expropriation rule , established by the courts is comparable to that of statutory provisions ( PERSON and GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . ORG had observed that the NORP case - law had evolved and that a case - law rule did not bind the courts as regards its application ( PERSON and GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government alleged that determining the role of case - law in GPE was of great importance in this type of case . According to the Government , as the national case - law had created the constructive - expropriation rule , this rule should be considered as forming part of the positive law starting from ORG judgment no . DATE . Subsequent case - law had confirmed this rule and clarified certain aspects of its application . In addition , the rule had been recognised by PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE and by LAW no . DATE .", "DATE . In conclusion , the Government submitted that , as of DATE , the rules governing constructive expropriation were perfectly clear and accessible to all owners of land .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the quality of the law , the ORG asked the ORG to revert to its \u201c PERSON case - law \u201d and to consider that the mechanism of constructive expropriation , based on a court declaration finding unlawfulness , was compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In this respect , the Government noted that the finding of unlawfulness by a court was the determining factor in the transfer of illegally occupied land into public ownership .", "CARDINAL . The Government defined constructive expropriation as the result of a systematic interpretation of the existing rules , intended to ensure that the general interest prevailed over the individual interest where public works had been performed ( alteration of the land ) and were in the public interest .", "DATE . The authorities were obliged to compensate individuals . According to the Government , however , this compensation could be lower than the damage sustained by the claimant , and , in particular , lower than the value of the land , given that constructive expropriation met a collective interest and the unlawful act committed by the authorities concerned only the form , namely failure to follow the rules governing administrative proceedings . In addition , the Government noted that the compensation as capped by Law no . CARDINAL of DATE was in any event higher than that which would have been payable had the expropriation been carried out in due form .", "CARDINAL . In the light of these considerations , the Government concluded that the fair balance had been struck .", "DATE . ORG reiterates that , in determining whether there has been a deprivation of possessions , it is necessary not only to consider whether there has been a formal taking or expropriation of property but to look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of . Since the ORG is intended to safeguard rights that are \u201c practical and effective \u201d , it has to be ascertained whether the situation complained of amounted to a de facto confiscation ( see PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG notes that , in applying the constructive expropriation rule , ORG considered the applicants as having been deprived of their property from the moment that the occupation of the land was no longer legal . In the absence of a formal expropriation order , the finding of unlawfulness by the court is the element which enshrines the transfer of the occupied property into public ownership . In those circumstances , the ORG concludes that ORG final judgment had the effect of depriving the applicants of their property within the meaning of the second sentence of LAW ( see PERSON and GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VII ) .", "CARDINAL . In order to be compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL , such interference must be \u201c in the public interest \u201d , \u201c subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law \u201d and must strike a \u201c fair balance \u201d between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual 's fundamental rights ( see PERSON and PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , the issue of whether a fair balance has been struck \u201c becomes relevant only once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary \u201d ( see PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 MONEY , ECHR DATE , and ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-I ) .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the ORG does not consider it appropriate to base its decision solely on the finding that the applicants did not receive full compensation ( see PERSON and GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The first and most important requirement of LAW No . CARDINAL is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful . The rule of law , CARDINAL of the fundamental principles of a democratic society , is inherent in all Articles of the Convention ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) . The principle of lawfulness presupposes that the provisions of domestic law are sufficiently accessible , precise and foreseeable in their application ( see PERSON v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , and PERSON and PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "DATE . In the judgments ORG srl and PERSON and GPE , cited above , the ORG did not consider it necessary to decide in the abstract whether the role in the continental - law system of a rule , such as the constructive - expropriation rule , established by the courts is comparable to that of statutory provisions , as what counted \u2013 in any event \u2013 was that the legal basis met the criteria of accessibility , precision and foreseeability set out above . The ORG remains convinced that the existence as such of a legal basis is not sufficient to satisfy the principle of lawfulness and considers it useful to examine the issue of the quality of the law .", "CARDINAL . ORG takes note of the evolution of the case - law which has led to the development of the constructive - expropriation rule . It also notes that this rule has been transposed into legislation , such as Law no . CARDINAL of DATE , PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE and , most recently , LAW . Nonetheless , the ORG does not overlook the fact that the rule has been applied inconsistently in the case - law . Indeed , this was the view of the PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which , in its judgment no . DATE , adopted as a full court , recognised that the case - law 's constructive - expropriation rule had never given rise to stable , complete and foreseeable regulations .", "CARDINAL . ORG also notes inconsistencies between the case - law and the above - mentioned legislation . By way of example , the ORG notes that , whilst it is true that the case - law ruled out , from DATE , the application of constructive expropriation where the declaration that expropriation was in the public interest had been set aside , it is also true that LAW only recently provided that , in the absence of such a declaration , any land may enter into public ownership if a court decides not to order restitution of land that has been occupied and altered by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . In view of these factors , the ORG does not rule out the continuing possibility of an unforeseeable or arbitrary result for the individuals concerned .", "CARDINAL . ORG further notes that the constructive expropriation mechanism generally enables the authorities to bypass the rules governing expropriation , with the risk of an unforeseeable or arbitrary result for the owners concerned , irrespective of whether the unlawful nature of the situation existed from the outset or subsequently emerges . In any event , constructive expropriation is intended to confirm a de facto situation arising from unlawful acts committed by the authorities and to deal with the consequences for the owner and the authorities in the latter 's favour . Whether occurring by virtue of a case - law rule or a legislative text such as LAW of LAW , constructive expropriation can not therefore constitute an alterative to expropriation in due form ( see , on this point too , the PERSON position , paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In this regard , the ORG notes that constructive expropriation enables the authorities to occupy a plot of land and to alter it irreversibly , with the result that it is considered as having entered into public ownership , without the adoption of a formal act declaring that transfer of ownership . In the absence of an act formalising the expropriation , adopted at the latest when the owner has lost all control of his or her property , the element enabling the occupied property to be transferred into public ownership and to achieve legal certainty is the finding of unlawfulness by a court , which is equivalent to a declaration of transfer of title . It is for the landowner concerned \u2013 who continues to be the formal owner DATE to apply to the competent court for a decision finding , where appropriate , unlawfulness accompanied by the performance of works in the public interest , the necessary preconditions for the owner to be declared retroactively deprived of his or her property .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above , the ORG considers that the mechanism of constructive expropriation is not capable of ensuring a sufficient degree of legal certainty .", "CARDINAL . ORG further notes that constructive expropriation also enables the authorities to occupy and alter land without simultaneously paying compensation . Compensation must be claimed by the landowner concerned within a DATE limitation period , which begins to run from the date on which the court finds that the irreversible alteration of the land took place . This may lead to adverse effects for the persons concerned , and render futile any hope of compensation ( see PERSON and GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court notes that the constructive - expropriation rule enables the authorities to derive a benefit from their unlawful conduct , and that the price to be paid is PERCENT higher than in the case of expropriation in due form . In the ORG 's opinion , this situation is not such as to further the correct administration of expropriation proceedings and to prevent incidents of unlawfulness .", "CARDINAL . In any event , the ORG is required to verify whether the manner in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . In the instant case , the ORG notes that , in applying the constructive - expropriation rule , the NORP courts considered the applicants to be deprived of their possessions as of the date on which the occupation was no longer authorised , since the conditions of unlawful occupation and the public interest of the works in question were both met . However , in the absence of a formal expropriation order , the ORG considers that this situation can not be considered as \u201c foreseeable \u201d , since it was only through the final decision \u2013 ORG final judgment once it had become final and binding DATE that the constructive - expropriation rule could be considered to have actually been applied and that the land 's entry into public ownership was endorsed . In consequence , the applicants did not have \u201c legal certainty \u201d concerning the deprivation of the land until DATE , the date on which ORG final judgment became final and binding .", "CARDINAL . ORG further notes that the situation in issue enabled the authorities to profit from an unlawful occupation of land . In other words , the authorities were able to take possession of the land in breach of the rules governing expropriation in due form , and , inter alia , without compensation being made available at the same time to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . As to compensation , the ORG notes that the retrospective application of LAW ( no . CARDINAL ) to the instant case had had the effect of depriving the applicants of full reparation for the loss sustained .", "CARDINAL . In the light of these considerations , the ORG considers that the interference complained of was not compatible with the principle of lawfulness and that it therefore infringed the applicants ' right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions .", "CARDINAL . It follows that there has been a breach of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto , and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made , the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to pecuniary damage for the loss of the land , the applicants claimed , firstly , the payment of a sum equivalent to CARDINAL of its market value , adjusted for inflation and with interest , and compensation for the occupation . Secondly , they claimed a sum corresponding to the increase in value of the land following the performance of the public works . The asked the ORG to commission an expert report in order to calculate the amount of the CARDINAL forms of compensation in question .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the applicants claimed the sum of ORG PERSON as reimbursement of the tax , deducted at source , payable on the sums awarded by the national court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In respect of non - pecuniary damage , they claimed compensation of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Finally , they claimed the sums of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , as reimbursement of the costs incurred before the national courts , and ORG CARDINAL , plus value - added tax ( VAT ) , as reimbursement of the costs incurred before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . With regard to pecuniary damage , the ORG argued that there was no necessity for a new expert report , given that the market value of the disputed land had already been assessed in the proceedings before the domestic courts . If the ORG were to calculate the pecuniary damage on the basis of the market value of the land , the ORG submitted that the applicants would be entitled to receive only a sum corresponding to the difference between that value and the amount of compensation calculated under the provisions of PERSON no .

In addition , the ORG submitted that the applicants would not be entitled to any compensation relating to the increase in the land 's market value following the performance of public works and no compensation as reimbursement for the tax , deducted at source , paid on the sums awarded by the domestic court .", "CARDINAL . As to the non - pecuniary damage , the Government left the matter to the ORG 's discretion , while emphasising that the amount claimed by the applicants was excessive and that they had quantified such compensation in a vague and imprecise manner .", "CARDINAL . As to the costs incurred in the proceedings before the domestic courts , the Government submitted that the applicants had already obtained reimbursement of these at national level and argued that , in any event , the decision on reimbursement of those costs was a matter for the domestic courts alone .", "CARDINAL . Finally , with regard to the costs of the proceedings in GPE , ORG left the matter to the ORG 's discretion , while emphasising that the amount claimed by the applicants was excessive .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that the question of the application of Article CARDINAL is not ready for decision .
