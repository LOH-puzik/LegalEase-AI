Foreigners who are in GPE without the documents necessary to allow them to stay lawfully in the country can be , and are in great numbers , arrested by the police or the ORG . After a brief period in police custody they are taken to a so - called \u201c guest house \u201d for foreigners run by ORG , where they are - in spite of the welcoming name of these institutions - to all effect locked up awaiting expulsion . However , no written decision to this effect is issued to them .", "CARDINAL . DATE the Law on the Residence of ORG , providing that foreigners who have been issued an expulsion decision but can not be immediately expelled , shall reside in a location assigned to them by ORG , does not constitute a sufficient legal basis for this practice . Neither this law , nor any other , provides further details as to the preconditions for , modalities of or maximum duration of assignment to a residence for foreigners awaiting expulsion . As this is not a measure adopted within the criminal process , judges of the peace have no jurisdiction to rule on challenges against such measures . It would appear that administrative tribunals are competent . However , this remedy appears not to be exercised in practice . Challenges to the expulsion decision may have an impact also on the question of detention , but they simply do not constitute the remedy against the fact of deprivation of liberty required by LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . It is important to stress that this has nothing to do with the criminal proceedings which can be initiated against a foreigner for illegal entry into GPE . Such proceedings are not regularly pursued and , in case of a guilty finding , result in a fine , not deprivation of liberty .", "CARDINAL . Another aggravating aspect is that , according to information provided by the police , not only foreigners who are actually the subject of an expulsion decision are assigned to guest houses ( i.e. deprived of their liberty ) , but also so assigned are many who - in the opinion of the police - are likely to receive an unfavourable outcome in expulsion proceedings initiated against them . This practice violates even article CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Residence of Foreign Citizens .", "CARDINAL .
