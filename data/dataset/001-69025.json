On DATE Mr PERSON died and his daughter , PERSON , pursued the application on his behalf . PERSON and PERSON live in GPE . PERSON lives in GPE . The applicants were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , Director of ORG of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE Mr PERSON lodged an application with ORG ( PERSON ) for restitution of his family 's property , which had been nationalised in DATE and allocated by the authorities to a third person free of charge since DATE . The property consisted of farmland , a house and farm buildings .", "By a decision of ORG for the Return and Compensation of ORG ( NORP v\u00f5\u00f5randatud vara tagastamise ja kompenseerimise GPE maakonna komisjon ) of CARDINAL DATE , all CARDINAL applicants were recognised as the persons entitled to the nationalised property under the property reform legislation .", "On DATE ORG ( \u00d5ru Vallavalitus ) , relying on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG LAW ( Omandireformi aluste seadus ) , decided not to return the property to the applicants on the ground that it had lost its former distinct character ( that is , the form or size of the property , as assessed according to the criteria established by law , had changed significantly ) . On DATE ORG decided to award the applicants compensation in respect of the property .", "The applicants appealed against both of these decisions to ORG ( Valga Maakohus ) .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG declared the decision of ORG of DATE unlawful , finding that the condition of the property had been incorrectly assessed . The judgment was upheld by ORG ( GPE ) on DATE . The courts left unexamined the applicants ' complaint concerning the decision on compensation of CARDINAL DATE as the complaint did not meet the formal requirements .", "On DATE the ORG gave a new decision refusing to return the property to the applicants . That decision was also declared unlawful , mainly for lack of reasoning , by ORG and ORG on DATE and DATE respectively . The courts also declared unlawful the compensation decision of DATE , as it had been made on the basis of the unlawful decision of DATE to refuse restitution .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG refused to return the nationalised property to the applicants on the ground that the property was in the possession of a third person who had acquired it in good faith . In particular , that person had not persecuted the applicants or expropriated their property . The District A dministration based its decision on an amended version of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG LAW , which had come into force on DATE .", "The applicants lodged a complaint against the decision submitting , inter alia , that , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG LAW in the version in force until DATE , a person who had obtained expropriated property free of charge could not be regarded as the bona fide owner of the property . They had lodged an application for restitution at the time when that LAW was in force and therefore had a legitimate expectation that their application would be decided according to that LAW .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG ( ORG ) dismissed the applicants ' complaint . The judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . ORG ( NORP ) , which initially refused the applicants leave to lodge an appeal with it , subsequently granted them leave and , on DATE , rendered a judgment upholding ORG judgment .", "In its judgment ORG reiterated that one of the purposes of the property reform was to undo the injustices caused by violations of property rights in the past . At the same time , the restitution of property or the payment of compensation to former owners should not prejudice the lawful interests of other persons or cause new injustices . The deprivation of property of new owners who had received it free of charge would create such an injustice . Expropriated property had often been preserved thanks to the efforts of new owners . The provisions of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG LAW , as they had existed until DATE , were unjust and offered no protection to new owners of unlawfully expropriated property . The applicants could not reasonably expect that the law would not change . Their expectation that their restitution claim would be decided in accordance with the former law did not outweigh the right of the current owner to the protection of his property and his legitimate expectation that he would not be deprived of his lawfully obtained possessions . The applicants were , however , entitled to claim compensation for property which could not be returned to them .", "In the meantime , on DATE ORG decided to award compensation to the applicants in respect of the nationalised property in the form of \u201c privatisation vouchers \u201d to the nominal value of CARDINAL NORP kroons ( EEK ) for Mr PERSON and to the nominal value of EEK CARDINAL each for PERSON and PERSON .

Under the new text of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , unlawfully expropriated property was not subject to return if", "\u201c the property [ was ] in the possession of a natural person who [ had ] acquired it in good faith ; above all , a person who [ had ] participated in the persecution of the owner of the property or in its unlawful expropriation [ could ] not be regarded as a bona fide owner \u201d .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG LAW stipulated that if unlawfully expropriated property could not be returned on the basis of CARDINAL of the LAW , the ORG would pay compensation in respect of the property according to the procedure provided for by law .", "In accordance with the Regulation on the procedure for the restoration of unlawfully expropriated property enacted by the government on DATE , as amended , the restitution of property rights was carried out in CARDINAL stages : ( CARDINAL ) the establishment of the unlawfulness of the expropriation and the determination of the persons entitled to restitution of their property rights ; ( CARDINAL ) the decision as to whether the property was to be returned ; ( CARDINAL ) the transfer of the property to the eligible persons .
