LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Giorgio Malinverni;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr ORG , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "In DATE , after GPE had re - established independence , the applicant and PERSON started working at ORG ( ORG apsaugos departamentas ) .", "On TIME of CARDINAL DATE the NORP army launched military operations against GPE . NORP troops entered the television tower of GPE and the headquarters of NORP public television , and also tried to take the NORP parliament . Massive crowds of NORP citizens came to the rescue of the institutions of the newly independent GPE . CARDINAL NORP civilians were killed and CARDINAL injured during the clash with the NORP army ( see PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIV ) . At the time of the events , the applicant and ORG were on the premises of the NORP parliament building , where they worked as guards .", "In DATE a publishing house released a book by ORG According to the applicant , it contained false and defamatory information about him .", "On DATE the applicant addressed the publishing house requesting the opportunity to respond critically to the content of the book . In his letter to the publisher the applicant described ORG negatively and criticised ORG \u2019s actions during the events of DATE . The applicant \u2019s letter contained allegations that ORG had deserted his post at the barricades of the ORG building and that he had not passed the psychiatric check for permission to carry a gun .", "Following these events , on DATE ORG brought a private prosecution against the applicant for defamation . The applicant made a counterclaim , alleging that ORG had defamed him in his private prosecution statement .", "The applicant states that during the initial examination of the case by ORG he was undergoing medical treatment . He asked for a longer break before the later hearings , for health reasons . The applicant states that the judge suggested that he did not have to be present at the final CARDINAL hearings of his case , at which ORG was due to give his final submissions and judgment would be adopted . The applicant admits that no request for a longer break was noted in the official hearing record . Although the applicant then informed the court that he would not be present at the CARDINAL final hearings , they were not postponed .", "On DATE the FAC found the applicant guilty of defamation , given that his statements that \u201c J.U. had deserted his post during the tragic events of DATE \u201d and \u201c ORG had not passed the psychiatric check for permission to carry a gun \u201d had not been proved . The applicant was fined CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) and ordered to pay compensation for non - pecuniary damage in the sum of LTL MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The court terminated the proceedings in so far as the counterclaim by the applicant was concerned . ORG and his lawyer , as well as the applicant , were present at the hearing .", "In finding the applicant guilty , the court noted that the applicant had failed to submit credible evidence in support of his statement that ORG had deserted his post . In this connection the court noted that in an official document ORG \u2019s superior had given a positive evaluation of ORG \u2019s behaviour during the events of DATE . The submissions of CARDINAL independent witness , PERSON , questioned in the courtroom , were also taken into account . The court further established that the statement that ORG had not passed the psychiatric check for permission to carry a firearm was false , given that the medical records showed that he had passed the examination in respect of his mental health .", "The applicant states that he saw the record of the hearing of DATE only on DATE , at TIME", "The applicant appealed , mainly arguing that the trial court had distorted the testimony of GPE , had misunderstood the circumstances surrounding the events of DATE , and assessed the evidence and applied domestic law wrongly .", "On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction . In the appellate proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer . As the transcript of the hearing on appeal shows , the court deemed it unnecessary to question witness PERSON , who had testified before the trial court , again , but granted the applicant \u2019s request to add written evidence to the file and to question CARDINAL more witnesses , GPE and PERSON One more witness , ORG , was questioned at the request of ORG", "ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that the official transcript of the hearing was inaccurate , finding that the applicant had had the right to comment on the record of the hearing within DATE of its signing by the judge , if he believed there were mistakes or inconsistencies . However , he had not made use of this right . The court reviewed the findings of the lower court and decided that the latter had assessed the evidence correctly and reached reasoned conclusions . The appellate court also emphasised that GPE , who had testified before the trial court at the request of the applicant , could not unambiguously confirm the fact that PERSON had left his post at the barricades in DATE . Another witness , ORG , had testified that ORG had not deserted his post . The appellate court also noted that written evidence - a report by ORG \u2019s superior - stated that during the events of DATE ORG was \u201c holding firm \u201d .", "Lastly , the court observed that the lower court had correctly concluded that the assertion that ORG had not passed the psychiatric check was a pejorative allusion to his mental health , and thus was damaging to his reputation . No procedural violations were found . This decision was final , as there is no right to appeal on points of law under the domestic law in private prosecution cases .", "Subsequently , the applicant unsuccessfully tried to reopen the proceedings , alleging that the courts were unfair . His requests were dismissed by the public prosecutor and the GPE City Second ORG as unsubstantiated ; they found no procedural irregularities when handling the applicant \u2019s case at both levels of jurisdiction .", "Articles CARDINAL of LAW provide that a participant in the criminal proceedings may raise an objection on the grounds of partiality of a judge .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that a transcript of a hearing must be prepared and signed by the judge who heard the case and the recording officer of the hearing DATE after the hearing took place . The participants in the proceedings have the right to acquaint themselves with the transcript within DATE of its signing . Any objections as to the accuracy of the transcript must be put to the judge who heard the case . If the judge agrees with the objections , he or she adds them to the transcript of the hearing . Should the judge deem that the original transcript was accurate , he may dismiss the participant \u2019s objections by adopting a ruling in a new hearing .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that an appeal on points of law may not be lodged in cases of private prosecution ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
