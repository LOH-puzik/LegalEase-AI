{"ITEMID": "001-57817", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "CHE", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 1993, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF W. v. SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 5-3", "JUDGES": "Franz Matscher;John Freeland", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a NORP businessman who with CARDINAL accomplices was prosecuted for a series of economic offences , including a large number of frauds in the management of CARDINAL companies . He was arrested on DATE and placed in pre - trial detention with CARDINAL of his co - accused , on the grounds that there was a risk of absconding , collusion and repetition of offences .", "CARDINAL . The first complaints relating to him had reached the criminal police of the GPE of GPE in DATE , inter alia following a number of fraudulent bankruptcies . In DATE the cantonal authorities asked the ORG agencies in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and several LOC countries to make inquiries about the applicant , and opened a preliminary investigation against him on DATE .", "In view of the complexity of the case they set up in DATE a subsection of the office of the investigating judge ( ORG ) of the GPE of GPE , consisting of CARDINAL investigating judges assigned exclusively to the investigation , under the authority of a cantonal attorney at ORG ( Obergericht ) and the indictments chamber ( Anklagekammer ) of that court . They were assisted by specialist police officers and considerable facilities were made available to them ( secretariat , computer , archives ) .", "CARDINAL . In the period from DATE their investigation , which traced events back as far as DATE , gave rise to CARDINAL searches , including several at PERSON \u2019s residence and the office of the companies he controlled . Documents in large quantities were found there , mostly in utter disorder , some in the cellar , some in the bathroom and even some in bin bags ready to be destroyed . PERSON had in fact altered the accounts of his companies , some of which were incidentally fictitious , in order to thwart possible investigations .", "On DATE the authorities froze assets in CARDINAL banks and issued warrants relating to other credit institutions . They drew up a list of CARDINAL accounts in all which were affected by the fraudulent dealings of the applicant and his accomplices .", "In DATE and DATE money and valuables belonging to the applicant and his co - accused were seized following orders or searches . These were dated DATE and DATE , DATE , CARDINAL May , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL May , DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE .", "The investigators also had to have recourse to international judicial assistance , in particular from the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office . That office sent them a report dated DATE , as a result of which the NORP authorities extended their inquiries to GPE and took over criminal proceedings instituted against PERSON in that country .", "On DATE the investigating judges requested CARDINAL insolvency practitioners to provide documents relating to CARDINAL companies . The last of these reached them in DATE and DATE .", "On DATE , in view of the urgency , they severed the proceedings against the applicant from those against CARDINAL accomplices .", "CARDINAL . The applicant twice challenged the investigating judges . He also brought CARDINAL appeals and CARDINAL complaints against decisions by them restricting access to the case - file at the beginning of the investigation . The accused were eventually given access to CARDINAL of the file from DATE and the entire file from DATE . PERSON had meanwhile reacted by deciding on DATE to make no further statements .", "On DATE he complained of other irregularities , stating that documents had not been given to him and his lawyer had been unable to obtain free photocopies of them . The indictments chamber dismissed his complaint on DATE . After the committal for trial ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) the authorities on DATE and DATE and DATE allowed the case - file to be consulted by the defence for DATE respectively .", "There was another incident when PERSON was not permitted to be present at certain investigative acts . On DATE the indictments chamber decided that in principle he had the right to attend these .", "His request of CARDINAL DATE that there should be no supervision of the visits by his wife was dismissed by the indictments chamber on DATE and ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . During his pre - trial detention PERSON committed further offences , which resulted in an additional conviction for fraudulent bankruptcy and criminal mismanagement ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; the general meeting of a company controlled by him , which took place in prison on DATE in the presence of a lawyer ( advocate and notary ) , had allowed the latter to use a power of attorney to issue bonds secured on the property of the said company and used as security for the applicant \u2019s personal debts .", "CARDINAL . Once the basic documentation had been collected and sorted , the authorities in DATE and DATE also ordered CARDINAL expert reports , CARDINAL from a psychiatrist and CARDINAL from accountants , the latter following a defence request for evidence of DATE , the only such request made by them in the course of the investigation . The reports were filed on DATE and in DATE . The psychiatric report concluded that the applicant was fully criminally liable , and described him as a confidence trickster ( Hochstapler ) and an unrestrained hedonist ( hemmungsloser Hedonist ) who had no scruples about causing harm to others .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judges declared , pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , that they would request the cantonal attorney \u2019s office to commit PERSON for trial before ORG ( Wirtschaftsstrafgericht ) of the canton . The order committing for trial ( ORG ) was made on DATE .", "The investigators had carried out a total of CARDINAL interrogations . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant himself had been questioned CARDINAL times , but he had always refused to answer the questions put to him ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The transcripts recording the questions and noting his silence filled CARDINAL pages .", "In DATE the main case - file comprised CARDINAL binders . At the time of the trial there were CARDINAL , together with the original documents which themselves took up QUANTITY of shelving .", "The amount of the damage had been estimated at MONEY .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL applications for release were submitted by the persons in pre - trial detention in this case . CARDINAL of them came from the applicant . The first of these , made on DATE , was dismissed by the indictments chamber on DATE . The indictments chamber also dismissed on CARDINAL DATE a complaint of DATE and on DATE a complaint of DATE , relating respectively to the lawyer who had been appointed for PERSON and his visiting rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the indictments chamber turned down a further application of CARDINAL DATE . A public law appeal to ORG was dismissed on DATE , as that court considered that all the conditions to which pre - trial detention was subject under LAW had been fulfilled ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court felt that the serious suspicions against PERSON were supported by the case - file ; moreover , he had transferred his residence to ORG , and his numerous stays in GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE also gave reason to fear that he might try to evade the NORP judicial authorities ; as to the very genuine risk of collusion , this resulted from the way in which the applicant \u2019s various companies were entangled and from the large number of his associates .", "ORG , however , invited the investigators to act with diligence and in particular to question as soon as possible the persons likely to collude with the applicant , as in the court \u2019s opinion the complexity of the facts alone could not justify detention for DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON brought a third application for release on DATE . It was dismissed by the indictments chamber in a decision of CARDINAL DATE , which was upheld by ORG on DATE , following a public law appeal . ORG said that even a summary reading of certain transcripts of interrogations showed that there was serious suspicion against the applicant of multiple fraud and fraudulent bankruptcy ; he was wrong in claiming that this suspicion was unfounded in the specific cases cited by the indictments chamber in justifying the already considerable duration of the detention in issue .", "Moreover , the danger of absconding and that of collusion still both persisted , the former because of the applicant \u2019s good relations with foreign countries and his stated intention of starting a new life in GPE , and the latter in the light of his conduct before his arrest and during the investigation . However , as the last of the co - accused had now been arrested and the principal witnesses had already made statements , this ground could no longer be relied upon without specifying the collusive acts which were feared .", "Furthermore , PERSON was primarily responsible for the length of his detention ; the lack of any proper accounts of his companies had made it extremely difficult to identify the financial transfers by means of which the companies had been burdened for personal ends . Despite this , the investigating judges had worked intensively . All things considered , the detention complained of did not yet appear to be too long . It was nevertheless disturbing that not much progress had been made with the systematic processing of the documents and the production of a report for the purpose of indicting the applicant . Secondly , there was still some doubt as to whether expert reports on the accounting and psychiatric aspects were needed . A close watch had to be kept on these points .", "CARDINAL . A fourth application for release was made on DATE , and dismissed by the indictments chamber on DATE .", "The applicant brought a public law appeal against this decision ; he complained of the time taken to produce the accounting report , and of the alleged inability of the authorities to complete the file . ORG gave its ruling on CARDINAL DATE . It considered that the applicant \u2019s disregard of the elementary rules of bookkeeping was the reason why it had not been possible to complete the expert report earlier ; and the accusation against PERSON was precisely that he had mingled funds of his various companies . Since the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the authorities had taken account of its observations on the processing of the documents , so that in this respect the investigation could not be criticised , bearing in mind in particular the very large number of documents to be classified . That the authorities had entrusted the investigation to a team of CARDINAL investigating judges also showed the great importance they attached to it . As to the psychiatric report and accountancy reports , which were moreover on the point of being filed , there had been no delay in drawing them up , since PERSON was refusing to answer any questions at all . In short , the detention in issue had not yet exceeded the maximum period allowed .", "The court added , however :", "\" ... a practice according to which an accused who was suspected of serious economic offences but not of acts of violence necessarily had to remain in detention until final judgment in his case , merely because of a general risk of absconding , would not be compatible with the fundamental right of personal freedom ... . It should also be taken into account in this respect that the incentive to abscond generally decreases as the proportion of time already spent in detention increases . The investigating judges , the public prosecutor \u2019s office and the indictments chamber will therefore , after carrying out the few investigative acts in respect of which a certain danger of collusion can still be presumed , but at the latest after a period of detention of DATE , have to consider the applicant \u2019s release subject to appropriate substitute measures within the meaning of Article PERSON of LAW . The case would be different only if specific indications of [ W. \u2019s ] intention to abscond were by then present . The risk of repeated offending ... would on the other hand probably not be of relevance as a ground for detention in the case of the applicant , who has no previous convictions . \"", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant once more requested the indictments chamber to terminate his detention . This was refused in a decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s public law appeal on CARDINAL DATE . In its opinion the slowing down of the investigation , noted since its last judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , was not open to criticism , as the NORP authorities had in the meantime taken over the proceedings brought against PERSON by the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and this had entailed additional work . In this respect the investigators could not be blamed either for having often questioned the applicant on these proceedings despite his refusal to make a statement ; their sole aim had been to allow PERSON to exercise his rights of defence . No failure to observe the requirement of acting swiftly had resulted ; rather it was the applicant \u2019s attitude which amounted to delaying the investigation by any legal means . In view of the minimum sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment which the applicant was likely to receive , the pre - trial detention of DATE and DATE had in any event not yet reached the critical level .", "ORG also invited the investigating judges to reconsider , by DATE , the length of the detention in issue . On DATE they took a decision to extend it ( Haftbelassungsbeschlu\u00df ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s sixth application for release had meanwhile been made to the indictments chamber on DATE . It had dismissed it on DATE on the grounds that nothing had changed since ORG last judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; it considered that there was still a danger of absconding and collusion . PERSON did not appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he once more requested his release . The indictments chamber refused this on DATE , and he appealed to ORG .", "ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . It held that the indictments chamber had not breached the LAW or the LAW in considering that there was still a danger of absconding ; in his application of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON had moreover refused to provide a security .", "Apart from the applicant himself , the authorities were also partly responsible for the delays in the investigation ; they had put forward in explanation reasons - such as the taking over of the NORP file ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the different charges against the various co - accused - which they had already been aware of on CARDINAL DATE , when they said that the investigation would be completed in DATE . These delays admittedly had not brought about an excessive prolongation of the deprivation of liberty in issue , but in ORG opinion it was necessary to close the investigation as quickly as possible .", "ORG said :", "\" The judge deciding on detention may prolong the pre - trial detention only to the extent that its duration does not come too close to the sentence to be expected in the specific case ; he must not , for example , take the possible maximum sentence as a reference point . Great attention must also be paid to this limit because the trial court might be inclined to take the length of pre - trial detention into account as CARDINAL factor in determining the sentence . To this extent there is thus a sort of absolute maximum length of pre - trial detention ... . However , even the European Convention institutions allow detention for DATE in cases which are both highly complex and also subject to heavy sentences ... \"", "In this instance the length of the detention had not yet reached the critical level , as the total sentence which could be expected was now considerably PERCENT DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant submitted his eighth application for release ; he supplemented this on DATE by offering a security of a maximum of MONEY ( CHF ) . The indictments chamber dismissed the application on DATE , inter alia on the grounds that he had not given any information on the third party who would pay the money and that the sum appeared derisory in view of the size of the case and the personality of the defendant .", "On a public law appeal by the applicant , ORG quashed the decision on the grounds that Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW had been violated , as PERSON had not had an opportunity to reply to the arguments of the investigating judge and the cantonal attorney before the indictments chamber .", "CARDINAL . Rehearing the application , the indictments chamber on DATE refused to release the applicant , who again appealed to ORG . That court gave judgment on DATE ; it considered that at this stage of the proceedings , after the end of the investigation and the committal for trial ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , pre - trial detention on the ground of a risk of collusion could only be justified by specific evidence , such as in this case the applicant \u2019s personality and the numerous examples of forgery and interference with witnesses already shown to have been done by him in specific cases . It quashed the decision , however , on the grounds that the indictments chamber , when assessing the maximum permissible period of the detention in issue , had omitted to consider whether there were special circumstances in PERSON \u2019s case which meant that the possibility of his conditional release should be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the indictments chamber dismissed the application of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) for the third time . ORG upheld its decision on DATE : having regard to the number and nature of the offences the applicant was accused of , and to his conduct during the investigation and the conclusions of the psychiatric report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the indictments chamber had been right to conclude that there were no reasons making conditional release appear very probable .", "CARDINAL . The trial before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) opened on CARDINAL DATE and ended on DATE with the applicant being convicted and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of CHF MONEY , for offences including fraud on a professional basis ( gewerbsm\u00e4\u00dfiger FAC ) , fraudulent bankruptcy ( betr\u00fcgerischer ORG ) , forgery of documents ( Urkundenf\u00e4lschung ) and aggravated criminal mismanagement ( qualifizierte ungetreue PERSON ) . The DATE spent in pre - trial detention were deducted from the main sentence .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( PERSON \u00fcber das NORP ) of the GPE of GPE provides that :", "\" When the investigating judge regards the investigation as sufficient , he shall notify this to the parties whose addresses are known . If it is for the investigating judge and the district attorney to decide on committal , the investigating judge shall state whether he intends to request that the proceedings be stayed or discontinued or the accused be committed for trial .", "The parties may , within a period from such notification determined by the judge , apply in writing , giving brief reasons , for specified further investigative measures or additional questions and express their opinion on the outcome of the proceedings . If the investigative measures applied for are ordered , the parties may be present at their implementation . \"", "\" During the preliminary investigation the accused shall as a rule remain at liberty .", "The investigating judge shall however be empowered to arrest him if there are specific and serious grounds for suspecting him as perpetrator or accomplice , and in addition there are reasons for supposing", "( a ) that there is a risk of absconding , or ( b ) that the accused would abuse his liberty in order to frustrate or endanger the discovery of the true facts of the matter , or ( c ) that the accused , if he has intentionally committed a further criminal offence ( Verbrechen oder Vergehen ) during the proceedings , will commit further criminal offences .", "A risk of absconding shall be presumed if the accused has no fixed residence in GPE .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the unwritten constitutional right to individual freedom is to be interpreted in the light of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW and the case - law of the GPE institutions , and requires that pre - trial detention must not be excessively prolonged . Each case must be assessed individually , with the accused \u2019s right to liberty being balanced against the ORG \u2019s right to bring criminal proceedings and enforce sentences . If the length of the detention is excessive , the detainee must be released even if serious suspicions and the danger of absconding still subsist ( Decisions of ORG , CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL ; CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
