ICELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Wilhelmina Thomassen", "TEXT": ["The applicants are NORP nationals , born in DATE and DATE , and reside in LOC , GPE . Before the ORG they are represented by PERSON S. \u00c1rnd\u00f3ttir , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are master house builders . In DATE they established the limited liability company Tr\u00e9smi\u00f0jan K CARDINAL hf . together with CARDINAL other persons . The applicants and CARDINAL of the other persons formed the company 's ORG . They were on the company 's payroll and worked there on carpentry . The first applicant is a member of ORG in PERSON . None of the applicants has been a member of ORG or other trade union during the period under reference . The applicants paid premiums to ORG until DATE . As of that time they commenced paying premiums to ORG . In DATE ORG filed a request to ORG to pay the company 's part of the premiums with respect to the applicants . The company rejected payment as the applicants had shifted to ORG and thereby done their legally prescribed duty of payment to a pension fund .", "In DATE ORG , which had then taken over the rights and duties of ORG , instituted proceedings against PERSON before ORG , claiming payment of premiums in respect of the period from DATE until DATE . The company disputed the claim , arguing , inter alia , that an interpretation of the provisions of ORG DATE ( Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , hereinafter referred to as \u201c the GPE \u201d ) to the effect that there was an obligation to participate in ORG , would be incompatible with the right to freedom of association and the right to property as protected by LAW , LAW No . CARDINAL thereto .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered Tr\u00e9smi\u00f0jan to pay to ORG the premiums claimed by it .", "The company appealed against the above judgment to ORG , which , by CARDINAL votes to QUANTITY , upheld ORG judgment on DATE . The minority voting for acquitting the company of the pension claim relied , inter alia , on LAW .", "The majority 's reasoning included the following observations :", "\u201c ... from the above follows that LAW contains an unequivocal legal duty for the entire population to belong to a pension fund . The aim of this legislation is to promote public welfare and , inter alia , to base the right to life insurance on the most possibly equal conditions . Such general limitations under the law are not in conflict with the human rights provisions of LAW .... Being employers the appellants were according to ... section CARDINAL of the DATE Act required to pay their employees ' premiums and are therefore rightly considered as parties to the present case . It has been shown that the appellants engage in business operations falling within the plaintiffs ' field of work . They have not referred to ORG any dispute about payments being made to the plaintiffs . The fact that the plaintiffs have not done so does not weaken their case .", "The appellants plead that , in addition to the fact that their employees have been paying a premium to ORG , they have met the duty for pension guarantee in accordance with LAW . They consider that according to LAW , which applied to the freedom of association at the time when the case was before ORG , and LAW , cf . Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL incorporating the LAW , they could at least have discharged their duty towards any pension fund had ORG ratified its ORG . The plaintiffs maintain , with reference to section CARDINAL of LAW , that the appellants ' wage - earners can not select a fund for themselves as they work in the field to which participation of plaintiffs extend and are thus naturally parties thereto .", "The plaintiffs are a pension fund functioning in accordance with LAW . The appellants ' employees were parties of ORG being CARDINAL of the funds merged with the plaintiffs . It has not been shown that the plaintiffs are unable to secure the appellants ' wage earners the annuity rights provided for under LAW . Thus , their compulsory participation in a pension fund does not prevent them from purchasing additional rights from other instances . It follows from the above that pension funds like that of the plaintiffs are established under the law for the benefit of the funds ' participants and in order to achieve a social aim , but this is a question of joint insurance funds . The legislators have considered that , if one were to be able to join and leave the funds at will , there would be a risk that this social aim would risk not be achieved and that the interests of other holders of rights in the fund would be set aside . Under the present circumstances , it is considered that the appellants have not shown that the restrictions on the employees ' choice of pension fund , ... is inconsistent with the former provisions of the LAW on the freedom of association , cf . the current provisions of paragraph CARDINAL of LAW . ...", "In the light of the above the conclusion in the present case is that the appellants shall pay on behalf of their wage - earners the annuity contribution claimed by the plaintiffs ... \u201d", "On DATE ORG placed Tr\u00e9smi\u00f0jan under bankruptcy administration , at a request made by ORG on account of ORG order that the company pay its arrears in pension contributions .", "LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on LOC ) contained in its section CARDINAL the following provision :", "\u201c All wage earners and self - employed persons have the right and duty of membership of the pension fund of the members of the relevant profession or occupation , which shall function in accordance with laws enacted on that particular fund or a regulation approved by ORG . Any employer is obliged to withhold his employees ' pension fund contributions from their wages and to return them to the fund with his own obligatory contribution , in accordance with the rules on contribution payments laid down in the regulation on the relevant fund or in law . ORG , having obtained the opinion of ORG , ORG and/or other concerned parties , shall decide on any dispute as to what fund the contributions shall be paid . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provided :", "\u201c The duty of pension insurance shall be performed by participation in the pension funds provided for in LAW to the extent possible , and in accordance with the rules of the individual funds relating to membership . A person not automatically entitled to membership of a fund provided for in section CARDINAL shall select a pension fund that is permitted under the rules of the individual funds . If this duty is not performed in this manner , it shall be performed by contributions to the pension fund indicated by the deciding authority under section CARDINAL , and by an agreement concluded with the pension fund in question . \u201d", "On DATE the CARDINAL Act was replaced by LAW rights and on ORG Act no .

CARDINAL objective of the new legislation was to increase the freedom of choice of pension funds for persons who were not subjected to collective agreements . Following the changes brought about by its section CARDINAL , persons who , like the applicants , do not receive wages under a collective agreement , may chose not to contribute to ORG but may instead select another pension fund ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
