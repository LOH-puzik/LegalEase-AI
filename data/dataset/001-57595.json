The object of the ORG \u2019s request is to submit the case of PERSON to the ORG so that the ORG may decide whether or not the facts reveal any violation by GPE of its obligations under LAW ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( article CARDINAL , article DATE ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as they appear from ORG , the memorials , documents and evidence submitted to ORG and the oral statements made by ORG , are essentially as follows :", "CARDINAL . PERSON , a NORP national born at GPE in DATE , is habitually resident there . At the time of his arrest he was a broker by profession .", "CARDINAL . Being under suspicion of being involved in offences of breach of trust , the PERSON was arrested on DATE . A warrant of arrest ( PERSON ) issued DATE by ORG ( ORG ) of ORG ordered his detention on remand .", "The warrant stated that PERSON was under grave suspicion of having incited breach of trust ( GPE zur Untreue ) contrary to Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the NORP LAW : as a customer of the August - Thyssen Bank in GPE he was said to have incited certain of the ORG \u2019s officials to misappropriate very large sums of money . It was also stated in the warrant that it was to be feared that , if left at liberty , the Applicant would abscond and attempt to suppress evidence ( LAW of LAW ) , for :", "- he was likely to receive a considerable sentence ;", "- persons implicated in the offences but not yet known to the authorities might receive warning ; and", "- there was a danger that the Applicant would destroy those business documents that it had not yet been possible to seize .", "During the investigation the warrant was superseded successively by CARDINAL detention orders dated DATE and CARDINAL DATE , both issued by ORG . These stated that PERSON was under grave suspicion of continuing acts of fraud ( fortgesetzter LOC ) contrary to LAW , of prolonged abetment to fraud ( fortgesetzte Beihilfe zum Betrug ) contrary to Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code and of prolonged abetment to breach of trust ( fortgesetzte GPE ) contrary to Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code .", "CARDINAL . In the course of DATE and DATE the Applicant asked at several times to be released but all his requests were rejected by the GPE courts which referred to the reasons given in the warrants of arrest mentioned above . In particular , in DATE , he made an unspecified offer of bail , which was rejected by ORG ( GPE ) on DATE , on the grounds of a danger of suppression of evidence ( GPE ) and moreover because bail could not dispel or diminish the danger of flight in the present case . On DATE , he offered bail of CARDINAL ORG , but he withdrew the offer DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the occasion of an ex - officio examination of the lawfulness of the detention by ORG , ORG lawyer asked on DATE for conditional release of the Applicant , offering in particular the deposit of identity papers . On DATE , however , the court ordered the further detention of the Applicant on the grounds given in the warrant of arrest .", "The Applicant contested this decision on DATE , when he invoked the provisions of ORG first time . Asking for release on any condition which might be thought to be necessary , he held in particular that there was neither a danger of suppression of evidence nor a danger of flight , for he had done all he could do to clear up the transactions involved . He added that all his roots were in GPE where he lived with his wife and child and where his family had for CARDINAL owned a jeweller \u2019s shop , and which his father intended to convey to him very soon . He further stressed that he had brought civil actions against his debtors and therefore had to appear as plaintiff before several ORG CARDINAL times a week . On the other hand , he pointed out that it was not possible for him to flee from GPE : by reason of his numerous previous journeys he was so well known at the GPE airport that he could not take an aeroplane there ; having been detained for DATE in GPE he could enter neither this territory nor GPE . Finally the fact that he stayed at GPE after the discovery of his transactions by ORG on DATE showed clearly that he never had any intention of fleeing .", "This appeal was rejected by ORG ( Landgericht ) of GPE on CARDINAL DATE , on the following grounds :", "- the Applicant was under suspicion of having committed the alleged offences ;", "- the facts had not been fully investigated and were particularly involved ;", "- he appeared to have played a particularly significant part in all the transactions under consideration so that he was likely to receive a particularly severe sentence and might therefore be suspected of intending to flee ;", "- he had important connections abroad and it was impossible , at the present stage of the preliminary investigation , to deny the possibility that he had assets there ;", "- the threat of his financial collapse increased the danger of flight which was not diminished by the existence of his family links in GPE ;", "- while it was doubtful whether the danger of suppression of evidence was sufficient to justify continued detention , certain reasons still suggested that there was still such danger .", "In a second appeal ( PERSON ) of CARDINAL DATE , the Applicant specified that he had been sentenced in DATE by a tribunal in GPE to DATE penal servitude and had been released in DATE . Adding that he had declared his opposition to communism on many occasions , the Applicant declared that it was also impossible for him to flee by passing through GPE by train or by road .", "From the judgment of ORG of DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL , infra ) , it appears that the conviction mentioned by the Applicant had been in respect of the illegal transport of goods belonging to refugees and of timber to GPE ; this conviction was dated DATE .", "The Appeal of CARDINAL DATE was rejected by ORG on CARDINAL DATE . While admitting that at this stage there might be some doubt as to whether there was still a danger of suppression of evidence , the ORG , taking up the grounds of the decision against which the appeal was lodged , pointed out that there was still a danger that the Applicant would abscond ; and that his continued detention did not conflict with the requirements of LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . The ORG added that it was to be feared that ORG would refuse to comply with the summons to appear before the judicial authorities on account of his character on which a medical expert had given an unfavourable opinion , which had been confirmed by his conduct while in detention pending trial .", "CARDINAL . Several applications for conditional release filed by the Applicant in DATE and DATE were also rejected by the GPE courts on grounds similar to those stated by ORG on CARDINAL DATE . In particular , this court found , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE , that the risk that the Applicant would abscond was even greater than in DATE . As a matter of fact , he was likely to receive an appreciably higher sentence than had formerly been thought , as in the meantime LAW had extended the accusation against the Applicant to certain offences under LAW some of which he was said to have committed while in detention . On the other hand , the court considered that it was not yet possible to forecast whether the LAW , in the event of a conviction , would be conditionally released in accordance with LAW after serving CARDINAL of his detention and whether , in the event of such conviction , the time he had spent in detention pending trial would be counted as part of the sentence .", "DATE and CARDINAL DATE the LAW submitted CARDINAL petitions concerning the conditions of his detention on remand , CARDINAL of which were accepted by the responsible authorities while the other CARDINAL were refused .", "During his detention , he was subjected to disciplinary punishment CARDINAL times .", "CARDINAL . The investigation concerned CARDINAL persons . It was conducted by a member of ORG and lasted from DATE to CARDINAL DATE without any important interruptions . In particular , PERSON was interrogated on CARDINAL occasions .", "CARDINAL of the subjects of the investigation was extremely complex cheque manipulations of which the defendants were suspected ( paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ) . It involved the examination of CARDINAL accounts at CARDINAL banks in GPE , CARDINAL banks in GPE and CARDINAL banks in GPE ; the transactions checked totalled CARDINAL DM . In the case of the Applicant alone , transactions amounting to CARDINAL DM were involved DATE and DATE , affecting CARDINAL accounts at CARDINAL banks .", "CARDINAL witnesses were questioned , both in GPE and abroad . In addition CARDINAL expert opinions were obtained from a number of auditing firms and accountants and from a retired President of the ORG . The number of DATE amounted to CARDINAL . The reports of the financial experts alone comprised CARDINAL pages .", "By the time the charge was preferred the court \u2019s records comprised CARDINAL volumes containing CARDINAL pages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the investigation having been completed , the indictment - a document of CARDINAL pages - was filed with ORG of Berlin ; it was notified to the Applicant on DATE . It shows that the PERSON was accused of :", "- CARDINAL cases of prolonged incitement to breach of trust ;", "- prolonged fraud in CARDINAL of these CARDINAL cases ;", "- CARDINAL case of prolonged abetment to breach of trust ; and", "- seven offences under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( i ) and CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) .", "The cases of incitement to breach of trust , fraud and abetment to breach of trust were considered particularly grave ones within the meaning of Sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the indictment , ORG , on DATE , replaced the existing detention order by a new one which stated that PERSON was under grave suspicion of having committed the same acts of incitement to breach of trust and complicity in breach of trust as well as fraud and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL offences against LAW mentioned above .", "In connection with the last - named offences the detention order stated that there were grounds for thinking that in the DATE of DATE PERSON had withdrawn CARDINAL ORG from an account in his wife \u2019s name at ORG , GPE , and secreted this amount somewhere . It added that the same was true , at least in part , of a sum of CARDINAL ORG paid in by ORG in DATE to an account kept by his agent with the \" ORG \" , GPE .", "According to the detention order , there was still a danger that the applicant would abscond , because of the likely sentence .", "CARDINAL . By an order ( PERSON ) of ORG dated DATE , the Applicant and CARDINAL other accused were committed to the trial court ; the order severed the proceedings against a further CARDINAL accused persons from the main proceedings .", "ORG found there was reason to think that PERSON had committed the offences described in the detention order of CARDINAL DATE .", "Proceedings on CARDINAL of the CARDINAL acts of bankruptcy of which the applicant was suspected were severed from the main proceedings ; they were later discontinued ( Einstellung ) under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Applicant \u2019s trial opened on DATE . In the course of it he lodged CARDINAL applications for the hearing of witnesses , covering CARDINAL points . He challenged CARDINAL judges and CARDINAL financial experts on the grounds of partiality . ORG heard CARDINAL witnesses , CARDINAL medical experts and CARDINAL financial experts . TIME totalled CARDINAL pages , apart from the appendices , which comprised CARDINAL pages .", "On DATE , ORG , acting under LAW of LAW , discontinued ( eingestellt ) the proceedings in those cases of fraud with which the PERSON was charged that occurred before the beginning of DATE . On DATE , it severed from the principal proceedings the CARDINAL offences under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( i ) of LAW for which the LAW was still being prosecuted . DATE the proceedings relating to these were also discontinued ( LAW ) .", "On DATE , ORG found PERSON guilty of a particularly serious case of prolonged abetment to breach of trust ( fortgesetzte Beihilfe zur Untreue , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) and sentenced him to DATE and DATE penal servitude ( ORG ) and a fine of CARDINAL DM , the period of detention on remand being counted as part of the sentence . The court ordered that the Applicant should be kept in detention on remand for the reasons stated in the detention order of DATE .", "Judgment was passed on the Applicant at the same time as on CARDINAL other accused . The judgment comprised CARDINAL pages .", "CARDINAL . After conviction , PERSON again applied for provisional release in DATE , but ORG rejected his application on DATE . His appeal against this decision was rejected by ORG on CARDINAL DATE . That court found that it was very probable that he had secreted large sums of money and that he was greatly in debt and insolvent , so that there was a danger that he would yield to the temptation to evade prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the PERSON requested provisional release against security of CARDINAL DM ( CARDINAL DM in cash and CARDINAL DM in the form of a bank guarantee to be put up by his father ) . After discussing the matter at ORG , PERSON amended his request DATE , offering security of CARDINAL DM . This offer was accepted by ORG on DATE . The Applicant , however , did not deposit this security but on CARDINAL DATE , offered a bank guarantee of CARDINAL or CARDINAL DM which was to be provided by his father . ORG rejected this offer on DATE . The Applicant contested this decision and offered security of CARDINAL DM , but ORG dismissed his appeal on DATE on the ground that a security of this sum was not sufficient to dispel the danger of flight which was still present .", "On DATE , while these proceedings were still in progress , PERSON again asked ORG to order his release if necessary against security of CARDINAL DM . The court rejected the application on DATE . It found that the temptation for PERSON to abscond was still very great , for :", "- the sentence remaining to be served was considerable ;", "- the Applicant was insolvent and deeply in debt , which he would probably never be able to settle ; and", "- the suspicion that he had secreted away CARDINAL DM , as stated in the detention order of DATE , had grown stronger during the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) rejected an appeal ( Revision ) filed by the PERSON in DATE against his conviction by ORG . The time he had spent in detention since the judgment of DATE , in so far as it exceeded DATE , was to be counted as part of the sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after serving CARDINAL of his sentence , PERSON was conditionally released ( in accordance with LAW ) under an Order of ORG dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his original ORG lodged with the ORG on DATE , the Applicant alleged that the length of his detention on remand violated his right under LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention to be brought to trial within a reasonable time or released pending trial . He complained of the fact that the decisions of ORG dated DATE , of ORG dated CARDINAL DATE and of ORG dated CARDINAL DATE had not put an end to the detention . He claimed compensation for the damage suffered and reserved the right to specify later the exact amount of his claim .", "On DATE the ORG declared the ORG admissible in respect of LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) , and also , ex officio , with reference to LAW .", "Subsequent to his ORG , PERSON made CARDINAL other complaints . On DATE the Commission declared CARDINAL of them inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded ; the other CARDINAL were not upheld by the Applicant .", "CARDINAL . Following the decision declaring admissible the original ORG , a ORG ascertained the facts and unsuccessfully sought a friendly settlement ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention ) ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG and ORG , the PERSON maintained that the purpose of LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) was to avoid an excessively long deprivation of liberty because of the extent and length of the investigation . He stated that detention on remand was a \" special sacrifice \" imposed upon persons , whether guilty or not , for the maintenance of an effective administration of justice . As , according to the Applicant , this involves a derogation from the principle of the presumption of innocence enshrined in LAW ( article DATE ) , the ORG has not the right to continue such detention until the social position , the livelihood , the health , the professional and family life of the individual concerned were destroyed , consequences which his detention had brought about . Pointing out that a remand prisoner \u2019s uncertainty as to his fate is a mental strain that becomes heavier with the passage of time , the PERSON also mentioned LAW ) of the Convention .", "ORG also submitted that it would have been possible to deal with his case more speedily , in particular , by dividing it , by employing several public prosecutors and by accelerating the work of the experts . He added that he himself had not caused any substantial delay in the proceedings but , on the contrary , assisted ORG in unravelling the transactions in issue .", "Furthermore , the Applicant submitted that neither the length of his anticipated sentence nor his civil liability for the loss suffered by ORG constituted sufficient grounds for suspecting him of intending to escape . His offers of bail and the fact that after the discovery of the PERSON affair on DATE , he remained with his family in GPE until his arrest on DATE proved that he had no intention of resorting to flight .", "Lastly PERSON claimed that he was a victim of a violation of LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) notwithstanding the final result of his trial , since , in his opinion , the decision whether or not the length of detention pending trial is reasonable can not depend upon any subsequent occurrence . The Applicant added that , if the conditions of detention on remand are less harsh than those of penal servitude , the uncertainty of the remand prisoner as to his future constitutes a special burden which does not exist in the case of a convicted prisoner .", "CARDINAL . After the failure of the attempt to arrange a friendly settlement made by ORG , ORG drew up a ORG as required under LAW article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . The ORG was adopted on DATE and transmitted to ORG DATE . The Commission expressed therein the following opinion , which it later confirmed before the ORG :", "( a ) by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , that the Applicant had not been brought to trial \" within a reasonable time \" or released pending trial , and that , consequently , LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention had been violated in the present case ;", "( b ) by CARDINAL votes to one , that that conclusion could not be affected by the fact that the judgment of DATE required the period of detention on remand to be counted as part of the sentence ;", "( c ) unanimously , that the PERSON \u2019s continued detention on remand , ordered by the competent courts on the grounds of danger of flight and suppression of evidence , was a \" lawful detention \" within the meaning of LAW ) ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-c ) ;", "( d ) unanimously , that it could not consider the Applicant \u2019s claim for compensation under LAW ) ( article DATE ) , before :", "( i ) the competent organ , namely , the ORG or ORG , had given a decision on the question whether LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) had been violated ; and", "( ii ) the Applicant had had an opportunity , with respect to his claim for compensation , to exhaust , in accordance with LAW , the domestic remedies available to him under NORP law ;", "( e ) unanimously , that even if the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE was considered , LAW ( article DATE ) had not been violated in the criminal proceedings against the Applicant .", "In brief , of the CARDINAL members of the Commission who were present when the ORG was adopted , CARDINAL found no breach by GPE of its obligations under the LAW while the majority considered that there had been a breach on CARDINAL count , but none on the others . The ORG sets out CARDINAL individual opinions \u2013 CARDINAL concurring , and the other CARDINAL dissenting .", "Arguments of the ORG and the Government", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view LAW ) ( LAW ) of the Convention lays down the right of a person detained in accordance with LAW ) ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-c ) either to be released pending trial or to be brought to trial within a reasonable time . If the person is being held in detention on remand it must not exceed a reasonable period . The most important problem , therefore , is to determine the exact meaning of the words \" reasonable time \" . The Commission finds this expression vague and lacking in precision , with the result that it is not possible to determine abstractly its exact meaning , which can be evaluated solely in the light of the particular circumstances of each case .", "CARDINAL . In order to facilitate such evaluation the ORG believes that it is in general necessary to examine an individual case according to the CARDINAL following \" criteria \" or \" elements \" :", "( i ) The actual length of detention .", "In this respect , the ORG does not indicate in its ORG when it considers the \" reasonable time \" mentioned in LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) to begin and to end in abstracto . During the oral proceedings before the ORG , however , ORG of the Commission stated the problems which the Commission thinks arise in this matter . Whereas the LANGUAGE version ( \" entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to be released pending trial \" ) would permit the interpretation that the period referred to ends with the opening of the case before the trial court , the LANGUAGE version ( \" \u00eatre jug\u00e9e dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable , ou lib\u00e9r\u00e9e pendant la proc\u00e9dure \" ) would cover a longer period , ending at the date on which judgment is pronounced . The Commission has not stated any definite opinion on this question , but at the hearing its ORG expressed a clear preference in favour of the interpretation based on the NORP text , the meaning of which is , unlike the LANGUAGE version , clear and unequivocal and also more favourable to the individual . In particular , the delegate of the Commission rejected the argument of ORG that the LANGUAGE version should be accepted for the simple reason that it limits the sovereignty of GPE to a lesser degree .", "The Commission emphasised the importance which it attaches to the ORG \u2019s settling this question of interpretation .", "( ii ) The length of detention on remand in relation to the nature of the offence , the penalty prescribed and to be expected in the case of conviction and any legal provisions making allowance for such a period of detention in the execution of the penalty which may be imposed . On this point the ORG remarked that the length of detention on remand may vary according to the nature of the offence concerned and the penalty prescribed and to be expected . However , in determining the relation between the penalty and the length of detention , it is necessary to take into account the presumption of innocence as guaranteed by LAW ( article PERCENT ) of the LAW . If the length of detention should approach too closely the length of the sentence to be expected in case of conviction , the principle of presumption of innocence would not be fully observed ;", "( iii ) material , moral or other effects on the detained person .", "( iv ) the conduct of the accused :", "( a ) Did he contribute to the delay or expedition of the investigation or trial ?", "( b ) Was the procedure delayed as a result of applications for release pending trial , appeals or other remedies resorted to by him ?", "( c ) Did he request release on bail or offer other guarantees to appear for trial ?", "( v ) difficulties in the investigation of the case ( its complexity in respect of facts or number of witnesses or co - accused , need to obtain evidence abroad , etc . ) .", "( vi ) the manner in which the investigation was conducted :", "( a ) the system of investigation applicable ;", "( b ) the conduct by the authorities of the investigation ( the diligence shown by them in dealing with the case and the manner in which they organised the investigation ) .", "( vii ) the conduct of the judicial authorities concerned :", "( a ) in dealing with the applications for release pending trial ;", "( b ) in completing the trial .", "CARDINAL . The ORG argues that a rational scheme of this kind makes possible in each case a \" coherent interpretation without any appearance of arbitrariness \" . The ORG remarks , however , that the conclusion in any particular case will be the outcome of an overall evaluation of all the elements . Even if examination of some of the criteria leads to the conclusion that the length of detention is reasonable , the application of other criteria may lead to a contrary conclusion . The final and determining conclusion will therefore depend on the relative weight and importance of the criteria , but this in no way precludes CARDINAL single criterion from having decisive importance in some cases .", "The ORG adds that it has endeavoured to cover , through the aforementioned criteria , all the situations of fact which it is usually possible to find in cases of detention on remand , but that the list should not be considered exhaustive , there being exceptional situations , other than those submitted to the ORG for decision in the case in question , which might justify the examination of other criteria .", "CARDINAL . In this case the ORG ascertained the facts in the light of the said criteria and proceeded to their legal evaluation by the same method of interpretation .", "Certain of the facts established by the ORG seemed to it important in the light of several criteria . There will be found below a summary of the ORG \u2019s opinion on these various points .", "CARDINAL . With regard to application of the first criterion , that is to say the length of ORG \u2019s detention on remand , the ORG takes into account the period from DATE ( the date of his arrest ) to CARDINAL DATE ( DATE of the opening of the trial before ORG ) . According to the Commission the actual length of this detention ( DATE ) seems to warrant the conclusion that it exceeded a \" reasonable \" period .", "CARDINAL . As regards the second criterion mentioned above , the ORG is of the opinion that its application in the present case seems to justify the same conclusion . It remarks that here it has taken into consideration both the possibility of the Applicant \u2019s provisional release under LAW , and the fact that the length of detention has been counted as part of the sentence imposed . The ORG accepts that this last measure constitutes an element comparable to an \" extenuating circumstance \" , but states that it in no way changes the distinctive nature of detention on remand which , not being in accordance with LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) , remains a violation of the LAW , even if in the execution of the sentence finally imposed , account has been taken of the period of detention .", "CARDINAL . Application of the third criterion , in the opinion of the Commission , likewise leads to the conclusion that the length of detention was excessive , in view of the prejudicial effects of the detention on the PERSON \u2019s family life ; his long detention is said to have destroyed his marriage and injured his close relations with his parents .", "CARDINAL . ORG does not think , as regards the fourth criterion , that the Applicant \u2019s conduct contributed substantially to the length of his detention .", "CARDINAL . In evaluating the fifth criterion the Commission considers that the case in question was of very great complexity , not only on account of the nature and number of the financial transactions involved but also because of the number of accused and witnesses who had to be heard and the ramifications of the case both in GPE and abroad . According to the Commission these circumstances support and conclusion that the length of detention was reasonable .", "CARDINAL . The examination of the sixth and seventh criteria does not , in the opinion of the Commission , lead to the conclusion that the criminal proceedings against the Applicant were substantially prolonged through any fault of the authorities .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the overall evaluation of these various criteria , Commission attaches particular importance to the actual length of detention and concludes that the Applicant was not brought to trial within a \" reasonable \" time or released pending trial , and that consequently he has been a victim of a violation of LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It should be added that in the ORG \u2019s view the continued detention on remand of the Applicant , ordered by the competent courts because of the danger of flight and suppression of evidence , was lawful within the meaning of LAW ) ( article QUANTITY - CARDINAL-c ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG maintains that LAW ) poses questions of interpretation similar to those raised by LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) , in particular as regards the \" time \" mentioned in LAW ( article DATE ) . However , in the opinion of the Commission , the question whether the time was \" reasonable \" for the purposes of LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) or of LAW ) ( article DATE ) must be judged differently in the CARDINAL cases ; the former , being intended to safeguard the physical freedom of the individual , requires stricter application than the latter , the object of which is to protect the individual against abnormally long judicial proceedings , irrespective of the question of the actual detention . In the present case , the criminal procedure related to extremely complex facts ; it was not unduly prolonged by the NORP judicial authorities . Therefore , the ORG arrives at the conclusion that even if the period concerned were considered to run from DATE until DATE , LAW ) has not been violated in the criminal proceedings against the Applicant .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE , the ORG made the the following submissions :", "\" DATE it please the ORG to decide :", "( CARDINAL ) whether or not LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW has been violated by the detention of ORG from DATE to CARDINAL DATE or any later date ;", "( CARDINAL ) whether or not LAW ) ( article DATE ) of the LAW has been violated by the duration of the criminal proceedings against ORG between his arrest on DATE or any later date and the judgment of ORG of GPE on DATE or any other date . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG , for its part , remarks that it shares the ORG \u2019s opinion as to the absence of any violation of LAW ) ( article DATE ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the interpretation of LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW and its application to the present case , the ORG believes that the period to be considered is that which the ORG takes into account in its ORG , from arrest ( DATE ) to the opening of the case before the trial court , ORG of GPE ( CARDINAL DATE ) .", "According to the Government it is essential , at least in the present case , not to rely on the NORP text ( \" le droit d\u2019\u00eatre jug\u00e9e dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable ou lib\u00e9r\u00e9e pendant la proc\u00e9dure \" ) , which could signify a longer period ( up to the date of the judgment ) than one terminating on the date of the opening of the trial , as suggested by the LANGUAGE version ( \" entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial \" ) . It could therefore lead to a further limitation of the sovereignty of GPE . Moreover , application of LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) in the NORP version would allow the accused to prolong the protection accorded by that provision by making excessive use of procedural devices . The result would be an undue prolongation of proceedings , with the danger that by the time release was possible , the period would no longer be \" reasonable \" .", "CARDINAL . In general terms the Government expresses considerable reservations as to the method adopted by the Commission - that of laying down CARDINAL \" criteria \" - while admitting that the answer depends In its opinion , the Commission was not objective , on its strict allocation of the facts to the same criteria , as indeed some of the facts mentioned in relation to CARDINAL of the criteria would be equally relevant to others .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also sets against the Commission \u2019s reasoning the following considerations which , in its opinion , demonstrate the absence of any violation of LAW ) ( article CARDINAL ) in the case of the Applicant .", "CARDINAL . To the first criterion advanced by the ORG , namely , the actual length of detention , the ORG raises objections of principle . In its opinion , the adjective \" reasonable \" , qualifying the noun \" time \" , introduces a relative element ; the absolute factor which the actual length of detention represents can not therefore serve as a criterion for determining whether such a length of time is \" reasonable \" . Furthermore , the ORG remarks that , in the ORG \u2019s view , the Applicant \u2019s detention was \" lawful \" for the whole of its length within the meaning of LAW ) ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-c ) of the LAW ; it adds that the ORG , in evaluating the fifth criterion , admits that the complexity of the investigation tends to justify the length of detention . The Government therefore does not see how it is possible to consider as \" unreasonable \" the length of the detention on remand in toto . Moreover , the ORG has not indicated at what moment the detention ceased , in its opinion , to be \" reasonable \" .", "CARDINAL . Neither does the Government share the evaluation of the Commission with respect to the second criterion . It emphasises that the opinion of the ORG is based primarily on the possibility , provided in LAW , of the conditional release of a detained person . However , according to the ORG , that ORG , whose application depends on the ORG \u2019s discretion , can operate only when the sentence has become final and , more precisely , from the moment when the convicted person has already served CARDINAL of his sentence ; it can not therefore justify the conclusion that the length of detention on remand has been \" unreasonable \" . Moreover , the NORP judicial authorities granted the Applicant conditional freedom when he had served CARDINAL of his sentence . This decision , which dates from DATE , was able to be taken so early because the length of detention on remand had been counted as part of the sentence .", "With regard to the ORG \u2019s argument that detention on remand represents a distinct situation even where it has been counted in part or in whole against the sentence , the Government stresses the advantages - which are not disputed - of such detention compared with a sentence of imprisonment . It is inferred from this that the length of the detention operated in favour of the Applicant : had it been shorter , ORG would have had to spend longer in penal servitude , which would have made the conditions of his detention appreciably worse .", "CARDINAL . In evaluating the third criterion , the ORG has omitted , in the ORG \u2019s view , to verify the existence of a causal relation between ORG detention and the deterioration of his family life . The Government maintains that if PERSON had been convicted earlier and thus subjected to a longer period of imprisonment , the effects would have been equally prejudicial - indeed , even graver - for his financial and family position than would those of detention on remand . It is deduced from this that the evaluation of the third criterion by the ORG is not convincing .", "CARDINAL . In the opinion of the Government , the statements of fact arrived at by the Commission in the light of the fourth criterion contain certain lacunae . Certainly , it may be acknowledged that the numerous requests , appeals and other approaches , set out in detail in Appendices PERSON and ORG , do not allow it to be affirmed that ORG generally intended to slow down the course of the proceedings . According to the ORG , there can , however , be no doubt that the examination of the case was thereby prolonged . On this point , the Government likewise remarks that ORG of GPE decided on DATE , i.e. after conviction , to suspend the detention order subject to the deposit of bail of CARDINAL DM . ORG had , in the light of the documents in its possession , discovered that the Applicant had deposited the sum of CARDINAL DM in an account opened in the name of his wife in a NORP bank , and that he had withdrawn this sum when his offences came to light . In the course of the proceedings , the Applicant had given highly contradictory explanations of this transaction ; the judicial authorities have not been in a position to discover what PERSON had done with the sum of money in question .
