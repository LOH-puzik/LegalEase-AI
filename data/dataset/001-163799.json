The applicant was chairperson of ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) DATE and DATE , when he resigned . The ORG has legal personality under public law .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment dated DATE , delivered in the case of ORG v. ORG and ORG , ORG declared that it was unconstitutional to use the legal term \u201c DATE regulation fee for transport activities \u201d ( \u10e0\u10d4\u10d2\u10e3\u10da\u10d8\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10e4\u10d0\u10e1\u10e3\u10e0\u10d8 ) , which appeared in various relevant legal acts LAW of DATE on the Rules of ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , and the Orders of DATE , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of the Minister for ORG ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court considered that the aforementioned \u201c DATE regulation fee for transport activities \u201d , which was a compulsory payment provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , was strictly speaking neither a tax nor a levy . However , LAW only recognised the latter CARDINAL kinds of compulsory payment to the ORG . Furthermore , unlike taxes and levies , the regulation fee was not paid into the ORG \u2019s coffers or to a local authority , but directly to the ORG . ORG considered that in those circumstances the fee amounted to a special form of tax , which was a compulsory payment and which had the features of both a traditional levy ( payable in exchange for a service or the granting of a right ) and of a tax ( payable on the DATE income of the body concerned ) .", "CARDINAL . The defendant authorities \u2013 ORG and ORG argued before ORG that there was a need for some kind of compulsory regulation fee for transport activities because it was not possible for the ORG to sign contracts with civil aviation companies . ORG dismissed that argument , pointing out that the regulation of transport activities meant the provision of a service by a public authority in exchange for the payment of a fee for that service . Such relationships could only arise within the framework of a mutual contract , freely entered into by the parties concerned . A fee received by a public authority for a service should therefore take the form of income received for work carried out on a contractual basis , in accordance with section CARDINAL(d ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further observed that the claimant , a private airline , would obviously never be able to carry out its business without the transport service provided by the ORG . However , regard being had to the principle of the freedom to choose services , even an undeniably necessary service should be the subject of a free agreement between the parties . ORG thus concluded that if the matter at issue were settled in that way , then future situations in which the payment of considerable amounts imposed unilaterally by a public authority , in total disregard of the opinions of the companies concerned , would be avoided . ORG emphasised that not even constitutional provisions could prevent a public authority in charge of the regulation of civil aviation from signing a contract with a private entity which included conditions and rules for services to be provided under that contract .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court ruled that its judgment of DATE would become effective on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted for abuse of power against unnamed officers of ORG , the ORG and CARDINAL ORG - owned civil aviation companies . That decision was taken on the basis of information provided by \u201c an investigative journalism organisation carrying out research into corruption \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a charge of repeated abuse of power was brought against the applicant himself , under LAW and CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW , by ORG ( \u201c the PERSON \u201d ) . He was accused in particular of having entered into civil contracts in his capacity as chairperson of the ORG on DATE and CARDINAL DATE with CARDINAL civil aviation companies \u2013 GPE , FAC and ORG - GPE DATE which undertook to pay the ORG on a DATE basis a \u201c fee for services rendered in relation to the regulation of activities \u201d ( \u10db\u10dd\u10db\u10e1\u10d0\u10ee\u10e3\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10e4\u10d0\u10e1\u10e3\u10e0\u10d8 ) . Accordingly , DATE the ORG received CARDINAL NORP laris ( GEL ) ( CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) ) . According to the investigator , the applicant \u2019s actions in using the words \u201c fee for services rendered in relation to the regulation of activities \u201d ( hereinafter \u201c fee for services \u201d ) had concealed what had actually in fact amounted to the old \u201c DATE regulation fee for transport activities \u201d , a legal term and obligation which had become unconstitutional after DATE , when the ORG judgment of DATE had entered into force ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was further accused of having issued Order no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , and of applying it retroactively , again in breach of ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The order had allowed the ORG to charge GPE and FAC the sum of GEL CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) DATE and DATE in respect of the regulation fee .", "CARDINAL . Thus , by having wilfully circumvented the legal effects of ORG judgment of DATE , the applicant \u201c had acted unlawfully and had therefore committed an abuse of power \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE . He was charged on DATE but pleaded not guilty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Krtsanisi - Mtatsminda District Court of First Instance in GPE ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) , allowing an application by the PERSON , ordered the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE , pending investigation and trial .", "CARDINAL . By a final decision of DATE , ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant as inadmissible and upheld the detention order of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG , after hearing both parties\u2019 arguments , allowed an application by the PERSON to extend the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until DATE . No appeal lay against that decision , and it was therefore final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an accountancy expert from the crime detection department of ORG , whose services had been solicited by the PERSON as part of the investigation of the applicant \u2019s case , drew up an audit of the ORG \u2019s regulatory activities ( \u201c the audit report of DATE \u201d ) . Firstly , the expert listed the acts which constituted the legal basis for the activities of the ORG and which were in force before and after DATE , when ORG judgment of DATE had entered into force . He then distinguished CARDINAL periods of activity : ( i ) the period DATE and DATE , corresponding to the imposition of \u201c the DATE regulation fee for transport activities \u201d by the ORG on the civil aviation companies concerned ; ( ii ) the period DATE and DATE , corresponding to the regulation by the ORG of the activities of the companies in question in accordance with conditions negotiated as part of the contracts it entered into ; and ( iii ) the period DATE and DATE , when the ORG had collected regulation fees on the basis of Order no . CARDINAL , which had been issued by its chairperson , the applicant , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The expert noted that the adoption of ORG judgment of DATE had led to \u201c the suppression of the imposition by the ORG , in the form of an order , of the \u2018 DATE regulation fee for transport GPE on companies operating within civil aviation and the removal of the compulsory nature of the payment of that fee \u201d . However , \u201c the judgment in question had not declared that it was unlawful for the ORG to provide its services to the companies concerned on the basis of negotiated contracts \u201d . According to the expert , the judgment indicated , on the contrary , that there was a \u201c need for such contracts and a legal settlement of the issue in this way \u201d . The expert assumed that the applicant had taken the latter route , \u201c which had been suggested to him by the LAW \u201d . That had brought him to sign the impugned contracts with GPE and FAC on DATE , that is to say , DATE before the entry into force of the judgment in question . On DATE the applicant had signed the same kind of contract with ORG - GPE . In each case , the ORG \u2019s remuneration had been calculated on a DATE basis and was referred to as a fee for services provided in the field of regulation . The CARDINAL contracts had been terminated on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regarded Order no . CARDINAL , which had been issued by the applicant on DATE , the expert noted that the order , approved for entry into force by ORG on DATE , had been able to be applied retrospectively , that is as of DATE , which was the date of the termination of the CARDINAL above - mentioned contracts . He said the order showed good conduct in the financial activities relating to the functioning of civil aviation in the country which , by its very nature , had to be a continuous process .", "CARDINAL . After examining the available evidence , the expert concluded that the ORG \u2019s charging of the fees for the CARDINAL above - mentioned periods of activity \u201c was based on the relevant laws and regulatory acts \u201d . He established , moreover , that the regulation fee at that time constituted the sole source of revenue for the ORG , a public - law entity not financed by the ORG . Had it not charged those amounts , the ORG would have been obliged to continue functioning without , though , paying its employees\u2019 salaries . The expert reiterated that the regulation fee paid to the ORG by the companies concerned was included in the price for the service that those companies offered to individuals ( air travel tickets ) or other companies ( carriage of goods ) . Payment of the fee to the ORG did not therefore cause them any financial damage and , even if there had nevertheless been a loss , it would in the end have been passed on to the consumer .", "CARDINAL . Generally , the expert established that the ORG had received , DATE and DATE , GEL CARDINAL ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) in fees for the regulatory services provided under the CARDINAL impugned contracts with FAC , Air - BP - Georgia and GPE , and GEL CARDINAL ( some EUR CARDINAL ) by way of the fee collected on the basis of Order no . CARDINAL . In any event , the expert emphasised that the charging of those sums by the ORG to the various private companies had been continuous in time and had been based on valid legal acts ( either statutes or other legal instruments ) . Out of all the abovementioned amounts received by the ORG DATE and DATE , the applicant had made a personal profit of GEL CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( some ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) by way of , respectively , the salary and business trips allowances he had received over the same period of time . A further GEL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( some EUR CARDINAL ) had been paid to ORG in income tax and social security charges , while the remaining funds had been spent on the salaries of other ORG employees and various business trips and management expenses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the preliminary investigation was terminated and a bill of indictment was served on the applicant . According to the bill , DATE and DATE the ORG had carried out CARDINAL unlawful activities : ( i ) firstly , it had received , in breach of the judgment of ORG of DATE , a regulation fee from CARDINAL civil aviation companies ; ( ii ) secondly , CARDINAL companies had paid the ORG the same regulation fee on the basis of Order no . CARDINAL , issued by the applicant ; ( iii ) and , thirdly , the CARDINAL companies \u2013 GPE ( a government - owned undertaking ) , FAC and AirBPGeorgia DATE had paid the fee for services to the ORG on the basis of contracts concluded by the applicant . The pecuniary damage thus incurred by the companies concerned amounted to GEL CARDINAL , of which GEL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( some EUR CARDINAL ) was caused to GPE . The applicant had used the amounts received to pay salaries and expenses for the management and business trips .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the indictment before the investigator of ORG handling the case , arguing that the evidence that had been gathered did not support the charges . In particular , the investigation authorities had not explained how , within the meaning of LAW , the acts committed had damaged the \u201c interests of the civil service \u201d ; what unlawful \u201c personal profit \u201d he had derived ; what unlawful personal profit had been derived by third parties and who those people actually were ; which of the rights of the companies concerned had been breached by his action ; what legal interests of the ORG had been disregarded ; and in what way that \u201c disregard \u201d had been \u201c substantial \u201d ( see LAW , at paragraph MONEY below ) . He again pointed out that the judgment of ORG at issue authorised the ORG to continue to charge the fee for services , provided that the payment was based on negotiated contracts and not imposed , as hitherto . Contrary to the argument put forward by the investigator , the companies concerned could not be deemed to have incurred any substantial losses simply by having fulfilled contractual obligations which had been freely negotiated with the ORG . Moreover , those companies had never complained of the unlawfulness of the contracts in question . Lastly , the applicant argued that \u201c none of the ORG \u2019s legal interests \u201d had been disregarded , given that the ORG could not claim to be a victim of contractual relationships CARDINAL entities which were independent of it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator rejected that complaint as illfounded . He pointed out that the indictment of CARDINAL DATE had been based on evidence gathered during the investigation , and that such evidence was sufficient to dispel any doubts that the applicant had committed the offence provided for in LAW ( a ) of LAW . In particular , the investigator pointed out that everyone had to comply with the judgment of ORG DATE , which had the force of law , but which the applicant had failed to do . After DATE , the date of entry into force of that judgment , the applicant had continued to charge the regulation fee , referring to it as a \u201c fee for services provided in the field of the regulation of activities \u201d in order to conceal the nature of the activity . ORG had considered , however , that revenues gained by the ORG in the form of a regulation fee were unconstitutional . The applicant and his employees had derived a personal profit from the amounts at issue in the form of salaries , and management and business trip fees . For example , the applicant had received total salary of GEL CARDINAL ( some EUR CARDINAL ) . According to the investigator , even if most of the companies concerned had declared that they had not incurred any loss from the applicant \u2019s activities , the charging by the ORG of the disguised regulation fee in breach of the judgment of ORG had damaged the legal interests of the ORG . Furthermore , by giving retrospective effect to Order no . CARDINAL , registered by ORG on DATE , the applicant had jeopardised the well - being of the companies concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision with ORG . He stated that the investigator had failed properly to the arguments made in his complaint of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor from ORG replied to the applicant , stating that his appeal had been rejected because the decision of DATE had properly and exhaustively addressed all his claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the indictment was approved by a deputy chief prosecutor and the case sent for trial before the NORP - Saburtalo ORG of First Instance in GPE ( \u201c the NORP - Saburtalo Court \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the Vake - Saburtalo Court , claiming that he had been unlawfully detained since DATE . In particular , the period of his pre - trial detention had expired on that date and had not been extended . He asked that he be released immediately .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG held a pre - trial conference hearing in the case , ruling to commit the applicant for trial as a defendant ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ) . Without replying to the applicant \u2019s complaint of DATE of the unlawfulness of his pre - trial detention , the court upheld the restraint measure on the basis of the \u201c nature of the charges \u201d and the inability to conduct a comprehensive judicial assessment of his arguments for release at the admissibility stage .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , subsequent to a reform of the judicial system and the associated liquidation of the Vake - Saburtalo ORG , the applicant \u2019s case was assigned for trial to the newly created ORG .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by ORG during the trial , the acting director and the chief accountant of GPE confirmed that their company had paid the relevant fee to the ORG even after ORG judgment of DATE , either on the basis of a contract or on the basis of Order no . CARDINAL . They did not know at the time that they were exempted from paying the fee by ORG ruling .", "CARDINAL . The managers of FAC and Air - BP - Georgia , which specialised in fuel distribution , confirmed to the trial court that their companies had paid the amounts at issue pursuant to contracts that they had freely entered into with the ORG . They specified that in exchange for the fee the ORG licensed their ORG activities , and that without such certification it would have been impossible for FAC to host international flights .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by the trial court , PERSON . PERSON , the first deputy chairperson of the ORG , explained that at the material time , a new law , which should have been passed following the judgment of ORG of DATE , had been delayed and that , if the applicant had not decided to enter into contracts with companies whose activities were subject to regulation , the ORG , which received no funding from the ORG , would have had to cease operations . That would have meant that employees of NORP airports would no longer have been certified , that no aircraft would have been able to land at those airports and that no country would have allowed aircraft that had taken off from those airports onto its territory . By way of an example , PERSON , the airline behind the request which had resulted in the judgment of ORG DATE , leased its aircraft in GPE on the condition that the ORG , under an agreement entered into with the NORP civil aviation authority , assumed responsibility for supervising those aircraft and regulating the corresponding activities . If the ORG were to cease operations , GPE would no longer lease its aircraft to PERSON . It was to prevent any such blockages in the field of civil aviation in GPE that the applicant had entered into the contracts , in accordance with LAW and the judgment of ORG at issue .", "CARDINAL . The second deputy chairperson of the ORG told the court that he had personally worked on drafting contracts which were subsequently entered into with the CARDINAL civil aviation companies . He maintained that those contracts , which had become the only source of funding for the ORG , had become necessary after ORG had invalidated the relevant legal provisions by declaring them unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s accountant explained before the trial court that on DATE the ORG had been split from ORG , on the recommendation of ORG , and that it had become legally fully independent . The exercise of public duties had been delegated to it , including the supervision of flight safety . Since DATE , the ORG had not been funded from the ORG budget , and had therefore been obliged to collect duties from the various private companies working in civil aviation . However , since the relevant legal provisions regulating the collection of \u201c the DATE collection fee for transport activities \u201d had been declared invalid by ORG , the ORG , pending the passing by ORG of new legislation on the matter , had been forced to make contracts with civil aviation companies . Subsequently , after the amendment of LAW on DATE ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , the chairperson of the ORG , the applicant , had become entitled to issue orders setting the amount of fees payable by the companies .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by the trial court , the representatives of various other private companies working in civil aviation , who were contractors of the ORG , stated that prior to DATE , they had paid the regulation fee in accordance with the law . Following the judgment of ORG of DATE , they had stopped doing so and had only resumed payments on DATE , as a result of Order no . CARDINAL , issued by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by the trial court , the accountancy expert from ORG who had authored the audit report on the ORG \u2019s activities confirmed the conclusions in the report relating to the legality of the ORG \u2019s transactions DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions before the court , the applicant first reiterated the arguments he had made during the investigation , notably in his complaint of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant then argued that of the amounts which he had been unjustifiably accused of charging unlawfully , he had paid GEL CARDINAL ( some EUR CARDINAL ) to the ORG , while the remainder had been used to fund the ORG \u2019s operations ( see the aforementioned expert report cited at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . Consequently , neither he nor anyone else had derived any personal profit from the amounts in question . The applicant argued that the accountancy expert \u2019s report confirmed the legality of his actions . He explained that the reason ORG had delayed the entry into force of its judgment of DATE had been to grant ORG sufficient time to legislate and fill the gap arising from its judgment . In order not to leave the ORG without funds , which would have meant flight safety might have been compromised , ORG had clearly indicated in its judgment that the ORG could enter into contractual relationships with the aviation companies concerned , which would thus be able to negotiate conditions freely .", "CARDINAL . It was for the very same reasons as those espoused by ORG in its judgment that the NORP President had issued Decree no . CARDINAL on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . That decree , as well as section CARDINAL(d ) of LAW , gave a direct right to the applicant , as chairperson of the ORG , to collect duties by entering into contractual relations with companies working in civil aviation . Furthermore , the new law , required as a result of the judgment of ORG of DATE , had been passed on DATE and had entered into force on DATE . The applicant had issued Order no . CARDINAL in compliance with that law and had subsequently submitted it to ORG for registration . ORG had registered it on DATE , approving its retrospective application as of CARDINAL DATE under sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and DATE of ORG , on the grounds that all the companies covered by the Order had the necessary legal identification numbers and codes . The applicant pointed out that if it had been unlawful to apply the order at issue retrospectively , ORG would have informed the ORG and instructed it to make the necessary amendments , in accordance with the law . The applicant concluded that the actions he had taken in the exercise of his official duties had not been contrary to the judgment of ORG in question , or to any other legal provisions applicable at the material time , and thus could not qualify as abuse of power .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL episodes of abuse of power which the ORG had accused him of ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , but acquitted him of CARDINAL . The CARDINAL he was acquitted of was with respect to the ORG collecting \u201c an DATE registration fee for transport activities \u201d from CARDINAL private companies working in civil aviation , including GPE and FAC , DATE and DATE . The court established that the relevant amounts corresponded to debts owed to the ORG by those companies for the period prior to DATE .", "CARDINAL . As for the other CARDINAL episodes , ORG considered that the applicant had unlawfully entered into the contracts of CARDINAL March and CARDINAL DATE with GPE , FAC and AirBPGeorgia , in breach of ORG judgment of DATE . Thus , DATE and DATE , the ORG had unlawfully received the sums of GEL CARDINAL ( some ORG CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ( around EUR CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( some EUR CARDINAL ) respectively , from which the applicant had unlawfully paid his own salary and the salaries of his employees , and had financed the ORG \u2019s business trip and management expenses . Furthermore , the applicant was found guilty of unlawfully issuing Order no . CARDINAL , to which the applicant had moreover given retrospective effect , which served as the basis for collecting levies DATE and DATE from CARDINAL companies , amounting to GEL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( some EUR CARDINAL ) which had been spent in the same , unlawful way .", "CARDINAL . The Tbilisi City Court stated that it disagreed with the applicant \u2019s argument that the Constitutional Court judgment of DATE had given him the right to enter into contracts with the companies concerned and that the ORG would have been unable to continue to operate if those contracts not been entered into . However , the court did not give any reasons to explain its position .", "CARDINAL . As to the audit report prepared by the accountancy expert on the ORG \u2019s activities , the ORG restricted itself to noting that the expert in question was from ORG and that he had confirmed his conclusions when he had been questioned during the trial . The court gave no explanation for why it did not take the expert \u2019s statements into consideration .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of CARDINAL DATE found the applicant guilty of the crime provided for in LAW ( a ) of LAW and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . He was also banned from holding public office for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , stating that ORG had not established which of the impugned actions had breached the notion of public service requirements , within the meaning of LAW , what exactly the criminal offence had consisted of , what had been the reasons for it , and what its objectives and consequences had been . Furthermore , ORG had not explained how his actions had damaged the interests of CARDINAL companies , when none of those companies had expressed any interest in joining the criminal proceedings as civil parties or had ever initiated any separate civil proceedings against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by ORG , representatives of CARDINAL of the companies concerned stated that they had incurred no financial damage as a result of having paid the fees for the services provided by the ORG , either on the basis of the relevant contracts or Order no . CARDINAL . Moreover , the cost of the amounts paid had not been borne by the companies , since it had been included in the price of airplane tickets sold to the end consumer , who was airline passengers ( see also the accountancy expert \u2019s report cited at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . By a judgment of DATE ORG acquitted the applicant in respect of the charge relating to the aforementioned CARDINAL companies . It upheld the judgment of the lower court as to the remaining charges , notably the collection by the ORG of fees for services from the remaining CARDINAL companies on the basis of either contracts or Order no . CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s prison sentence was amended and set at DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law , arguing that his case had been examined superficially and that , amongst other things , the accountancy expert \u2019s report of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) had not been taken into consideration . The applicant complained that in examining the question of the existence of a loss to the aforementioned CARDINAL companies , ORG had failed to consider the case from the same point of view concerning the other companies , especially GPE , which had allegedly incurred the biggest loss . In fact , according to the applicant , ORG had completely failed to consider that part of the case or the accountancy expert \u2019s view that GPE could not have incurred a loss . The applicant concluded that the reasoning given by the lower court to prove his guilt had been manifestly insufficient and arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed the appeal on points of law by the applicant , stating that by continuing to charge the fees to the various private companies after DATE the applicant had misapplied the judgment of ORG of DATE and had thus committed an abuse of power , infringing the rights of various legal entities and the general legal interests of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . After serving his sentence in full , the applicant was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , well before the applicant had been placed under investigation and arrested , and shortly after the Rose Revolution that led to the resignation of President PERSON ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ) , Mr PERSON , who did not hold any State office at the time but was campaigning as a candidate to be elected president , addressed representatives of NORP companies in GPE \u2019s sports stadium . He stated that the objectives of the abolition of the old , corrupt and unfair regime had not involved simply replacing CARDINAL political clan with another . In particular , he promised that nepotism , irrespective of where it came from , whether from representatives of the old or the new regime , would no longer be the rule . Amongst other things , he stated in that regard :", "\u201c I heard more news on the television DATE : it would appear that NORP Ts ... , the chairman of a committee of the former parliament , took his son and had him appointed deputy chairman of ORG ! It is now CARDINAL . I will give [ the applicant ] : either he gets rid of Ts ... , or [ the applicant ] himself goes to jail ! ... It is said that we are instructing the prosecution authorities to arrest officials of the old regime but that this seems like a breach of their human rights ! Yes , I confirm , all those who should be arrested will be jailed . They only began to remember human rights when their own interests were threatened ... Where does the money come from [ for a former governor ] to hire lawyers to defend himself and ... live in a fivestar hotel in GPE , when TIME there costs the same as your pensions several times over ... ? Is not your money , GPE \u2019s money , being taken from your pockets ? ... \u201c", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the events which came after the speech of Mr PERSON , who was elected President of GPE in DATE , were as follows : the son of PERSON . immediately resigned as deputy chairman of the ORG , the applicant was placed under investigation in DATE on the aforementioned charges and the same PERSON . was reelected to parliament from Mr PERSON \u2019s presidential party list during the parliamentary elections of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
