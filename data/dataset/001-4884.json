The decree entered into force on DATE .", "On DATE the applicants , represented by counsel , specified their compensation claim as regards the plots of land affected by the DATE decree and extended their claim as regards the plots of land affected by the DATE decree .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 compensation claim as regards damages resulting from the DATE decree as well as regards damages resulting from the DATE decree . Referring to the relevant provisions of LAW , the court noted that anyone claiming damages resulting from a decree under LAW had to file a request for compensation within DATE of the entry into force of the respective decree . As to the DATE decree , the applicants had filed their compensation claim within the time - limit . However , they had implicitly waived their right to compensation as they had not pursued their claim for DATE . As to the DATE decree , the applicants had only filed their request on CARDINAL DATE . The court noted that the applicants had claimed to have made a supplementary request when lodging their first claim , in which they requested the court to take any changes of the danger zone into account and to take any necessary steps to compensate them for future damages . The court explicitly noted that it was irrelevant whether or not the applicants had filed the said supplementary request . Even if it had been made as claimed by the applicants , it did not fulfil the requirements of a compensation claim as is did not specify the plots of land concerned and the amount of compensation requested . The applicants had only made these submissions on CARDINAL DATE , i.e. outside DATE time - limit .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) upheld ORG decision as regards the refusal of compensation for damages resulting from the DATE decree . However , it quashed the said decision as regards the refusal of damages resulting from the DATE decree and referred the case back to ORG . Subsequently , the applicants were granted compensation in this respect .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed the ORG appeal on points of law . Referring to the relevant provisions of LAW , it noted that the claim to compensation only arises once the respective decree is issued . Thus , even assuming that the applicants had in DATE filed a supplementary request relating to possible future damages , such a request was inadmissible . As the applicants failed to specify their compensation claim within DATE of the entry into force of the DATE decree , their request was out of time and had to be rejected ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
