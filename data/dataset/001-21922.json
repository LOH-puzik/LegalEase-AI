At the time of introduction of the application , the applicant was detained in the GPE for expulsion purposes . He is represented before the ORG by Ms G.E.M. Later , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , following the apprehension of the NORP leader PERSON by the NORP authorities , a protest demonstration took place in GPE in the course of which protesters occupied the residence of the NORP Ambassador and members of the Ambassador \u2019s household were prevented from leaving the LOC . On DATE , the applicant was arrested and subsequently detained in police custody ( inverzekeringstelling ) on suspicion of involvement in the offence of unlawfully depriving a person of his of liberty .", "Whilst in police custody , the applicant \u2019s provisional placement in GPE detention ( voorlopige vreemdelingenbewaring ) was ordered , after he had been heard on this matter .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) against the decision to order his provisional placement in GPE detention and he requested the court to award him compensation .", "The applicant was released from custody on DATE and handed over to the NORP police ( vreemdelingenpolitie ) , who placed him in GPE detention for the purposes of expulsion ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) under LAW ( a ) of LAW ( PERSON ) .

It noted at the outset that the applicant did not hold a valid residence permit , that he lacked sufficient means of subsistence and that he had no fixed abode . In these circumstances , it accepted that the suspicions that the applicant would seek ways to evade his expulsion were not unfounded . It further noted that an order for the applicant \u2019s expulsion had been issued .", "Although ORG found that the hearing of the applicant on the measure of his provisional placement in GPE detention had fallen short of the requirements of LAW ) in that it had been conducted in too routinely a manner and it was not apparent that the applicant had realised what was at issue , it concluded that this had not harmed the applicant \u2019s material interests . On this point , ORG observed that hearings pursuant to LAW were held so that the person concerned might have an opportunity to put forward facts or circumstances which could lead to the conclusion that the imposition of this measure was not called for . However , at the hearing before ORG of DATE it could not be established whether any such facts or circumstances had in fact existed . ORG further held that it had not appeared that it was highly likely that the applicant \u2019s asylum request would be granted . It concluded that the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention was in accordance with LAW and , after having balanced all interests involved , could reasonably be regarded as justified . It consequently rejected the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation for the time spent in GPE detention .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that , in view of reports on what had happened to CARDINAL asylum seekers who had been expelled to GPE , a policy decision had been taken to suspend temporarily the expulsions of NORP nationals of NORP origin .

The lawfulness of a placement in GPE detention can , however , be challenged before a court . Where the court is of the opinion that there are no prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time , it can order that the measure of placement in GPE detention be terminated .", "It has been established in the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) of ORG that the interest of an alien to be released from GPE detention increases with the passage of time . Where a placement in GPE detention exceeds a period of DATE , it is generally held that the alien \u2019s interest in being released is greater than the interest to keep him in detention for the purposes of expulsion . Depending on the specific circumstances of each case , this point in time may also be reached before or after DATE have passed . It may be later where the alien frustrates the determination of his identity or nationality and it may be earlier where the alien concerned is unable to obtain travel documents for reasons beyond his control .", "Although no appeal lies against a decision by ORG in proceedings concerning requests for release from detention for expulsion purposes , an appeal to ORG ( Gerechtshof ) is available in relation to a decision taken in the context of such proceedings on a request for compensation for the time spent in detention for expulsion purposes .

CARDINAL )", "There is no time - limit for the filing of an appeal against a decision of placement in GPE detention and in principle a person placed in GPE detention may file as many appeals against this decision as he sees fit . When the lawfulness of a decision of placement in GPE detention has been determined for a first time , the examination of any subsequent appeal in this respect will be limited to the lawfulness of the continuation of the placement in GPE detention as from DATE last judicial decision taken on this point .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG requested ORG to suspend until DATE its examination of appeals , including requests for injunctions on expulsions , filed by asylum seekers of NORP origin , in view of a recent report of CARDINAL such asylum seeker having encountered serious problems after his expulsion to GPE . As the veracity of this report was not certain , the Minister of ORG had been requested to investigate the matter and to submit his findings as to the origin , background and veracity of the report before DATE .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that , in view of reports on what had happened to CARDINAL asylum seekers who had been expelled to GPE , a policy decision had been taken to suspend temporarily the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that the results of an investigation into the facts on the basis of which the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin had been temporarily suspended had led to the lifting of that suspension ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
