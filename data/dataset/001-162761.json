The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant fled from GPE to NORP because of pressure from the police , who suspected him of anti - constitutional activities in connection with his alleged NORP religious beliefs and practices . He feared , in particular , that if he stayed in GPE , he would face persecution from the ORG authorities , and would eventually be imprisoned and tortured like some of his fellow NORP friends . In support of his allegation of the risk of ill - treatment in GPE , the applicant submitted a copy of a list of persons who had been charged with offences against the ORG . The list had been prepared by ORG \u201c FAC , a non - governmental organisation based in GPE , and included the applicant \u2019s name . According to this document , the applicant was charged under LAW of LAW ( attempting to violently overthrow the ORG \u2019s constitutional order ) . At the top of the document , it was explained that the list had been compiled on the basis of the \u201c Bulletin on ORG prepared by the criminal investigation and counter - terrorism department of ORG of GPE and published in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP From NORP , the applicant went on to GPE and GPE . In DATE he arrived in GPE , where he settled in GPE . The applicant applied to the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in GPE for recognition as a refugee . He lived in GPE for DATE without experiencing any major problems . In DATE , however , together with some other NORP asylum seekers who had left their country for the same reasons , the applicant decided to flee from GPE following deportation threats . He claimed that the threats had been a response to certain disagreements with the NORP authorities over their living conditions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant entered GPE illegally through PERSON and went to GPE to apply for refugee status at the ORG . Following a preliminary interview , the applicant was referred to the ORG office in GPE . The PERSON office issued him with an asylum seeker certificate . Subsequently , he registered with the GPE police headquarters and started the domestic temporary asylum procedure . Thereafter he was given a temporary residence permit until DATE and was ordered to report to the police CARDINAL times a week for signature . It appears that the other NORP asylum seekers who had fled GPE together with the applicant were granted similar certificates and permits after following the same procedural steps .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the PERSON police sent a notice to a number of NORP families requiring them to appear at the police station on DATE . The notice stated that their attendance was required for the distribution of food rations and school stationery .", "CARDINAL . Although the applicant did not receive such a notice , at TIME on DATE he went to the police station for signature , as part of his DATE routine . Once at the police station , CARDINAL asylum seekers , including the applicant , were placed in detention . Their personal items , including identity documents , money and telephones , were confiscated . They were driven to the border at TIME and forcibly deported to GPE . The applicant was allegedly illtreated and threatened by the police during deportation .", "CARDINAL . After crossing the border to GPE on foot , the NORP asylum seekers , including the applicant , were captured and held hostage by people smugglers , who demanded MONEY to spare their lives and to release them . The asylum seekers contacted some other NORP who had managed to escape deportation from GPE and obtained the ransom fee . The smugglers made them walk for DATE to PERSON , a town close to the NORP border of GPE , where they were released .", "CARDINAL . After re - entering GPE illegally , the applicant went back to PERSON together with the other NORP asylum seekers . They requested legal advice from ORG , which , along with CARDINAL NORP non - governmental organisations , published a report on DATE regarding the NORP asylum ORG collective expulsion . It was argued in the report , inter alia , that the expulsion of the NORP by ORG authorities , despite their valid residence permits , had had no legal basis . It was also alleged that the expulsion had been motivated by political considerations to improve relations with GPE , which had been strained following the acceptance by GPE of members of NORP opposition groups , such as the applicant , as asylum seekers in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a number of NORP asylum seekers , who had previously been deported to GPE on DATE , were collected from their homes by police officers from the GPE police headquarters . TIME , they were deported to GPE once again . The applicant , however , escaped this deportation by pure chance , as the police did not have his correct home address .", "CARDINAL . The deportation of the applicant and the other NORP nationals was brought to the attention of the national and international public through press releases from various NGOs and the ORG . In particular , CARDINAL human rights and refugee rights organisations , including ORG , issued a press release in which they condemned the forced illegal deportation of the applicant and the other NORP nationals to GPE . Likewise , a NORP parliamentarian issued a press release within the ORG and criticised the removal as well as the existing refugee protection system in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s representative sent letters to , inter alia , ORG of ORG , ORG of the GPE office and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of ORG of the ORG of GPE replied to the applicant \u2019s representative that ORG had informed the ORG , in a letter dated DATE , that the applicant had been deported to GPE , a safe third country , in compliance with the legislation in force .", "CARDINAL . In his reply dated DATE , in his capacity as head of ORG of the GPE office , the Deputy Governor of PERSON informed the applicant \u2019s representative that the applicant and the other deportees had been removed to GPE in compliance with the legislation in force and that GPE was a safe third country where the applicant had lived before he had arrived in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a letter to the applicant \u2019s representative , informing him that the ORG had learned that the applicant , along with a number of other NORP nationals , had been illegally deported to GPE and that the applicant \u2019s asylum claim was under review . The ORG also informed the applicant \u2019s representative that on CARDINAL DATE they had sent a letter to the NORP authorities requesting the latter to take the necessary measures to grant the applicant and other NORP nationals who had been deported on DATE residence permits with a view to legalizing their status in GPE pending the completion of the procedures with regard to their cases .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , the applicant has been living in GPE in hiding and his application for refugee status under the mandate of the ORG is still under consideration . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE he was interviewed by officers from the ORG \u2019s GPE office regarding his application for refugee status . He has not received any information from the NORP authorities as to his request for asylum . The applicant can not approach the NORP authorities to apply for asylum or to obtain a temporary residence permit for fear of being deported to GPE , like the other NORP asylum seekers who were deported once again to GPE in DATE . Moreover , he can not appoint a lawyer to undertake the necessary legal and procedural actions on his behalf before the domestic authorities as he does not possess the necessary identity documents required to issue a power of attorney before a notary public .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant applied for asylum in GPE in DATE , he informed the authorities that he had been granted refugee status in GPE by the ORG . His application was registered and he was asked not to leave the city of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant left PERSON and returned there on CARDINAL DATE . He subsequently repeated his asylum request .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s asylum request was assessed in the light of LAW , LAW , LAW and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the national legislation . He was subsequently deported to GPE , a safe third country , where he was recognised as a refugee by the ORG . According to a document signed by CARDINAL police officers and CARDINAL military officer , submitted by the Government , CARDINAL NORP and NORP nationals , including the applicant , were deported on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the applicant was not deprived of his liberty . Moreover , his identity documents were not confiscated .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained under LAW , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention that he had been unlawfully deported to GPE on DATE without an individual assessment of his situation and claims , and whilst he was legally residing in GPE , and that he had not been informed of the decision to deport him to GPE on DATE and , thus , had had no effective domestic remedies to challenge it .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicant \u2019s claims were not substantiated .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that this part of the application should be examined under LAW alone . However , having regard to its reasoning which led it to conclude LAW was breached in the present case , the ORG finds nothing that would justify a separate examination of the same facts from the angle of LAW of the Convention . It therefore deems it unnecessary to rule separately on either the admissibility or the merits of the applicant \u2019s complaints under this head ( see PERSON and PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
