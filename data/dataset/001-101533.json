He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in Helsingfors . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON Kosonen of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG unsuccessfully tried to recover debts from the applicant .", "On DATE a property company petitioned ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten , k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus ) for the applicant to be declared bankrupt .", "The Bailiff tried to reach the applicant CARDINAL times at his registered home address in order to serve the notice on the bankruptcy proceedings . The applicant 's telephone number could not be found by the directory service and he did not answer the door intercom . The Bailiff managed to get into the staircase and saw light coming from the applicant 's apartment but he did not answer the doorbell . The Bailiff left a meeting request in his post box , to which the applicant also failed to react .", "As the applicant could not be reached during the service period set by ORG and running from DATE to DATE , a letter was sent to the applicant 's address on DATE , confirming that the notice had been served and that the documents were kept available at the local police station .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a letter to ORG requesting that the case documents be translated from NORP into NORP . The letter was sent from the same address where the Bailiff had attempted to serve the notice .", "On an unspecified date the applicant requested that ORG extend the deadline for his written reply . The deadline was accordingly extended until DATE .", "On DATE the applicant applied for an adjustment of his debts . As required by the domestic legislation , the bankruptcy proceedings were postponed and were continued only after ORG had refused to grant the debt adjustment . Thereafter , on DATE , the applicant was again requested to submit a written reply by DATE .", "When attempting to serve the above - mentioned request at the applicant 's address , the Bailiff learned that the applicant had moved . He tried to reach the applicant at his new address in DATE .", "Following a request made by the Bailiff on DATE , the service period was extended until DATE . On DATE the applicant was informed by letter that the request had been served and that the documents were again made available at the local police station .", "ORG resumed the bankruptcy proceedings . The applicant did not request that the deadline for his written reply be extended , nor did he submit any reply . According to the Government , the applicant was personally present at ORG when swearing to the accuracy of the inventory of the estate .", "On DATE ORG declared the applicant bankrupt . It noted that the applicant , who had been invited to reply to the petition within a given time , had failed to do so . It also noted that the claim was based on a final default judgment and on the fact that the claims mentioned therein had been transferred to the company . The company also had in its possession promissory notes signed by the applicant and which he had not contested . The court found that the applicant was insolvent since the debt recovery on DATE had been unsuccessful and the petition for bankruptcy had been lodged within DATE from that date .", "The file does not disclose whether or not ORG held an oral hearing .", "On DATE the applicant appealed , applying for an injunction and an oral hearing in the appellate court with a view to hearing witnesses as to whether he was insolvent . He argued that although he had moved to a new address in DATE , the court had sent to his old address a letter dated DATE in which he was invited to submit his reply by DATE . This letter had never reached the applicant . On DATE the Bailiff had sent a letter to the applicant informing him that documents to be served had been deposited at the police station . The letter did not mention what those documents concerned . The applicant claimed that he had received the letter at the earliest on DATE but as he had been travelling he had learned about the documents and the fact that they related to the bankruptcy proceedings only on DATE when he contacted the police station .", "As to the merits of the appeal , he relied on LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( konkurslagen , konkurssilaki ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) according to which a debtor can not be declared bankrupt if the creditor has a protective lien . He also argued that the creditor had failed to produce evidence of his insolvency as ORG attestation was not sufficient for the purposes of LAW . At the material time , the applicant had assets outside ORG district which did not appear in the attestation .", "On DATE ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten , hovioikeus ) dismissed the request for an injunction . On DATE it dismissed the applicant 's renewed request to the same effect .", "In its decision of DATE ORG noted first that the applicant had been able to establish a probability , in accordance with LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Code of Judicial Procedure ( r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken , oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari ) , that he had not been able to refer to the circumstances and evidence relied on in his appeal in ORG . For this reason the court considered all circumstances and evidence relied on in the applicant 's appeal . As concerned the serving of the documents , ORG noted that in DATE the Bailiff had looked for the applicant at the address which the latter had communicated to ORG . Subsequently , the Bailiff had found out that the applicant had moved to another municipality following which he had unsuccessfully looked for the applicant at his new address in DATE . In the circumstances , the Bailiff could assume that the applicant was trying to avoid the service of the documents . The court also observed that ORG in a precedent ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) had taken the view that it was irrelevant for the purposes of the application of LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW whether the person concerned later shows that he was not avoiding trial . ORG therefore concluded that , in the present case , it had been justified to serve the documents by leaving them with the local police and rejected the applicant 's view that there had been a procedural error .", "As to whether the conditions for declaring the applicant bankrupt were met , it endorsed the lower court 's reasons , adding , inter alia , that it was clear from the appeal documents that the unemployed applicant 's assets amounted to CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) whereas his debts ran to some EUR CARDINAL . It was therefore unnecessary to hold an oral hearing in order to examine whether the applicant was insolvent .", "The applicant sought leave to appeal , maintaining the grounds for his appeal . On DATE ORG ( h\u00f6gsta domstolen , korkein oikeus ) refused such leave .", "According to LAW , LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken , oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari ; as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The summons shall state that the written response is to be delivered to the court registry before a deadline counted from the service of the summons . An extension may be granted for a special reason , if the request for this has been submitted before DATE . \u201d", "LAW , section CARDINAL , of MONEY ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides the following :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) When a process server , for the purpose of service of a notice , has sought a person with a known residence in GPE , but has not found him or her or any person competent to receive service in his or her stead , and on the basis of the circumstances it may be assumed that he or she is evading the service of the notice , the process server may serve the notice by delivering the documents to a household member who has attained DATE , or , if the said person conducts a business , to a person employed in this business . If none of the above can be found , service of the notice may be performed by delivering the documents to a local police authority .", "( CARDINAL ) When the process server has performed the service of the notice pursuant to subsection CARDINAL , he or she shall notify the recipient of the same by a letter sent to the home address of the recipient .", "( CARDINAL ) The service of the notice shall be deemed to have taken place when the letter referred to in subsection CARDINAL has been given to be delivered by post .", "( CARDINAL ) The summons in a criminal case may not be served on the defendant in the manner provided in this section . ( CARDINAL ) \u201d", "LAW , LAW , of the same Code regulates service procedure in a civil matter with multiple respondents the following manner :", "\u201c In a civil case involving CARDINAL or more parties jointly , the notices shall be separately served on each party as provided in sections CARDINAL\u2014CARDINAL . If a notice is to be served on so many recipients that separate service on each of them can not be done without difficulty , the court may order that the notice is to be served on CARDINAL of them . A summary of the contents and the name of the person on whom the notice has been served , as well as information on the place where the documents to be served are kept available , shall be published as provided in section CARDINAL . The service shall be deemed to have been performed when the public notice has been published in ORG . \u201d", "As concerns the possibility to present new material in ORG , according to LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the same LAW ( as amended by LAW no . PERSON ) :", "\u201c In a civil case , the appellant may not refer in ORG to other circumstances or evidence than those presented in ORG , unless he or she establishes a probability that he or she had not been able to refer to the circumstance or evidence in ORG or that he or she has had a justifiable reason for not doing so . \u201d", "In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , ORG addressed the issue of serving a notice on a presumably absent applicant in a civil case . In that precedent case the applicant had not been reached by the Bailiff but had for legitimate reasons been temporarily residing abroad and had notified ORG of his temporary place of residence . A certificate on the applicant 's domicile issued by the registry office did not however include information on his temporary address . As relatives and neighbours had not known about the applicant 's temporary address either , ORG held that the Bailiff had rightly assumed , for the purposes of the serving of the notice , that the applicant was attempting to hide from the authorities . The applicant 's later clarification of the issue was not relevant in this regard . It followed that the notice could legitimately have been served on the applicant in accordance with the requirements of LAW , LAW , of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
