The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG lodged a criminal complaint against a number of its employees , including the applicant , alleging suppression of documents , forgery and uttering , and fraud , offences which it claimed had caused it a loss of MONEY . It accused the employees concerned of having debited the account of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) using CARDINAL cheques from a cheque book that had been produced in the railway company \u2019s name but never actually issued to it . On DATE the public prosecutor instituted proceedings against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was summoned to appear before the investigating judge and was placed in pre - trial detention . On DATE he was released on bail , subject to court supervision entailing , among other things , a ban on leaving the country .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG committed some of the accused , including the applicant , for trial in ORG , composed of CARDINAL judges as is the rule for cases dealt with by courts of appeal at first instance .", "CARDINAL . The hearing , initially set down for DATE , was adjourned firstly until DATE because of a strike by members of ORG and subsequently until DATE because of the ill health of CARDINAL of the other defendants . On DATE the hearing was again adjourned , this time until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who before joining the bank had been an officer in the merchant navy , applied to have the ban on his leaving the country lifted so that he could work in the navy again . He argued that he needed to be in gainful employment in order to support his wife and CARDINAL children and pointed out that the proceedings had been adjourned several times by the court itself . However , his application was refused by the public prosecutor and subsequently by ORG , ORG having earlier rejected a similar application .", "CARDINAL . The trial finally began on DATE \u2013 five years , DATE and DATE after ORG decision of DATE and DATE after the complaint had been lodged and the proceedings instituted . Hearings were held on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . CARDINAL of the co - defendants requested the production in court of the back - up tape for the bank \u2019s computer ( but not the cheques in question ) . Counsel for the bank produced a declaration by the bank \u2019s information technology department attesting that the copies of the computer tapes in the file were authentic . The declaration was read out at the hearing without eliciting any reaction from the defendants . During the trial CARDINAL documents were read out and evidence was heard from CARDINAL witnesses .", "ORG gave judgment on DATE . It convicted the applicant and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , to be reduced by the period already spent in pre - trial detention , and ordered the confiscation and destruction of the CARDINAL cheques in question . Lastly , it ruled that if the applicant decided to appeal , the appeal would suspend the execution of the sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment to the appropriate court , namely ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges . On DATE that court upheld the judgment delivered at first instance but reduced the sentence to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . During the trial the applicant had requested the production of certain extracts from the log file of the bank \u2019s computer and of the original cheques and had asked for a handwriting expert , PERSON , to be summoned and cross - examined in the presence of another handwriting expert .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused those requests on the following grounds :", "\u201c The precision and authenticity of the extracts from the bank \u2019s central computer records , accompanied by declarations by senior executives of the bank , are beyond dispute , and the production of the extracts is unnecessary . Nor is there any need to summon and cross - examine PERSON , because he has drawn up a detailed report which was read out at the trial . Lastly , the photocopies of the relevant cheques , which none of the parties disputes are forged , satisfy the needs of the proceedings and production of the originals therefore serves no purpose . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG read out the items of evidence that had already been adduced at first instance and heard evidence from CARDINAL prosecution and CARDINAL defence witnesses .", "CARDINAL . It noted that , contrary to what the applicant had maintained , the connection between the cheques in question and the ORG \u2019s account could not have been established by members of the bank \u2019s information technology department , which was empowered only to process data from branches . It further observed that on the date of the offence , the applicant had been the only person to use the computer on which the offence had been committed . The handwriting expert had concluded that characteristics of the applicant \u2019s handwriting and signature were visible on the cheques . Lastly , ORG noted that the applicant was one of the very limited number of the bank \u2019s employees who knew the ORG \u2019s account number and the names of the ORG employees authorised to issue cheques .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment appealed against in respect of the charges of suppressing documents and forgery and uttering , and remitted the case to ORG in respect of the charge of fraud only .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE . The applicant again requested the production of extracts from the bank \u2019s log file and sought a declaration from counsel for the bank attesting that the photocopies of the cheques were authentic . ORG refused those requests . With regard to the first request , it ruled that it was impossible to recover the extracts from the bank \u2019s log file because the relevant tape reels had not been kept , and added that the authenticity of the documents in question was clear from other pieces of documentary evidence . It construed the second request as an attempt to establish whether the defendant had had an accomplice , whereas his guilt was apparent from other evidence . ORG also held that it had not been proved that the photocopies of the cheques had been falsified . It concluded that the defendant had committed the offence on the basis of a pre - defined plan , which he had intended to carry out several times in order to misappropriate funds from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of fraud within the meaning of LAW , holding that the loss sustained by the bank had resulted from deception on the part of its employees and that the question whether the computer had been used or not was irrelevant . It sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ( to be reduced by DATE , the period already spent in pre - trial detention ) and ordered the destruction of the forged cheques .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on an appeal by the applicant , upheld ORG judgment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
