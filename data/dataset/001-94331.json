He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a law firm based in GPE .", "The applicant comes from a successful family of jewellers . In around DATE , the applicant moved from GPE to GPE , where he began a business working with his cousin and brother - in - law , PERSON . It is disputed whether the applicant and PERSON were equal partners in the business in GPE and in subsequent businesses established .", "In DATE , the applicant married and his wife , PERSON , joined him in GPE .", "By DATE , the applicant wished to expand the business outside GPE . He incorporated the GPE business , which became ORG , GPE . The applicant and his family subsequently moved to GPE .", "The applicant claims to have entered into a written joint venture agreement with PERSON in DATE specifying that they were in business as equal partners , each owning MONEY of the assets and being responsible for MONEY of the liabilities of the jewellery business . This claim was later contested by PERSON .", "In DATE , the applicant incorporated ORG , a GPE company . The company acquired the lease of a shop in GPE and the applicant has subsequently built up a prestigious jewellery business trading from those LOC .", "In DATE , the applicant caused a PERSON company to be formed , ORG Initially the applicant and PERSON were the CARDINAL shareholders and directors .", "It was around this time , PERSON alleges , that the marriage began to deteriorate .", "The applicant claims that he and PERSON entered a second joint venture agreement in DATE .", "In DATE , the applicant decided to set up an offshore trust , following tax advice from his lawyers .", "In DATE , a GPE company , ORG , was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of ORG became the holding company for the other CARDINAL companies in ORG , including ORG ( GPE ) and ORG ( GPE ) . At the same time , most of the shares of ORG were bought in by the company and loan accounts in the name of the applicant and PERSON were set up .", "In DATE , the applicant and his family moved to GPE . On DATE , the IMK Family Trust was created in GPE . Its trustees were ORG ( GPE ) . The applicant and PERSON transferred their remaining shares in ORG to the ORG trustees , to be held under the terms of the trust . The settlors of the trust were therefore expressed to be the applicant and PERSON , and the beneficiaries were the applicant and PERSON and their children .", "On DATE the applicant and PERSON separated . The applicant subsequently removed PERSON as a beneficiary of ORG and a second GPE trust , ORG .", "PERSON applied to ORG for a decree nisi and ancillary relief for herself and the CARDINAL children of the family . The hearing commenced on DATE .", "On DATE of the hearing , the applicant and his legal team withdrew from the proceedings following the discovery that evidence upon which the applicant sought to rely in order to support his claim that he had entered into a second joint venture agreement with PERSON was false .", "The hearing continued in the applicant \u2019s absence . Mr Justice Bodey had the benefit of evidence from experts instructed by the applicant and by PERSON on the global trading conditions for the jewellery industry . PERSON expert also gave oral evidence .", "In his judgment of DATE , Mr PERSON considered the financial position of the applicant in light of the evidence he had heard regarding the jewellery industry . The judge also considered other assets held by the applicant , or alleged to be held by him . He concluded that the applicant had other undisclosed assets which were or may be of considerable value .", "As to the applicant \u2019s claim that PERSON was entitled to MONEY of all his assets , the judge noted that all the relevant assets were in the applicant \u2019s sole name and were not legally owned in any way by PERSON . He found that the burden must fall on the applicant and PERSON to establish the equitable or moral claim asserted by PERSON , on a balance of probabilities . The judge considered affidavits from CARDINAL witnesses as to the existence of a partnership between the applicant and PERSON and took into account expert evidence as to the cultural differences between business arrangements in GPE compared to GPE . He found that :", "\u201c I am satisfied that nothing said by the [ applicant ] , PERSON or their witnesses is sufficiently cogent ( certainly without having seen them and heard them cross - examined ) to outweigh the matters set out ... below , the strong thrust of which is firmly against the existence of any kind of partnership or sharing agreement \u201d .", "Mr Justice PERSON made an order that the applicant should pay to Mrs PERSON a lump sum of GBP CARDINAL . He was further ordered to make periodical payments of ORG CARDINAL to PERSON until payment of the lump sum , as well as periodical payments in respect of the children . The judge also ordered that if the applicant failed to pay the lump sum or provide security for it within TIME of being served with the judgment , then he should deliver up to PERSON solicitors the whole stock of jewellery and artefacts listed in a schedule delivered to the court ( owned either by ORG or ORG ) to be sold to meet the award made under the judgment .", "The applicant sought to appeal the order . On DATE ORG dismissed his application for permission to appeal . PERSON referred to the husband \u2019s and Mr PERSON \u2019s evidence about the alleged joint venture agreement as being \u201c nothing more nor less than a fraud \u201d , and he considered significant the husband \u2019s \u201c determined \u201d and \u201c dishonest \u201d litigation strategy .", "On DATE , having heard evidence from several parties , including the financial director of CARDINAL of the GPE companies , Mr Justice Bodey in ORG accepted that as a matter of law , the court could not \u201c pierce the corporate veil \u201d ( i.e. it could not ignore the company / trust structure through which the jewellery stock was owned ) . He therefore discharged the paragraph of his order of DATE in which he ordered the delivery up and sale of the jewellery stock . He found nonetheless that the applicant did have undisclosed assets from which he could make the lump sum payment . He further considered that it was plain that the applicant controlled the ORG , which was revealed both by the documents setting up the trust and the ease with which he had arranged for PERSON name to be removed from the trust beneficiaries . While the court was not able to pierce the corporate veil in order to seize the company assets directly , the applicant could nonetheless in practice use his ultimate ownership of the business structure to raise the sums required by accessing the underlying resources .", "By DATE , PERSON had obtained a total of GBP CARDINAL of the lump sum through charging orders on CARDINAL flats owned by the applicant . The applicant made the periodical payments in full until DATE , at which point he began making reduced payments of around GBP CARDINAL . In DATE , he reduced the payments further , to around GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL . He stopped the payments altogether in DATE .", "On DATE , PERSON made an application to enforce the unpaid balance of the lump sum . She sought : ( a ) to set aside the transfer of assets into ORG in DATE ; ( b ) to set aside the document of exclusion in DATE whereby the applicant excluded her as a beneficiary of the trust ; ( c ) to vary the trust as a post - nuptial settlement such that the trustees would hold for her absolutely that value of the trust assets as equated to the outstanding sums arising from the DATE orders ; and ( d ) to be released from an undertaking given by her not to litigate against the trust except within the jurisdiction of GPE and GPE . In addition to the primary relief sought , PERSON also sought an order barring the applicant from opposing her applications by taking part in proceedings , pursuant to a jurisdiction founded on a ORG of Appeal decision from DATE in the case of PERSON [ DATE ] P CARDINAL ( \u201c a GPE order \u201d ) .", "On DATE , Mr Justice Bodey delivered judgment in relation to PERSON application for a GPE order . He accepted that a GPE order was competent where a party to proceedings was in contempt and concluded that non - payment in breach of a matrimonial order to pay money was in itself a contempt of court , whether or not such non - payment could be described as \u201c culpable \u201d ( i.e. whether or not the non - paying party had the means to pay ) . The question therefore arose as to how the court ought to act on the contempt established . Mr Justice Bodey considered it \u201c blindingly obvious \u201d that the applicant could have paid a great deal more towards the outstanding balance of the lump sum than he had paid . However , in the event , he refused to make an order barring the applicant from the proceedings altogether . Instead , he made an order requiring the applicant to fulfil certain conditions before he would be able to participate in the substantive hearing . He noted ( at paragraph CARDINAL of his judgment ) :", "\u201c I am satisfied that the husband can and should be placed on certain terms . This is exceptional and unusual , but it is an exceptional and unusual case . To echo the words of Lord PERSON in GPE , it merits \u2018 a strong thing\u2019 . \u201d", "As to the terms of the order , the judge stipulated as follows :", "\u201c ( a ) By DATE ( or by such other date as the parties may agree or the court may direct ) the husband do by recorded delivery letter inform the trustees of ORG in terms expressed to be irrevocable :", "( i ) that he accepts that he is bound by the court \u2019s orders , awards and findings of DATE and can not go behind them ( including in particular the finding that Mr. PERSON has no interest in the Trust assets ) ;", "( ii ) that he wishes the trustees to assist him in meeting his obligations under the orders of this court and wishes them not to take any steps having the effect of making it more difficult for him to do so ; and", "( iii ) that he accepts that ( subject to appeal ) he is bound by whatever orders the court may make on the wife \u2019s pending applications in DATE , and that ( again ) he wishes the trustees to give full effect to those orders ; and", "CARDINAL . NORP ( b ) For each \u00a3 CARDINAL he pays to his own lawyers for preparation , representation or advice in respect of the DATE hearing from now on , he do pay \u00a3 MONEY into a joint account in the names of the parties\u2019 respective solicitors . ( This is what I called during the hearing \u2018 pound for pound\u2019 ) . The money so lodged is to be held to the order of the court , but is to be paid out to the wife \u2019s solicitors at the conclusion of DATE hearing unless , when dealing with costs at the end of that hearing , the court should positively rule otherwise in its overall discretion .", "( c ) The husband \u2019s solicitors are , by DATE , to confirm to the wife \u2019s solicitors whether the husband has complied with paragraph ( a ) of these terms ( enclosing a copy of the husband \u2019s letter concerned ) and are to keep the wife \u2019s solicitors regularly appraised of each payment made to them by the husband from now on , unless any such payment is not in any way connected with the DATE hearing . \u201d", "The order stipulated that in the event of a dispute as to whether the applicant had complied with the terms of the order , the parties were at liberty to apply to the court for a determination on the matter .", "In making the order , the judge was mindful of the requirements of LAW . In particular , he commented :", "\u201c CARDINAL . These terms are not intended to punish or penalise the husband , which would be a wrong objective ... Rather they have what I regard as the legitimate aims of trying to create a fair hearing for both parties and/or facilitating the enforcement of the court \u2019s orders ...", "CARDINAL . The terms are also , in my judgment , proportionate . The link exists which [ counsel for the applicant ] submits is required between contempt and sanction . \u2018 Term ( a)\u2019 requires the husband to do no more than to attempt to comply with the orders of the court . \u2018 Term ( ORG seeks to moderate his ability to continue to employ ORG legal team whilst simultaneously failing to pay the wife any of the monies owed to her and leaving her reliant on credit in trying to achieve enforcement .", "CARDINAL . Only \u2018 term ( b)\u2019 requires the husband to find any money . It does not stop him litigating nor being legally represented . It merely creates an opportunity for the court to ensure that this wife , who is owed substantial sums , is not unduly disadvantaged in funding the litigation by reason of the husband \u2019s wilful non - compliance with the court \u2019s orders ...", "CARDINAL . If the husband complies with the above terms then he may fully participate at the hearing in DATE . Otherwise he will be debarred from so doing . \u201d", "The applicant sought leave to appeal against the order . Leave was refused on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant wrote to the trustees of the IMK Family Trust purporting to comply with the conditions of the order of CARDINAL DATE . In his letter , he emphasised that he was \u201c deeply unhappy at being compelled by the court to write in this manner \u201d and that his \u201c sole purpose in doing so is to enable me to resist strenuously the current application which my wife has made \u201d . He confirmed that he was bound by previous findings of the court as to PERSON interest \u201c ... despite the fact that neither Mr PERSON nor I agree with the findings the learned judge made and that I contend that he made an order for me to pay a sum that I can not afford to pay \u201d . He confirmed that he would be bound by an order made in DATE and continued :", "\u201c I wish to give effect to any such order provided that this can be achieved without prejudicing the viability of PERSON \u2019s companies to trade , or prejudicing their obligations to their employees or their liabilities to their creditors . \u201d", "The letter concluded by stating that the applicant would like the trustees to assist him in meeting his obligations to pay his wife the sums awarded , again provided that the money could be raised without prejudicing the viability of PERSON \u2019s companies to trade , or prejudicing their obligations to their employees or their liabilities to their creditors .", "On DATE , PERSON applied to the court for a determination of whether the applicant had satisfied the conditions imposed .", "On DATE , Mr Justice Bodey found that the applicant had failed to comply adequately with the terms set out in paragraph ( a ) of the order . He made a further order , in the following terms :", "\u201c Unless the [ applicant ] shall send by recorded delivery by TIME on DATE to the Trustees of the IMK Family Trust a letter in the terms of the letter attached to this order , pursuant to ... the order of CARDINALth DATE he shall be debarred from participating in the substantive hearing of [ PERSON ] applications listed for hearing on DATE . \u201d", "The attached letter reproduced almost exactly the terms of paragraphs ( a ) ( i ) to ( iii ) of the order of CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant subsequently sent a letter in the ordered terms and the proceedings before ORG took place with his participation .", "On DATE , Mr Justice PERSON gave judgment . He refused the first CARDINAL applications , namely to set aside the transfer of assets into ORG in DATE and to set aside the document of exclusion in DATE whereby PERSON was excluded as a beneficiary of the trust . However , he granted the third application and varied the terms of ORG so as to require the trustee to pay PERSON an amount equalling the balance owing under the lump sum , any arrears of periodic payments and the balance of costs still due .", "The applicant \u2019s application for leave to appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . ORG noted that in refusing leave on the papers , PERSON had commented that :", "\u201c ... the application falls to be considered in the context of over DATE of litigation , rightly described by PERSON as \u2018 Titanic\u2019 . The husband is and has been for DATE in contempt . He cynically incurs and discharges massive litigation bills with , as I infer , the intention of depriving the wife of her entitlement to independent affluence . This court should not encourage or collude in his apparent strategy . \u201d", "ORG later reiterated ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c At this point it is , I think , necessary , and therefore needs to be stated again , that this is not a case of can not pay ; it is case of will not pay , and CARDINAL of the worst of its kind . \u201d", "He later added ( at paragraph DATE ) :", "\u201c I remind myself that the reason for the application has been [ the applicant \u2019s ] grossly contumacious refusal to pay . Had he paid , none of this would be necessary . \u201d", "PERSON then applied to ORG , where the trust was based , seeking enforcement of the order of PERSON Justice PERSON . On DATE , the court handed down its judgment . It noted that by that stage , some GBP CARDINAL was owed to PERSON but concluded that it was unable to enforce the judgment of ORG in light of the relevant legislation in force in GPE . However , it considered an alternative argument advanced by PERSON that the trust could be varied by consent of all the beneficiaries , namely the applicant and the children of the marriage . The court noted that the CARDINAL adult children consented to the variation in favour of PERSON . As regards the minor and unborn children , the court approved the alteration of the trust as being to their benefit . In respect of the applicant , the court considered his letter to the trustees following the order of Mr Justice PERSON of DATE and concluded that the letter demonstrated that the applicant had consented to the variation of the trust . It emphasised that the applicant had had a choice whether to refuse to write the letter , and thus be prevented from participating in the hearing before Mr PERSON , or to write the letter and thereby be able to participate in the hearing . The court noted ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c It was a matter entirely for [ the applicant ] . He chose the latter course . He wrote the letter . He therefore obtained the advantage of appearing before PERSON and he did this by leading and junior counsel who argued strongly against the wife \u2019s application . It is of interest that the hearing before PERSON apparently took DATE . \u201d", "The court concluded ( at DATE to CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The terms of the DATE letter are clear . The husband confirms that he is bound by the PERSON order and wishes the ORG to give effect to it , i.e. he wishes effect to be given to the alteration to the ORG made by PERSON Is he now to be allowed to renege on that letter ? We do not think so . The husband chose to write the letter and to participate in the hearing before PERSON The whole purpose of the GPE order made by PERSON was to require the husband to agree to be bound by the outcome of the hearing before PERSON if he wished to participate . In exchange for this assurance , the husband was permitted to participate in the hearing and to seek to persuade PERSON not to accede to the wife \u2019s application . In this respect he was successful on CARDINAL of the CARDINAL heads of application ... He therefore obtained a tangible advantage by agreeing to write the DATE letter .", "We strongly deprecate the idea that , having obtained this advantage , he should now be permitted to disown the DATE letter as , for example , he has sought to do in a recent undated letter to the ORG indicating that he opposes the wife \u2019s application to this ORG . He has made his choice and he is bound by it . We therefore have no hesitation in finding that he should be treated as consenting to the alteration to the ORG contained in the PERSON order notwithstanding his later attempt to renege .", "We would emphasise that our decision to treat the husband as having consented on the basis of the DATE letter is wholly exceptional in the light of the particular circumstances of this case . Firstly , the husband was in flagrant and longstanding contempt of the LANGUAGE order ; but secondly and most importantly , he exercised his free will in choosing to write the letter ... \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG judgment was unsuccessful .", "It used to be the case in GPE that a person in contempt would not be heard , although there were certain defined exceptions . However , this rule was clarified in the case of PERSON [ DATE ] P. CARDINAL , in which Lord PERSON indicated that :", "\u201c ... It is a strong thing for a court to refuse to hear a party to a cause and it is only be justified by grave considerations of public policy . It is a step which a court will only take when the contempt itself impedes the course of justice and there is no other effective means of securing [ his ] compliance ... I am of the opinion that the fact that a party to a cause has disobeyed an order of the court is not , of itself , a bar to his being heard but if his disobedience is such that , so long as it continues , it impedes the course of justice in the cause by making it more difficult for the court to ascertain the truth or to enforce the orders which it may make , then the court may in its discretion refuse to hear him until the impediment is removed or good reason is shown why it should not be removed . \u201d", "This approach was accepted and approved by ORG in X ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL , in which Lord PERSON of PERSON stated :", "\u201c ... It is suggested that to decline to hear an Appellant who is in contempt infringes the maxim \u2018 audi alteram partem\u2019 which lies at the route of every civilised system of law ... For my part I think this is too facile an analysis . The maxim \u2018 audi alteram partem\u2019 means not that a party has an absolute right in all circumstances to be heard in his own defence , but that he must be given a proper opportunity to be heard . So long as that opportunity is given upon terms with which the proposing appellant can reasonably comply , there is not and there should not be any impediment in principle to the imposition by the court of proper conditions which require to be complied with before the appeal is heard ... \u201d", "Subsequently , in ORG v. PERSON ( Unreported ) DATE , Lord PERSON ( as he then was ) formulated the relevant question as follows :", "\u201c ... whether , in the circumstances of an individual case , the interests of justice are best served by hearing a party in contempt or by refusing to do so , always bearing in mind the paramount importance which the court must attach to the prompt and unquestioning observance of court orders . \u201d", "This was approved by Lord PERSON in ORG in PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL .", "As regards the implications of limitations on access to court and compliance with LAW indicated in ORG Uzan ( No.CARDINAL ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL W.L.R. CARDINAL that :", "\u201c ... It is clear that the right of access to the court which is implied in DATE is not an absolute right but one that is open to restriction provided that the restriction has a legitimate aim in the public interest and that the means employed to realise that aim are proportionate ... The test of proportionality is to be applied on a case by case basis ... As it seems to us , this is reflected in the approach of ORG in X ORG v. ORG ... the width of discretion there recognised being apt to allow issues of proportionality to be properly considered and applied by the court in coming to its decision whether or not to hear a contemnor . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
