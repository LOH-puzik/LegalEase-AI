I told him that I knew a person , PERSON , who knew a third person who could provide explosives . NORP suggested me that that person could bring the explosives firstly to the ORG petrol station and then in the village of PERSON ... I hired a taxi and went to meet Mr A.P. ... I told him about the potential buyer , without specifying the quantity and price of the required explosives . It was something for him to agree upon with PERSON accepted ... I called Mr PERSON to ask him , if possible , to come in his car ... I stayed in the village of PERSON in order to meet with NORP whom I met at the petrol station . We stayed there for TIME , until Mr GPE and Mr PERSON arrived . We had a coffee ... when Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON arrived , I got into the car and continued towards PERSON .

Asked by his representative , he stated that he would not have taken part in any of the activities had it not been for NORP , who had incited him to find explosives . In his concluding remarks , the applicant \u2019s representative stated that NORP , acting as an agent provocateur , had instigated the offence . He further argued that the prosecution had failed to secure NORP \u2019s attendance at the trial so that evidence could be taken from him .", "On DATE the trial court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It established that Mr T.A. had taken explosives in DATE from a mine where he had worked . On TIME of DATE , the applicant had agreed with Mr GPE and Mr PERSON to sell the explosives to NORP The transaction was supposed to take place in the village of FAC . DATE , Mr GPE and Mr PERSON went to Mr T.A. \u2019s house and obtained the explosives from the latter \u2019s wife , PERSON They put the explosives in their car and drove towards Stip . The applicant joined them in the car at the ORG petrol station near Stip . They were stopped by police on their way to the village of FAC , where the sales transaction , which had earlier been agreed between the applicant and NORP , should have taken place .

The court also referred to documentary evidence , namely CARDINAL expert reports , several search reports , photo evidence and the explosives and detonators found . The trial court rejected the applicant \u2019s allegations of being entrapped by an agent provocateur as \u201c ill - founded \u201d and \u201c irrelevant \u201d .", "On DATE the applicant , through his representative , complained that , inter alia , the trial court had not provided reasons for rejecting his request to examine the key witness on his behalf , namely the agent provocateur . He argued that there was considerable evidence that he had been incited by a police informer to uncover the person who was able to obtain explosives , even though the police had already known about the latter . He further alleged that the whole series of events had been planned in advance and monitored by the police . He considered it crucial for the court to establish whether it was the applicant who had approached the police informer of his own accord or whether it was the agent provocateur who had taken the initiative . He regarded it as inhuman for the investigating authorities to have taken advantage of his poor standard of living to ensure a successful police operation . He therefore concluded that the trial court had erred in rejecting his request to examine the buyer whose identity , in fact , he did know . That person was Mr R.Dz . The applicant also provided his address and requested ORG to examine him regarding the circumstances surrounding the applicant \u2019s involvement in the crime .", "At a session ( \u0441\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 ) held on DATE , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal in part and reduced his sentence to a term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It upheld the remainder of the trial court \u2019s decision . At the session , the applicant requested acquittal and stated that he would not have had any involvement in the crime had it not been for the agent provocateur . ORG established that the fact that no items had been confiscated from the applicant did not rule out his guilt . It further found that evidence adduced by the trial court , namely the statements given by the applicant , Mr PERSON and Mr GPE , together with other evidence , corroborated the contention that the applicant , before arriving at the petrol station , had instructed the other CARDINAL accused to obtain the explosives with the intention of selling them to the buyer Mr PERSON . , with whom he had arranged the transaction . It concluded , therefore , that the applicant \u2019s defence rights had not been violated .", "The court further rejected the applicant \u2019s allegations that he had been incited to commit the offence by an agent provocateur , on the grounds that the applicant himself had stated in the pre - trial proceedings that , having been asked by his acquaintance , Mr PERSON . , whether he knew anyone selling explosives , he had offered the latter explosives , which he had said he would secure through another person . The applicant had then agreed to bring the explosives to the petrol station and take them to the village of PERSON afterwards . The court further relied on Mr GPE \u2019s statement , according to which the applicant had promised him a reward of DEM CARDINAL , to be deducted from the selling price of the explosives after the transaction . Finally , the court concluded that the trial court had established all facts relevant to the case and that accordingly , examination of Mr PERSON . , the alleged agent provocateur , was not necessary .", "On DATE the applicant lodged with ORG an appeal on points of law ( \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0438\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430 ) . He complained that the lower courts had erred in rejecting his request for examination of the alleged agent provocateur as irrelevant . Relying on DATE , the applicant complained that the lower courts had failed to consider the arguments in his defence .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It found that the lower courts had adduced sufficient evidence to establish the truth and that the applicant \u2019s arguments had not been such as to undermine their credibility . It further stated that the applicant \u2019s conviction had not been based , as he alleged , on inadmissible evidence . The applicant \u2019s allegations had been examined by ORG , which had provided sufficient reasons to satisfy ORG . As to the applicant \u2019s allegations that there had been a violation of LAW as his conviction had been based on evidence which could not serve that purpose , namely the evidence of an agent provocateur , ORG stated :", "\u201c ... the court does not accept this allegation ... given that , in order for there to have been a violation of LAW concerning the right to a fair trial , the lower courts\u2019 decisions must have been based solely on evidence provided by a socalled agent provocateur . The lower courts\u2019 decisions were not based on any such evidence ... On the contrary , the defence insisted that evidence should be heard from such a witness . The witness in question was not examined and the courts\u2019 decisions were in no way based on statements made by him . The lower courts adduced sufficient evidence and provided sufficient reasons in relation to all the defence arguments . There has , accordingly , been no violation of LAW . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
