AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection dismissed (non-exhaustion);Violation of Art. 6-1+6-3-c;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE the applicant was arrested at GPE , GPE , on suspicion of having killed , shortly before , his friend Ms. PERSON with whom he had gone to GPE on holiday .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's trial commenced before a Court of Assizes ( Geschwornengericht ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , sitting with a jury . The applicant was assisted by his official defence counsel Mr. PERSON An interpreter was present . At the hearing , the court heard the applicant 's statements , the testimony of several witnesses and the explanations of the psychiatric experts Professor PERSON and Dr. PERSON Several requests for the taking of further evidence , inter alia as to the victim 's personality and behaviour in the past , the applicant 's criminal responsibility and his state of mind following the offence , were dismissed .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the hearing , the court put CARDINAL questions to the jury : a first main question related to the offence of murder , CARDINAL subsidiary questions concerned the offences of unpremeditated homicide , intentionally inflicted grievous bodily harm resulting in death and grievous bodily harm resulting in death , respectively , and a fifth main question about the applicant 's criminal responsibility . The court 's directions to the jury covered the jury 's duties and the general legal notions of intent and negligence . As regards the questions , the jury was inter alia directed that the offence of murder ( PERSON ) consisted in the intentional killing of a human being and that premeditated homicide ( Totschlag ) was the intentional killing of a human being in a comprehensible state of emotion ( in einer allgemein begreiflichen heftigen PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the jury , by a unanimous verdict , found the applicant guilty of murder . The jury also unanimously found that the applicant was criminally responsible . According to the record of their deliberations , the jury relied in particular on the testimony of the hotel owner , as well as on the expert opinion of Professor P.", "CARDINAL . The ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment . In fixing the sentence , the ORG considered as a mitigating circumstance the applicant 's diminished responsibility ( verminderte PERSON ) , although his offence had not been committed upon provocation and did not obviously contradict his previous behaviour . Moreover , he had not made a repentant confession ( reum\u00fctiges PERSON ) , and his statements regarding the offence had not essentially contributed to the establishment of the truth .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , assisted by his official defence counsel Mr. PERSON , filed a plea of nullity ( PERSON ) with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) , challenging the order of questions put to the jury , the dismissal of his requests for the taking of further evidence , as well as the conclusiveness of the findings of the jury . He further lodged an appeal ( GPE ) complaining about the severity of the sentence , referring to further mitigating circumstances such as his previous reputable life , his feelings of regret and repentance and his emotional state at the time of the offence .", "CARDINAL . ORG ) also appealed against the sentence , requesting that a life sentence be imposed . The ORG considered that the fact that the applicant 's responsibility had been diminished at the time of the offence could not be regarded as a mitigating factor . Rather it showed the applicant 's particular dangerousness and aggressiveness towards women intending to terminate their relations with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a summons for the hearing on the plea of nullity and the appeals , indicating that , at the hearing on the plea of nullity , the applicant , being incarcerated , could only appear through his official defence counsel and that , at the hearing of the appeals , he would not be brought to court as the conditions of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW were not satisfied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , upon the request of the senior partner of counsel Mr. PERSON , appointed Mr. PERSON as the applicant 's official defence counsel for the purposes of the proceedings before ORG . The applicant received the certificate of appointment on DATE . By letter of DATE , the applicant requested ORG to allow him to be represented by Mr. PERSON at the hearings and to attend them as an observer . On DATE ORG , upon instructions by ORG , informed the applicant , with the assistance of an interpreter , that the conditions of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW were not satisfied , and that his attendance as an observer was not possible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held the hearing on the plea of nullity and the appeals in the absence of the applicant . He was represented by his new official defence counsel , Mr. S. ORG rejected the plea of nullity as well as both appeals .", "CARDINAL . ORG , in its judgment , found that the rejection by the trial court of the applicant 's requests for the taking of evidence did not impair the rights of the defence . In particular , ORG confirmed in detail the reasoning of the trial court that the requests concerned in part irrelevant issues and in part issues which required expert evidence . Moreover , the applicant had failed to show the necessity of a second expert opinion as to his criminal responsibility . ORG also dismissed the applicant 's argument that the order of questions put to the jury had been incorrect . ORG found that there could be no objection to the findings of the jury . The applicant 's allegation of a discrepancy in the statements of CARDINAL of the main witnesses was unfounded and , in any event , expert evidence had been taken on the relevant issue , namely his mental state at the time of the offence .", "CARDINAL . As regards the appeals , ORG noted that the applicant 's own statements appeared to indicate that he quickly lost his self - control in his contacts with women . Nevertheless , there was no sufficient reason to exclude the mitigating circumstance that he had been previously of good conduct . ORG further , on the basis of the file , considered that there had been no provocation and that there were no indications of exceptional mental or emotional excitement . Except for the further mitigating circumstance , there was no other reason to amend the evaluation regarding the applicant 's character or his mental state at the time of the offence , or his motive . Taking all the circumstances into account , the sentence imposed by the trial court appeared appropriate .", "CARDINAL . The decision was received at ORG on DATE and by the applicant 's defence counsel , Mr. PERSON , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A first - instance court judgment given by a ORG , at ORG can be challenged by a plea of nullity to ORG on the specific grounds enumerated in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . ORG task is mainly to control the acts of the bench and the presiding judge of ORG examining , in particular , whether the trial has been conducted in a manner which complies with fundamental procedural principles , whether the right questions have been put and the right directions given to the jury . ORG may only verify whether the jury has provided unclear , incomplete or contradictory answers to the questions put to it . ORG supervises the correct application of the criminal law , but in so doing is bound by the jury 's findings of fact .", "CARDINAL . In certain cases ORG may reject a plea of nullity without a public hearing ( section CARDINAL ( c ) of LAW ) . In all other cases - such as the present - there will be a public hearing which may also be combined with a public hearing on an appeal against sentence .", "CARDINAL . As regards the hearing on a plea of nullity , section CARDINAL of LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . When the date of the public hearing is being fixed , the accused ... shall be summoned ...", "CARDINAL . If the accused is under arrest , the notice of the hearing given to him shall mention that he may only appear through counsel . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure applies , in principle , the above rules to nullity pleas arising out of jury trials .", "However , if the hearing is a combined one on a plea of nullity and an appeal against sentence , an accused who is present for the latter purpose may also exercise his rights concerning the nullity plea .", "CARDINAL . The sentence as such can be challenged by way of an appeal against sentence . It may concern both points of law ( in particular whether mitigating or aggravating circumstances have been correctly taken into account ) and factors relating to the assessment of the sentence . Where the substance of an appeal is examined , a public hearing must normally be held .", "CARDINAL . As regards the personal appearance of the accused at a public appeal hearing , section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of LAW provides :", "\u201c An accused who is detained shall always be summoned and an accused who is detained shall also be brought before the court if he has made a request to this effect in his appeal or counter - statement , or otherwise if his personal presence appears necessary in the interests of justice . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG on DATE . He alleged , inter alia , a violation of LAW and CARDINAL ( c ) of the LAW on the ground that , in criminal proceedings against him , he was not present at the hearing before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Commission declared the application ( No . CARDINAL ) partly admissible on DATE . In its report of CARDINAL DATE ( former LAW ) , it expressed by a majority the opinion that there had been a violation of LAW and CARDINAL ( c ) of the LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
