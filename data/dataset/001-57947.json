ORG In DATE a pamphlet written by the applicant and entitled \" War Crimes and the Wardenship of Winchester College \" was circulated by Mr PERSON to parents , boys , staff and former members of the school as well as to Members of ORG , Members of ORG and the press . Mr LOC bore a grievance against the Warden of ORG , Lord PERSON , at the time Chairman of an insurance company , concerning an insurance claim . The pamphlet included the following statements :", "\" DATE some CARDINAL GPE and NORP prisoners - of - war and refugees were handed over to NORP and ORG forces as a result of an agreement made with ORG administering occupied GPE . They included a large proportion of women , children , and even babies . The majority of LOC officers and their families handed over held ORG passports or those of the NORP countries in which they had found refuge after being evacuated from GPE by their NORP and NORP Allies in DATE , and were hence not liable to return under the terms of LAW , which related only to NORP citizens .", "...", "As was anticipated by virtually everyone concerned , the overwhelming majority of these defenceless people , who reposed implicit trust in NORP honour , were either massacred in circumstances of unbelievable horror immediately following their handover , or condemned to a lingering death in NORP gaols and forced labour camps . These operations were achieved by a combination of duplicity and brutality without parallel in NORP history since the Massacre of Glencoe . Outside Lienz may be seen DATE a small LOC cemetery , whose tombstones commemorate men , women and children shot , clubbed , or bayoneted to death by NORP troops .", "...", "The man who issued every order and arranged every detail of the lying and brutality which resulted in these massacres was Brigadier PERSON , Chief of Staff to General PERSON 's CARDINAL ORG , subsequently ennobled by PERSON as the CARDINALst Baron PERSON . Since DATE he has been Warden of ORG , one of the oldest and most respected of NORP public schools . Whether Lord PERSON is an appropriate figure for such a post is primarily a matter for the College to decide . But it is also surely a legitimate matter of broader public concern that a man responsible for such enormities should continue to occupy a post of such honour and prominence within the community , in particular one which serves as exemplar for young people themselves likely DATE to achieve high office and responsibility .", "The truth is , however , that Lord PERSON knows every one of his pleas to be wholly or in large part false . The evidence is overwhelming that he arranged the perpetration of a major war crime in the full knowledge that the most barbarous and dishonourable aspects of his operations were throughout disapproved and unauthorised by the higher command , and in the full knowledge that a savage fate awaited those he was repatriating . Those who still feel that a man with the blood of CARDINAL men , women and children on his hands , helpless charges whom ORG was making every attempt to protect , is a suitable Warden for Winchester might care to ask themselves ( or Lord PERSON , if they can catch him ) the following questions :", "...", "Lord PERSON has been repeatedly charged in books and articles , by press and public , with being a major war criminal , whose activities merit comparison with those of the worst butchers of NORP GPE or NORP GPE ... \"", "CARDINAL .

He directed the jury , inter alia , as follows :", "\" ... Let us now , members of the jury , ... deal with the aspect of damages ... I have to give you this direction in law because damages may arise ... If the plaintiff wins , you have got to consider damages . Some would say that the only direction on damages necessary in this particular case was to say : [ the applicant ] says that if damages are to be payable he agrees they should be enormous . Mr Rampton [ defence counsel ] , I do not think , in his final speech could quite bring himself to utter that word , but he said they will be very generous - and I could stop there . But that is not the way , you see , because the parties do not dictate ( even if they are making concessions ) how you should approach damages . You do it in accordance with the law , and that is what I am now going to tell you . You have to accept my directions about it , and you will apply them of course as you think fit .", "...", "the means of the parties - the plaintiff or the defendant - is immaterial", "...", "Neither , as I think I said earlier but I say it now , is the question whether Lord PERSON or [ the applicant ] , or for that matter Mr LOC , have been or will be financially supported by any well wishers as to damages relevant at all . Nor is it relevant the undoubted fact that legal aid is not available in libel cases to a plaintiff or a defendant . All irrelevant , and if it is to be changed it is up to ORG to do something about it ...", "... what you are seeking to do , what a jury has to do , is to fix a sum which will compensate the plaintiff - to make amends in financial terms for the wrong done to him , because wrong has been done if you have got to the stage of awarding damages . It is not your duty or your right to punish a defendant ...", "What [ Lord PERSON ] does claim , of course , is for ' general damages ' , as lawyers call it , a sum of money to compensate him . First of all , you have to take into account the effect in this case , as in every case where there is libel , on the position , standing and reputation of the successful plaintiff ...", "... If they [ the allegations made in the pamphlet ] were untrue and not fair comment , where it is suggested that they were comment , he is entitled to be compensated for that , so that that will register your view of that .", "Then you have got to consider ... the injury to his feelings . I told you that he can not , of course , claim on behalf of his wife or any member of his family , although the affect on them may have had an affect on him which is a reaction , which you are entitled to take into account .", "It is not just his feelings when he read this ... It is his feelings during the time whilst awaiting the trial ... and the publicity ...", "... you have to consider ... what lawyers call ` vindication ' ...", "You may think - it is a matter for you - that in this particular case vindication - showing that he was right - is the main reason for Lord PERSON bringing this action - that is what he says anyway - to restore his character and standing ... ' An award , an enormous award ' , to use [ the applicant 's ] words - ' a very generous award ' to use Mr PERSON 's words , will enable him to say that put the record straight .", "Members of the jury , of course , you must not , as a result of what I have just said , just bump and bump the damages up . You must , at all times , as they say , keep your feet on the ground .", "... You have to take into account the extent and nature of the publication .", "... whilst you must leave aside any thought of punishing the defendants if you find for the plaintiff , juries are always entitled , as I have hinted already , to take into account any conduct of the defendant which has aggravated the damages - that is to say , made the damage more serious and the award higher - or mitigated them - made the damage done less serious and the award smaller .", "...", "Now , CARDINAL general remarks which I make in every case : nobody asks you how you arrive at your verdict , and you do not have to give reasons like a Judge does , so it is exceedingly important that you look at the matter judicially , and that means that you should not be outrageously or unreasonably high , or outrageously or unreasonably low .", "The second matter I say to every jury is : please , I beg you , if you come to damages , do not pay the slightest attention to any other case or the result of any other case you may have read about or heard about . The facts and the legal considerations are like[ly ] to have been completely different . There is no league of damages in defamation cases . There is no first division , there is no fourth division , there is no ORG conference , if any of you are interested in football .", "So , members of the jury , please forget other cases . Use your own common sense about it . How do you translate what I have said into money terms ? By our rules and procedure , members of the jury , counsel can use , and a judge can use , words like ' very substantial ' or ' very small ' , but we do not either of us , counsel or judges , mention figures . Some people again , who have not really considered the matter very carefully , wonder about that , and they say juries should be given guidance , and I say to you what I say to every jury in these cases , it would not be a great deal of help for you , because inevitably , it is human nature and it would be their duty - counsel for the plaintiff would be at the top end of the scale and perhaps in some cases , I do not suggest this one , off the clock , and counsel for the defendant would be at the bottom end of the scale in the basement . Now , that would not be much good to anybody . As for the Judge , well the jury might think - you may have an exactly opposite view - a jury might think : ' Well , on the whole , whatever other people say about this particular Judge in this case , we think he tried to be fair , why does n't he suggest a figure to us ? '", "Supposing a Judge , myself in this case , were to suggest a figure to you , or a bracket between so and so and so and so , there would be CARDINAL possibilities : CARDINAL is that you would ignore what I said and either go higher than my figure or bracket , or much lower , in which case of course the losing party that did not like it would be off to ORG saying : ' Look , the Judge suggested a figure and the jury went above it or below it . '", "Supposing you accepted my suggestion , and gave a figure that I recommended , or close to it . Well , all I can say is that you would have been wasting your valuable time in considering the matter of damages because you would just have been acting as a rubber stamp for me , or the Judge , whoever it was . So we do not have that over - bidding or under - bidding , as ORG has called it , by counsel , and we do not have ORG trying to lay down to juries what they should award , and I do not hesitate to say , whatever other people say , I hope and pray , for the sake of our law and our court , we never get the day when ORG dictate to juries so that they become rubber stamps .", "I am , however , allowed - indeed encouraged - by ORG just to say a little bit more . I say it not perhaps in the words of ORG , but in my own way , which may be too homely for some , but I say to you that you must remember what money is . You do not deal in PERSON money just reeling off noughts because they sound good , I know you will not . You have got to consider money in real terms . Sometimes it is said ' Well , how much would a house cost of a certain kind ' , and if you are giving a plaintiff as compensation so much money how many houses is he going to buy ? I do not mean to suggest that Lord PERSON or any other plaintiff would take his damages and go and buy a house or a row of houses , but that relates it to the sort of thing , if you will allow me to say , you and I do know something about , because most of us have a pretty good idea how much houses are worth . So remember that . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG In its unanimous verdict of CARDINAL DATE , the jury answered the questions put by PERSON Justice PERSON as follows :", "\" CARDINAL .

In addition he granted an application by Lord PERSON for an injunction ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) restraining , inter alios , the defendants from publishing or causing or permitting to be published or assisting or participating in or conniving at the publication of the words contained in the impugned pamphlet or", "\" any other words or allegations ( however expressed ) to the following or any similar effect namely that the Plaintiff [ Lord PERSON ] in connection with the handover in DATE to NORP or NORP forces of military or civilian personnel was guilty of disobedience or deception or criminal or dishonourable or inhumane or other improper or unauthorised conduct or was responsible for the subsequent treatment of any such personnel by the NORP or the PERSON the said defendants being at liberty to apply to vary or discharge this injunction . \"", "The applicant was also ordered to pay Lord PERSON 's costs .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant ( but not Mr LOC ) gave notice of appeal to ORG setting out a number of grounds , several of which went to the fairness of the proceedings . He criticised Mr Justice PERSON among other things for having displayed overt animosity towards the defendants and for his continual interruption , sarcasm and abuse of defence counsel . The Judge had , he alleged , insulted and disparaged the defence witnesses . Throughout his summing - up he had wholly or largely suppressed or ignored many of the most important aspects of the case for the defence and had misled the jury on issues central to the defendants ' arguments . When directing the jury on the question of damages , the tenor of the judge 's remarks had been in large part to urge the jury to award high damages to the plaintiff and to discount the alternatives which had been reasonably available on the evidence ; the damages had in any event been unreasonable and excessive .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE Lord PERSON applied to ORG for an order requiring the applicant , under LAW , Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Rules of ORG , to give security in an amount which would cover the costs of his opponent 's representation if the appeal were to be unsuccessful . It was not disputed that the applicant would be unable to pay the relevant costs .", "CARDINAL . ORG In an open letter of CARDINAL DATE , Lord PERSON offered not to enforce \u00a3 MONEY of the damages awarded . In his reply the applicant confirmed that he was unable to provide any security for Lord PERSON 's costs in the appeal proceedings and , maintaining that the trial had been a travesty of justice , declined the offer .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a CARDINAL - page judgment of CARDINAL DATE the Registrar of ORG examined the facts raised by the applicant and rejected the application for security for costs . The PERSON stated that impecuniosity was a ground for awarding security for costs in respect of the costs of an appeal to ORG . In exercising its discretion in this regard , ORG would attach particular weight to the merits , or otherwise , of the appeal concerned . If the appeal had little or no merit , a security for costs order would normally be made against an impecunious appellant . If the appeal had reasonable prospects of success , the court would be reluctant to order security for costs .", "The PERSON pointed out that he had not found it easy to decide whether the applicant 's appeal on liability had sufficient strength to justify allowing him to proceed without furnishing security for costs , given that , if his appeal failed , he would not have the funds to pay Lord PERSON 's costs of the appeal . He added that , with some hesitation , he found that on several specific points the appeal had just enough strength to lead him to conclude that security for costs should not be awarded in this case . There was a possibility that if the applicant succeeded in convincing ORG that he had not had a fair trial , and his case had not been fairly and clearly put to the jury , ORG would conclude that a new trial had to be ordered , notwithstanding the fact that the chances of his succeeding on the new trial were slim .", "In view of the above conclusion the Registrar did not find it necessary to deal with an argument made by counsel for Lord PERSON that the appeal on quantum would be academic because of his offer of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON appealed successfully against the Registrar 's decision to the full ORG , which heard the matter for DATE between CARDINAL and DATE and gave judgment on DATE . The members of ORG gave , in summary , the following reasons .", "ORG had to consider the application afresh and decide whether to order security would amount to a denial of justice to the applicant , having regard to the merits of his appeal . The criticism made in the applicant 's grounds of appeal did not concern Mr Justice PERSON 's directions on the law but , in particular , what the applicant characterised as bias and partiality on the part of the judge towards Lord PERSON and the way in which the judge had dealt with CARDINAL particular issues of fact . The criticism was however not justified . Mr Justice PERSON had clearly left to the jury the decision on the facts of the case and all the major matters had been dealt with fully and fairly . The judge 's summing - up had quite clearly brought to the jury 's minds the matters which the defence had contended were of primary significance . Counsel had been given full opportunities to raise matters of alleged error , and when they had deemed it necessary they had done so . Furthermore the principal witnesses had been in the witness - box for some thirteen days in all . Lord PERSON , who had been the central witness in the case in the sense that it was his conduct which was the subject of examination , had been in the witness box for CARDINAL and a half days . It was inconceivable that the jury had not taken full account of and acted on the evidence of the principal witnesses who had been so comprehensively examined and cross - examined upon all the material issues in the case .", "The case had been an entirely appropriate CARDINAL for a jury and had duly been tried by a jury . In this connection Sir PERSON noted that at a preliminary stage , when Lord PERSON had asked for the case to be tried by a judge alone , the applicant had resisted his application .", "The new evidence adduced by the applicant did not carry any weight in the light of all the evidence which had been given at the trial .", "The applicant 's submission that Lord PERSON was supported by ORG was irrelevant .", "In the result , on the issue of liability there was no merit in the appeal .", "Sir PERSON added :", "\" The quantum of damage is a very large sum . However , there is no doubt that the learned judge gave an impeccable direction on damages . [ The applicant ] has argued that the judge invited the jury to give excessive damages . A correct reading of the transcript shows that he did just the opposite . There is no merit in that submission .", "The award was entirely within the jury 's discretion and they received a very full direction about it . I have no doubt that it was meant to mark their view of the enormity of the gross libel which had been published and persisted in .", "[ The applicant ] has however made it clear that he is not really interested so much in the question of the amount of damages as in the issue of liability . He wishes to continue to pursue Lord PERSON if he can and to persist in his allegation at a new trial . In fact he was offered a substantial reduction in the damages to the extent of MONEY . This he rejected . This move was not a concession by the plaintiff 's solicitors that the award was too high , but was made recognising that the plaintiff was unlikely to receive the amount awarded and was content with the fact that the jury had by their verdict rejected in an overwhelming manner the truth of the libel which had been published . \"", "\" The court will be very slow to interfere with the jury 's verdict unless there has been some material irregularity in the proceedings which renders the verdict unsafe or unsatisfactory , or it can properly be said that the verdict is perverse . Much the same considerations must apply in the instant case .", "As to any irregularity in the proceedings , I detect none ...", "This case , and the jury 's verdict , depended essentially upon the veracity of Lord ORG . No document or documents were produced which on their face could destroy Lord PERSON 's credibility . If the jury had disbelieved Lord PERSON , there would have been an end of his case . The fact that the jury found in his favour and awarded him the damages that they did demonstrates that upon the vital issues of the case they must have accepted the plaintiff 's evidence . Was that a course which was open to the jury ? In my judgment , it plainly was ...", "There is not in my judgment the remotest chance of ORG interfering with the jury 's finding in the plaintiff 's favour and directing a retrial of that issue , either on the basis that the verdict can not stand or on the basis of fresh evidence which [ the applicant ] seeks to introduce .", "...", "Finally , upon the issue of damages , [ the applicant ] had been offered in an open letter the substitution of \u00a3 MONEY for the CARDINAL and QUANTITY awarded by the jury . The libel remains as serious a libel as it is possible to imagine . Any appeal upon quantum alone would be no more than an academic exercise . [ The applicant ] wishes to reopen the whole case . In my judgment , the defendant being impecunious , justice demands that he should provide security for the plaintiff 's costs of any appeal . \"", "\" It would be difficult to conjecture an allegation more calculated to bring the respondent into the hatred and contempt of his fellow men and the evidence showed that it was deliberately circulated with the aim of encouraging the respondent to sue him , thus giving the appellant the opportunity to challenge in public the respondent 's conduct DATE ...", "It is not for this court to grant a retrial after the verdict of a jury , even if it thought that a reasonable jury ought to have found differently . The test which , on the hearing of the appeal , this court would have to apply is whether the finding of the jury is so absolutely unreasonable that it can be said that they have not performed the judicial duty cast upon them . Again I have listened to the skilful development of the facts and evidence by the appellant . He has failed to satisfy me that he has any reasonable chance of success in this appeal . Even if he persuaded the court to grant a retrial on the issue of the amount of the damages , I would regard as negligible the prospect of any jury , doing their judicial duty , awarding the respondent [ Lord PERSON ] less than the sum which he has in reality already offered to accept in compromise of this appeal . The appellant has therefore failed to satisfy me that he has any such real and substantial grounds of appeal as would justify this court in saying that the special circumstances of his inability to pay the respondent 's costs if he fails can be disregarded . \"", "CARDINAL .
