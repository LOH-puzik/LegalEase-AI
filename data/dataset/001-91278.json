The western part belongs to the internal waters of the GPE . It provides feeding and breeding grounds for a variety of wildlife including a number of species of molluscs and seabirds . With the exception of passages left open for shipping and military training grounds , it is subject to an environmental protection regime under domestic law .", "In the part of LOC under the sovereignty of the GPE , the regime was defined at the relevant time by decrees issued under the CARDINAL LAW ( Natuurbeschermingswet ) .

Its natural predators in LOC include several bird species , particularly eider ducks ( somateria mollissima ) and oystercatchers ( haematopus ostralegus ) .", "Cockles are fished commercially , using both manual and mechanical methods : the mechanical techniques used are dredging and suction .", "On DATE the Deputy Minister ( Staatssecretaris ) of Agriculture , Nature Conservation and Fisheries ( \u201c the Deputy Minister \u201d ) granted a licence to the applicant association entitling its members collectively to a total catch of CARDINAL tonnes of cockle meat from LOC over a period of CARDINAL in the following autumn .", "On DATE LOC , also known as PERSON ) , a nongovernmental organisation whose stated aim was to protect the LOC environment , lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) on its own behalf and on behalf of another non - governmental organisation , ORG ( PERSON , also called PERSON ) . The ORG stated , in so far as relevant to the case before the ORG , that mechanical cockle fishing caused long - term and possibly irreversible damage to ecologically vulnerable areas and that the quota set was too high in relation to the feeding needs of seabirds , including oystercatchers .", "On DATE the Deputy Minister gave a decision dismissing the objection as unfounded , on the grounds that much of LOC was closed to mechanical cockle fishing ; at all events , in the absence of empirical evidence , it was not established that the effects of such fishing were irreversible . The estimated quantities of cockles in DATE were such that there was no need to reserve them all for DATE , particularly since the birds could also feed on protected mussel banks .", "ORG appealed against that decision to ORG of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State ) .", "On DATE the Deputy Minister granted a licence to the applicant association entitling its members collectively to a total catch of up to QUANTITY of cockle meat from LOC over a period of CARDINAL in DATE .", "On DATE LOC lodged an objection , again acting on its own behalf and on behalf of ORG . It mainly restated the grounds of its objection of CARDINAL DATE . A serious reduction in the numbers of eider ducks and oystercatchers had been noted in DATE , presumably as a result of the partial destruction of their feeding grounds . In addition , the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision was incompatible with LAW DATE on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora ( \u201c the Habitats Directive \u201d \u2013 see below ) , which required a stricter assessment of the likely environmental effects than the applicable domestic legislation .", "On DATE the Deputy Minister dismissed the objection as unfounded . He dismissed the argument that the environmental impact assessment was incompatible with the Habitats Directive , since in his view the assessment under the applicable domestic legislation was equivalent in scope and was based on the latest available scientific information . No grounds for serious concern as to possible irreversible environmental damage had been made out , nor had the reality of the supposed threat to the feeding grounds of eider ducks and oystercatchers been established .", "LOC lodged an appeal against that decision also .", "ORG joined the cases and held a hearing on DATE . The applicant association appeared as an interested party .", "On DATE ORG gave its decision .", "It rejected the arguments of the appellant non - governmental organisations in so far as they called into question the Deputy Minister \u2019s assessment of the likelihood of harm to the LOC environment and wildlife . It accepted , however , that questions arose with regard to the interpretation and application of LAW in the light of the binding substantive standards of ORG law , in particular the LOC Directive .

The competent national authorities , taking account of the appropriate assessment of the implications of mechanical cockle fishing for the site concerned in the light of the site \u2019s conservation objectives , are to authorise such an activity only if they have made certain that it will not adversely affect the integrity of that site .

Although it is objective and reasoned in law , the opinion is nevertheless intended to advise and accordingly influence ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The [ NORP ] Court of Human Rights went on to consider that \u2018 the fact that it was impossible for Mr PERSON to reply to them [ the submissions ] before the end of the hearing infringed his right to adversarial proceedings .

Emesa takes the view that this case - law applies to the opinion delivered before the ORG by the Advocate General and accordingly seeks leave to reply to it .", "CARDINAL . As the ORG has consistently held , fundamental rights form an integral part of the general principles of law , the observance of which it ensures ( see , in particular , opinion CARDINAL of DATE [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) . For that purpose , the ORG draws inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member ORG and from the guidelines supplied by international treaties for the protection of human rights on which the member GPE have cooperated or of which they are signatories . The LAW has special significance in that respect ( see , in particular , Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG [ DATE ] ORG , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , those principles have been incorporated in LAW , according to which \u2018 The Union shall respect fundamental rights , as guaranteed by LAW signed in GPE on CARDINAL DATE and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the member GPE , as general principles of Community law\u2019 . According to LAW , the ORG is to ensure that this provision is applied \u2018 with regard to action of the institutions , in so far as [ it ] has jurisdiction under the Treaties establishing ORG and under [ the ] LAW [ on NORP Union]\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . It is also appropriate to recall the status and role of the Advocate General within the judicial system established by LAW and by LAW of ORG , as set out in detail in ORG .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , ORG consists of ORG and is assisted by Advocates General . LAW lays down identical conditions and the same procedure for appointing both Judges and Advocates General . In addition , it is clear from Title I of LAW of ORG , which , in law , is equal in rank to the LAW itself , that the Advocates General have the same status as the ORG , particularly so far as concerns immunity and the grounds on which they may be deprived of their office , which guarantees their full impartiality and total independence .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the Advocates General , none of whom is subordinate to any other , are not public prosecutors nor are they subject to any authority , in contrast to the manner in which the administration of justice is organised in certain member GPE . They are not entrusted with the defence of any particular interest in the exercise of their duties .", "CARDINAL . The role of the Advocate General must be viewed in that context . In accordance with LAW , his duty is to make , in open court , acting with complete impartiality and independence , reasoned submissions on cases brought before ORG , in order to assist ORG in the performance of the task assigned to it , which is to ensure that in the interpretation and application of the LAW , the law is observed .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW of ORG and LAW , the opinion of the Advocate General brings the oral procedure to an end . It does not form part of the proceedings between the parties , but rather opens the stage of deliberation by ORG . It is not therefore an opinion addressed to the judges or to the parties which stems from an authority outside the ORG or which \u2018 derives its authority from that of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2019s department [ in the NORP version , \u2018 minist\u00e8re PERSON ( judgment in PERSON v. GPE , cited above , paragraph CARDINAL ) . Rather , it constitutes the individual reasoned opinion , expressed in open court , of a member of ORG itself .", "CARDINAL . The Advocate General thus takes part , publicly and individually , in the process by which the ORG reaches its judgment , and therefore in carrying out the judicial function entrusted to it . Furthermore , the opinion is published together with the ORG \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to both the organic and the functional link between the Advocate General and the ORG , referred to in DATE of this order , the aforesaid case - law of ORG does not appear to be transposable to the opinion of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , given the special constraints inherent in Community judicial procedure , connected in particular with its language regime , to confer on the parties the right to submit observations in response to the opinion of ORG , with a corresponding right for the other parties ( and , in preliminary ruling proceedings , which constitute the majority of cases brought before the ORG , all the member GPE , the ORG and the other institutions concerned ) to reply to those observations , would cause serious difficulties and considerably extend the length of the procedure .", "CARDINAL . Admittedly , constraints inherent in the manner in which the administration of justice is organised within the ORG can not justify infringing a fundamental right to adversarial procedure .
