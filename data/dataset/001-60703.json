The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . When they introduced the application , they were all living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant went to GPE in DATE to live with his parents and siblings . As from DATE he cohabited with the second applicant , who was born in GPE and has lived there all her life . They married under NORP law in DATE and under NORP civil law in DATE . Their daughter , the third applicant , was born on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL ORG imprisonment on probation for shoplifting by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) convicted him of theft without pronouncing a sentence . The court established that in DATE the first applicant had stolen moped - accessories , cutlery and other commodities , CARDINAL gold rings and a gold bracelet , worth altogether CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) , equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) . A probation period of DATE was fixed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the first applicant was convicted of CARDINAL minor breaches of traffic rules and sentenced to pay fines of ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL respectively . DATE he was convicted CARDINAL times of driving a car without a driving licence and sentenced to pay fines of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , CARDINAL , respectively ( equivalent to EUR CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , still without a driving licence , he overran a red traffic light and exceeded the speed limit of QUANTITY , driving at CARDINAL km / h . On DATE ORG ( GPE ) convicted him of these offences and sentenced him to a fine of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG imposed a DATE residence ban on the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . The authority referred to section QUANTITY of the DATE LAW , which paragraphs provide that a residence ban has to be issued against an alien , inter alia , if he has been convicted more than once for similar offences by a domestic or foreign court , or if a fine has been imposed on him more than once for a grave administrative offence by an administrative authority . The ORG found that both conditions had been met in this case .", "CARDINAL . Further , ORG , referring to the first applicant \u2019s stay in GPE since DATE , the fact that his close family was living in GPE , his co - habitation with a NORP national who was born in GPE , and his employment , found that the residence ban constituted an interference with the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his private and family life . However , it was necessary for the aims set out in LAW , namely for the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights of others . Given the first applicant \u2019s continuous disregard of NORP law , the authority assumed that it was probable that he would commit similar offences in the future . Thus , despite the first applicant \u2019s high degree of integration in GPE , the public interest in issuing a residence ban outweighed the first applicant \u2019s interest in staying . This decision was served on the first applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was taken into detention with a view to his expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to deal with the first applicant \u2019s complaint as it lacked sufficient prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the first applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . He requested that the decisions relating to the residence ban against him be quashed for errors of law . He submitted that the contested decisions violated his right to respect for his private and family life . In particular , he complained that the competent authorities had failed duly to weigh his interests in staying in GPE against the public interest of issuing a residence ban against him . Although he had been convicted of theft , no punishment had been imposed on him . The other convictions only concerned administrative offences . Neither his fianc\u00e9e , the second applicant , who was born in GPE and worked there , nor their daughter , the third applicant , could be expected to follow him to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the first applicant submitted that GPE had become a member of ORG on DATE and was therefore bound by ORG between ORG and GPE . According to this Agreement , and the decisions on its implementation , NORP workers who had been legally employed in a member ORG for a certain period had a right of free access to the employment market and also to a residence permit . In this context the first applicant requested ORG to refer the case to ORG of ORG for a preliminary ruling under LAW of LAW . Moreover , measures of public security against such workers were only possible if the public interest was massively and actually endangered . Therefore , it would contradict GPE - law to issue a residence ban against the child of a migrant worker \u2019s family who has never committed anything else than petty crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the first applicant \u2019s complaint suspensive effect . Thereupon , on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was released from detention with a view to his expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s complaint . It found that the contested residence ban served aims set out in LAW , namely the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights of others . Furthermore , ORG had duly weighed the interests involved . Given the fact that the first applicant had committed several criminal and administrative offences during a protracted period , the public interest weighed more heavily than the private interest , even in cases where an alien was integrated as the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . As to ORG between ORG and GPE , and in particular decree no . CARDINAL of ORG , ORG noted that the rights contained therein only applied after a certain number of DATE of lawful employment . The first applicant had failed to submit the relevant facts to the administrative authorities , in particular whether he had been working in GPE for the requisite period . Thus , ORG could not be reproached for not having taken into account that ORG and the above decree . The decision was served on the first applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an order to leave NORP territory was served on the first applicant , with which he complied on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is currently living in GPE . The validity of his residence ban expired in DATE . However , according to his submissions , which were not contested by the Government , the possibilities of legally returning to GPE are very limited and involve long waiting periods .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the second and third applicants visited the first applicant on a number of occasions in GPE and spent a longer period of time there at DATE and in DATE . In DATE the first and second applicants divorced . According to the divorce decree issued by a NORP court , the second applicant has sole custody over the third applicant while the first applicant has a right of access . In DATE the second applicant returned to GPE . She has a settlement permit and a work permit . She has left the third applicant temporarily in GPE where the latter is being cared for by relatives but intends to bring her back to GPE .", ""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
