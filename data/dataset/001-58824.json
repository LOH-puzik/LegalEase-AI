{"ITEMID": "001-58824", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF CAMP AND BOURIMI v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 14+8;No violation of Art. 8;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE Ms Camp 's partner , Mr PERSON , died without having recognised ( erkenning ) the child she was carrying at that time and without leaving a will . ORG and ORG had been living together in a house owned by the latter . They had been intending to marry , but a wedding scheduled for DATE had been postponed due to the death of ORG mother .", "CARDINAL . The parents of ORG believed neither that the child Ms Camp was carrying had been fathered by their son nor that their son had intended to marry PERSON . Consequently , they considered themselves and their other children to be their son 's heirs . On DATE , contrary to the wishes of ORG , Mr ORG parents , together with CARDINAL other relatives , moved into the house which had belonged to their son . Thereupon , Ms Camp moved out of the house .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ms Camp requested the President of the Roermond Regional Court ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) in summary proceedings ( kort geding ) to grant an injunction ordering the parents to vacate the house pending the winding up of ORG estate . Furthermore , on DATE , she requested the Queen to grant letters of legitimation ( brieven van wettiging DATE see paragraphs QUANTITY below ) in respect of the child she was carrying .", "CARDINAL . NORP The President of ORG refused to grant the injunction on DATE but this decision was quashed by the ' sHertogenbosch ORG ( Gerechtshof ) on DATE . ORG considered that ORG had adduced sufficient evidence to corroborate her claim that she had been living with PERSON in his house for a considerable time , that they had intended to get married and that Mr A. Bourimi was ORG 's father . In view of the fact that it therefore seemed likely that letters of legitimation would be granted and ORG would thus emerge as ORG sole heir , ORG found that it was Ms FAC 's right and in her interest in her capacity of mother and guardian to be given possession of the house . ORG accordingly ordered the parents of PERSON to vacate the house . The parents subsequently filed an appeal on points of law ( beroep in cassatie ) to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG was born . Since he was illegitimate and had not been recognised by his father , he was initially given the family name of his mother . On DATE ORG issued advice in favour of the granting of letters of legitimation . Such letters were granted on DATE and NORP took on the family name of his father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of ORG of DATE . It considered that the letters of legitimation did not have retroactive force from the time of ORG death and that therefore NORP could not inherit from him . As regards PERSON argument that this outcome was contrary to LAW taken in conjunction with LAW held that the establishment of the consequences of an incompatibility of GPE law with these provisions of the Convention went beyond the task of the judiciary .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred the case back to ORG , which was to examine whether other circumstances existed justifying a judicial order to the effect that PERSON parents vacate the house DATE such as the fact that ORG had been living in the house for a considerable time . On DATE ORG struck the case out in view of the fact that the parties to the proceedings had reached an agreement to the effect that ORG and NORP would vacate the house .", "CARDINAL . The estate of PERSON was distributed amongst the heirs ( that is , his parents and siblings ) on DATE by a notary ( notaris ) .", "CARDINAL . Legally recognised family ties ( familierechtelijke betrekkingen ) between a father , his relatives and a child exist where a child is born to married parents or if it is born within DATE following the dissolution of the marriage ( Article CARDINAL:CARDINAL of the Civil Code ( Burgerlijk DATE \u201c ORG \u201d ) ) . An illegitimate child will have a legally recognised family relationship with its father ( who does not have to be the biological father ) and the latter 's relatives if it has been recognised ( erkenning ) by the father , either before or after its birth ( Article PERSON ) . At the relevant time , moreover , a legally recognised family relationship would also be created by the granting of letters of legitimation ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW CARDINAL:CARDINAL provided as follows :", "\u201c The request for letters of legitimation may also be made if the man , who , aware of her pregnancy , and intending to marry the mother , died before the birth of the child without having recognised it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears from the explanatory memorandum ( PERSON ) to this provision that the intention to marry the mother , which , if carried out , would have resulted in the birth of a legitimate child , replaced the recognition required by LAW for the establishment of a legally recognised family relationship .", "A request for letters of legitimation could be made by the child 's mother or , after her death , by the child itself . No time - limit was attached to a request for such letters . According to LAW , legitimation pursuant to LAW took effect from DATE on which letters of legitimation were granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW was amended . The option of letters of legitimation was replaced by a judicial declaration of paternity ( gerechtelijke vaststelling van vaderschap , LAW ) . A declaration of paternity has retroactive force from the time of the child 's birth but it does not affect adversely any rights acquired in good faith by third parties .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL CC only those persons who have a legally recognised family relationship with a person who has died intestate may inherit from this person . Furthermore , the heir must have existed at the time of death . ( LAW ) . However , according to LAW , a child who has been conceived but has not yet been born is considered as having already been born when his or her interests so require .", "CARDINAL . According to the rules of intestacy , if a deceased does not leave any children with whom he has a legally recognised family relationship or a spouse , his parents and siblings will inherit from him ( LAW ) . If there are such children or a spouse , the parents and siblings are excluded from the inheritance ( ORG CARDINAL and ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied to the Commission on DATE . They complained that , contrary to LAW taken in conjunction with LAW , the letters of legitimation did not have retroactive force from the time of PERSON death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Commission declared the application admissible .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its report of DATE ( former LAW ) [ Note by ORG . The report is obtainable from ORG . ] , the Commission expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been no violation of Article CARDINAL either in respect of the family life between the CARDINAL applicants or in respect of ORG family life with the relatives of ORG , that it was not necessary to examine under LAW the complaint relating to NORP 's family life with the relatives of his father , and that there had been a violation of LAW taken in conjunction with LAW NORP ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
