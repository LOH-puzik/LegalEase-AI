The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was suspected of an aggravated drugs offence . On an unspecified date the public prosecutor brought charges against him and CARDINAL other persons , PERSON and PERSON According to the indictment , the defendants had decided to obtain a large amount of amphetamine from GPE . CARDINAL and DATE the applicant and PERSON made a trip to GPE to arrange the purchase , acting on instructions from L.J. On DATE the drugs , hidden in a truck , were brought to GPE by a fourth person . During this period the applicant kept in contact with the NORP supplier by telephone . On DATE the truck driver handed over the drugs to ORG and PERSON , who then hid them . Later in the evening PERSON returned for the drugs , as agreed with PERSON While PERSON was driving back to town , the police stopped and detained him and seized the drugs from his possession . In the meantime , the applicant picked up PERSON from a nearby petrol station .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , all the defendants contested the above charge . The applicant denied any knowledge of the matter . He maintained that his trip to GPE had only been for pleasure and that he had not received any instructions from GPE relating to it . Nor had he kept any contact with the supplier . He further denied any knowledge of what had happened at the petrol station on DATE . Apparently all the defendants asserted that their collective enterprise had concerned a plan to purchase weapons and not drugs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel sent a letter to the police inquiring whether all the telephone calls made between the CARDINAL defendants by mobile phone had been included in the pre - trial investigation material . He also requested the police to confirm in writing that it was not possible to disclose to the defence the telephone metering information in the possession of the police .", "CARDINAL . In their response of CARDINAL DATE the police stated that all the telephone calls pertaining to the investigated offence had been included in the pre - trial investigation material . The police further confirmed that the telephone metering information in their possession could not be disclosed as it was confidential .", "CARDINAL . The evidence obtained through telephone surveillance and produced before the court included CARDINAL recorded telephone conversations and CARDINAL recorded text messages between the defendants DATE and DATE , apparently all pertaining to the different stages of the alleged drugs offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) found that the defendants had planned to purchase drugs and had carried out the plan together . It convicted them as charged and sentenced each of them to CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment . As to the conviction of GPE and PERSON the court relied mainly on the testimony of the truck driver and the fact that the drugs had been found in PERSON \u2019s possession . As to its finding that all CARDINAL defendants had acted in concert in committing the offence , the court relied on information obtained through telephone surveillance . According to the court , the numerous recordings of telephone conversations between the defendants consistently showed that there had been a common understanding about the plan to obtain the drugs DATE before they were delivered . Their co - operation had begun on DATE , at the latest , when the applicant had made a trip to GPE with PERSON Since that journey they had been showing concern about the delay in the delivery . The court found the GPE account of the plan to purchase weapons unsubstantiated . The court also relied on the recordings in concluding that the applicant had participated in the actual receiving of the drugs just as actively as the other defendants , even though he had not been there to receive them in person .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , along with the other parties , appealed against the judgment to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) . In his letter of appeal he claimed that all that had been established beyond dispute was that he had made a trip to GPE and that he had been in contact with the other defendants by telephone , but that did not connect him to the offence of which he had been convicted . ORG had failed to specify which telephone conversations proved that he had been an accomplice .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his subsequent additional submission to the court the applicant also requested that the public prosecutor be ordered to produce all the recordings of the telephone conversations between the applicant and other defendants , as they would reveal that the dealings involving the defendants had related to matters other than drugs . The applicant contended that only a fraction of all these telephone conversations had been included in the pre - trial investigation material , thus giving a misleading impression of the nature of their association . If the court were to refuse this request , the defence should at least be granted access to all of the recordings .", "CARDINAL . The court requested the prosecutor to submit a reply regarding , inter alia , the above request . In his reply of DATE the prosecutor stated that it was not disputed that the applicant had been in contact with PERSON and PERSON by telephone also concerning matters other than the purchase of drugs . These conversations had not , however , been included in the case material and had been destroyed , as was required LAW , LAW ( pakkokeinolaki , tv\u00e5ngmedelslag , Act no . PERSON ) . Nor did the conversations in question , according to the prosecutor , relate to any other offence which would have allowed the police to keep the recordings without breaching the law . All the conversations that pertained to the matter had been retained , included in the case file and produced to the court .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the prosecutor \u2019s reply , ORG did not render a decision on the applicant \u2019s request . On DATE , following an oral hearing , the court upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction . It increased his prison sentence to DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its reasons the court stated , inter alia , that , apart from the testimonies given by the defendants , there was no evidence to support the allegations about purchasing weapons . Furthermore , the court found the GPE testimonies regarding those allegations not credible . It also found inconsistencies between the applicant \u2019s testimony and some of the telephone conversations , which had been played back to the court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) maintaining that his conviction had been based mainly , and in practice , on the ORG false interpretation of those telephone conversations which had been included in the case file . The defence had never been given access to a large number of recordings which had not been included therein , although a request to that end had been made during the pre - trial investigation . He submitted as evidence the response given by the police on DATE . As the recordings were subsequently destroyed , the applicant had been denied the right to assess their relevance for his defence . The applicant renewed his contention that the recordings which had not been included in the case file would have shown that he had been involved with the co - defendants in a transaction not related to the purchase of drugs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section QUANTITY of LAW , as in force at the relevant time , provided that an authority investigating a crime could be granted permission to intercept and record telephone calls made by a suspect using an extension in his possession or another extension presumably used by him , or calls received by a suspect through such an extension , if the information thus obtainable could be assumed to be of vital importance for solving a crime . This permission could only be granted for serious offences listed in the provision , including aggravated drugs offences . Weapons offences were not included in the list .", "CARDINAL . LAW , sections CARDINAL of the said Act provided that the head of the investigation or another official by his order was to check the recordings at the earliest convenience and that recordings containing information which was not related to the offence covered by the authorisation had to be destroyed after they had been checked . LAW allowed , however , the retention of recordings pertaining to such [ other ] offences where the interception of telecommunications could be permitted . Recordings which were not to be destroyed were to be retained for DATE after the case had been resolved with legally binding effect or removed from the docket .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW was amended by Act no . CARDINAL , which came into force on DATE . The current provision states that superfluous information obtained through interception of telecommunications but not related to the offence or pertaining to an offence other than the CARDINAL covered by the authorisation , is to be destroyed after the case has been resolved with legally binding effect or removed from the docket . The Government PERSON ( hallituksen esitys , regeringens proposition , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerning the amendment stated that , according to the provision in force at the time , superfluous information was to be destroyed as soon as it had been checked . Information supporting the innocence of the suspect could thus also be destroyed as superfluous information . The provision was thus proposed for amendment in order to ensure that all the material would be available for the [ subsequent ] proceedings , where necessary .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act on Public Prosecutors ( laki yleisist\u00e4 syytt\u00e4jist\u00e4 , lag om allm\u00e4nna \u00e5klagare , Act no . ORG ) provides , inter alia , that it is the duty of a prosecutor to see to the realisation of criminal liability in the consideration of a criminal case , the assessment of the charge and the trial in a manner consistent with the public interest and the legal safeguards of the parties .", "CARDINAL . The same principle applies to the conduct of the police , which has the duty , under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( esitutkintalaki , f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningslag , Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) to investigate and take into consideration the facts both for and against the suspect ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-b"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
