CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The present case concerns the confiscation and/or fining of the applicants for their failure to observe customs rules imposed by the authorities of the self - proclaimed \u201c GPE ( the \u201c FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants used cars registered with the authorities of GPE and had NORP registration plates . Like many other inhabitants of the \u201c FAC , the applicants refused to use registration plates issued by the \u201c FAC authorities , which are not recognised by any country and which means that cars registered with them can not leave the territory of GPE . In DATE , the \u201c FAC authorities adopted new rules , according to which any car with non - TIME registration plates could only enter the territory of the \u201c FAC \u201d after the payment of customs duties for temporary entry into the \u201c FAC . Failure to observe the new rules was punished with a fine which could be as high as the full value of the car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was driving a car ( the first car ) from his village to the right bank of the Dniester river when he was stopped by a customs officer of the \u201c FAC , who seized his car on the grounds that such a car with NORP plates had not been registered with the \u201c FAC customs authorities and no customs duties had been paid for its temporary use on the territory of the \u201c FAC . By a decision of DATE by the chief of the Dubasari ( \u201c FAC ) customs office , the applicant was ordered to pay a fine of MONEY , equal to PERCENT of the value of the car , in order to be able to recover it .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant borrowed a car from a friend ( the second car ) , which also had GPE number plates , and registered it with the \u201c FAC customs authorities by paying customs duties . The registration was due to expire on DATE . On DATE of the expiry , since the applicant was ill , he sent his son to prolong the car \u2019s registration period with the \u201c FAC customs authorities . However , registration of the car was refused on the grounds that the applicant had to be present in person . The applicant went DATE , only to have his car seized for failure to register it within the allocated time - limit . By a decision of DATE of the NORP customs office the applicant was ordered to pay CARDINAL Transdniestrian roubles , an amount which was equal to PERCENT of the value of the car , in order to be able to recover it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE before the courts of the \u201c FAC and argued , inter alia , that he had been going through the customs check - point since DATE and that nobody had informed him about the need to pay any customs duties . Moreover , the last time he had crossed the customs check - point had only been DATE prior to the confiscation of his car .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the NORP district court rejected the first applicant \u2019s challenge to the decision of the NORP customs office of CARDINAL DATE concerning his first car .

He did not contest the decision of the \u201c FAC customs authorities before the \u201c FAC courts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also complained to the authorities of GPE .
