{"ITEMID": "001-22273", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "HEMAT KAR v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP passport - holder but he also claim to be an NORP citizen . He is presently detained in GPE for deportation to GPE . He was represented before the Court by Ms Nyblom , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant came to GPE on DATE and DATE he lodged an asylum application in the name of PERSON . He claimed that he was an NORP citizen and that he had no passport or other travel documents . The only identification document he was able to produce was an NORP military book .", "In the initial inquiry the applicant stated that he was born in GPE , GPE , but before travelling to GPE he had lived in GPE . He had left GPE when the intelligence service was looking for him . He had been accused of collaboration with the Daawa party and imprisoned in GPE in DATE . He had fled from GPE because he did not feel safe due to the unstable political situation . He further stated that he did not know where his wife and children were .", "On DATE ORG in GPE informed ORG that some visitors had submitted CARDINAL pages of the applicant \u2019s NORP passport and had stated that the applicant had been an NORP national for DATE and that his family lived in GPE . When confronted with this information on DATE the applicant gave other reasons for his request for a residence permit .", "At the outset he answered that he had visited GPE and that if his wife was there she must have moved there recently . He further stated that in addition to NORP citizenship he also held NORP citizenship because his father had been an NORP national . The applicant claimed that he had lived in GPE his whole life and that he possessed an NORP passport , which would be sent to him . However , he never produced any such document to the NORP authorities .", "The applicant subsequently maintained that he could not go to GPE . He also claimed that he had not been politically active or committed any crime in GPE . Then he alleged that he had lived in GPE until DATE when he moved to GPE with his wife and family . They lived in GPE until DATE when the war between GPE and GPE broke out . His wife and children arrived in GPE at DATE or DATE and they are still living there . The applicant , however , \u201c commuted \u201d between Chaklawa in GPE and GPE before he left for GPE . He finally stated that he could not return to GPE because he had committed adultery with his sister - in - law and his brothers - in - law had initiated legal proceedings against him on the grounds of adultery . He claimed that he had left GPE when he was summoned to the court because he feared that he would be sentenced to inhuman punishment . In this respect he asserted that the penalty for adultery in GPE was stoning to death .", "On DATE ORG rejected his request for a residence permit and a working permit because of his lack of general credibility . At the same time ORG ordered his refusal of entry and that the applicant would be sent to GPE unless he showed that he would be received in another country . According to the applicant \u2019s own statements ORG drew attention to the fact that the applicant had departed from GPE airport holding a valid NORP passport and that he had not been politically active in GPE . He had thus been allowed to leave the country which indicated that he was not of special interest to the NORP authorities . Finally , ORG noted that NORP law placed exacting demands on the testimony of witnesses in order to convict a person of adultery . The applicant had , however , stated that there were no witnesses of the act . In ORG opinion , the applicant \u2019s assertion only to the effect that he had committed adultery was not a sufficient ground for granting him residence permit . It found no reasons to trust his assertion that he would be persecuted if returned to GPE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . In his appeal he stated that the reason why he had first denied being an NORP national was his fear of being expelled to GPE as he had committed adultery in that country . The applicant further claimed that the QUANTITY brothers of the woman in question had reported him and had also declared themselves as witnesses . In support of his claims he invoked a document in LANGUAGE , which he alleged was a summons to appear before a court on DATE . He further submitted CARDINAL warrants for his arrest dated DATE , which he alleged that he had received from a friend in GPE who had visited the applicant \u2019s closest neighbour in GPE . He finally asserted that a friend would send a judgment to him .", "In observations dated DATE the applicant claimed that there had been a misunderstanding regarding the above - mentioned judgment . The document he had now received from his friend , who had bribed an official at the police , was a court request to apprehend him immediately and make him answer to the charges of adultery . CARDINAL named persons had reported him for the crime and declared themselves as witnesses . According to the applicant the document proved that a judgment concerning adultery would be rendered .", "ORG had the above mentioned documents translated into NORP and the translations were sent to the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant submitted , inter alia , that it was clear that he was wanted by the police in GPE for adultery , that he was accused of immoral behaviour and an improper relationship with his sister - in - law and that it appeared from CARDINAL of the documents that a judgment existed . The sentence for adultery was , claimed the applicant , stoning to death .", "By decision of DATE ORG rejected his appeal . ORG shared the opinion of ORG that the applicant had given contradictory information and found that the explanations provided for this were unconvincing . It also noted that NORP law placed very exacting demands on testimony of witnesses in order to convict a person of adultery .", "As regards the documents , which according to the applicant proved that he was summoned to court and would be apprehended and arrested for adultery , ORG observed the following . The applicant had stated that the summons had been delivered to his neighbours and that a friend of his received it from them . Moreover , he had affirmed that a court had rendered a judgment and that it would be sent to him . Later the applicant had indicated that this was a misunderstanding and that the document he had received was a request from the court to apprehend him and that he had obtained the document from a friend who had bribed the police . He had then claimed that a judgment existed because it was stated in one of the documents that \u201c in order to enforce this judgment according to NORP criminal laws the accused is to be transported urgently to this court house \u201d . ORG also found that the applicant had submitted contradictory information regarding the documents and that he had not given an acceptable explanation for this . It appeared from the translation that CARDINAL of the documents , named \u201c Warrant of arrest \u201d and dated DATE , was issued by ORG and addressed to the Commander of the police within ORG . It was further observed in the warrant : \u201c in accordance with a report made by the plaintiffs , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , against PERSON , accused of immoral behaviour and an improper relationship with his sister - in - law , who are both married and have children . The court finds this proved . \u201d Another document , ORG noted , also named \u201c Warrant of arrest \u201d and issued on DATE , was signed by the interrogator / assisting prosecutor at the office of the public prosecutor . ORG found it remarkable that the applicant had been able to get access to these documents as they seemed to be part of a correspondence between authorities . It further questioned the wording and the contents of the documents and especially noted that in CARDINAL of the documents , the summons application , the office of the public prosecutor was mentioned , an office that was abolished in GPE in connection with a reform of the court system in DATE . For these reasons ORG gave no credence to the documents in question .", "In DATE , in the course of the proceedings before the ORG , the applicant submitted to it CARDINAL additional documents . The first was a letter from ORG ( in exile ) , according to which an investigation conducted by the association showed that proceedings eventually had been initiated against the applicant on account of adultery , but that no judgment had been delivered . The other document submitted by the applicant was an e - mail from a NORP law professor of NORP origin , stating that he had no reason to put in question the authenticity of the arrest warrants , noting that they were issued by an investigating judge carrying out tasks previously done by public prosecutors . However , he could not express any view on the possibility of getting access to such documents . He also assumed that the assessment of ORG had been based on a non - professional translation of these documents .", "Following the ORG \u2019s indication under LAW , ORG decided on DATE to stay the enforcement of its decision of CARDINAL DATE refusing the applicant entry into GPE and ordering his expulsion to GPE .", "The CARDINAL documents ( the alleged summons application and the CARDINAL warrants of arrest ) the applicant has invoked in support of his claim have been examined by legal experts at the request of ORG in GPE . They concluded that the documents were not authentic and that the alleged case regarding adultery does not exist . An inquiry to the NORP court designated in CARDINAL of the documents revealed that the case in question concerned cheque fraud and not immoral behaviour or adultery . According to the ORG , the kind of court mentioned did not even handle cases of adultery ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
