National practices regarding the right to vote of citizens living abroad and its exercise are far from uniform in LOC .", "CARDINAL .

That is true at least of persons who are temporarily out of the country .

The proportions of citizens living out of the country may also vary greatly from CARDINAL country to another .

It is perfectly legitimate to require voters living abroad to register to be able to vote , even if registration is automatic for residents .", "CARDINAL . The obligation to vote in an embassy or consulate may in practice severely restrict the right to vote of citizens living abroad .

To sum up , while the denial of the right to vote to citizens living abroad or the placing of limits on that right constitutes a restriction of the principle of universal suffrage , the ORG does not consider at this stage that the principles of the NORP electoral heritage require the introduction of such a right .", "CARDINAL . Although the introduction of the right to vote for citizens who live abroad is not required by the principles of the NORP electoral heritage , ORG PERSON suggests that GPE , in view of NORP mobility , and in accordance with the particular situation of certain GPE , adopt a positive approach to the right to vote of citizens living abroad , since this right fosters the development of national and NORP citizenship . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
