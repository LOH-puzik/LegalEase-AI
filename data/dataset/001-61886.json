The applicants submitted that ORG had armed the separatists in CARDINAL ways : firstly , ammunition stores belonging to ORG had been opened up to the separatists ; secondly , ORG personnel had offered no resistance when separatist militiamen and civilians tried to seize military equipment and ammunition . For example , no force had been used against ORG , led by PERSON .", "The ORG notes the explanation given by an ORG officer ( see PERSON : Colonel PERSON , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) about the forcible seizure of weapons by women and children and observes that this account was contested by all the GPE witnesses questioned on the subject .", "The ORG considers it highly improbable that women and children could have seized weapons and ammunition guarded by armed military personnel in locked stores without the guards ' agreement .", "In short , the ORG considers it to have been established beyond a reasonable doubt that NORP separatists were able to arm themselves with weapons taken from the stores of ORG stationed in GPE . The ORG troops chose not to oppose the separatists who had come to help themselves from the ORG 's stores ; on the contrary , in many cases they helped the separatists equip themselves by handing over weapons and by opening up the ammunition stores to them ( see PERSON : Mr GPE , \u00a7 DATE ; Mr PERSON , LAW ; PERSON , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL ; Mr ORG , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and PERSON , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants asserted that ORG troops had joined the separatist side with the evident approval of their superiors .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINALth ORG 's ORG sapper battalion , under the orders of General PERSON , had gone over to the separatist side . That information has been confirmed by ORG . The applicants went on to say that at the time of this \u201c transfer \u201d the sappers were in possession of a considerable number of PERSON rifles , cartridges , ORG and ORG pistols , grenades and grenade launchers and air - to - ground rocket launchers . It was the ORG battalion which had destroyed the bridges at PERSON , PERSON and GPE .", "The applicants further asserted that , on DATE , armoured combat vehicles , mine throwers , battle tanks and armoured transport vehicles were transferred from ORG units to the separatists . In addition , during the fighting , DATE ORG helicopters had taken part in transporting ammunition and the wounded on the separatist side .", "In a written statement sent to the ORG by PERSON representative on DATE , PERSON , a former volunteer attached to ORG from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , said that during that period , as evidenced by a certificate issued by ORG , she had worked for the general staff of the NORP army , at ORG command and espionage centre , under the name of PERSON . While working there , she had sent ORG of documents confirming the participation of NORP troops in the armed operations and the massive contribution of weapons they had made . She had also gathered information proving that the separatists ' military operations were directed by ORG , which coordinated all its actions with ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants asserted that CARDINAL of NORP ORG had come from GPE to fight alongside the separatists ; ORG , a NORP association , had been recognised by the NORP authorities . They alleged that the arrival of the ORG from GPE had not been hindered in any way by the NORP authorities , in spite of the appeal to them made by the NORP President , Mr PERSON . On the contrary , ORG officers had welcomed CARDINAL ORG at DATE and armed them . The applicants asserted in that connection that , whereas in DATE there had been no ORG in GPE territory , CARDINAL ORG who had come from GPE were now living in NORP territory .", "ORG submitted that ORG could be found in other parts of the world and that everyone had the right to freedom of movement .", "The ORG notes that several documents in the file and statements taken down by the delegates show that large numbers of ORG and other NORP nationals went to GPE to fight alongside the separatists . It further notes that ORG have not denied this .", "The ORG accordingly considers it to be established beyond a reasonable doubt that large numbers of NORP nationals went to GPE to fight in the ranks of the NORP separatists against the NORP forces .", "CARDINAL . In a book published in DATE by the publishing house ORG and entitled General PERSON Russian Enigma , the author , PERSON , supplies plentiful evidence , backed up by documentary sources , of the support given by ORG to the NORP separatists . The book mentions , for example , the creation by General PERSON of the NORP joint defence headquarters and the participation by ORG in the military operations conducted by the NORP forces against the NORP \u201c enemy \u201d .", "Referring to this book , the applicants mentioned by way of example the destruction of a NORP unit by ORG at PERSON on DATE and the shelling by ORG of several NORP positions at GPE , ORG DATE and DATE .", "The other parties did not comment on the information given in the book .", "CARDINAL . The applicants further submitted that the bridge abutments on the left bank of the Dniester had been mined by ORG personnel .", "The ORG notes that CARDINAL witness directly involved at the highest level in the military operations during the conflict asserted that part of the territory on the left bank of the PERSON had been mined , that this work had been done by specialists , and that after the end of the conflict the NORP army had had to have recourse to foreign specialists in order to demine the area ( see PERSON : PERSON , \u00a7 MONEY ) . That information was not disputed by the other parties .", "Taking account also of the witness 's credibility , the ORG can take it to be established that part of NORP territory situated on the left bank of the PERSON was mined by the forces opposing the NORP army . On the other hand , it notes that this witness was unable to assert categorically that the mines had been laid by ORG personnel , but merely contended that logically work of such a technical level could only have been carried out by professionals , that is by ORG troops . It likewise notes that this witness asserted that the separatists had seized anti - personnel mines previously held in the CARDINALth ORG 's stores . In the circumstances , the ORG considers that this assertion is not certain \u201c beyond a reasonable doubt \u201d and therefore can not take it as established that it was CARDINALth ORG or ORG personnel who laid mines on the left bank of the Dniester .", "CARDINAL . ORG asserted that they had never claimed that the army of GPE had been legally stationed in GPE territory , or that ORG had not intervened in the NORP conflict .", "On the contrary , they asserted , as appeared from the witness evidence taken by the ORG 's delegates , that ORG had intervened actively , both directly and indirectly , in the NORP conflict , against the armed forces of GPE . The NORP separatists had been able to arm themselves with weapons belonging to ORG and with ORG complicity . ORG considered that no faith could be placed in assertions that women had forcibly seized weapons and ammunition from the CARDINALth ORG 's stores . Moreover , not a single NORP soldier had subsequently been disciplined for negligence or complicity in the seizure of equipment from ORG stores .", "CARDINAL . ORG argued that ORG had been in GPE when the NORP conflict broke out . The NORP military forces as such had taken no part whatsoever in the fighting and had not been involved in the acts complained of . However , where illegal armed operations had been carried out against soldiers of ORG , appropriate measures had been taken in accordance with international law . In general , ORG were prepared to accept as a hypothesis that individuals claiming allegiance to ORG might have taken part in the acts in issue , but emphasised that if that had been the case such conduct would have constituted a gross breach of NORP legislation , for which the individuals responsible would have been punished .", "ORG went on to say that GPE had remained neutral in the conflict . In particular , it had not supported the combatants in any way , whether militarily or financially .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that all the NORP witnesses questioned categorically confirmed the active involvement , whether direct or indirect , of ORG , and later of the ROG , in the transfer of weapons to the NORP separatists . They also confirmed the participation of NORP troops in the conflict , particularly the involvement of tanks bearing the flag of GPE , shots fired towards the NORP positions from units of ORG and the transfer of a large number of ORG troops to the reserves so that they could fight alongside the NORP or train them ( see PERSON : PERSON , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and Mr Creang\u0103 , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "These assertions are corroborated by the information contained in LOC report no . CARDINAL of DATE , added to the file by ORG , and by other sources ( see PERSON : Mr NORP , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . In that connection , the ORG notes both the abundance and the detailed nature of the information in its possession on this subject .", "It sees no reason to doubt the credibility of the NORP witnesses heard , and notes that their assertions are corroborated by ORG , who confirmed these facts in all of the observations they submitted throughout the proceedings .", "As to ORG allegation that the witnesses belonged to political circles opposed to GPE , the ORG notes that this has not been substantiated .", "Moreover , it is not possible for the ORG to determine precisely on the basis of the statements taken what the relative strengths of the combatants were . However , regard being had to the support given by the troops of ORG to the separatist forces and the massive transfer of arms and ammunition from ORG stores to the separatists , it is certain that the NORP army was in a position of inferiority that prevented it from regaining control of GPE ( see Annex : Z , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and PERSON , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP parliament protested against the silence of the NORP authorities , amounting to complicity in its view , about the support allegedly given to the NORP separatists by armed groups of ORG from GPE belonging to ORG , an association recognised by the NORP authorities . The NORP parliament asked ORG of GPE to intervene , with a view to securing the immediate withdrawal of ORG from NORP territory .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE met in GPE , where they adopted a declaration laying down a number of principles for the peaceful settlement of the conflict . At further meetings held in DATE and DATE in PERSON , the CARDINAL ministers decided to set up ORG and a group of military observers to supervise observance of any ceasefire .", "DATE .

On DATE the President of GPE , Mr PERSON , decreed a state of emergency . He noted that \u201c adventurers \u201d had created on the left bank of the Dniester , \u201c not without outside help \u201d , a \u201c pseudo - State \u201d , and that , \u201c armed to the teeth with the most up - to - date equipment of the NORP army \u201d , they had unleashed armed conflict , doing everything they could to bring about the intervention in the conflict of ORG of the combined armed forces of the ORG . Under the state of emergency , ORG and of the ORG and other relevant bodies , acting in concert with the units of the NORP army , were ordered by the President to take all necessary measures to break up and disarm illegally armed formations and seek out and bring to justice all those who had committed crimes against the organs of the ORG and the population of the LOC . The founders of the \u201c so - called GPE \u201d and their accomplices were enjoined to dissolve illegal armed formations and surrender to the organs of the Republic .", "CARDINAL . By Decree no .
