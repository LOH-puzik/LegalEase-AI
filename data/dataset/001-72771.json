The applicant maintained that , despite ORG minutes , PERSON had not presented alternative charges of \u201c without better knowledge \u201d during the principal hearing , and that had this occurred while he was absent on DATE , it was in any case prohibited .", "Further , the applicant complained that the final statements submitted by him to the police on DATE ( charge no .

He maintained that as the police had conducted CARDINAL further witness interrogations and other investigative measures after his final statements , he did not have at his disposal the entire pre - trial investigation reports as ORG had , according to the applicant , wrongly held . He also complained that punishing legal counsel for pursuing their GPE cases would impede the ORG actions .", "The applicant further maintained that the presiding judge had allowed PERSON to insult him during the trial several times which disclosed bias and rendered the trial unfair .", "On DATE ORG , without having held an oral hearing , upheld ORG judgment , accepting its reasons and upholding the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence .
