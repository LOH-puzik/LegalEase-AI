The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is an active member of civil society who holds leading positions in several NGOs , including ORG , ORG and PERSON charity fund . He is of an NORP origin and since DATE has apparently been permanently resident in GPE where he has a family and owns an apartment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appears to be a critic of the NORP authorities . He alleges that in this connection he has been invited to visit ORG ( ORG ) on several occasions , where he was ordered to stop his cooperation with the opposition and his criticism of the government .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the Head of ORG of the ORG filed a motion , seeking to carry out secret surveillance and recording of the applicant \u2019s telephone and other conversations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE and ORG of GPE examined the motion , finding :", "\u201c It is evident from the materials submitted to the court and the motion that ORG of the ORG has sufficient grounds to believe that [ the applicant ] , born in DATE in GPE , a NORP national , residing at CARDINAL PERSON , apt DATE , GPE , leader of ORG , is carrying out activities aimed to destabilise the internal political situation in GPE and to create a situation of civil disobedience , thereby creating a basis for the change of government in GPE through unconstitutional means by making public calls . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG decided to grant the motion , authorising the interception and recording of the applicant \u2019s telephone and other conversations made to and from the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL mobile and CARDINAL landline numbers for DATE , taking into account that they might contain information substantiating the above - mentioned circumstances , the use of which would facilitate the disclosure of a crime and obtaining evidence , since there were elements of an offence prescribed by LAW in the applicant \u2019s actions . In doing so , ORG referred to , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( CCP ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave a speech at an assembly organised by ORG . The assembly took place in the hall of ORG and was attended by CARDINAL people . The applicant called on the participants of the assembly to get organised , otherwise nothing would move forward . It was not enough to keep telling the President and the Prime Minister to resign ; they would never do that . Peaceful assemblies would not make them resign . Nor would external pressure . He called on the participants to create a significant force , in order to make the authorities resign , stating that the main and only objective was to get rid of them . He further stressed that they should not allow those in power to multiply , otherwise the future plans of the participants of the assembly would encounter serious obstacles . The applicant called the authorities \u201c monsters \u201d who would become even more dangerous if they were allowed to multiply . The applicant agreed with other speech makers that any means were acceptable for achieving their goals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG decided to institute criminal proceedings under LAW on the ground that public calls for a violent overthrow of the government had been made during the speeches given at the above assembly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicant was arrested and taken to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s office was searched , as a result of which a revolver and various types of bullets were found .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the relevant arrest record was drawn up . It stated that the applicant was suspected of offences under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG . It appears that his passport was seized .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was questioned as a suspect . He refused to give testimony , stating that the criminal proceedings against him were politically motivated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was formally charged under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG . He was accused of making calls for a violent overthrow of the government and of not handing in , and illegally keeping , his weapon after his demobilisation in DATE . Another person , PERSON , who had also given a speech at the above assembly , was accused together with the applicant under LAW . Their speeches had been recorded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator filed a motion with the GPE and ORG of GPE , seeking to have the applicant detained for DATE and arguing that , if at large , he could abscond and obstruct the investigation . It appears that on DATE members of the parliament filed a statement with ORG , giving their personal guarantees for the applicant \u2019s proper conduct and requesting that no detention be imposed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the investigator \u2019s motion , including the charge and the circumstances surrounding it . ORG decided to grant the motion , taking into account the nature and degree of dangerousness of the imputed offence and the fact that it was at the top of the list of offences directed against state power and finding that the materials of the case provided sufficient reasons to believe that the applicant could abscond and obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on persons involved in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal , arguing , inter alia , that there was no reasonable suspicion of his having committed an offence and that ORG had failed to provide reasons justifying the necessity of his placement in detention . He submitted , in particular , that the investigating authority had a recording of his speech at its disposal , so the allegation that he could unlawfully influence witnesses was unfounded . Furthermore , the allegation that he could abscond was not supported by any arguments or evidence , while the court did not take into account the fact that he was a permanent resident in GPE , with CARDINAL minor children and an elderly , sick mother who were dependent on him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . In dismissing the applicant \u2019s argument about the lack of a reasonable suspicion , ORG found that his involvement in the imputed acts , which included features of offences envisaged by Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG , was substantiated by evidence , such as various records and expert opinions , produced by the investigator and examined in court . As to the reasons given by ORG , ORG found these to be justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a motion requesting to be released on bail . He submitted that he was known to the investigating authority and the court , he had a clear and concrete place of residence and he had never attempted to abscond . He asked the court to fix the amount of bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another person , V.A. , who was the applicant \u2019s friend , was also charged under LAW ORG with illegal possession of firearms and ammunition in the context of the same criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for bail , citing the same grounds as those justifying his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld this decision , adding that the applicant was a foreign national and therefore could abscond . Furthermore , it was unacceptable to release the applicant on bail in view of the fact that his co - accused , V.A. , who was also charged with illegal possession of firearms and ammunition , was in detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator filed a motion with ORG seeking to have the applicant \u2019s detention period , which was to expire on DATE , extended by DATE . The investigator argued that the applicant could abscond because he was a foreign national . He further argued that on DATE the applicant had transmitted through his lawyer a short note to co - accused V.A. which said \u201c be strong \u201d . This suggested that he was attempting to exert unlawful influence on the participants in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having examined the investigator \u2019s motion and other materials , granted this motion , finding that there was a need to carry out further investigative measures and citing the same grounds as before in justifying the applicant \u2019s continued detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal . In his appeal he argued , inter alia , that the extension of his detention had been effected in violation of the time - limits prescribed by LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , finding that ORG , taking into account the circumstances mentioned in the investigator \u2019s motion , had taken a reasoned decision , since the grounds for the applicant \u2019s detention had not ceased to exist . As to the violation of the time - limits , ORG considered this not to be of such gravity as to have affected the correct outcome of examination of the investigator \u2019s motion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator filed a motion with ORG seeking to have the applicant \u2019s detention period , which was to expire on DATE , extended by DATE on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined and granted this motion on the same grounds . In the proceedings before ORG the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked the court whether any evidence had been submitted by the investigator in support of his motion which would be examined in court . The presiding judge replied that the materials of the criminal case related to the motion had been submitted by the investigator during the examination of his previous motion . These materials had been examined and returned by the court . The criminal procedure rules did not allow the lawyers access to the materials of a criminal case before the completion of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . Following this announcement the applicant \u2019s lawyer challenged the judge \u2019s impartiality , inter alia , on the ground that the judge had not disclosed the materials in question to the defence during the previous proceedings . The judge dismissed this challenge with reference to , inter alia , LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal , raising similar arguments as previously .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that his lawyers had not been notified of the hearing to take place upon his appeal and were therefore not able to appear .", "CARDINAL . The Government contested this allegation and alleged that on CARDINAL DATE ORG had sent notifications to both ORG and the applicant \u2019s lawyers , which were received by them , informing them that the hearing on the applicant \u2019s appeal would take place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lawyers filed a challenge with the Chairman of ORG , contesting the impartiality of the judges who were assigned to examine the appeal . The lawyers stated in their challenge that they had been informed on DATE that the case had been assigned to a judge rapporteur .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s appeal in the absence of both parties . ORG decided to dismiss the appeal with the same reasoning as on DATE . This decision stated that the parties had been duly notified of the hearing but failed to appear . The same follows from the transcript of the court hearing , in which it was stated that the parties had also been informed by a judge \u2019s assistant by telephone . It appears that a copy of this decision was received by the applicant \u2019s lawyers on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the investigation was over and from DATE May the applicant was granted access to the case file . He submits that only then did he find out about the decision of CARDINAL DATE authorising the secret surveillance of his telephone communications .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor approved the indictment and the case was sent to court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON of the GPE and ORG of GPE decided to take over the applicant \u2019s criminal case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention period , authorised by the decision of CARDINAL DATE , expired .", "CARDINAL .

He sought to be released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON decided to put the applicant \u2019s criminal case down for trial . This decision stated that the preventive measure imposed on the applicant was to remain unchanged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE and ORG of GPE found the applicant guilty under LAW and acquitted him LAW . ORG , having examined the statements the applicant had made in his speech , found that they could not be qualified as calls for a violent overthrow of the government . As to the charge of illegal possession of a weapon , ORG found that the applicant had kept the weapon and the ammunition without a permit after his demobilisation . The applicant was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant \u2019s CARDINAL co - accused were found guilty as charged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld this judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the ORG provide :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
