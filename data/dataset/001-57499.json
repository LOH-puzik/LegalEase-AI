After having arranged for the translation of the book into LANGUAGE the applicant prepared an edition for GPE with the help of a group of children and teachers . He had previously consulted a variety of people about the value of the book and intended publication in GPE on DATE . As soon as printing was completed he sent out CARDINAL review copies of the book , together with a press release , to a selection of publications from national and local newspapers to educational and medical journals . He also placed advertisements for the book in various publications including ORG , ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG published an account of the book 's contents , and other accounts appeared in ORG and the DATE FAC on DATE . Further reports were carried by ORG on DATE and DATE ; they also indicated that representations would be made to ORG demanding that action should be taken against the publication of the book .

After receipt of a number of complaints , on DATE ORG asked ORG to undertake enquiries . As a result of these , on DATE , a successful application was made for a warrant under LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL to search the premises occupied by CARDINAL in GPE . The warrant was issued in the applicant 's absence but in accordance with the procedure laid down by LANGUAGE law and a copy of the Schoolbook was before the judicial authority which issued the warrant . It was executed on DATE and CARDINAL copies of the book were provisionally seized together with leaflets , posters , showcards and correspondence relating to its publication and sale .", "CARDINAL . Acting on the advice of his lawyers the applicant continued distributing copies of the book in DATE .

DATE altogether CARDINAL copies of the book were seized at Stage CARDINAL 's premises and , at the printer 's , CARDINAL spoiled copies of the book , together with correspondence relating to it and the matrix with which the book was printed .

He thereupon ceased distribution of the book and advised bookshops accordingly but , by that time , CARDINAL copies were already in circulation .", "CARDINAL . The summonses were answerable on CARDINAL DATE at ORG but , on the application of ORG , the case was adjourned until DATE . On DATE the applicant appeared at ORG to which the case had been transferred , having consented to the case being heard and determined in summary proceedings by a magistrate rather than by a judge and a jury on indictment . He claims that this choice was dictated by his financial plight and the need to avoid the delays inherent in the indictment procedure although this is questioned by the Government . Having been granted legal aid , he was represented by counsel . On DATE , after witnesses had been called for both prosecution and defence , the applicant was found guilty of both offences and fined \u00a3 MONEY on each summons and ordered to pay \u00a3 MONEY costs .

Pending the appeal hearing , the applicant consulted his legal advisers concerning a revision of the ORG to avoid further prosecutions ; apparently he tried to consult ORG as well , but in vain . It was decided to eliminate or re - write the offending lines which had been attacked before ORG by the prosecution but to do so necessitated , in some cases , re - writing substantially more than these criticised sentences . There were other alterations made to the text by way of general improvement , for example in response to comments and suggestions from readers and the updating of changed data ( addresses , etc . ) .", "CARDINAL . The revised edition was published on DATE . After consulting the Attorney General , ORG announced on DATE that the new edition would not be the subject of a prosecution .

At the time of the events under review , the authorities frequently adopted a non - contentious procedure ( \" disclaimer / caution procedure \" ) rather than instituting , as in this case , criminal proceedings . However it could only be used when the individual admitted that the article was obscene and consented to its destruction . The procedure constituted no more than a matter of practice and was abandoned in DATE following criticisms expressed in a judicial decision .", "The judgment of the Inner London Quarter Sessions", "CARDINAL . At the appeal hearing CARDINAL principal issues were examined by the court , namely , first , whether or not the ORG had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Schoolbook was an obscene article within the meaning of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL Acts ; and secondly , if so , whether or not the applicant had established the defence under LAW to the effect that he had shown , on a balance of probabilities , that publication of the book was justified as being for the public good .", "CARDINAL . The court first dealt with the issue of obscenity . Following a decision in another case the court noted that it had to be satisfied that the persons who it was alleged were likely to read the article would constitute a significant proportion . It also accepted the meaning of the words \" deprave and corrupt \" as it had been explained in that other case and about which there had been no dispute between the parties .", "CARDINAL . Following further previous case - law , the court had decided that expert evidence should be admitted on the question of whether the ORG was obscene . Such evidence , though not normally admissible for this purpose but only in connection with the defence under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL Acts , could be heard in the present case which was concerned with the effect of the article upon children .", "The court had therefore heard CARDINAL witnesses on behalf of the prosecution and CARDINAL on behalf of the applicant , being experts in various fields , in particular those of psychiatry and teaching ; the views they had expressed were very different . After they had been heard , the applicant had argued that , when one had the sincere opinion of many highly - qualified experts against the prosecution 's case , it was impossible to say that the tendency to deprave and corrupt had been established with certainty . The court was unable to accept this submission : in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE it pointed out that there was an almost infinite variation in the relevant background of the children who would be in CARDINAL way or another affected by the book , so that it was difficult to speak of \" true facts \" in this case . The views of the applicant 's witnesses had been those approaching the extreme of CARDINAL wing of the more broadly varied outlook on the education and upbringing of children , whereas the evidence given on behalf of the prosecution tended to cover the views of those who , although clearly tending in the opposite direction , were less radical . Particularly , when looking at the evidence on behalf of the applicant , the court had been driven to the conclusion that most of the witnesses were so uncritical of the book looked at as a whole , and so unrestrained in their praise of it , as to make them at times less convincing than otherwise they might have been . In summary the court considered that a good deal of the witnesses had been so single - minded in an extreme point of view as to forfeit in a large measure the power to judge with that degree of responsibility which makes the evidence of any great value on a matter of this sort .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the Schoolbook itself , the court first stressed that it was intended for children passing through a highly critical stage of their development . At such a time a very high degree of responsibility ought to be exercised by the courts . In the present case , they had before them , as something said to be a perfectly responsible adult opinion , a work of an extreme kind , unrelieved by any indication that there were any alternative views ; this was something which detracted from the opportunity for children to form a balanced view on some of the very strong advice given therein .", "CARDINAL . The court then briefly examined the background . For example , looking at the book as a whole , marriage was very largely ignored . Mixing a very CARDINAL - sided opinion with fact and purporting to be a book of reference , it would tend to undermine , for a very considerable proportion of children , many of the influences , such as those of parents , the ORG and youth organisations , which might otherwise provide the restraint and sense of responsibility for oneself which found inadequate expression in the book .", "The court reached the conclusion that , on the whole , and quite clearly through the mind of the child , the ORG was inimical to good teacher / child relationships ; in particular , there were numerous passages that it found to be subversive , not only to the authority but to the influence of the trust between children and teachers .", "CARDINAL . Passing to the tendency to deprave and corrupt , the court considered the atmosphere of the book looked at as a whole , noting that the sense of some responsibility for the community as well as to oneself , if not wholly absent , was completely subordinated to the development of the expression of itself by the child . As indications of what it considered to result in a tendency to deprave and corrupt , the court quoted or referred to the following :", "\" Maybe you smoke pot or go to bed with your boyfriend or girlfriend - and do n't tell your parents or teachers , either because you do n't dare to or just because you want to keep it secret .", "Do n't feel ashamed or guilty about doing things you really want to do and think are right just because your parents or teachers might disapprove . A lot of these things will be more important to you later in life than the things that are ' approved of ' . \"", "The objectionable point was that there was no reference there to the illegality of smoking pot which was only to be found many pages further on in an entirely different part of the book . Similarly there was no specific mention at all in the book of the illegality of sexual intercourse by a boy who has attained the age of DATE and a girl who has not yet attained DATE . It had to be remembered that the Schoolbook was indicated as a work of reference and that one looked up the part which one wanted rather than read it as a whole book .", "\" Porn is a harmless pleasure if it is n't taken seriously and believed to be real life . Anybody who mistakes it for reality will be greatly disappointed .", "But it 's quite possible that you may get some good ideas from it and you may find something which looks interesting and that you have n't tried before . \"", "Unfortunately , the sane and sensible first paragraph quoted above was immediately followed by a passage suggesting to children that in pornography they might find some good ideas which they might adopt . This was to raise the real likelihood that a substantial number of children would feel it incumbent upon them to look for and practise such things . Moreover , just on the previous page there was the following passage : \" But there are other kinds - for example pictures of intercourse with animals or pictures of people hurting each other in various ways . Pornographic stories describe the same sort of thing . \" The court considered that , although it was improbable that young people would be likely to commit sexual offences with animals as a result of this , the possibility that they should practise some other forms of cruelty to CARDINAL another , for sexual satisfaction , was a real likelihood in the case of a significant number of children if this got into the hands of children at a disturbed , unsettled and sexually excited stage of their lives . Such acts might very well be criminal offences just like smoking pot and sexual intercourse between a boy of CARDINAL and a girl not yet CARDINAL . The expression \" to deprave and corrupt \" must include the admission of or the encouragement to commit criminal offences of that kind .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded \" in the light of the whole of the book that this book or this article on sex or this section or chapter on pupils , whichever one chooses as an article , looked at as a whole does tend to deprave and corrupt a significant number , significant proportion , of the children likely to read it \" . Such children would , it was satisfied , include a very substantial number aged DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court finally dealt with the issue of the defence under LAW . It stated that no doubt there were many features about the book which , taken by themselves , were good . The unfortunate thing was that so frequently the good was intermixed with things that were bad and detracted from it .", "For example , much of the information about contraceptives ( pp . CARDINAL ) was very relevant and desirable which should be laid before very many children who might not otherwise readily have access to it . But it was damaged by the suggestion , backed by the recommendation to take direct action if the school authorities would not give way that every school should have CARDINAL contraceptive vending machine ( p. CARDINAL ) .", "Similarly , the treatment of the subject of homosexuality ( pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) was a factual , very compassionate , understanding and valuable statement . But again , no matter how good one assessed the value of this section , it was hopelessly damning by its setting and context , and the fact that it , only , contained any suggestion of a stable relationship in relation to sex and that marriage received no such treatment at all . Moreover , there was a very real danger that this passage would create in the minds of children a conclusion that that kind of relationship was something permanent .", "Again , there were passages with regard to venereal diseases ( pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , contraception ( pp . CARDINAL ) and abortion ( pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , containing dispassionately and sensibly , and on the whole completely accurately , a great deal of advice which ought not to be denied to young children . However , on the balance of probabilities , these matters could not outweigh what the court was convinced had a tendency to deprave and corrupt . The court asked itself whether , granted the degree of indecency which it found , the good likely to result from the Schoolbook was such that it ought , nevertheless , to be published in the public interest ; it regretfully came to the conclusion that the burden on the appellant to show that \" publication of the article in question is justified as being for the public good \" had not been discharged .", "Further details concerning the revised edition", "CARDINAL . The passages from the original edition of the ORG whose \" extreme \" tone or \" subversive \" aspects had been emphasised by the judgment of DATE ( paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) are repeated either with no , or with no important , changes in the revised edition which was prepared before that date but published on DATE ( paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "Of the passages cited by DATE as striking examples of the tendency to deprave and corrupt ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) , one was not altered ( p. CARDINAL , \" Be yourself \" ) . On the other hand , the others were fairly extensively softened ( pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , \" Intercourse and petting \" , and pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , \" Pornography \" ) and on page CARDINAL of the work there is now a mention of the illegality of sexual intercourse with a girl under CARDINAL .", "Furthermore , the revised edition no longer has any reference to the installation in schools of contraceptive vending machines and points out , on page CARDINAL , that homosexual tendencies are often temporary ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "14", "18"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
