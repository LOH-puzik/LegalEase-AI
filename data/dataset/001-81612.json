RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6;Violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She receives an old - age pension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Law on Calculation and Adjustment of State Pensions ( hereafter \u201c the Pensions Act \u201d ) introduced a new method of calculation of retirement benefits based on what is known as the \u201c individual pensioner coefficient \u201d ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The ORG was the ratio between an individual 's wages at the time of retirement and the national average wage . The ORG was meant to maintain a link between pensions and previous earnings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant considered that ORG of ORG ( hereafter \u201c the Fund \u201d ) had incorrectly calculated her pension and in DATE she sued the ORG for an increase of her pension in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found in the applicant 's favour . ORG held that the ORG had misconstrued the law and that the applicant 's pensions should be recalculated and increased in line with an ORG of CARDINAL starting from DATE . ORG also awarded the applicant MONEY ( RUR ) in pension arrears . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG requested ORG to reopen the case owing to a newly - discovered circumstance . The ORG claimed that on DATE ORG had issued an Instruction on the Application of Limitations established by LAW . The LAW clarified how LAW should be applied . The ORG further indicated that on DATE ORG of GPE had dismissed the complaint by a group of individuals challenging the ORG . ORG found that ORG had acted within its competence when it had issued the ORG , and that the ORG 's interpretation of LAW had been correct . The Fund contended that since it had been unaware of ORG decision of DATE at the time of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the judgment would have to be reconsidered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the ORG 's request , quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and reopened the proceedings . ORG applied Article CARDINAL of LAW according to which judgments could be reconsidered in the event of discovery of significant circumstances which were not , and could not have been , known to the party concerned . ORG found that the ORG could serve as such a circumstance . The decision of DATE was final and not amenable to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after the fresh examination of the case , dismissed the applicant 's action in full . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ( in force at the material time ) provided for grounds for reconsideration of final judgments on the basis of \u201c newly - discovered circumstances \u201d . Such grounds included , inter alia , significant circumstances which were not and could not have been known to the party which applied for reconsideration , and invalidation of a court ruling or another authority 's decision which had served as a legal basis for the judgment in question .", "Article CARDINAL required that an application for reconsideration of a judgment owing to the discovery of new circumstances should be lodged within DATE after the discovery of the circumstances .", "Pursuant to LAW on the basis of newly - discovered circumstances , should either grant such an application and quash the final judgment or dismiss the application . Such a decision was not amenable to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE adopted a ruling concerning certain provisions of LAW ( CCrP ) . In that ruling ORG decided that LAW CCrP ( \u201c FAC for reconsideration of a [ criminal ] case on the basis of newly discovered circumstances \u201d , which was in many respects similar to LAW ) was unconstitutional in that it limited the grounds for the reopening of a criminal case to situations of \u201c newly discovered circumstances \u201d . In that ruling ORG suggested that this provision of the ORG prevented rectification of judicial errors and miscarriages of justice ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
