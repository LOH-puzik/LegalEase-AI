Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in GPE , GPE , in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was convicted at ORG on DATE of causing actual bodily harm to a woman passer - by in a random and unprovoked attack . He punched her in the head and in the abdomen and then walked off . Unbeknownst to the applicant , the woman was DATE pregnant . The applicant had previous convictions for unprovoked assaults : in DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for an assault on his mother ; in DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for an assault in which he had struck a woman passer - by with a housebrick ; in DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for assaulting QUANTITY girls walking along a city street . He also had convictions for robbery , criminal damage and various driving offences . The maximum sentence which the court could have imposed under section QUANTITY of the Offences against LAW in respect of the current offence was a term of imprisonment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . While on remand in ORG the applicant was diagnosed as suffering from \u201c mental illness \u201d , manifested in delusions of conspiracy and victimisation and an obsession with astral projection . The precise diagnosis was of schizophrenia superimposed on a psychopathic personality . The applicant had a history of alcohol and drug abuse . He had never previously been diagnosed as mentally ill within the meaning of LAW DATE although , when on remand on a previous charge of actual bodily harm , he had been assessed for psychiatric treatment but had been found to be unsuitable .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s diagnosis ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was confirmed by CARDINAL psychiatrists . ORG accordingly imposed a hospital order on him under LAW of LAW . He was also made subject to a restriction order without limit in time under LAW of the same LAW , the court being satisfied that this order was necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was admitted to ORG , a maximum security psychiatric institution . Between the date of his admission and up to CARDINAL DATE he remained under the supervision of PERSON , the responsible medical officer ( \u201c RMO \u201d ) . PERSON acted as his ORG from CARDINAL DATE until DATE discharge .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant was admitted to ORG Dr PERSON recorded that he was suffering from schizophrenia superimposed on a psychopathic personality . Soon after his admission the applicant was administered antipsychotic drugs , and it would appear that he responded well to treatment to the extent that by CARDINAL DATE he had developed full insight into his mental illness . The applicant ceased taking medication in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s detention was reviewed on several occasions DATE by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) pursuant to the provisions of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . The first review was held in DATE . The ORG had before it the psychiatric report of PERSON , the applicant \u2019s PERSON at the time , as well as a similar report drawn up by Dr PERSON , a consultant psychiatrist , at the request of the applicant \u2019s solicitor .", "CARDINAL . While noting the applicant \u2019s great progress since the date of his admission to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , PERSON stated that he was still suffering from schizophrenia , superimposed on a psychopathic personality . He was also reported to be devious in his attitude to the staff at the hospital . PERSON concluded that the applicant continued to require treatment and was unfit to be discharged . PERSON expressed the opinion that the applicant showed ample signs of psychopathic disorder with superimposed mental illness and that the mental illness had the characteristics of a paranoid schizophrenic condition . He did not recommend any change in the applicant \u2019s current status .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG stated that it was satisfied that the applicant was suffering from mental illness or a form of that disorder of a nature or degree which made it appropriate for him to be liable to be detained and that it was necessary for his health or safety and for the protection of other persons that he should receive medical treatment in ORG .", "The applicant continued therefore to be detained after that date .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s case came up for review on CARDINAL DATE and again on DATE . On both occasions the ORG decided to make no direction for his discharge or reclassification of his illness , believing that it was necessary for his own health and safety as well as for the protection of other persons in the community at large that he continue to receive medical treatment for his condition in hospital .", "CARDINAL . A fourth review took place in DATE . The ORG had before it a psychiatric report drawn up on CARDINAL DATE by PERSON who had taken over from PERSON as the applicant \u2019s PERSON following her retirement ; an assessment of the applicant \u2019s condition prepared on DATE by ORG , a consultant psychiatrist , based on , inter alia , an interview with the applicant on DATE ; and a further assessment dated CARDINAL DATE drawn up by PERSON , who had interviewed the applicant on DATE .", "Dr PERSON and PERSON both concluded that the applicant was free of symptoms of mental illness . Dr PERSON \u2019s view was that the applicant was no longer detainable under LAW . While recommending a discharge , Dr PERSON noted that arrangements were being made by Dr PERSON ( see below ) to secure accommodation for the applicant in a hostel for persons suffering from drink - related problems . Dr PERSON for his part felt that the applicant still needed to undergo a period of rehabilitation and was not fit for discharge at that time . In his report PERSON PERSON concluded that the applicant was best described as \u201c a schizoid personality with a history of explosive anti - social behaviour induced by intoxication \u201d and that he could benefit from a stay in a hostel for people with drink - related problems following his discharge from ORG . Dr PERSON offered to facilitate the applicant \u2019s transfer to a hostel which he had in mind and to act as his psychiatric supervisor .", "CARDINAL . The ORG ruled on DATE as follows :", "\u201c The ORG accepts the medical evidence that the patient is not now suffering from mental illness . The episode of mental illness from which he formerly suffered has come to an end . He is not now in receipt of any psychotropic medication . \u201d", "However the ORG continued :", "\u201c The [ applicant ] had an unrealistic opinion of his ability to live on his own in the community after DATE in ORG and required rehabilitation under medical supervision and that such rehabilitation ( and its associated support ) can be provided only in a hostel environment . Further , the ORG is of the opinion that the recurrence of mental illness requiring recall to hospital can not be excluded until after successful rehabilitation of that nature . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On that basis , the ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s conditional discharge , the conditions being that the applicant be subject to the psychiatric supervision of ORG and to the social - worker supervision of a nominated psychiatric social worker , and reside in a supervised hostel approved by ORG and the nominated psychiatric social worker .", "The applicant \u2019s discharge was to be deferred until arrangements could be made for suitable accommodation .", "CARDINAL . Following the DATE review , considerable efforts were made to secure hostel accommodation for the applicant , but to no great avail . In the report of a senior social worker dated DATE , it was noted that no progress had been made on account of , inter alia , the limited number of hostel placements in the area catering for the applicant \u2019s specific needs . The applicant himself also seemed intent on portraying himself in a negative light when visiting hostels , with the result that he confirmed their initial anxieties about accepting him .", "CARDINAL . The nominated psychiatric social worker ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , Mr PERSON , contacted a number of hostels . In his report of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON PERSON described how his search for hostel accommodation for the applicant had been \u201c a time - consuming , lengthy and frustrating \u201d experience both for himself and the applicant . CARDINAL hostel visited had rejected the applicant almost immediately . Another rejected him without seeing him and the housing associations running hostels in conjunction with ORG also felt unable to offer him accommodation for some time on account of staff composition . It would appear that all potential hostels expressed concern about the applicant \u2019s drinking problem and his previous history of assaults on women which might present a threat to female residents and members of staff . Mr PERSON indicated that the applicant during this time had not always shown a realistic appreciation of the lifestyle needed to achieve a successful rehabilitation .", "However , CARDINAL hostel , PERSON , did express interest in accepting the applicant on condition that he agree to and successfully complete an DATE trial period in an open ward in a local hospital . Mr PERSON believed that PERSON was the only viable option , although the applicant remained rather ambivalent about exploring this possibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the ORG to have his detention reviewed , hoping for an absolute discharge . The ORG met in DATE and heard the applicant in person . It had before it Mr PERSON \u2019s report on attempts to find suitable accommodation for the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , as well as his views on the applicant \u2019s suitability for absolute discharge . Mr PERSON had concluded that he would be fearful of granting an absolute discharge since the applicant , if left to his own devices and without suitable support , could quickly find himself in trouble again . He was in favour of the applicant spending an DATE trial period in a local hospital , which would provide the basis for acceptance by the PERSON hostel .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also considered a report prepared by PERSON , dated CARDINAL DATE . PERSON confirmed in this report that the applicant was no longer mentally ill . He stated that the terms of the earlier conditional discharge were still being pursued but that it had not yet been possible to find suitable accommodation . He recommended that the applicant be discharged as soon as appropriate arrangements could be made .", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted in its ruling of CARDINAL DATE that the necessary arrangements for supervised accommodation had not been easy to make \u201c probably because the patient is himself not easy to please \u201d . The ORG accepted the reasoning of the DATE ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Although acknowledging that the applicant \u2019s clear preference was for an absolute discharge , the ORG considered that it was in the interests of the applicant and the public that \u201c he remain liable to hospital recall and to have the support that is assured by a discharge that is conditional \u201d .", "Accordingly , the ORG once again directed the applicant \u2019s conditional discharge but deferred the discharge until suitable arrangements had been made for supervised accommodation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant commenced trial leave at another hospital , PERSON , which was less secure than ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He was allowed increasing freedom in the form of time away from the hospital . On DATE , after drinking in a local pub , he returned to the hospital TIME and assaulted a patient whom he alleged had provoked him . Thereafter the placement began to break down completely . In a report dated DATE , PERSON , the supervising psychiatrist , noted that the applicant had terrorised the nursing staff and had began to reject the rehabilitation plans which had been foreseen for him . He was returned to ORG on CARDINAL DATE .", "Back in ORG , the applicant was given the choice to return to the pre - discharge unit there , where he could pursue other pre - discharge possibilities , or to go to another ward containing more long - term patients . The applicant chose the latter option .", "CARDINAL . A sixth review was carried out in DATE . The ORG considered a progress report drawn up by PERSON on DATE , the report prepared in DATE by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and a report of PERSON PERSON dated CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Dr ORG noted in his report the failure of the trial - leave period ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the difficulty in rekindling the applicant \u2019s motivation . Dr PERSON concluded :", "\u201c [ the applicant ] is not mentally ill and does not require to remain in ORG . Since DATE attempts to obtain his conditional discharge have been foiled by his inability to cooperate with the arrangements made and it is now difficult to envisage any conditions of his discharge that would be acceptable to [ the applicant ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON \u2019s report of CARDINAL DATE expressed pessimism about the applicant \u2019s future in the light of the failure of the trial - leave period . He indicated that the applicant suffered from an explosive disorder of personality which meant that \u201c when he is not in the middle of an explosion he is not in the formal sense mentally ill \u201d . Dr PERSON had no doubt that intoxication had played some part in the breakdown of the rehabilitation process and was convinced that the applicant \u2019s intoxicated explosions would likely recur whenever he was granted freedom into the community with access to intoxicants . Dr PERSON also considered that any further attempt at rehabilitation through general psychiatric routes would be inappropriate and for this reason was reluctant to continue as his psychiatric supervisor .", "CARDINAL . In his report PERSON PERSON noted that the applicant \u2019s failure to complete successfully the trial - leave period ruled out any prospect of his acceptance by the PERSON hostel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found that the applicant was not suffering from mental illness , psychopathic disorder , severe mental impairment or mental impairment or from any of those forms of disorder of a nature or degree which made it appropriate for him to be detained in hospital for medical treatment . However , the ORG was satisfied that it was appropriate for the applicant to remain liable to be recalled to hospital for further treatment . The reasons given were that the applicant did not accept sufficient responsibility for his own behaviour to be able to cope with the pressures of life in the community without a considerable degree of supervision and support . Hence the applicant was again ordered to be conditionally discharged , such discharge to be deferred until alternative supervised accommodation could be found .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s final review took place in DATE . He was assessed prior to this review by PERSON , who indicated that the applicant had no symptoms of mental illness and , provided that the topic of rehabilitation was avoided , he was constantly pleasant , friendly and cooperative . PERSON concluded :", "\u201c There is no basis for [ the applicant ] continuing to be classified as suffering from mental illness and with the benefit of hindsight it appears unlikely that he ever experienced more than a drug - induced psychosis ... He does not require to remain in ORG but it is difficult to envisage any conditions of his discharge that would be acceptable to him and his current application for an absolute discharge must now be considered on its merits . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s absolute discharge on the basis that the applicant", "\u201c is not now suffering from any form of mental disorder and that it is not appropriate for the patient to remain liable to be recalled to hospital for further treatment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In reaching this conclusion the ORG had regard to Dr ORG \u2019s oral evidence . It noted from his evidence that the applicant had not suffered from mental illness since DATE and was not suffering from any other form of mental disorder . Medication had been withdrawn in DATE . The applicant had shown consideration and kindness to other patients in his ward and he was \u201c often acting more like a member of staff than a patient \u201d .", "Furthermore , the ORG noted that PERSON considered that the index offence was not to be regarded as a result of mental illness but of a likely combination of drugs and alcohol . The applicant had suffered a psychotic episode whilst on remand which PERSON attributed to the stress of prison and the withdrawal of drugs and alcohol . According to PERSON there was no evidence that this illness was likely to recur and there was no medical basis to believe that the applicant would be dangerous if released .", "While having regard to the view of the Secretary of ORG that only a conditional discharge was appropriate at that stage , the ORG concluded that it was proper and in the interests of justice to grant the applicant an absolute discharge .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from ORG on DATE . Since then , he has not relapsed into mental illness . At the hearing the ORG was informed that the applicant had recently been given a conditional discharge following his conviction of a minor public - order offence arising out of an altercation with a neighbour . He was also facing a charge of cultivating cannabis .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) defines \u201c mental disorder \u201d as mental illness , arrested or incomplete development of mind , psychopathic disorder and any other disorder or disability of mind . A personality disorder would not , of itself , justify detention unless it came within the definition of psychopathic disorder , namely \u201c a persistent disorder or disability of mind ( whether or not including significant impairment of intelligence ) which results in abnormally aggressive behaviour or seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned \u201d .", "Under LAW CARDINAL ) of the LAW , dependence on alcohol or drugs is not to be construed as a form of mental disorder .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act empowers a court to order a person , on being convicted of a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment , to be admitted to and detained in a specified hospital ( \u201c a hospital order \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The court can only make a hospital order if it is satisfied on the written or oral evidence of CARDINAL registered medical practitioners that the offender is suffering from mental disorder ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and that", "\u201c the mental disorder is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment , and in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment , that such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration in his condition \u201d ( section DATE ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) ( i ) )", "and", "\u201c the court is of the opinion , having regard to all the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character and antecedents of the offender , and to the other available methods of dealing with him , that the most suitable method of disposing of the case is by means of a [ hospital order ] \u201d ( section DATE ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) ( ii ) ) .", "Under section DATE ( CARDINAL ) a hospital order must specify the form or forms of mental disorder from which the offender is suffering , as confirmed by the evidence of CARDINAL practitioners .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act empowers a court to make a restriction order ( with or without limit of time ) at the same time as it makes a hospital order . The restriction order gives the Secretary of ORG , inter alia , increased powers over the movement of a patient and may be made if it appears to the court having regard to the nature of the offence , the antecedents of the offender and the risk of his committing further offences if still at large , that it is necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm to make the order . A restriction order also confers a power to recall or conditionally discharge a patient at any time and restricts the powers of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to order release more narrowly than in the case of an ordinary mental patient .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , a person who is subject to a hospital order and restriction order ( \u201c a restricted patient \u201d ) , and who is detained in hospital , may apply to the ORG after CARDINAL months\u2019 detention for a review of his detention . After CARDINAL months\u2019 detention such applications may be made DATE . The Secretary of ORG may at any time refer the case of a restricted patient to the ORG ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .

Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , where the ORG is satisfied as to either of the matters referred to at ( a ) in paragraph CARDINAL above but not as to the matter referred at ( b ) in paragraph CARDINAL above , it is required to direct the conditional discharge of the patient . Lady Justice PERSON , giving judgment in the case of NORP v. ORG , ex parte K ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG , ORG ) , explained the nature of this power as follows :", "\u201c LAW gives to the tribunal the power to impose a conditional discharge and retain residual control over patients not then suffering from mental disorder or not to a degree requiring continued detention in hospital . This would appear to be a provision designed both for the support of the patient in the community and the protection of the public , and it is an important discretionary power vested in an independent tribunal , one not lightly to be set aside in the absence of clear ORG pp . CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . By virtue of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , a patient who has been conditionally discharged may be recalled by the Secretary of ORG and must comply with the conditions attached to his discharge . In contrast to absolute discharge , a conditionally discharged patient does not cease to be liable to be detained by virtue of the relevant hospital order .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , a tribunal can defer a direction for the conditional discharge of a restricted patient until such arrangements as appear to be necessary for the purpose of discharge have been made to their satisfaction . However , in the case of restricted patients , whose discharge has been accordingly deferred , the ORG does not have the power to direct the discharge if the specified conditions are not fulfilled or to adjourn its consideration of the case to await further developments or to recommend that the patient be granted leave of absence or to specify a time within which the conditions are to be complied with and to reconvene the proceedings failing such compliance with the time fixed . However , once the case comes back before the ORG on an application by the patient ( which at the earliest will be DATE ) or on a reference from the Secretary of ORG ( which may be at any time ) the ORG must consider the case afresh . In Secretary of ORG for ORG v. ORG and another ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG , ORG ) , Lord Bridge noted that there was no basis in the DATE Act or in the rules of ORG to defer a conditional discharge until a fixed date . He stated :", "\u201c ... it is impossible for a tribunal in making a deferred direction for conditional discharge to predict how long it will take to make the necessary arrangements . The decision should simply indicate that the direction is deferred until the necessary arrangements have been made to the satisfaction of the tribunal and specify what arrangements are required , which can normally be done , no doubt , simply by reference to the conditions to be imposed . Whoever is responsible for making the arrangements should then proceed with all reasonable expedition to do so and should bring the matter to the attention of the tribunal again as soon as practicable after it is thought that satisfactory arrangements have been made ... \u201d ( at p.
