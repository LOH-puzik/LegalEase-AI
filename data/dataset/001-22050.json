The overall sentence was DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 term of imprisonment .", "The offence of stirring up , as a public official , national , racial and religious hatred , disagreement and intolerance had been made out by the failure of the applicant , who had been an elected mayor , to inform ORG and the central Government that the decision to display the flags of GPE and GPE in front of FAC had been unconstitutional . He had implemented such an unlawful decision and had instructed all other public institutions to display the respective flags during the public holidays .

He had caused a feeling of insecurity and fear among the citizens of NORP origin . He had been aware in advance of the serious consequences which his speech might have and had actually provoked .", "There had been a connection between the meeting of DATE and the events of DATE as it was clear from the evidence that the set up of the central crisis headquarters , shelters for the injured , TIME shifts and different strategies how to defend the flag had been planned and undertaken by the applicant .", "Furthermore , the CARDINAL villagers who had been \u201c on duty \u201d to protect the flag on TIME gave evidence that a person who had identified himself as being a messenger of the applicant had asked CARDINAL of them , PERSON , to be on the TIME shift of CARDINAL DATE for the protection of the flag of GPE . For this purpose he had received a proxy with the stamp and signature of the applicant . The name of the second witness PERSON had also been put on the proxy .

Mr F. had been in a possession of a gun - \u201c PERSON \u201d , calibre CARDINAL with no licence .", "The court concluded that the applicant was determined to protect the flag of GPE despite ORG decision . As an elected mayor of a town with mixed population instead of promoting an inter - ethnic co - operation and tolerance he had called the citizens of NORP ethnic origin to resist a lawful police action and had organised armed resistance against the implementation of ORG decision .", "The applicant appealed to ORG . He argued that his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly guaranteed by ORG DATE had been violated . The main reason to organise the meeting of CARDINAL DATE had been to express his discontent with ORG interim order of CARDINAL DATE . The violent events of DATE had not been provoked by his speech and actions but by the police action . The \u201c civil night shifts \u201d had been organised to watch over and report if somebody or the police attempted to remove the flags .", "On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . The sentence for having stirred up , as a public official , national , racial and religious hatred , disagreement and intolerance was reduced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment ; the sentence for having organised resistance against a lawful decision or activity of a ORG institution was reduced to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment ; and the sentence for not having executed , as a public official , ORG decision was reduced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment on the ground that the applicant had no previous criminal record . The applicant \u2019s overall sentence was reduced to DATE imprisonment .", "The court held that the applicant was not punished because he had expressed his opinion or organised an assembly , but because he , as a public official , had stirred up national , racial and religious hatred , disagreement and intolerance by his speech of DATE addressed to the citizens of NORP origin by which he encouraged a group of citizens to criminal activities . As a result there were public riots and disorder on DATE and DATE . Furthermore , he , as a public official , had refused to execute ORG decision and had organised resistance against a lawful decision and activity of a ORG institution . In particular , he had planned and set up central and regional branches of the crisis headquarters and armed shifts for the protection of the flag of GPE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , holding that the lower courts\u2019 judgments were precise , consistent and reasoned .", "On DATE the applicant availed himself of his right to submit constitutional complaint concerning the alleged violation of his right to freedom of expression .", "On DATE ORG dismissed his complaint .

The circumstance that the criminal offences had been made out by way of action which at its surface appeared to be an enjoyment of the right of freedom of expression does not represent a ground to justify the applicant \u2019s guilt concerning the criminal offences committed , as it transpires from the facts of the case that his action had resulted in loss of the very content of the public expression as guaranteed and protected by LAW . The reason for that , as transpires from the facts of the case , is that the applicant with his publicly expressed opinion had not given his intellectual or political stance , nor had [ his action ] represented a way of intellectual or political persuasion of the persons attending the assembly , but had directly called the citizens of NORP ethnic origin to disobey or , evenmore , fight against public order , thus causing intolerance , friction and hatred among the citizens of ORG in the situation of already existing sensitive inter - ethnic tension , and the feeling of insecurity among the citizens of NORP ethnic origin , as well as , among the citizens of NORP ethnic origin , which all together had the event of DATE as its tragic epilogue ... \u201d", "On DATE the ORG adopted LAW following which the applicant was granted amnesty and dispensed from having to serve his prison sentence .
