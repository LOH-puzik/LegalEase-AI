They are currently in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and fifth applicants arrived in GPE and , DATE , they applied for asylum and residence permits . The second , third , fourth and sixth applicants arrived in GPE on DATE and applied for asylum and residence permits on DATE . ORG ( Migrationsverket ) held CARDINAL interviews with the first applicant and CARDINAL interviews with the fifth applicant . The applicants\u2019 legal representative was present at the third interview with the first applicant and at the second interview with the fifth applicant . The legal representative also submitted written submissions to the ORG concerning all of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . During the CARDINAL interviews held by ORG on DATE , DATE and DATE , the first applicant essentially told ORG the following . She was from NORP in GPE where she had lived with her husband , X , and their CARDINAL children . She and PERSON came from the same clan and he worked in industry . In her view , they had been poor . Her mother , CARDINAL brother and CARDINAL sisters lived in GPE and another brother lived in GPE . Her father was deceased . She had travelled with the fifth applicant to GPE , via GPE , using their passports and with NORP visas . She had thrown the passports away upon arrival in GPE for fear of being sent back . They had paid MONEY ( ORG ) for their tickets and MONEY for the visas . She had paid for this by selling gold that she owned . A friend of hers had helped to obtain the visas from ORG in GPE in DATE . Her brother had obtained their passports without PERSON \u2019s knowledge . The second , third , fourth and sixth applicants had travelled to GPE illegally with the help of smugglers .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant claimed that her biggest problem was X who had abused her for DATE . They had married when she was DATE and he had been very strict and had hit her , burnt her and threatened her with a knife . She had back problems caused by the violence and had received an injection at a hospital in GPE DATE before leaving the country to alleviate the back pain caused by a slipped disc . She had tried to obtain a divorce but the judge at the court had told her that she should solve her private problems with her husband . She had not contacted a lawyer as she had no money and she had not reported the violence to the police because they did not interfere in family matters .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the first applicant alleged that the main reason for leaving GPE had been to protect her daughters . The second applicant had been forced to marry an older man when she was DATE and forced to leave school because of it . X had also planned to marry off the fifth applicant to a much older man when she was DATE . The first applicant had petitioned the courts to stop the marriage but the courts had decided that PERSON , as the head of the family , was entitled to make that decision . She claimed that women had no freedom in GPE and that X would kill her if she were returned since she had dishonoured him by leaving the country with their daughter and without his permission . No one would be able to protect her and her daughter .", "CARDINAL . The fifth applicant supported her mother \u2019s claims , stating that X had wanted to marry her off to an older man against her will . The court case to stop the marriage had taken DATE and the outcome had favoured X for which reason she and the first applicant had left the country . Her uncle had helped them to obtain travel documents so they could leave the country legally . She also stated that PERSON had worked at a ministry and that he had been very strict with her and her mother .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant also supported her mother \u2019s claims and submitted that PERSON had married her off , at the age of DATE , to a much older man who had CARDINAL children and a disabled first wife . He had treated the second applicant like a servant but had agreed to divorce her if he was reimbursed the ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL that he had paid as a dowry for her to X. After her mother and sister had left the country , the second applicant alleged that X had made her other siblings leave the house but that they had been able to stay with a friend of hers until they could travel to GPE . She submitted that , if they were to return to GPE , they would all risk being killed since they had dishonoured X. She also risked being killed by her husband since she had left him without his permission .", "CARDINAL . In a later submission , the second applicant added that X would never allow her to return home even if she did obtain a divorce from her husband . Moreover , when PERSON had made her siblings leave their home , she had exceptionally been allowed by her husband to house them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applications . It first noted that the applicants had not submitted their passports or any other documents to prove their identity or to support their story . It then observed that GPE is a tribal society dominated by a patriarchal social order where women are subject to discriminating treatment and where they have to obey their husbands . Turning to the applicants\u2019 personal situation , the ORG first pointed out that the first applicant \u2019s brother had failed according to the \u201c honour rules \u201d by helping her to obtain a passport . Moreover , it considered that the mere fact that the first applicant had left the country , and by doing so allegedly dishonoured her husband , was not sufficient to create a need for protection in GPE . In this respect , the ORG observed that the first applicant \u2019s clan could protect her against X. Concerning the fifth applicant , ORG considered that ORG actions had been motivated by financial gain and that , by paying the necessary sum to X , the fifth applicant could solve any problems that might arise . Here , it noted that the applicants\u2019 contention that they were poor was contradicted by the fact that they had been able to afford to travel to GPE since the cost of the journey would have been a fortune to a poor person . Turning to the second applicant , ORG observed that her husband had consented to divorce her if she reimbursed him the sum he had originally paid X. Again , ORG considered that the problem was mainly a financial matter which could be solved by paying the required amount . In regard to the remaining applicants , the ORG found that they would be able to stay with their maternal grandparents or other relatives in the clan .", "CARDINAL . Thus , ORG concluded that the family \u2019s problems were related to financial matters rather than to honour and , consequently , they could not be considered refugees or otherwise in need of protection in GPE . Since the situation in GPE was not such as to call for an automatic grant of residence permits , the applicants\u2019 requests were rejected . In reaching this conclusion , ORG had regard to the fact that some of the applicants were minors .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the decision to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining their claims and adding that they had disgraced the head of their family as well as the clan by fleeing . Since they were members of the same clan as X and , since the clan always took the side of the man , it would not protect them . On the contrary , the clan , which was very large and powerful , had blacklisted them and they were convinced that the clan would kill them to save its honour . Moreover , the first applicant \u2019s brother had helped them in secret and had risked his own life by doing so . He would not be able to help them again . According to the applicants , there was no one in GPE who would be able to protect them . Furthermore , the applicants insisted that their need for protection was honour - related and not economic in nature . The second and fifth applicants did not have the money necessary to buy their freedom and , in any event , nothing would hinder X from marrying them off to someone else later on . The first applicant added that she had been a member of a women \u2019s association which had met on DATE and that she had told the women in the association about her problems and they had lent her some money to pay for travel . The remainder of the cost , she had paid by selling her jewellery . As concerned the other applicants , the second applicant had helped to pay for that trip .", "CARDINAL . In support of their claims , the applicants submitted an e - mail , dated DATE , and sent by a programme officer for \u201c Sisters of Arab Forum for Human Rights \u201d . It stated that , if the applicants were sent back to GPE , their lives would be in danger since the first and fifth applicants had disgraced their husband / father when they had run away instead of accepting his decision that the fifth applicant marry the man X had chosen for her . It further stated that honour crimes were common in GPE and that NORP law encouraged it ; for example , a man who killed his wife because of infidelity would only be sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . They also submitted a copy of a police report , dated DATE , from which it appeared that X had reported to ORG that the third and fourth applicants had stolen CARDINAL NORP rial ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) from him . He stated in the report that he had hidden the money in his wardrobe DATE previously and had discovered that it had gone DATE before . He had asked his wife about it but she had not known anything and thus he suspected that his CARDINAL sons had stolen the money since they had been out a lot lately . The sons had now run away from home and he wanted them arrested . It appeared from the report that a regional arrest warrant had been issued for the third and fourth applicants . The applicants claimed that this was a method for X to get the authorities\u2019 help to locate the family in order for him to have his revenge . They had received the report from the first applicant \u2019s brother , who had heard about it and requested a copy from ORG . He had received a copy since he was the PERSON uncle .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicants submitted the children \u2019s birth certificates in original which their uncle had also acquired and sent to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG appeal . The court first observed that the general situation for women in GPE was not a sufficient ground for them to be granted refugee status . An individual assessment had to be made in each case . It then observed that the reasons referred to by the applicants in support of their need for protection mainly concerned problems within the personal sphere caused , inter alia , by the country \u2019s traditions . The court further noted that , other than the first applicant \u2019s petition to a court to stop the fifth applicant \u2019s marriage , the applicants had not turned to the NORP authorities to obtain protection against NORP or the second applicant \u2019s husband . The court reiterated that , before international protection could be considered for problems of violence and reprisals within the family , all avenues of mediation and protection by the national authorities should have been tried . With regard to X \u2019s police report against the third and fourth applicants , the court considered that it would be no problem for them to prove that they were innocent since they were in GPE at the time of the alleged crime . Therefore , they did not risk being arrested or imprisoned . The court concluded that the applicants could not be considered refugees , that they were not in need of protection and that there were no exceptional circumstances to grant them leave to remain in GPE , even though some of them were still minors . In reaching this conclusion , the court also had regard to the fact that the family was united , that several of them were adults and that they had family and friends in GPE who supported them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , with CARDINAL of the judges being of a dissenting opinion , the majority of ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused leave to appeal . This decision was final and the deportation order thus became enforceable .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in DATE , the applicants lodged an application with ORG to stay the enforcement of the deportation order and to reconsider their case due to new circumstances . They maintained their previous claims and submitted a copy of a document in LANGUAGE that they claimed was a copy of a summons , dated DATE , and which had been issued by a NORP court . According to the applicants , it stated that the first applicant had taken her and LAW \u2019s CARDINAL children and had moved to GPE , following a dispute between her and X regarding whether or not the fifth applicant should be married to an older man . According to the document , PERSON requested the court to order the return of the applicants to GPE so that the children would be with their father and to imprison the first applicant because she had disobeyed her husband and to stop her from leaving GPE again . Moreover , PERSON requested the court to decide that the fifth applicant should marry the man that he had chosen . The applicants contended that this , together with the other information in the case , showed clear discrimination against women and that there could be no doubt that , should they be returned to GPE , they would be subjected to persecution because they had dishonoured the head of the family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the new application and decided that the measures to enforce the deportation order should continue . ORG found that the grounds invoked by the applicants had already been examined earlier in all essential parts and that no new circumstances had been presented which could lead to a stay of the enforcement of the deportation order . Furthermore , it considered that the applicants had invoked no other new circumstances which could lead to granting them residence permits in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the decision to ORG , insisting that the evidence showed that inhuman treatment awaited them if they were returned to GPE . However , on DATE , the court upheld the ORG \u2019s decision and reasoning in full and rejected the appeal .", "CARDINAL . Upon further appeal , ORG , on DATE , refused leave to appeal", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon request by the applicants , the ORG applied Rule CARDINAL of ORG until further notice . On DATE and on the basis of the ORG \u2019s request , ORG stayed the enforcement of the deportation order until further notice .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the Aliens Act \u201d ) , as amended on DATE . The following refers to LAW in force at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . LAW , of LAW stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , such a permit may be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies , under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of ORG issued an instruction concerning the enforcement of deportation orders to GPE . He noted that the already unstable situation in GPE had rapidly deteriorated due to protests against the regime and that there was increased violence from various groups , including by government forces . Having regard to the difficulties in evaluating the situation in the country and how it would develop , the Head of ORG considered that no deportation orders to GPE should be enforced until further notice .", "CARDINAL . A second instruction was issued on DATE by the Head of ORG in which he considered the developments in GPE since the issuance of the first instruction . He first noted that the security situation in GPE was affected by a number of internal conflicts , such as conflicts between clans , between the regime and various clan militias in the north and the south of the country as well as the regime fighting ORG in LOC ( AQAP ) . These conflicts had been accentuated by the growing protests and opposition against the regime by civil society , weakening the central government and its control over the country . During the autumn of DATE , in particular , there had been violent clashes in the bigger cities of GPE and PERSON . Following the agreement brokered by ORG and sanctioned by ORG , where President PERSON agreed to hand over power to Vice - President PERSON , the situation in GPE continued to be marked by political unrest , an unstable security situation and continued internal conflicts . However , the country - wide protests had diminished in intensity and no longer paralysed the big cities of GPE and PERSON . Thus , the general security situation in GPE and other big cities had improved . In view of this , the Head of ORG found that the situation in the country was generally very serious but that the violence was not so serious or indiscriminate as to give well - founded grounds to assume that civilians , through their mere presence in the parts of the provinces where the violence occurred , were at a real risk of being exposed to serious and personal threats to life or limb .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the Head of ORG noted that GPE was still marked by major political instability and occasionally armed fighting between various entities in essentially all parts of the country . The Government had little if any power in certain parts of the country and the judicial system could currently not be considered to be capable of impartially protecting the population \u2019s basic rights . In these circumstances , he considered that there were severe conflicts ( sv\u00e5ra mots\u00e4ttningar ) within the meaning of LAW in all of GPE . It was important to point out that the severe conflicts , and consequently the security situation , were more serious in some parts of the country than in others and that this had to be taken into account in each individual case . He further noted that vulnerable groups in GPE , such as women and children , should be given special attention when their need for protection was considered . Through this instruction , the first instruction was repealed and thereby the stay on deportation orders was also ended .", "CARDINAL . ORG Travel Advice for GPE , as updated on DATE , sets out the following about the political situation in GPE :", "\u201c Following the signing on DATE of ORG Initiative by President PERSON , political transition in GPE is now underway .

GPE faces tough political , humanitarian and economic challenges . Violent clashes continue across GPE , particularly in GPE and PERSON .
