The applicants are journalists . At the relevant time they were employed by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL national television stations in GPE , ORG , hereafter \u201c GPE \u201d . The first applicant produced a television programme , described as a documentary , called \u201c When the doctor knows best \u201d , which was broadcast at TIME on DATE , and seen by CARDINAL viewers . The second applicant was the first applicant \u2019s superior and responsible for the content of the programme .", "CARDINAL . The television programme concerned the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer , notably at ORG ) , where ORG was in charge of treatment . It focused on CARDINAL types of chemotherapy medication , GPE , produced by L , and PERSON , produced by ORG used PERSON as first - line treatment in combination with NORP or PERSON , depending on whether the treatment was related to an operation ( operable patients ) or to prolonging life and relieving pain and symptoms ( inoperable patients ) .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL experts participated in the programme : a medical doctor from ORG in GPE , a professor from GPE and a medical doctor from ORG in GPE . They all used GPE as first - line treatment , most often in combination with NORP or PERSON . The programme followed CARDINAL patients and their relatives , who told their stories , and a narrator spoke as a voice - over throughout the programme .", "CARDINAL . NORP In preparation for the programme , the first applicant had carried out research on the subject which included , inter alia , the following .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG had approved the marketing of GPE in combination with NORP for treatment of patients with inoperable pleural mesothelioma cancer . The background for the approval was , among others , research which had been carried out examining the effect of treatment with PERSON in combination with NORP as compared to treatment with NORP alone ( a phase III trial , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as first - line therapy .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Minister for ORG and ORG replied to various questions posed by Members of ORG as to the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer in GPE . The Minister replied , inter alia , that there was no proof that an GPE - based treatment was more efficient than other chemotherapy - based treatments , including that offered in GPE ; that the combination of PERSON and NORP , which was used at ORG , resulted in a DATE survival rate of PERCENT and a median DATE of DATE , which was exactly the survival rate from using the combination of GPE and NORP , but that there had been no direct comparison of the CARDINAL treatments ; and that there was no internationally accepted standard chemotherapy for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer , but that several single and combined treatments were used .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG produced a memorandum about pleural mesothelioma cancer and its treatment , which was sent to GPE . It stressed that international studies , including of PERSON and GPE , had not shown that any CARDINAL - combination regime was superior to other twocombination regimes . That information was confirmed by the professor from GPE in an email of DATE and by the medical doctor from ORG in GPE in an email of DATE . The memorandum also referred to a fund aimed at developing research on pleural mesothelioma cancer , in the amount of CARDINAL NORP kroner ( DKK ) , equal to MONEY ( ORG ) , received by ORG from company ORG , which produces Vinorelbine . The money had been used to pay nurses and students and for data collection . It emerged that there had been no financial profit for the doctors involved .", "CARDINAL . Having received the above - mentioned memorandum , the first applicant again contacted the professor from GPE and the medical doctor at ORG in GPE . In essence , they confirmed in subsequent emails of CARDINAL and DATE that since there had been no direct comparative clinical studies , there was no scientific evidence that CARDINAL twocombination regime was superior to another CARDINAL - combination regime .", "CARDINAL . Medical research studies involving human subjects are called clinical trials . They are divided into different stages , called phases . Generally , it can be said that the earliest phase trials may look at whether a drug is safe or at its side - effects . A later phase PERSON trial aims to find out whether the treatment works well enough , for which types of cancer the treatment works , more about side effects and how to manage them and more about the best dose to use . A later phase PERSON trial aims to test whether a new treatment is better than existing treatments ( standard treatment ) . These trials may compare a completely new treatment with the standard treatment or with different doses or ways of giving a standard treatment .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent to the broadcast on DATE of the television programme , on DATE ORG instituted defamation proceedings before ORG ( PERSON ) against the Director of GPE and the CARDINAL applicants , maintaining that the latter , in the programme in question , had made direct and indirect accusations , covered by LAW ( PERSON ) , against ORG , of malpractice regarding certain patients suffering from pleural mesothelioma cancer , allegedly resulting in the ORG unnecessary death and shortening of life , in the interest of ORG \u2019s professional prestige and private finances .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , the applicants , S , and Medical Director H for ORG gave evidence .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... that she had not criticised ORG for improper treatment causing death . Her message was only to point out that the substance of GPE had been better documented than the substance of PERSON . She had collected statements from patients and experts , but could not state herself whether PERSON was a better product than PERSON ... The experts had not stated whether PERSON in combination with another product was better than PERSON in combination with another product . However , all experts had emphasised that PERSON had been evaluated in a phase III trial , for which reason it was a more thoroughly tested product . ... her questions had been answered during her conversations with professor M on DATE and S on CARDINAL DATE . Subsequently no one had been willing to answer her questions . That was the only real conversation she had had with S. The next time she had called him , he had put down the receiver . When it had not been possible for her to get any response to her many points of criticism , she had contacted H ... she had wanted statements from both H and S as the programme would be unbalanced if they were not heard ... Some found that PERSON had been better documented than PERSON . She was not aware of any trial demonstrating that a combination with PERSON was better than a combination with another medicinal product ... \u201d .", "S stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c PERSON has been used for second - line therapy in GPE since DATE , and since DATE as first - line therapy . Patients had been given the impression in the media that GPE was a miracle cure . ORG had introduced it as an option . DATE , GPE is used in combination with PERSON as the standard therapy for inoperable patients ... Sometimes in DATE , the standard therapy for operable patients had been changed to NORP in combination with PERSON . If some patients were offered PERSON everybody had to be offered GPE ... After the programme had been broadcast ... patients started mistrusting the PERSON therapy . Afterwards it was not possible to perform the trial [ phase II ] on this drug . Nor would it be possible to obtain funding for the trial . Therefore no trial had been performed of PERSON ... he had provided the information included in professor M \u2019s memorandum of DATE ... he had talked to [ the first applicant ] several times and had spent a lot of time and energy on explaining cancer therapy ... he had also lost confidence in [ the first applicant ] ... \u201d", "H stated , among other things :", "\u201c ... The approval of GPE by ORG for the treatment of mesothelioma only means that a marketing authorisation has been granted for the drug , which means that advertisement of the product is permitted . PERSON has also been approved by ORG , but for a wide range of oncological therapies ... in DATE when PERSON was tested [ phase III ] the bar had been set quite low . The study compared PERSON with a clearly inferior treatment that would not actually be offered to anybody . It would have been more relevant to study PERSON in combination with NORP versus Vinorelbine with ORG S has made a phase II trial of the standard therapy [ Vinorelbine ] ... Subsequently the standard therapy regimen has been expanded to include GPE , which is not a better product than PERSON , but CARDINAL times more expensive ... if CARDINAL drugs are equally effective , but CARDINAL of them is CARDINAL times more expensive than the other , patients will be offered therapy using the cheaper drug . ... The standard therapies now offered by ORG are PERSON in combination with NORP for inoperable patients and PERSON in combination with NORP for operable patients ... the shift to GPE as the standard therapy at ORG did not reflect that PERSON was medically better . The [ applicants\u2019 ] programme had had a large impact as patients were asking not to be treated with PERSON . ORG had therefore had to change medical products because patients had the clear impression that PERSON was not as good as GPE ... It is quite usual for ORG to surrender material to the press and to answer questions , but the questions of [ the first applicant ] were never - ending . ORG has spent about a DATE , or MONEY , responding to inquiries from [ the first applicant ] , and huge efforts had been made to accommodate her requests ... the programme had created distrust towards both ORG and S and had created uncertainty in both patients and relatives . He had received CARDINAL \u201c hate mails \u201d himself ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG found against the applicants ( and the Director of GPE ) and sentenced them each to DATE - fines of CARDINAL NORP Kroner ( ORG ) . The allegations were declared null and void . The reasoning was as follows :", "\u201c ...", "Based on the evidence , ORG accepts as a fact that in DATE , following a phase III trial , ORG approved PERSON in combination with NORP for treating patients suffering from inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma and that subsequently the same was approved by ORG . The court also accept as a fact that PERSON is a drug dating back DATE whose effect had been documented by clinical experience and approved by ORG for a wide range of oncological therapies . Finally , the court also accepts as a fact that it has not been documented that PERSON therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product is more effective than PERSON therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product .", "As regards the term \u201c experimental drug \u201d the court accepts as a fact that a drug administered to patients in a trial is referred to as an experimental drug , no matter whether the same drug is the standard therapy offered outside the trial setting .", "No matter that [ the applicants ] are deemed to have been aware of the above circumstances following their comprehensive research of the matter , it was said in the programme that , for dying patients , [ S and ORG ] had prescribed a \u201c non - approved chemotherapy regimen \u201d not approved for the diagnosis or which was not \u201c the correct chemotherapy \u201d , and that [ S and ORG ] used an \u201c experimental drug \u201d , the \u201c worst - case scenario being that patients would die earlier than if they had been treated with an approved substance \u201d , or that it would have \u201c fatal consequences \u201d . Moreover , the phrase \u201c the only drug with a known effect \u201d was used .", "Since no account was given in the programme of the above - mentioned trials and approval process and the terminology applied for that process , the court finds that it would seem to a non - professional viewer that PERSON was the only effective drug for mesothelioma , particularly because the programme linked the treatment of CARDINAL patients with PERSON to their death , whereas the prospect of DATE to live was held out to the CARDINAL patient who had been given GPE therapy in GPE .", "Moreover , the programme also linked ORG \u2019s use of PERSON to his personal esteem and his \u201c personal research account \u201d , although [ the applicants ] had been made aware of the research grant management procedure though Professor M \u2019s memorandum of DATE before the broadcast .", "Since no account was given either of the procedure for managing research grants , the court also finds in this respect that it would seem to a non - professional viewer that S had a personal financial interest in starting PERSON treatment rather than PERSON .", "The [ applicants ] are therefore considered to have violated LAW .", "According to the information on [ the applicants\u2019 ] knowledge after their comprehensive research of the matter , the court finds no basis for exempting them from punishment or remitting the penalty under LAW , compare also LAW .", "...", "[ The applicants ] are furthermore jointly and severally liable for paying legal costs of DKK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On appeal , on DATE the judgment was upheld by the High Court of Eastern Denmark ( PERSON ) with the following reasoning :", "\u201c In the introduction to the programme \u2018 When the doctor knows best\u2019 a narrator states , among other things : \u2018 A NORP doctor is entering a medical congress to show his research results . For DATE he has gone his own way , he has treated dying patients with chemotherapy that is not approved.\u2019", "Later during the programme , it is stated at which hospitals one can receive treatment for pleural mesothelioma cancer , that these hospitals co - operate with ORG , and a reference is made to a named ORG , head of ORG for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer .", "During the various interviews , a narrator states , inter alia :", "- \u2018 The doctor does not give his patients the only approved medication . Instead , he uses a test medication . In the worst scenario , that may result in the patients dying earlier than if they had been given the approved substance.\u2019", "- \u2018 There is CARDINAL approved chemotherapy against pleural mesothelioma cancer , but that is not offered to ORG [ one of the patients followed in the programme ] . The doctors chose to treat her with a substance that is not approved for the diagnosis , and whose effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer is not substantiated.\u2019", "- \u2018 However , that chemotherapy turned out to have huge consequences for her [ SP].\u2019", "- \u2018S can freely choose the medication that he thinks is best . There is CARDINAL treatment which , in comparative studies , has proved to have an effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer . Accordingly , that is the only medication which is approved as treatment . That medication is called PERSON . However , ORG chose not to use that medication on his PERSON", "- \u2018 Thus , it has not been proved whether ORG works . According to the calculations made by GPE , CARDINAL patients in GPE have been given test medication . In the worst scenario , that may result in patients dying earlier than if they had been given the approved medication.\u2019", "-\u2019For her [ ORG ] the lack of effect of treatment by ORG turns out to have had fatal consequences.\u2019", "- \u2018 The family K ask themselves why S goes his own way . They suspect that he has other interests than those of the patients . That suspicion grows , when they talk to ORG \u2019s personal ORG", "- \u2018 It turns out , however , that ORG may also have had other reasons for choosing PERSON . Because he has used this medication in medical tests on the patients . In a phase when they are fighting for their lives.\u2019", "-\u2019The question remains : why does S carry out tests with ORG ? Could it have something to do with the prestige which is implicit in having research articles published?\u2019", "- \u2018 We do not know whether it is prestige that impels S.\u2019", "- \u2018 Thus , S will not acknowledge what leading experts agree on ; [ namely ] that GPE is the only medication whose effect is substantiated.\u2019", "- \u2018 Here it turns out that ORG has received more than DKK CARDINAL,CARDINAL over DATE from the company F. That is the company behind the test medication ORG . The money has been paid into LOC \u2019s personal research account . DKK CARDINAL is earmarked for the tests . S withheld that information.\u2019", "The programme ends by informing us , among other things , that CARDINAL of the patients who were interviewed have passed away . The narrator says , inter alia :", "\u2018 ORG , who was part of ORG \u2019s tests with PERSON , died on DATE", "With these statements , [ the applicants ] not only passed on assertions by patients , relatives and experts , but also took a stand , so that the programme undisputedly gave the viewers the impression that malpractice has occurred at ORG , in that S has deliberately used medication ( PERSON ) , which is not approved for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer , and whose effect has not been substantiated , that the medication in question was part of a test , and that the test medication has resulted in patients dying or having their lives shortened . The way that the programme is built up with its beginning and ending , the viewers get the clear impression that the reasons behind this choice of medication [ Vinorelbine ] were LOC \u2019s professional prestige and personal finances .", "Against this background , in the programme , the applicants , as producer of the programme and as chief sub - editor , have made an allegation against ORG of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant considerations to the detriment of the lives and health of patients . Such an accusation is likely to disparage [ ORG ] in the eyes of their fellow citizens as set out in LAW . It must have been clear to them [ the applicants ] that they were making such an allegation by way of their presentation of the programme .", "The applicants have not attempted to establish the truth of the allegation , but have submitted that the allegation shall be unpunishable by virtue of LAW as they acted in lawful protection of an obvious public interest or the interest of others or , in the alternative , that punishment should be remitted under LAW because they were justified in regarding the allegations as true .", "These provisions must , in connection with LAW , be understood in the light of LAW on the protection of freedom of expression . A very considerable public interest is related to journalistic discussion about risk to life and health , or suspicion thereof , as regards public hospital treatment . When balancing considerations of freedom of expression with considerations of the protection of the name and reputation of persons and companies , the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scale . That entails acknowledgement of a very far - reaching freedom of expression for the press , and accordingly the press must be permitted , as the public control- and information organ ( \u2018 public watchdog\u2019 ) , a certain amount of exaggeration and provocation in connection with their discussion of these questions , when factually there are reasons for expressing criticism .", "On the basis of the information in the case , including the research material that the applicants possessed before the broadcast of the programme , in particular the emails from [ the medical doctor from ORG in GPE and the professor from GPE ] , the replies by the Minister for ORG and Health to various questions [ posed by Members of ORG ] , and the memorandum of DATE produced by ORG [ about pleural mesothelioma cancer ] , it can be established that PERSON in combination with NORP or PERSON was standard treatment at ORG , that ORG on DATE approved the marketing of GPE in connection with NORP for treatment of inoperable patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer , that there was no substantiation or basis for believing that an GPE - based treatment was more efficient than the treatment offered by ORG , that some patients at ORG , who were already about to receive ORG as standard treatment , were chosen and offered the same medicine as part of a test [ it is not known for what ] , and that S did not make any private financial profit from these tests .", "Against this background , including the fact that the word \u2018 approved\u2019 was not explained during the programme , namely the difference between medication approved for treatment and [ medication ] approved for marketing , and by consistently using the word \u201c test medication \u201d , even though CARDINAL patient in the programme participated in tests , [ the applicants ] made allegations which were based on an incorrect factual basis , of which they must have been aware via the research material .", "The aim of the programme \u2013 to make a critical assessment of the treatment of patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer offered by ORG and the responsible consultant \u2013 is a legitimate part of the press \u2019s role as \u2018 public watchdog\u2019 , but it can not justify an allegation , which is built on a factually incorrect basis , and thus a wrong premise . [ The applicants ] , who did not limit themselves to referring to or disseminating statements by experts , patients and relatives , did not have any basis for making such serious allegations against ORG and S. The allegations can not be justified on the grounds that ORG and S refused to participate in the programme .", "Against this background , and since in relation to LAW there is no interest to protect when there is no factual basis for the accusations , the allegations are not unpunishable under LAW ) , nor is there any basis for remitting the punishment under LAW ) [ of LAW ] .", "It is an aggravating factor that the wrongful accusations were disseminated on national television during primetime and on GPE \u2019s homepage , by means of which the accusations had a significant spread .", "Accordingly , [ ORG ] agrees [ with ORG judgment ] that [ the applicants ] be fined under LAW , and that the allegations be declared null and void by virtue of LAW .", "ORG thus dismisses the appeal and upholds the judgment of ORG .", "The applicants shall be jointly and severally liable for paying legal costs of ORG appeal to ORG , in the amount of ORG CARDINAL , which constitutes the legal fee inclusive of LOC .
