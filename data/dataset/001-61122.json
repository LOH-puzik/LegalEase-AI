The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively . They are a married couple . They live in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as described mainly in the judgments of the national courts , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants bought at the price of ORG CARDINAL a property at FAC in GPE . On the land was a large wooden house built in DATE , which had previously served as a hotel and school . In DATE the municipal authorities wished to destroy the building , which by then had been unoccupied for DATE . The applicants ' initial plan was to renovate the building and then to sell it , but later they used the building as a hotel in DATE and rented it out to schoolchildren during DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The renovation costs were initially estimated at ORG CARDINAL , of which approximately ORG CARDINAL was to be financed by mortgages . At the time it was difficult to obtain loans , but in the end the applicants were able to borrow from LOC of ORG , ORG CARDINAL , secured on the applicants ' property in GPE gnr CARDINAL , bnr CARDINAL ) , and ORG CARDINAL , secured on their property ( gnr CARDINAL , bnr CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) in PERSON . ORG subsequently merged with ORG norske ORG and became ORG ) ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the Bank \u201d ) . Eventually the renovation , which was completed in DATE , became more extensive and expensive than expected , in part because of difficulties related to the installation of a fire prevention system . At an unspecified time in DATE or DATE , the applicants stopped paying the mortgages and the interest on them , resulting in an overdraft of ORG CARDINAL million . In addition , they apparently owed ORG CARDINAL to ORG ( Distriktenes Utbyggingsfond \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . As the ORG considered that the applicants had failed to honour their obligations , it sought to have the applicants ' property in GPE and PERSON sold at an auction in order to recover its loans . In DATE the ORG instituted proceedings for this purpose . On DATE the proceedings concerning the property in GPE were discontinued . In the meantime , on DATE the ORG had obtained a decision by ORG ( namsrett ) , the local district court , confirming an auction bid but that decision was later quashed by ORG ( lagmannsrett ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again brought proceedings to have the PERSON property sold at auction , and on DATE ORG granted the request .", "CARDINAL . In a complaint filed with ORG on DATE the applicants requested inter alia that Mr Justice PERSON should stand down on account of his past employment with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON confirmed that he had been , for a period from DATE to DATE , an employee of ORG assigned to the ORG 's legal department in GPE . He had not deemed it necessary to inform the parties about this as he did not consider that it had any importance for his eligibility to sit in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted a complaint to ORG , asking Mr Justice PERSON to stand down under LAW and CARDINAL of ORG Act DATE ( Domstolloven ) on the grounds that he had had close ties with the defendant ORG . On DATE the complaint was returned to the applicants with an explanation that , at the time , no execution proceedings were pending before the court . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON informed the applicants that he could not see that his past employment relationship with the ORG was a reason for him to withdraw from the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted a request by the applicants to have the auction proceedings suspended , pending a first instance decision in the proceedings mentioned under Section B below .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants brought an action against the ORG , claiming compensation for breach of contract . According to the applicants , the ORG had undertaken to discharge their mortgage debts secured on the properties at ORG which would have enabled them to earn money from their property during DATE . The ORG brought a counter - action . At the opening of the oral hearing in DATE , Mr Justice PERSON asked the parties whether there were any objections to ORG composition . No objection was made . On DATE ORG ( herredsrett ) , composed of Mr Justice PERSON and CARDINAL lay judges , unanimously found for the ORG , declaring that its mortgage securities were valid . ORG noted that the ORG had agreed on DATE to cancel the ORG CARDINAL mortgage security with respect to the property in GPE . It further observed that on DATE the ORG had requested the cancellation of the ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL security with respect to the properties at V\u00e5gs\u00f8y but had withdrawn its request on DATE . In connection with the said request , ORG referred to a letter of CARDINAL DATE from the ORG manager to the ORG . The letter read :", "\u201c The question of to what extent the ORG has an obligation to remove the lien [ on the PERSON property ] has been considered at several levels within the ORG , including our legal department . We have also obtained a statement from an external ORG who has been engaged by [ the applicants ] . No one has found any reason why the ORG should be required to follow the demands of the ORG . \u201d", "In its judgment ORG criticised the Bank for having expressed itself in the way it did , affirming that there was insufficient basis in the contacts between the ORG and the applicants ' lawyer at the time to draw such a conclusion . Despite this , ORG found on the evidence before it that the mortgage securities remained valid .", "Before ORG the applicants have submitted that the letter of CARDINAL DATE was kept secret from them \u201c for DATE until DATE \u201d ( see at p. CARDINAL of the ' Summary ' attached to their observations of DATE ) , and also that they \u201c did not discover the proof until they subpoenaed and received the documents during DATE \u201d ( observations of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "On appeal by the applicants , the judgment of ORG was unanimously upheld by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) refused the applicants leave to appeal . It does not appear that the applicants challenged the proceedings before ORG on account of Mr Justice PERSON 's participation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to resume the auction proceedings relating to the applicants ' property in GPE which , as mentioned under LAW above , had been suspended on DATE . This decision was upheld by ORG on DATE and , on DATE , ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the property in GPE was sold at an auction . The applicants made the highest bid , between ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL and CARDINAL , but since they were not able to offer security in time , the property went to the next highest bidder , the ORG , for approximately ORG CARDINAL , which was later confirmed on DATE as stated below . The auction was followed by CARDINAL sets of proceedings , CARDINAL concerning Mr Justice PERSON 's refusal to withdraw , the other concerning the ORG 's auction bid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in connection with proceedings relating to the confirmation of the ORG 's auction bid , Mr Justice PERSON of ORG decided to reject a further request made by the applicants that he withdraw from the proceedings . In his decision the judge stated that , from DATE , he had been an employee of ORG assigned to the ORG 's legal department in GPE . During this period he had not been involved with the applicants ' loan agreement and both the agreement and the persons concerned had been unknown to him . Nor had he had any dealings with the former director of the local branch in GPE who had pursued the case against the applicants . After ceasing to work with the ORG , the judge had maintained an ordinary customer relationship with it but had , beyond that , entertained no special links . On entering office as a judge in DATE he had , as a matter of caution , imposed on himself a rule not to deal with cases to which the ORG was a party for DATE . The applicants ' case was brought before ORG after the expiry of the DATE period . It had never been his opinion that his previous employment relationship with the ORG was a circumstance capable of calling into doubt his impartiality . Until the applicants ' complaint of CARDINAL DATE , he had thought that they were of the same view . He saw no grounds for arriving at a different conclusion as regards his ability to sit .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against this decision to ORG , which upheld it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants subsequently sought to appeal against ORG decision but , on DATE , ORG quashed the decision and gave a new decision to the effect that the appeal from the first instance court was to be dismissed by ORG . It observed that , following DATE decision mentioned below , the procedure and the merits of that decision ought to have been challenged in the same appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , sitting with a single assistant judge , confirmed the sale to ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG , which , after holding a hearing on DATE , upheld the decision by a judgment dated DATE . ORG further rejected the applicants ' contention that the first instance judge had been disqualified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG made a fresh application to ORG for the compulsory sale of the applicants ' property in PERSON . The applicants objected and again challenged the first instance judge 's eligibility to adjudicate their case and requested him to withdraw .", "By decision of DATE , the judge rejected their request and granted the ORG 's application . The judgment included the following reasons :", "\u201c The plaintiff has sent notice that a claim for enforcement will be made if the claim is not complied with . The said notice is in accordance with the requirements laid down in section CARDINAL of LAW ( tvangsfullbyrdelsesloven ) . The application has been lawfully served on the defendants .", "As explained above , the defendants have had objections to the application for forced sale . The court finds it appropriate to deal firstly with the objection concerning ability to sit .", "The said objection is linked to the circumstance that the undersigned judge has been employed by [ the ORG ] .", "The employment relationship that has been invoked concerns the fact that the undersigned was employed as a lawyer in ORG of [ the ORG ] , GPE , for a period from DATE . During this period I had nothing to do with the loan commitment to PERSON and PERSON . I had no knowledge of either the matter or the persons until the case was submitted to me in my capacity as judge . Nor did I , as an employee of the GPE office , have anything to do with the persons in the ORG who processed the loan commitment to ORG . Since my resignation I have maintained my relationship as a client of [ the ORG ] , ... but have otherwise had no special connection with the ORG or its employees .", "Several disputes between the parties deriving from the loan commitment have been brought before the courts . The underlying dispute was heard by the undersigned judge on DATE , and a final and enforceable decision for the ORG was taken by ORG in its judgment of DATE .", "The PERSON omitted to call the undersigned 's impartiality into question during the district court 's hearing of the main case , even though they had been explicitly informed of the employment relationship as early as during the preparatory proceedings in DATE . However , their objection was put forward in a written plea dated DATE by their counsel , PERSON , during the hearing of other enforcement proceedings between the same parties , cf . case no . DATE C. On that occasion , the objection was not upheld by the district court , and after a further interlocutory appeal , ORG of ORG decided on DATE that the question of disqualification could not be the subject of an interlocutory appeal because it could serve as a ground of appeal in the event of an appeal proper against the affirmation order .", "Since , on the previous occasion , the defendants raised the point that the undersigned withdrew from other cases involving [ the ORG ] , I wish to mention briefly that on entering office as a judge in DATE I chose to impose a precautionary rule upon myself . This consisted in my refraining , for DATE , from hearing cases in which [ the ORG ] was a party . I chose to take DATE on which the case came to court as the starting point for the DATE period , and the application of this rule led to my finding it appropriate to withdraw from a few cases . The case between PERSON and PERSON and the ORG came to court after the expiry of the self - imposed DATE limit .", "On the basis of the above , I the undersigned would conclude that my former employment relationship with [ the ORG ] can not be regarded as a special circumstance which might serve to weaken confidence in my impartiality . Until their counsel 's , PERSON PERSON 's , written plea of CARDINAL DATE in case no . CARDINAL - CARDINALC , it was my understanding that M\u00f8yfrid and PERSON also took the same view .", "Accordingly , the request that the undersigned judge disqualify himself from the case is rejected .", "As regards the objection concerning the ground for enforcement , the court refers to the judgment of DATE of ORG . Point CARDINAL of the conclusion of the judgment on the counter - claim reads as follows :", "' CARDINAL . NORP The mortgage bond from M\u00f8yfrid and PERSON , in the amount of ORG MONEY , judicially registered on DATE and secured on the property gnr . CARDINAL , bnr . CARDINAL and CARDINAL in PERSON , is binding on PERSON and PERSON and may be used as a ground for enforcing recovery of the debt they owe to ORG . '", "The judgment is now a final and enforceable decision since ORG has upheld it and ORG of ORG has refused leave to appeal on DATE ....", "Accordingly , the court finds that the objections raised by M\u00f8yfrid and PERSON concerning the ground for enforcement have been the subject of a final and enforceable decision and that the ground for enforcement may thus serve as the basis of the application for forced sale . As regards the objections indicated by the defendants regarding the ground for enforcement independently of the outcome in ORG , the said objections have not been specified and consequently the court has no cause to deal with them .", "The court finds that the conditions for forced sale are fulfilled and grants the application . ...", "C o n c l u s i o n :", "CARDINAL . The request that ORG Judge PERSON disqualify himself ... is rejected .", "CARDINAL . The application for forced sale of [ the property ] ... in the PERSON municipality is granted .", "CARDINAL . Enforced payment is to be effected by a forced sale with the help of an assistant , cf . section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision regarding forced sale is to be judicially registered in respect of the property ... in the PERSON municipality . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against this decision to ORG , stating inter alia :", "\u201c The appeal is firstly limited to point CARDINAL of the conclusion- the issue of the disqualification of the judge of ORG ( ORG judge ) . However , were the appellants to succeed on this point , this will necessarily result in DATE items in the conclusion also being quashed , since the case will thus have been dealt with by a disqualified judge .", "The appeal is grounded on a misapplication of law .", "Since it is DATE period and the office is almost completely closed , and because the undersigned counsel will be absent from the office in DATE for work - related reasons , the appeal submitted within the time - limit of DATE will have to be brief . A supplementary written plea will be prepared , and I take the liberty of requesting that the time - limit for submitting such a plea be set for the end of the court vacation , DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings ORG received from the applicants ' lawyer extensive observations dated DATE and DATE , and from the ORG 's lawyer observations dated DATE . The latter led the applicants ' lawyer to submit further comments on DATE , developing further arguments on the issue of disqualification , including on ORG judge 's awareness of the applicants ' objection to his participation . It further contained the following observations :", "\u201c The legal system does not differentiate between more and less ' serious ' cases . Neither on the basis of the amount or the type of case can one say that a judge who is on the ' borderline ' as regards qualification should be ' passable ' in certain minor cases , but not in major ones .", "In this litigation , too , there are various serious questions that may be brought up for consideration . And in any circumstance it is the judge of ORG who ultimately determines whether a given offer is to be confirmed or not .", "As regards the property in PERSON , it remains to be resolved whether the mortgage bond concerned is of a subsidiary nature , i.e. whether it is ' only ' security for any uncovered debts from the hotel operations in GPE . In that event , it is necessary to ascertain how much [ the ORG ] will recover in DATE in CARDINAL way or DATE before ascertaining whether there is any residual amount to be covered by selling the property in GPE .", "And before that stage is reached , various preliminary assessments and decisions may have to be made in which the judge 's qualification is not a question of secondary importance .", "In the second paragraph on page CARDINAL of the reply [ of DATE ] , it is stated that ' the appellants have a debt to [ the ORG ] of over ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ' \u2013 in other words , MONEY ! !", "I admit that I am new to this litigation and may not have a full overview of absolutely every detail . But amounts of this nature almost knock me flat since they in no way whatsoever resemble the amounts that I have so far been able to note in this litigation .", "That is why the adversary party is now being pressed upon to give an account of and to substantiate the manner in which it has computed this claim . Then there is the question whether the adversary party contends that this entire amount has been secured by the mortgage bond , or merely parts of it .", "The significance of this question is enormous . When , at some point in the future , ORG in all likelihood sets aside the confirmation of the give - away price for the hotel in GPE ( pursuant to LAW ) , it will be relevant to realise assets in a business - like manner in order to settle accounts with [ the ORG ] .", "Whether or not a general settlement is possible will naturally depend on such questions as", "a. what is the debt to the [ ORG ] in PERSON that is secured by a mortgage bond ?", "b. what is the amount of the total claim against the PERSON family ?", "c. can a forced sale be effected at all in the PERSON municipality until a further financial settlement has been reached in PERSON ? ; cf . evidence : CARDINAL . Letter of DATE from [ the ORG ] to the Walstons , affirming that the bond in the present case is merely in the nature of ' formal collateral ' ; regardless of how many subsequent judgments have been pronounced to the effect that the PERSON are not entitled to have the said bond discharged under the prevailing circumstances .", "In considering these questions \u2013 and several others that may arise during the further hearing of the case \u2013 it is naturally not of secondary importance who the judge is . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG 's lawyer filed additional observations , which were not communicated to either the applicants or their lawyer , until they were notified of ORG decision of DATE mentioned below . The CARDINAL DATE document read :", "\u201c I refer to the written plea of DATE from the appellants . The plea gives rise to a need for some clarification , but most of the content has been commented on previously .", "On page CARDINAL the appellants contend that the major grounds given for the decisions in this and another case contain direct errors that have allegedly been revealed . It is not correct , however , that Mr Justice PERSON has given any inaccurate information in this case .", "The ORG Judge has been aware of the objections that have been raised since DATE , but he was not aware that specific objections relating to disqualification had been raised in those cases where it is so contended . Here I refer to page CARDINAL , penultimate paragraph , of the plea , from which it appears that their counsel , Mr PERSON , did not raise during the main hearing any objections relating to disqualification , despite the fact that the PERSON allegedly instructed him to do so .", "It is completely incomprehensible to me that the Walstons now claim that their counsel , PERSON , acted contrary to his instructions in ORG when they themselves were present when it happened and did not protest in any way .", "As regards consideration of the disqualification issue in ORG , I abide by what I have said previously about the matter . ORG was not requested , either in the written plea or in court , to deal with the disqualification issue , as it was contended both by PERSON , counsel , in the written plea and by M\u00f8yfrid PERSON that , since there would be a completely new trial in ORG , it was not necessary to get a ruling on the merits of this issue . Thus there was no adjudication of any claim that ORG had made a procedural error due to disqualification and that ORG judgment should therefore be quashed and the case referred back to it for fresh examination . It is however correct that M\u00f8yfrid PERSON stated that she was still of the view that the judge was disqualified .", "As regards the question whether or not the mortgage bond is of a secondary nature , I refer to the security agreement according to which all the mortgaged properties are to secure any and all indebtedness between the parties . The amount of the debt was dealt with in the main case . In this context it is not necessary to document whether or not it exceeds ORG CARDINAL ( the figure was the result of an oversight ) as it is sufficient to point out that after depreciation and the grant from ORG , the outstanding debt was ORG CARDINAL , and that after depreciation no interest or instalment payments have been made with the exception of an insignificant instalment . Given that the bid established for the property in GPE is for ORG CARDINAL CARDINAL CARDINAL , it goes without saying that the question whether the bond is of a secondary nature or not is of no importance .", "Evidence : CARDINAL . Ruling by ORG of DATE in case no .

Thus it is obvious that the question whether or not the mortgage bond is secondary is of no importance in this case . However , the fact is , as noted above in the security agreement , that all the properties are to secure any and all indebtedness between the parties , so it is permissible to realise any or all of the mortgaged property , cf . section CARDINAL - CARDINAL , first paragraph , of the Mortgages and LAW ( panteloven ) .", "If it is probable that the amount realised by selling the properties would exceed the amount necessary to cover the mortgagee 's claim , a specific calculation must be made and a proper sequence for such realisation must be drawn up , as provided in section CARDINAL of LAW . LAW of the former ORG made some provision for a similar procedure .", "At any rate it is only in cases where there is a danger of excessive coverage that it is necessary to draw up any sequence in connection with realisation . There is no such danger in the present case .", "Written plea in DATE copies . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ' lawyer ceased to represent them . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , referring to the PERSON case , the applicants informed ORG of this fact and requested it to provide them with \u201c a copy of all documents in the interlocutory appeal case directly to [ them ] \u201d . In another letter of DATE they requested \u201c all the documents concerning \u201d the PERSON case .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , they renewed their request for the production of documents in both cases , invoking the approaching time - limit for making supplementary submissions in the PERSON case . They added that their former lawyer had refused to provide them with the documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision of DATE . It had particular regard to the fact that , while employed by the ORG , Mr Justice PERSON had not been involved with the loan agreement concerned , and that a considerable time had elapsed between the date of his leaving the Bank ( DATE ) and the date when the ORG requested the compulsory sale of the applicants ' property ( DATE ) . Moreover , the ORG was a large company with branches all over the country , whose employees DATE might expect \u2013 would have a less personal relationship to their employer than would normally be the case with smaller companies . While Mr PERSON was assigned to the GPE branch , the loan agreement had been arranged at the local branch in GPE . Furthermore , the applicants had not disputed his ability to sit in DATE when he dealt with the dispute regarding the underlying circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE after its above - mentioned decision , ORG transmitted to the applicants a copy of the case - file . On DATE they complained to ORG about the procedural error , stating the following :", "\u201c We refer to the letter dated DATE in which we were finally sent the documents in the interlocutory appeal case . This in fact occurred DATE after the ruling on the interlocutory appeal was given .", "This is a serious procedural error on the part of ORG for which we hold the judges responsible .", "The reason why we asked to be sent the documents in the case was because Mr. PERSON is no longer our lawyer .", "We did not have an overview of the documents that had been submitted to the court and , in order not to suffer legal prejudice , it was imperative for us to obtain the documents from the court .

As their lawyer at that time had ceased to represent them , it had not been sent to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG , requesting that ORG decision be quashed and that the case be referred back to it for a fresh examination . On this occasion the applicants requested to be given until DATE to supplement their appeal , which they did on that date , setting out their arguments , notably on alleged procedural errors on account of Mr Justice PERSON 's participation and ORG omission to communicate case - documents , and attaching an analysis of procedural errors allegedly committed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants complained that , in the proceedings before ORG , the latter had given a decision on DATE without having communicated the case - documents to them , as requested on DATE and again on DATE . The applicants were then not aware of the observations of DATE submitted by the ORG 's lawyer , on which they had comments of importance for the outcome of the case . The observations had contained an admission to the effect that ORG judge had since DATE been aware of the applicants ' objections to his dealing with their case . Moreover , whilst the ORG 's observations of DATE had stated that the applicants ' debts had exceeded ORG CARDINAL , those of DATE had indicated that they amounted to barely ORG MONEY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted additional observations commenting on a writ filed by the ORG on DATE and expressing their wish that the issue of the judge 's ability to sit be given careful examination . Moreover , they informed ORG that because of the shortage of time they had not been able to finalise the attachments to their analysis of DATE , and that these would be sent by ordinary mail on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicants ' appeal .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicants ' complaint about ORG omission to communicate the observations of DATE , the ORG reiterated that the ORG had in a previous case a legally enforceable judgment according to which the mortgage securities invoked were binding on the applicants and could be used as a ground for compulsory sale of the properties for recovery of debts that they had vis - \u00e0 - vis the ORG . Moreover , the appeal before ORG had been limited to the question of the first instance judge 's impartiality . Thus , the ORG found , the observations of DATE contained no information of any importance for the decision to be taken by ORG . It concluded that ORG omission to communicate the observations did not constitute an error of procedure for the purposes of LAW , second paragraph of LAW ( tvistem\u00e5lsloven ) . Nevertheless , the ORG added , a party 's pleadings should as a rule be communicated to the other party or the latter 's representative .", "CARDINAL .
