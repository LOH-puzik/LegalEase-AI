On DATE the ORG gave its judgment . It convicted the applicant of aggravated fraud . It dismissed as time - barred the charges concerning CARDINAL counts of dishonesty as a debtor . The court found that the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement laid down in the LAW and the LAW had not been respected and that the applicant was therefore entitled to redress . The court noted that it had dismissed as time - barred some of the charges . As the court was not allowed to pass any judgment on the time - barred charges , the redress for the length of the proceedings had to be given in some other way .

The court considered that the redress had to be significant and , having regard to the exceptionally lengthy nature of the proceedings , it should also be substantial . The court stated that it was taking CARDINAL third off the applicant \u2019s sentence owing to the breach of the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement . Taking an earlier sentence into account , it sentenced the applicant to DATE and CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL .
