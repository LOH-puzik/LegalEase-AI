The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant received a telephone call from PERSON , who inquired whether he had any cannabis in his possession . The applicant replied in the negative but added that in DATE , after having made some inquiries , he might know better .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE NORP and GPE entered GPE in a car in which a quantity of drugs had been hidden . They drove through customs in GPE , south - west GPE , and left for GPE . At CARDINAL a.m. M. called the applicant and requested him to go and get the drugs because he was unable to do so himself . The applicant accepted .", "CARDINAL . At TIME and TIME called the applicant again . In DATE asked the applicant whether he now had any cannabis . The applicant answered that he could provide it DATE . In the second call it was agreed that ORG would call the applicant again in order to arrange a meeting TIME . At TIME called the applicant and they agreed to meet in front of a restaurant TIME after the call .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the applicant did not know that PERSON had been in detention on remand from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The parties disagree as to the time of the initial call and as to when the order for narcotics was made . According to the applicant , the first call from H. could have taken place either on DATE CARDINAL DATE . That call was the start of the applicant 's involvement in the relevant events and the order was placed on DATE . According to the ORG , the order was placed at TIME on DATE , but the applicant had become involved earlier , during the importation of the drugs into GPE . They did not specify the exact nature or the time of his involvement .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant was arrested in front of the restaurant while in possession of QUANTITY of cannabis . In a later search of his apartment , a further QUANTITY of cannabis were found .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by the police , the applicant stated that he had DATE met CARDINAL women at a petrol station , in accordance with the instructions of PERSON , a drug dealer . The women had given him the car . He and PERSON together had unloaded QUANTITY of cannabis . The applicant had received QUANTITY and had gone to the restaurant , where he had been arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) authorised the police to obtain telephone metering information concerning the applicant 's telephone . On DATE the court ordered his detention pending trial .", "CARDINAL . During the criminal investigation the applicant told the police about his earlier drug deals , namely the sale of cannabis purchased from LOC in DATE , CARDINAL incidents of exporting cash to the GPE in DATE , the purchase of CARDINAL mobile telephone connections to be used by PERSON , the introduction of a third party to PERSON to purchase another mobile telephone connection and for the export of cash to the GPE , and giving PERSON a key to his apartment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with the following offences :", "\u201c I ) aiding and abetting on CARDINAL occasions the importing of narcotic substances in DATE and DATE [ delivering cash to GPE on the order of PERSON ] ;", "II ) promoting the importation of narcotic substances on CARDINAL occasions in DATE and DATE [ acquiring mobile phone connections for M. ] ;", "III ) an aggravated narcotics offence on DATE [ possession and handling of QUANTITY of cannabis together with PERSON and taking QUANTITY for himself ] ;", "IV ) CARDINAL narcotics offences in DATE [ sale of CARDINAL and QUANTITY grams of cannabis on the order of M. ] ; and", "V ) an aggravated narcotics offence in DATE [ sale of QUANTITY of cannabis purchased from M. ] . \u201d", "He admitted all the events on which the charges were based .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the applicant gave evidence against CARDINAL of his co - defendants . The applicant 's counsel clarified that on DATE his client had taken delivery of the car in order to obtain QUANTITY of cannabis without knowing how much cannabis the car contained . The case was adjourned and the applicant was ordered to remain in custody as the police investigation concerning some of the events had not yet come to an end .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the prosecution presented alternative charges against the applicant in so far as he had been charged on count II with promoting the importation of narcotic substances . He was now charged in the alternative with aiding and abetting a narcotics offence on CARDINAL occasions . The prosecution also made a change to count V to the following effect . As he had earlier been accused of possessing and selling QUANTITY of cannabis in DATE , the altered charge concerned QUANTITY of cannabis of which he had allegedly sold QUANTITY to CARDINAL different persons during the period from DATE until DATE . Also CARDINAL new charges were added , namely :", "\u201c VI ) NORP aiding and abetting narcotics offences in DATE [ giving PERSON keys to his apartment knowing that it was going to be used for the sale of narcotics ] ; and", "VII ) aiding and abetting an aggravated narcotics offence in DATE [ introducing a person to PERSON in order to have him deliver cash to GPE ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the applicant 's counsel pointed out as newly acquired information that PERSON had been in police custody when he had placed the order and he had been released as a reward for his favours to the police . Therefore , counsel argued that no offence had been committed under count III as the events had taken place under police control . The police had set a trap by having the agent provocateur order cannabis from the applicant , who would not have committed the offence had he not been explicitly asked to do so . Counsel had requested the police to produce the telephone metering information about calls made from and to the applicant 's mobile telephone , but this had not yet been disclosed .", "The applicant gave oral evidence that ORG had ordered a kilogram of cannabis on DATE or DATE , whereupon the applicant had contacted PERSON , who DATE had confirmed that there would be a shipment DATE . When PERSON called again on DATE , the applicant had told him that the deal might go through on DATE or DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police applied to ORG for permission not to disclose to the applicant that his mobile telephone had been under surveillance . DATE the court granted permission , relying on LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( pakkokeinolaki , tv\u00e5ngsmedelslagen ) . DATE the police informed the applicant of the decision , declining to divulge the requested information . DATE the applicant requested the police to issue a formal decision which could be appealed . On DATE the police issued a decision in which it was maintained , inter alia , that the information was not to be disclosed even to a party to criminal proceedings . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to order the police officer in charge of the investigations , PERSON , to produce the telephone metering information at the next hearing . The applicant had received several telephone calls from PERSON during the period DATE and the observance of the equality of arms principle required the production of the telephone records .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held its final hearing . As the criminal investigations had been continuing throughout , at this stage CARDINAL people had already been accused of various narcotics offences .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant 's counsel submitted that on DATE he had tried to summon PERSON to appear before the court , without success . He renewed his request to the court to summon PERSON and to order the disclosure of the telephone metering information .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor submitted that the allegation about the calls made by ORG while in police custody appeared to be true . He produced a fax from PERSON ( a memorandum dated DATE ) in which it was maintained that , given the date of ORG 's arrest , it was impossible that the police could have incited the applicant and PERSON to smuggle narcotics , as plans to import the drugs had already been in place . There was no mention in the memorandum as to when PERSON had called the applicant . The prosecution also produced another fax from PERSON dated DATE in which he reiterated that the detailed telephone metering information was classified . He nevertheless maintained that there had been CARDINAL call on DATE and CARDINAL calls on DATE from the police to the applicant . No further details were provided .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the former of the above faxes gave the court sufficient information to rule on the matter of incitement . It showed that the only reason for his actions under count III was the telephone call from ORG The public prosecutor accepted that he did not rule out this possibility and submitted that the calls could be taken into account so as to reduce the applicant 's sentence , but not to absolve him of all criminal liability . The applicant 's counsel pointed out that the prosecution did not dispute the agent provocateur claim . He withdrew his request to examine PERSON , who was in any event likely to rely on his right not to testify . He also withdrew the request to the court to order the disclosure of the telephone metering information .", "CARDINAL . It can not be concluded from the records of the hearings that any of the co - defendants testified as regards the charges brought against the applicant . According to the ORG , both NORP and PERSON were heard at the hearings on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted on all counts and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . On count III he was convicted on the basis that on DATE he had been in possession of QUANTITY of cannabis , having taken delivery of a car in which NORP and PERSON had illegally imported the drugs , and having later removed them from the car and weighed them together with PERSON The judgment did not mention any police involvement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against PERSON and Senior Constable GPE , alleging , inter alia , incitement to commit an offence ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninhallitus , l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) , arguing that ORG decision of DATE not to disclose to him that his telephone had been under surveillance did not mean that the information gathered should not now be accessible to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , requesting an oral hearing on count III . He also requested , relying on PERSON v. the GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , that the police officer in charge of the criminal investigation , PERSON , be ordered under LAW , Article CARDINAL , of the Code of Judicial Procedure ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) to produce the telephone metering information . As to the request for an oral hearing , he stated that , following ORG judgment , he had received more exact information about the persons involved in the agent provocateur operation . ORG ( keskusrikospoliisi , centralkriminalpolisen ) had proceeded with the investigation into the suspected offences . The public prosecutor did not submit any written reply to the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a pre - trial investigation report of DATE which concluded that GPE and GPE were suspected of abuse of public office , breach of official duty and incitement to commit an aggravated narcotics offence . He also produced a subsequent indictment by ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninsyytt\u00e4j\u00e4 , l\u00e4ns\u00e5klagaren ) . Lastly , he renewed his request for disclosure of the telephone metering information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , finding that the applicant in his capacity as a party to the proceedings against him should have access to the telephone metering information , annulled the police decision regarding the non - disclosure and ordered the information to be given to the applicant 's counsel . On DATE the applicant renewed his request to ORG for disclosure of the information . At that time , he had apparently still not received the requested information as the decision had not become final .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG delivered its judgment , upholding the applicant 's conviction . It rejected the requests for a hearing and disclosure of the telephone metering information as ill - founded . It stated that it had admitted to the file the applicant 's written submission of DATE with annexes , despite the fact that it had arrived after the time - limit for the appeal had expired . The court confirmed the substance of ORG judgment but amended some of the reasoning . It found it established that there had been CARDINAL telephone call to the applicant on DATE and CARDINAL calls on DATE from a mobile telephone owned by the police . Relying on the pre - trial statements of CARDINAL of the applicant 's co - defendants , NORP and PERSON , the court found that \u201c there [ had been ] an arrangement that the applicant receive the cannabis prior to the order made by NORP \u201d and thus found him guilty as charged . It did not specify whether it was making reference to the call of DATE or to one of the CARDINAL calls of DATE . Nor did it specify the date of the applicant 's initial involvement with the narcotics . The case file does not disclose that NORP and PERSON 's statements touched upon the chronology of the events as regards the applicant 's involvement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought leave to appeal from ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , requesting an oral hearing . He emphasised that charges had been brought against the police officers . Further , ORG had based his conviction in part on NORP and PERSON 's pre - trial statements , although neither the prosecution nor ORG had relied on them . Had the applicant known that those statements , which he had not seen , would be used as evidence against him , he would have cross - examined NORP and PERSON in ORG . ORG had not held an oral hearing and had assumed the functions of the prosecution , thereby violating the applicant 's right to examine the witnesses against him . ORG had also breached LAW , LAW , of LAW as it had not identified the special reasons justifying an examination beyond the arguments and facts adduced in the writ of appeal . ORG had reached its conclusion regarding the timing of PERSON 's call on the basis of the pre - trial investigation report in the proceedings against GPE and GPE , and thus on material relating to another case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted the judgment of ORG in which GPE and GPE had been convicted and fined . The incitement charge had however been dismissed ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a written submission , maintaining that the only differences between his case and that of Teixeira GPE v. GPE ( no . ORG report of CARDINAL DATE , Decisions and Reports ) were that he had been deprived of information about the agent provocateur operation and of an opportunity to examine GPE and GPE Further , the lower courts ' judgments had not been properly reasoned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused him leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . As mentioned above , on DATE the applicant made a criminal complaint about PERSON and Senior Constable GPE", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant 's request that the police interview the prosecutor in the criminal proceedings against him about , inter alia , whether the police report in his case had contained sufficient information , was rejected , as was his request that PERSON be interviewed about whether the applicant had participated in the smuggling of the narcotics prior to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the pre - trial investigation ORG maintained that ORG had agreed to disclose the identity of his drugs supplier only if it was not written down in the report . The applicant 's identity had been established from the telephone number produced by PERSON the first call had been to establish whether he had any narcotics in his possession . He had been under surveillance from TIME DATE and he had become a suspect as he had been sighted in a rented car together with PERSON on that afternoon . The police had received information from independent sources that a drugs shipment was going to be smuggled into the country on DATE in a rented car . The police had planned on stopping the vehicle but had failed . The only way to find the cannabis had been to call the applicant and place an order .", "CARDINAL . In the pre - trial investigation the applicant and PERSON testified that an order had been made in code language in the call of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the then ORG brought charges against GPE and GPE for abuse of public office , incitement to commit an aggravated narcotics offence and breach of official duty . The indictment alleged :", "\u201c From DATE PERSON in his capacity as GPE and GPE in his capacity as Senior Constable acted in the following manner when carrying out a pre - trial investigation into a suspected narcotics offence in which ORG was a suspect :", "CARDINAL . NORP [ GPE and GPE ] abused their office in relation to [ H. ] , who was under their direct supervision as a detainee on remand , by ... persuading PERSON , who hoped that it would bring him relief as regards his own situation , to make a deal over the telephone to the effect that [ the applicant ] sell to him QUANTITY of cannabis to enable the police to arrest [ the applicant ] and confiscate the drugs as the deal was about to take place . They thereby restricted his right to liberty to a greater extent than the aim of his arrest required .", "CARDINAL . NORP [ GPE and GPE ] , in the manner explained above , through [ H. ] on DATE , deliberately incited [ the applicant ] to obtain cannabis unlawfully to deliver it to [ H. ] together with another person receiving at least QUANTITY of narcotics from the persons who imported the narcotics unlawfully . Of this amount [ the applicant ] took over QUANTITY . When [ the applicant ] arrived at the location agreed on the telephone with [ H. ] the police arrested [ the applicant ] and confiscated the cannabis from his possession . [ The applicant ] was subsequently convicted of an aggravated narcotics offence . ... They have thereby also breached their official duty . \u201d", "The applicant associated himself with the prosecution . He also brought an alternative private prosecution to the following effect :", "\u201c CARDINAL . [ PERSON ] breached his official duty in that he did not , by making an annotation in the pre - trial investigation records or by any other means , inform [ the applicant ] , ORG or the Helsinki ORG of the circumstances in which [ the applicant 's ] offence had taken place . ... These circumstances had become clear at the end of the trial as ORG upon [ the applicant 's ] request had requested a clarification of the facts in issue . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The defence relied , inter alia , on ORG judgment of DATE in the applicant 's case , in which it was held that there had been an arrangement that the applicant receive the drugs prior to the order made by ORG The defence argued that the order had not been made before TIME on DATE . The applicant gave oral evidence , maintaining that H. had placed the order in his first call , on DATE CARDINAL or Thursday CARDINAL September , whereupon the applicant had contacted PERSON At CARDINAL TIME on DATE M. had called the applicant and requested him to take delivery of the narcotics from NORP and PERSON The court also heard oral evidence from PERSON , the defendant police officers and some other officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted GPE and GPE of abuse of public office and sentenced them to a fine . It held that the facts regarding the telephone calls as described in the indictment were established and stated that it did not believe that PERSON would have called the applicant solely on his own initiative . It noted that the telephone metering information disclosed that PERSON had called the applicant at TIME on DATE and at CARDINAL p.m. , TIME and TIME on DATE . It however rejected the incitement charge as the applicant had not been convicted of delivering the QUANTITY of cannabis to PERSON , GPE and GPE had lacked intent to incite the applicant to obtain the remaining drugs . Also the charge concerning breach of official duty was rejected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted , inter alia , that ORG had been wrong to find in its judgment of DATE that there had been an arrangement that he receive the narcotics prior to ORG 's order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the convictions of the QUANTITY police officers for abuse of public office , holding :", "\u201c On DATE [ the applicant ] was convicted by ORG ... of several narcotics offences committed from DATE ... In that judgment it was established that prior to the police officer 's order made by telephone there had been an arrangement that he would receive a QUANTITY drugs shipment . During the present proceedings , no such grounds have emerged for concluding otherwise . Accordingly , the order for the narcotics in issue did not affect [ the applicant 's ] guilt as to the possession of the QUANTITY of narcotics of which he has been convicted as mentioned above . The guilt of [ GPE and GPE ] as regards a prohibited entrapment operation has not therefore been established . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his writ of appeal , ORG ( valtiosyytt\u00e4j\u00e4 , stats\u00e5klagaren ; who replaced ORG ) submitted that it could not be concluded from ORG judgment of DATE that prior to the police order there had been an arrangement for the applicant to receive the narcotics . Further , he pointed out that the applicant had been charged and convicted of an offence committed on DATE , and not before , and no evidence had even been produced to show that the applicant had been involved in the shipment prior to DATE . In any event , it had not even been alleged that the shipment had arrived in GPE on DATE , or earlier .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found that PERSON , who had been in detention on remand , had co - operated with the police . It considered that there was no reason to depart from the lower courts ' establishment of the facts , although it remained unclear how the co - operation had been induced . The court found that on CARDINAL and DATE had discussed with the applicant in general terms whether it would be possible to buy cannabis from him . At TIME on DATE had placed an order . According to ORG 's confession , on TIME CARDINAL September CARDINAL he had encouraged H. through GPE to place an order with the applicant for QUANTITY of cannabis . H. had therefore called the applicant at CARDINAL p.m. The court found it established that GPE and GPE at TIME had incited the applicant to commit a new offence by selling narcotics to H.", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that in their judgments of DATE and DATE ORG and ORG respectively had found the applicant guilty of an aggravated narcotics offence in that on DATE he had been unlawfully in possession of QUANTITY of cannabis having unlawfully taken delivery of a car from persons who had unlawfully imported the narcotics in it and by participating in the unloading and the weighing of the cannabis . It had been established that the applicant had been involved in the importing of these QUANTITY of cannabis long before DATE . According to ORG , the telephone conversations between PERSON and the applicant had not therefore had any impact on the receipt by the applicant of the imported narcotics . Thus , the involvement by GPE and GPE could not be regarded as having had any causal relation with the offence of which the applicant had been convicted . In order to convict someone of incitement to commit an offence it was a pre - condition that the offence had actually been committed . That had not been the case here , because the police intervention had prevented the applicant from selling MONEY to H. Accordingly , GPE and GPE were not guilty of incitement to commit an aggravated narcotics offence .", "CARDINAL . ORG found however that GPE and GPE had used prohibited methods and were thus guilty of a breach of official duty .", "CARDINAL . As to the sentence , ORG noted that the police officers had been tipped off by a third party that a rented car containing narcotics was going to enter the country during DATE . On TIME the police had sighted the applicant in a rented car , but had not been able to follow it . In order to prevent the narcotics from entering the market , PERSON had decided that it was necessary to encourage PERSON to place an order and agree on a meeting . This had resulted in the applicant 's arrest and the confiscation of a large amount of narcotics . The court concluded that , considering the seriousness of the situation , resorting to the prohibited method was excusable . It therefore decided not to impose a sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested a re - opening of the case against him , based on the fact that ORG had convicted GPE and GPE of a breach of official duty . He made reference to the case of PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Reports of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , thus on the same day judgment in the case against PERSON and Senior Constable GPE was delivered , ORG refused the request .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( poliisilaki , polislagen ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that when being heard as a witness or otherwise , police personnel are not obliged to reveal the identity of any person who has provided them with confidential information in their official capacity or to reveal any confidential tactical or technical methods .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , national legislation did not contain any provisions on the use of undercover transactions or on the use of undercover agents .", "On DATE ORG adopted an amendment to LAW whereby explicit provisions on certain unconventional preventive methods and investigative techniques , including undercover operations and induced deals , were added to LAW ) .", "CARDINAL .
