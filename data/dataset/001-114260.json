In total , there were CARDINAL victims in the case who either died or could have died as a result of the applicant \u2019s criminal activity .", "CARDINAL . The conviction was based on several pieces of evidence , including the applicant \u2019s bag with needles and prepared soporific materials , expert examinations of these materials , oral evidence given by numerous witnesses , including a pawnshop owner who had bought various items from the applicant on numerous occasions , the surviving victims , the applicant \u2019s own statements and the autopsy reports on the victims .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the applicant complained that his lawyer had failed to take some investigative actions .

NORP The applicant also tried to retract his self - incriminating statements given at the pre - trial stage of proceedings , with reference to torture and coercion . The court examined this argument in detail , having , among other things , ordered an additional investigation in the matter , and explicitly rejected it as unsubstantiated . The decisions to discontinue the investigation with reference to the lack of indication that any crime had been committed were taken by the relevant prosecutor \u2019s office on DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Overcrowding is an issue of direct relevance to the ORG \u2019s mandate . All the services and activities within a prison will be adversely affected if it is required to cater for more prisoners than it was designed to accommodate ; the overall quality of life in the establishment will be lowered , perhaps signi\ufb01cantly . Moreover , the level of overcrowding in a prison , or in a particular part of it , might be such as to be in itself inhuman or degrading from a physical standpoint .", "CARDINAL . A satisfactory programme of activities ( work , education , sport , etc . ) is of crucial importance for the well - being of prisoners ... [ P]risoners can not simply be left to languish for DATE , possibly DATE , locked up in their cells , and this regardless of how good material conditions might be within the cells . The ORG considers that one should aim at ensuring that prisoners in remand establishments are able to spend a reasonable part of DATE ( TIME or more ) outside their cells , engaged in purposeful activity of a varied nature ...", "CARDINAL . Speci\ufb01c mention should be made of outdoor exercise . The requirement that prisoners be allowed TIME of exercise in the open air every day is widely accepted as a basic safeguard ... It is also axiomatic that outdoor exercise facilities should be reasonably spacious ...", "CARDINAL . Ready access to proper toilet facilities and the maintenance of good standards of hygiene are essential components of a humane environment ...", "CARDINAL . The ORG would add that it is particularly concerned when it \ufb01nds a combination of overcrowding , poor regime activities and inadequate access to toilet / washing facilities in the same establishment . The cumulative effect of such conditions can prove extremely detrimental to prisoners .", "CARDINAL . It is also very important for prisoners to maintain reasonably good contact with the outside world . Above all , a prisoner must be given the means of safeguarding his relationships with his family and close friends . The guiding principle should be the promotion of contact with the outside world ; any limitations upon such contact should be based exclusively on security concerns of an appreciable nature or resource considerations ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . As the ORG pointed out in DATE ORG , prison overcrowding is an issue of direct relevance to the ORG \u2019s mandate ( cf . ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) . An overcrowded prison entails cramped and unhygienic accommodation ; a constant lack of privacy ( even when performing such basic tasks as using a sanitary facility ) ; reduced out - of - cell activities , due to demand outstripping the staff and facilities available ; overburdened health - care services ; increased tension and hence more violence between prisoners and between prisoners and staff . This list is far from exhaustive .", "The ORG has been led to conclude on CARDINAL occasion that the adverse effects of overcrowding have resulted in inhuman and degrading conditions of detention ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . The phenomenon of prison overcrowding continues to blight penitentiary systems across LOC and seriously undermines attempts to improve conditions of detention . The negative effects of prison overcrowding have already been highlighted in previous ORG ...", "CARDINAL . In a number of countries visited by the ORG , particularly in central and eastern LOC , inmate accommodation often consists of large capacity dormitories which contain all or most of the facilities used by prisoners on a DATE basis , such as sleeping and living areas as well as sanitary facilities . The ORG has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when , as is frequently the case , the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions ... Large\u00adcapacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives ... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level ; further , in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions .", "CARDINAL . The ORG frequently encounters devices , such as metal shutters , slats , or plates \ufb01tted to cell windows , which deprive prisoners of access to natural light and prevent fresh air from entering the accommodation . They are a particularly common feature of establishments holding pre - trial prisoners . The ORG fully accepts that speci\ufb01c security measures designed to prevent the risk of collusion and/or criminal activities may well be required in respect of certain prisoners ... [ E]ven when such measures are required , they should never involve depriving the prisoners concerned of natural light and fresh air .
