When legal aid has been granted and the time - limit for the submission of a cassation appeal has already expired , it is open to the legally - aided party to submit the appeal together with a request for leave to appeal out of time made under sections DATE and CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Procedure before Administrative Courts ( e.g. ORG FZ CARDINAL of DATE and ORG , I CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) . In certain cases the courts stated that such a request should be submitted within DATE from the date on which the lawyer obtained a power of attorney from the party , which date is considered as the date on which the impediment to lodging an appeal ceased to exist ( e.g. ORG , II ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) , or from the date when the lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file ( e.g. the ORG , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a number of its recent decisions ORG acknowledged the difficulties which legally - aided parties experienced in connection with lodging their cassation appeals against judgments of the first - instance administrative courts . It expressed the view that they should not be penalised for the fact that their requests for legal aid were not processed speedily enough . It analysed relevant case - law of the administrative courts and noted that the manner in which DATE limit for lodging cassation appeals was determined had led to divergent results . It held that it was necessary to determine the relevant time in a manner compatible with effective access to the highest administrative court and which ensured equal treatment for parties represented by lawyers appointed under the legalaid scheme and by privately hired lawyers . The court held that the time - limit for a legally - aided party started to run only on DATE when a legal - aid lawyer had a genuine possibility of lodging the cassation appeal and not when he or she was informed of having been assigned to the case . The court was of the view that the latter approach was far too rigorous and rendered the effective enjoyment of legal assistance granted under the legal - aid system illusory . In any event , the cassation appeal had to be lodged within DATE from DATE on which the party was informed of the appointment of the legal - aid lawyer ( I FZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; I FZ CARDINAL of DATE ; PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; II OZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ; I CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ; I FZ CARDINAL of DATE ; ORG of DATE ; I FZ CARDINAL of DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
