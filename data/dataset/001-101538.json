AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the Court by PERSON E. St\u00f6ger , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a part - time farmer and ski instructor residing in PERSON , PERSON . He is entitled to allow his livestock to feed on grass on a certain plot of land , namely plot no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of the PERSON land register which belongs to PERSON ( grazing rights \u2013 Weiderecht ) . That land is building land .", "On DATE E. applied for a building permit for the construction of an underground car park on plot no . DATE .", "On DATE the Mayor of PERSON , as the building authority , conducted an oral hearing on the site of the project . The applicant had not been summoned to that hearing . In the course of the hearing the applicant , who had appeared nevertheless , claimed that as a holder of grazing rights on the proposed building site he had to be considered a party to the building permit proceedings and objected to the construction project .", "By decision of CARDINAL DATE the Mayor granted the building permit . He rejected the applicant 's objections as inadmissible because he was not a neighbour within the meaning of section CARDINAL of FAC ( GPE ) . He informed him that any dispute concerning the grazing rights had to be settled before the ordinary civil courts .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal against that decision as inadmissible because the applicant was not a party to the building proceedings within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW .", "On DATE the applicant lodged objections against ORG decision ( PERSON ) with the regional government . The applicant submitted that the decisions , whereby he had not been accepted as a party , were wrong . He claimed that section QUANTITY \u00a7 QUANTITY of LAW , which explicitly accepted persons holding a right to build ( Bauberechtigte ) as parties in building permit proceedings , should be interpreted as also extending the status of a party to persons who were holders of other kinds of servitudes encumbering the land of third persons .", "On DATE the regional government upheld the municipality 's decision . It found that the wording of section CARDINAL of LAW was clear and unambiguous and only conferred the status of a party on neighbours , namely persons who are the owners of land located at a specific distance from the proposed building project and persons who hold a right to build on the land at issue . As an obiter dictum , the regional government added that the legal situation of a person holding grazing rights was equally protected under civil law because , if a building permit infringed the civil rights of that person , a civil court could issue a prohibition on the carrying out of construction works .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , reiterating the arguments that he had raised before the regional government . He did not lodge a complaint with ORG .", "On DATE the regional government submitted its observations .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's complaint . It found that the building authorities and the regional government had correctly found that the applicant 's grazing rights did not confer on him the position of a neighbour within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW . The building permit proceedings solely had the purpose of establishing that there were no obstacles under public law ( the relevant building regulations ) against a planned building project , but the building authorities had no competence to examine and decide whether a planned building project interfered with private rights of third persons . On DATE this decision was served on the applicant 's counsel .", "Section CARDINAL of FAC ( GPE ) reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The applicant for the building permit and the neighbours are parties to the proceedings concerning the building permit .", "( CARDINAL ) Neighbours are the owners of plots of land that are immediately adjacent to the building site , or where CARDINAL point of their borders is within a distance of QUANTITY from a point along the border of the building site . Moreover , those persons who have a right to build on such a plot of land are considered to be neighbours .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG whose plots of land directly adjoin the building site , or where CARDINAL point of their borders is at a distance of QUANTITY from a point along the border of the building site , are entitled to claim non - compliance with the following provisions under LAW , to the extent that these provisions also serve to protect them :", "a ) specifications of the land development plan in relation to protection against pollution ;", "b ) fire - protection provisions ;", "c ) specifications of the zoning plan with regard to building lines , border lines of buildings , the type of construction and its height ;", "d ) provisions on distances under section CARDINAL ;", "e ) in the event that a general zoning plan and a supplementary zoning plan or a zoning plan with the specifications of the general and the supplementary zoning plan do not exist , the absence of the requirements pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) or LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) Other neighbours are entitled to claim non - compliance with the provisions listed in letters a ) and b ) of paragraph ( CARDINAL ) , to the extent that those provisions also serve to protect them .", "( CARDINAL ) If private - law objections are raised in the hearing on the building project , the authority shall strive , as far as possible , to achieve an agreement .
