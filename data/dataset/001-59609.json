On DATE the applicant , who is a journalist , published in the NORP DATE newspaper ORG , in the \u201c ORG mouth \u201d column ( GPE bocca del leone ) , an article about Mr PERSON , who was at that time ORG in GPE . The article purported to be a \u201c portrait \u201d of Mr Caselli . It was entitled \u201c PERSON , the judge with the white tuft \u201d and bore the sub - title \u201c NORP schooling , communist militancy \u2013 like his friend PERSON ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the article the applicant , after referring to the proceedings instituted by PERSON against PERSON , a very well known NORP statesman accused of aiding and abetting a mafia - type organisation ( appoggio esterno alla mafia ) , who had in the meantime been acquitted at first instance , expressed himself as follows :", "\u201c ... At university , [ ORG ] moved towards the ORG [ ORG ] , the party which exalts the frustrated . When he entered ORG he swore a threefold oath of obedience DATE to God , to the PERSON and to via PERSON [ formerly the headquarters of the ORG , now those of the PDS \u2013 ORG of the Left ] . And [ ORG ] became the judge he has remained for DATE pious , stern and partisan .", "But he can not really be understood without a mention here of his alter ego PERSON , his twin brother . Both from GPE ; DATE ; both raised by the NORP teaching orders ; both NORP militants ; both judicial officers ; and a deep understanding between them : when PERSON , the head , calls , PERSON , the arm , responds .", "PERSON ] has always been CARDINAL step ahead of PERSON [ PERSON ] . In DATE he indicted for an attempted coup PERSON , a former member of the Resistance , but also an anticommunist . It was a typical political trial which led nowhere . Instead of facing a judicial inquiry , PERSON found that his career began to take off . In DATE he was elected as a NORP MP . And ever since then he has been the via PERSON shadow Minister of Justice ...", "... [ Caselli ] is a judge in the public eye . He is in the first line of the fight against terrorism . It was he who obtained the confession of PERSON , whose evidence as a witness for the prosecution was a disaster for the BR [ the red ORG ] .", "In the meantime , the ORG set in motion its strategy for gaining control of the public ORG offices in various cities . That campaign is still going on , as the ORG has picked up the baton . ... The first idea was that if the NORP did not manage to gain power through the ballot box , they could do so by forcing the lock in the courts . There was no shortage of material . The NORP and the NORP were nothing but thieves and it would be easy to catch them out . The second idea was more brilliant than the first : the opening of a judicial investigation was sufficient to shatter people \u2019s careers ; there was no need to go to the trouble of a trial , it was sufficient to put someone in the pillory . And to do that it was necessary to control all the public ORG offices .", "And that was the start of GPE . The FAC , GPE and others were immediately caught with their hands in the till and destroyed . But PERSON was needed to complete the picture ...", "It was at that precise moment that PERSON [ PERSON ] was getting ready to leave the rain of GPE for the sun of GPE ...", "Once in GPE his fate and ORG \u2019s became intertwined , whereas the CARDINAL men had remained apart for DATE . DATE the senator for life was suddenly accused of belonging to the mafia . The file was an implausible rag - bag ...", "In DATE PERSON flew off to GPE , where he met PERSON . He offered the informer MONEY DATE to continue to co - operate . [ Buscetta ] could still be useful to him during the investigation , even if the outcome was no longer of much importance . The result sought had already been achieved .", "What will happen next is already predictable . In CARDINAL to CARDINAL months\u2019 time the investigation will be closed . But ORG will not be able to resurrect his political career . What a stroke of luck . PERSON , on the other hand , will be portrayed as an objective judge . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting on a complaint by PERSON , the judge responsible for preliminary investigations committed the applicant and the manager of ORG for trial in the Monza ORG . The applicant was accused of defamation through the medium of the press ( diffamazione a mezzo stampa ) , aggravated by the fact that the offence had been committed in respect of a civil servant in the performance of his official duties .", "CARDINAL . During the first - instance proceedings the defence asked to take evidence from PERSON as the complainant and civil party . It also asked for CARDINAL press articles concerning the professional relations between PERSON and the criminal - turned - informer ( pentito ) PERSON to be added to the file . ORG refused both the above applications on the grounds that there was no point taking evidence from PERSON in view of the content of the article written by the applicant and that the documents in question would not have had any influence over the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the accused guilty of defamation within the meaning of Articles QUANTITY and CARDINAL and QUANTITY of LAW and LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) . It sentenced the applicant to a fine of MONEY ( ITL ) , payment of damages and costs in the sum of ITL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL and publication of the judgment in ORG . It held that the defamatory nature of the article was evidenced by the fact that it denied that PERSON performed his duties conscientiously , attributing to him a lack of impartiality , independence and objectivity which had allegedly led him to use his judicial activity for political ends . The applicant was not entitled to assert the right to report current events ( diritto di cronaca ) and comment on them ( diritto di critica ) as he had not adduced any evidence in corroboration of such serious accusations .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . Relying on the freedom of the press and in particular the right to comment on current events , he submitted , among other arguments , that the reference to ORG \u2019s political tendencies reflected the truth and that ORG could have tested whether this was so by agreeing to take evidence from the complainant himself , that PERSON and PERSON actually were friends and that in the proceedings against ORG actually had made use of the assistance of the pentito Buscetta and had paid him sums of money as the representative of the ORG , since all the pentiti were in receipt of money from the NORP ORG . He further described himself as a commentator ( opinionista ) , arguing that his intention had not been to present a biography of PERSON but to express his critical opinions , in a figurative and effective way , on the basis of true and uncontested facts . Lastly , he insisted that the complainant , together with journalists and other well - known personalities on the NORP political stage who , like PERSON , had been militant NORP , should be required to give evidence . In particular , he asked for evidence to be taken from Mr PERSON and PERSON , both political comrades of the complainant during DATE in GPE and demanded that ORG add to the file press articles relating interviews in which they had confirmed the complainant \u2019s active political militancy . In particular , in an interview published in the DATE newpaper ORG on DATE , extracts from which were quoted in the applicant \u2019s appeal , PERSON had declared , among other statements , that the complainant was a courageous man of great integrity but that he was influenced by the NORP cultural and political model , that his links with the former ORG were very close and that ORG had subsequently become all but a member of it . In an interview published by another DATE newspaper , ORG , on DATE , also quoted in extract form in the applicant \u2019s appeal , PERSON had stated that in DATE he had participated in CARDINAL of political meetings attended by PERSON and PERSON , among others , held by the GPE federation of the former ORG . He had gone on to say that although ORG , a man of integrity , had done good work in fighting terrorism and as a judicial officer , he was highly politicised and should therefore avoid making speeches like a tribune .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG gave judgment against the applicant . It held that he had attributed acts and conduct to PERSON in a clearly defamatory way .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal gave separate rulings on the various key parts of the article .", "CARDINAL . It first examined the phrase concerning the \u201c oath of obedience \u201d ( giuramento di obbedienza ) :", "\u201c When he entered ORG he swore a threefold oath of obedience DATE to God , to the PERSON and to via PERSON [ formerly the headquarters of the ORG , now those of the PDS \u2013 ORG of the Left ] . And [ ORG ] became the judge he has remained for DATE pious , stern and partisan .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that this sentence was defamatory because , while it had a symbolic value , it indicated dependence on the instructions of a political party , which was inconceivable for persons who , on being admitted to judicial office , had to swear an oath of obedience ( not a symbolic one but a real one ) to the law and nothing but the law .", "CARDINAL . ORG next examined the remainder of the article , particularly the allegations that", "- Caselli , with the support of ORG , also a judicial officer ( the relations between the CARDINAL being described as relations between \u201c the arm and the head \u201d ) , had played a crucial role in the former ORG plan to gain control of the public ORG offices in each NORP city in order to annihilate their political opponents ;", "- Caselli had accused ORG and used the pentito Buscetta in the full knowledge that he would eventually have to discontinue the proceedings for lack of evidence , which confirmed that the sole purpose of his actions had been to destroy ORG \u2019s political career .", "CARDINAL . ORG ruled that these allegations were very serious and highly defamatory in that they were not backed up by any evidence .", "CARDINAL . As to the request for cross - examination of the complainant and other notable figures of NORP political life and for certain articles to be added to the file , ORG held that this was unnecessary since the applicant \u2019s remarks about PERSON \u2019s political leanings , the friendship between PERSON and PERSON and the use of PERSON , a pentito paid by the ORG , in the proceedings against ORG , were not defamatory and therefore did not have to be proved .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG upheld ORG decision . It held that it was a correct decision both in procedural terms and as regards the merits of the case . On the merits , it held that the offensive nature of the article for PERSON , both as an individual and as a judicial officer , could not be doubted , as the applicant had accused him of deeds which implied a lack of personality , dignity , autonomy of thought , coherence and moral integrity ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
