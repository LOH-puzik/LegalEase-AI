The applicant , who was born in DATE , is a judge . After DATE he applied for membership of ORG d\u2019Italia di PERSON . On CARDINAL DATE he became a member of ORG in GPE .", "During DATE the applicant read in the national press that certain ORG prosecutors , in particular the state prosecutor of GPE ( GPE di GPE ) , had begun inquiries , which , according to certain rumours , also concerned lodges associated with ORG d\u2019Italia di PERSON .", "In DATE the applicant asked to distance himself from the organisation and on DATE he was made a \u201c dormant member \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office sent ORG ( Consiglio Superiore della Magistratura ) a list of judges who were PERSON . ORG then sent it to the Minister of ORG and ORG at ORG , who instituted disciplinary proceedings against the judges . The list was then made public \u2013 at least in part \u2013 by the press .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after an inquiry had been commenced , the applicant was questioned by an inspector from ORG for ORG . Subsequently , in DATE , he was questioned by ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE he was summoned to appear before the disciplinary section of ORG . He was accused of having undermined the prestige of the judiciary by committing a serious breach of his duties , and thus being unworthy of the trust that must be had in a judge .", "In his address , counsel for the applicant referred to a decision of the same section , given DATE , which drew a distinction between secret associations \u2013 of which judges were forbidden from being members \u2013 and discreet associations . Counsel for the applicant also noted that the guidelines of ORG , which stated that judicial office was incompatible with membership of the NORP , had been adopted during DATE , which was DATE after the applicant had left the organisation of his own accord .", "At the end of the proceedings the disciplinary section found that the applicant had breached LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c the DATE decree \u201d ) and gave him a warning .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed on points of law to ORG , which examined the case in plenary session on DATE . It dismissed the appeal in a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG indicated again ( having already made a similar recommendation on an unknown date ) that it was not in favour of the applicant \u2019s promotion \u2013 for which the requisite conditions had been fulfilled since DATE in view of the disciplinary sanction that had been imposed on him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The particular provisions of LAW referred to by the Government are the following :", "\u201c All citizens shall have the duty to be loyal to the Republic and to comply with the LAW and the laws .", "ORG to whom public offices are entrusted shall perform them with discipline and honour , and take an oath where it is required by law . \u201d", "\u201c Public officials shall be at the exclusive service of the nation .", "If they are members of ORG they shall be promoted only by seniority .", "The right to become members of political parties may be limited by law in the case of members of the judiciary , professional members of the armed forces on active duty , police officials and officers , and diplomatic and consular representatives abroad . \u201d", "\u201c Reasons shall be stated for all judicial decisions .", "An appeal on points of law to ORG for a breach of the law shall always be allowed against sentences and measures concerning personal freedom delivered by the ordinary or special courts . The provision may be waived only in the case of sentences pronounced by military courts in time of war .", "Appeals to ORG against decisions of the PERSON and ORG shall be allowed only on grounds inherent to jurisdiction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , any judge who \u201c fails to fulfil his duties or behaves , in or outside the office , in a manner unworthy of the trust and consideration which he must enjoy \u201d will incur a disciplinary sanction .", "CARDINAL . Being called upon to judge the constitutionality of LAW decree with regard to LAW , ORG ruled that , in disciplinary proceedings against judges , the principle of lawfulness applied as a fundamental requirement of the rule of law and was a necessary consequence of the role conferred on the judiciary by LAW ( judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "However , with regard to the fact that DATE did not specify the types of conduct which might be regarded as unlawful , ORG pointed out that it was not possible to give examples of every type of conduct which might undermine the values guaranteed by that provision : trust and consideration which a judge must enjoy and the prestige of the judiciary . Indeed , according to ORG , those values constituted principles of professional conduct which could not be included in \u201c pre - prepared guidelines because it [ was ] not possible to identify and classify every example of inappropriate conduct which might provoke a negative reaction in society \u201d ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The court subsequently reiterated that the earlier laws governing the same subject matter had included a provision of general scope alongside the provisions penalising specific conduct , that the proposals for reform in this field had always been worded in general terms and that the same was true for other professional categories . It concluded that \u201c the provisions in this area [ could ] not but be of general scope because a specific directive would have the effect of legitimising conduct which had not been foreseen , but nonetheless attracted society \u2019s opprobrium \u201d . It added that those considerations justified the wide scope of the rule and the wide margin of appreciation conferred on a body which , acting within the guarantees inherent in any judicial procedure , was \u2013 by virtue of its composition \u2013 particularly well - qualified to judge whether the conduct considered in each case did or did not undermine the protected values ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "ORG stated , lastly , that this interpretation accorded with its case - law on the subject of lawfulness ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL of DATE on the implementing provisions of LAW ( right of association ) of the LAW concerning secret associations and the dissolution of the association called PCARDINAL provides that membership of a secret association is a criminal offence ( section CARDINAL ) . With regard to civil servants , section CARDINAL provides that disciplinary proceedings must also be brought against them before a special committee constituted according to very precise rules . However , in respect of judges of the judicial , administrative and military courts , jurisdiction remains vested in the respective disciplinary bodies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , which had convened following a message from ORG who is its president DATE to discuss the incompatibility between the exercise of judicial functions and membership of the NORP , passed guidelines . The TIME ( discussion and text of the guidelines ) of that meeting were published in the Official Bulletin ( PERSON consiliari , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and sent to the presidents of the ORG , ORG and ORG .", "According to those guidelines , \u201c judges\u2019 membership of associations imposing a particularly strong hierarchical and mutual bond through the establishment , by solemn oaths , of bonds such as those required by ORG lodges , raises delicate problems as regards observance of the values enshrined in LAW \u201d .", "ORG added that it was \u201c evidently [ within its ] powers to ensure compliance with the fundamental principle of LAW , according to which \u2018 judges are beholden only to the law\u2019 \u201d . In its words , \u201c this scrutiny include[d ] ... thorough care to ensure that , in the exercise of his functions , every judge respect[ed ] DATE and appear[ed ] to respect \u2013 the principle of being beholden to the law alone \u201d .", "ORG subsequently referred to a judgment of CARDINAL DATE of ORG in which the court had undertaken a balancing exercise between judges\u2019 freedom of thought and their obligation to be impartial and independent .", "It added : \u201c it has to be stressed that among the types of conduct of a judge to be taken into consideration for the requirement of the exercise of the administrative activity peculiar to the ORG , there is also , beyond the limit laid down by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE , the acceptance of constraints which ( a ) are superimposed on the obligation of loyalty to the LAW and of impartial and independent exercise of judicial activity and ( b ) undermine the confidence of citizens in the judiciary by causing it to lose its credibility \u201d .", "Lastly , ORG considered it \u201c necessary to suggest to the Minister of Pardons and ORG that it might be advisable to consider including among the restrictions on judges\u2019 rights of association reference to all associations which \u2013 for their organisation and ends \u2013 impose particularly strong bonds of hierarchy and solidarity on their members \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
