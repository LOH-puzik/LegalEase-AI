SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , PERSON and Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in PERSON .", "They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 grandmother owned a piece of land situated in a regional capital .", "In ORG that land is recorded on CARDINAL separate Certificates of Ownership relating to a number of plots occupying a total surface area of QUANTITY .", "The plots recorded in CARDINAL of these Certificates are classified as arable land and garden whereas the land recorded in the other ORG , having a surface area of QUANTITY , is classified as land in a built - up area .", "CARDINAL . This piece of land resembles a strip bordered on both sides by plots on which neighbours have their houses . According to the ORG , this piece of land used to be on the outskirts of town but because of the growth of the town its built - up areas have reached this property .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , when the land in question was de facto occupied by a socialist agricultural co - operative , CARDINAL high - voltage pylons were erected on it , subject to the provisions of the CARDINAL LAW ( Law no . QUANTITY . ) . The pylons themselves cover QUANTITY of the surface of the land in question , but the protective zone around them covers an area of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s grandmother was neither invited to take part in nor informed of the administrative proceedings concerning the construction of the electricity main of which the pylons were a part . She did not receive any compensation . Nevertheless , no decision appears to have been taken depriving her of the title to the land .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicants\u2019 grandmother , and later also the applicants , made a large number of applications to various courts , public bodies , members of parliament and other officials with a view to obtaining compensation in respect of the restrictions resulting from the erection and continued presence of the pylons on the land in question .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in DATE the applicants became the owners of the land by way of a gift from their grandmother , who then passed away in DATE .", "CARDINAL . As the owners , from DATE the applicants became liable to pay realestate tax on the land . In DATE the amount of tax payable in respect of the land as a whole was MONEY ( ORG ) , of which LAW related to the proportion of the surface taken up by the pylons .", "As the owners , the applicants became liable to maintain the land so that the use of the adjacent plots was not hindered .", "CARDINAL . In the applicants\u2019 submission , with the installations on it , their land can neither be sold nor made use of for construction . Nevertheless , in DATE , the applicants sold the plot classified as being in a built - up area ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to another individual .", "CARDINAL . As submitted by the Government , and acknowledged by the applicants , the remainder of the land can be used for farming , and it is used as a garden for growing fruit trees and vegetables .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought and later amended an action eventually directed against the local electricity - distribution company and aimed at obtaining an amount of money in compensation for the use of the surface occupied by the pylons .", "The defendant of the action is a joint - stock company and , as such , CARDINAL of its statutory purposes is to generate profit . It has been submitted by the applicants , and not contested by the Government , that the defendant is owned by another company , of which the ORG owns PERCENT of the stock .", "As to the substance , for each square metre occupied by the pylons , the applicants claimed the equivalent of approximately EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL per year .", "In support of their claim , the applicants relied , inter alia , on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention and CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL , arguing that while the impugned pylons served to make a profit for the defendant , the applicants not only had to endure the presence of the pylons but were also incurring costs related to the plot \u2019s maintenance .", "CARDINAL . The action was examined and dismissed at CARDINAL levels of ordinary jurisdiction : by ORG s\u00fad ) on DATE and , following an appeal by the applicant , by ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The courts applied section CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW , which was still in force by virtue of section ORG ) of MONEY ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of QUANTITY ( Law no . QUANTITY . ) . Their reasons may be summarised as follows :", "The DATE LAW authorised the construction of electricity mains , including the establishment of support points , such as the pylons on the applicants\u2019 land , on the real property of any party .", "As a matter of principle , no compensation was envisaged . However , if the owners or users of the real property concerned were significantly encumbered in its use they could claim adequate CARDINAL - off compensation .", "A claim for such CARDINAL - off compensation had to be filed within DATE of the entry into use of the installation or else it would lapse .", "The applicable legislation provided for an ex lege easement , which was a sui generis notion within public law . It was accordingly not possible to advance a compensation claim on the basis of private law . The easement in question was always to be governed by the legal rules applicable at the time of its creation . The subsequent legislation did not envisage any compensation other than the CARDINAL - off compensation under LAW .", "In support of this position , the courts also relied on a decision of ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "In the applicants\u2019 case , at the relevant time no compensation had been claimed or , consequently , obtained . The claim of the applicants\u2019 grandmother had thus lapsed , there had not been any legal basis for its renewal , and there was no basis for any new claim of the applicants\u2019 own .", "The courts equally held that the right to a fair trial did not imply the right to a successful outcome in the proceedings ; that the ex lege easement served the public interest and that it did not infringe on the applicants\u2019 property rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) under LAW no . PERSON . , as amended ) . They advanced similar arguments to those outlined above and alleged a violation of their rights under LAW No . CARDINAL .", "In addition , the applicants submitted that they accepted the public interest in having the installation and that the essential problem was the complete lack of any compensation , which they considered disproportionate . In particular , the ordinary courts had failed to respond to their argument that their grandmother could not have claimed any compensation at the time of the creation of the easement because she had de facto not been using it and compensation could only be claimed by someone who had been significantly encumbered in the use of their property .", "The applicants further relied on the judgments ( n\u00e1lez ) of ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00ed soud ) of GPE having a similar legal tradition \u2013 in cases nos . Pl . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , of DATE , and ORG of DATE . These judgments concerned , inter alia , the continued application of the compensation regime set up under LAW . In these judgments , an ideological distinction was observed between the \u201c old law \u201d , that is to say , that of the \u201c old ( NORP ) regime \u201d prior to DATE , and the law applicable under the subsequent democratic constitution . This distinction reflected the political and economic changes that had taken place .", "The quoted judgments recognised that , while there was a general continuity with the old law , there was a discontinuity in respect of the values of the old regime . The interpretation and application of the old rules had thus currently to take due account of the need for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the protection of property . The latter consideration was all the more relevant when the beneficiary of an ex lege easement was making use of it in order to obtain economic gain . While the lawfulness of the creation of an ex lege easement as such was undisputed , where the applicable public - law legislation contained no provision for compensation in respect of expenses relating to the exercise of the easement , the relevant provisions of private law were to be used as an alternative . Such provisions provided for compensation in respect of running costs , which was to be agreed on by those concerned or to be ordered by a court . A lack of compensation for such expenses would constitute unjust enrichment on the part of the beneficiary of the easement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court declared the applicants\u2019 complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded . It reiterated its established case - law to the effect that a general court could not bear \u201c secondary liability \u201d for a violation of fundamental rights and freedoms of a substantive nature unless there had been a constitutionally relevant violation of the rules of procedure . However , no such procedural claim had been advanced and , in any event , no procedural issue had been established . The ordinary courts\u2019 judgments were supported by adequate reasoning and their conclusions as to the facts and law manifested no signs of arbitrariness or lack of justification .", "CARDINAL . The Charter ( Constitutional Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG . ) was introduced into the legal order by way of a constitutional law which was enacted by ORG of the NORP and GPE on DATE and which entered into force on DATE .
