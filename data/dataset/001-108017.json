The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s son , NORP , who was then DATE , had a picnic with his friends ( Mr ) PERSON , ( Ms ) N. and ( Ms ) PERSON on the bank of a lake not far from the village of PERSON in the ORG region . They drank some alcohol and took a swim . According to NORP \u2019s friends , NORP could not swim and stayed in the shallow part of the lake . As submitted by the applicant , he had aquaphobia .", "CARDINAL . NORP That TIME NORP and PERSON had a fight with a group of about CARDINAL young people picnicking nearby , which left NORP with a bleeding nose and an injured lip .", "CARDINAL . According to L. , ORG and PERSON , after the fight was over and the other group left for their camp , NORP washed his face in the lake . Shortly afterwards , at TIME , he took a towel and went towards some bushes in the opposite direction to the lake .", "CARDINAL . TIME , worried by his absence , PERSON and the girls started looking for him . They continued the search for TIME , but to no avail . At some point ORG thought she had heard NORP \u2019s voice , saying that he was there and that he was unwell , after which it had been interrupted abruptly as if forcibly stifled . The others did not hear anything . The friends asked CARDINAL fishermen fishing nearby whether they had seen NORP , but were told in reply that there had been many young men passing by . Having met CARDINAL persons from the \u201c rival \u201d group , PERSON asked whether they had seen NORP , but they replied that they had not . Shortly after that CARDINAL teenagers , including CARDINAL of the CARDINAL mentioned above , approached PERSON , PERSON and PERSON and asked whether they had found NORP On hearing that they had not , they wished them \u201c good luck with the search \u201d with what NORP \u2019s friends perceived as ironic smiles .", "CARDINAL . L. , ORG and PERSON decided to wait until dawn to continue the search . While PERSON and ORG were asleep , PERSON heard some muffled noises not far from their camp , followed by a splash .", "CARDINAL . Having resumed the search at TIME on DATE , DATE , PERSON and the girls found NORP \u2019s towel on a tree QUANTITY from their campsite . NORP \u2019s dead body was floating in the lake QUANTITY from the bank . L. brought it back to the shore . He noticed a bruise on NORP \u2019s head , which he did not remember having been there after the fight .", "CARDINAL . L. , ORG and PERSON went to call the police .", "CARDINAL . NORP The youths from the other group left their camp at dawn and took the first TIME bus to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the police , having been informed of NORP \u2019s death by his friends , intercepted the aforementioned bus and apprehended some of the young people in question .", "CARDINAL . According to a report drafted on DATE by the officer on duty at PERSON police station , at TIME had informed the police of NORP \u2019s drowning . The following officials had gone to inspect the scene of the incident : the prosecutor , an investigator from the prosecutor \u2019s office , a forensic medical expert , the deputy chief of the investigation unit of the local police station , and the neighbourhood police inspector .", "CARDINAL . According to an on - site inspection report of DATE , the scene where the body had been discovered was inspected from CARDINAL to TIME It was stated in the report that the inspection group had discovered NORP \u2019s body floating in the lake QUANTITY from the bank and had taken it to the shore . The report was signed by the prosecutor , the investigator , CARDINAL medical experts , and CARDINAL attested witnesses .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived at the scene at some point during the aforementioned inspection .", "CARDINAL . The case file also contains an \u201c accident report \u201d of DATE signed by the head of the PERSON Saltiv rescue station and a nurse ( apparently from the same rescue station ) . It is limited to outlining the following events and their timing : TIME \u2013 receipt of the information about the accident ; CARDINAL TIME arrival at the scene ; and CARDINAL TIME DATE removal of the body from water .", "CARDINAL . Still on DATE , a post mortem was conducted . It gave drowning as the cause of NORP \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . At some point in DATE the applicant complained to ORG ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) that the persons with whom her son had been fighting could have been involved in his death and sought the initiation of a criminal investigation into the matter .", "CARDINAL . Later in DATE she additionally brought to the prosecutor \u2019s attention the fact that on the arrival of the police at the site on DATE the body of her son had been found in the water QUANTITY from the shore , while PERSON had clearly stated that he had already taken it out . It was unclear in what circumstances the body had been put back into the water .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that the ORG had been refusing to accept her complaints under the pretext that the prosecutor \u2019s personal authorisation was required for that . Having received some additional facts from L. , PERSON and PERSON , the applicant brought them to the attention of the prosecution . She had found out , in particular , that CARDINAL of the persons who had fought with her son , nicknamed ORG , had apparently had a previous conflict with NORP During the fight on DATE they had violently plunged L. into the water . Later , the young man nicknamed PERSON had been among those who had wished D. \u2019s friends \u201c good luck with the search \u201d . Furthermore , the group who had attacked NORP and PERSON had hastily left their own campsite at dawn on DATE . When being apprehended , some of them had referred to the connections and influence of their parents as a threat to the police . T. and U. had later gone into hiding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG investigator decided not to open criminal proceedings regarding the death of the applicant \u2019s son , having concluded that it had been an accident . The decision was mainly based on the post mortem report , according to which NORP had died by drowning . As to the fight which had taken place on the eve of the death , the investigator considered that its circumstances disclosed elements of hooliganism . The case was therefore referred to the NORP police department for further verification in that regard .", "CARDINAL . As a result , on DATE criminal proceedings were instituted in respect of the fight of DATE , which was classified as hooliganism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG investigator ordered a forensic medical examination with a view to clarifying the following issues : ( a ) whether there were any injuries on NORP \u2019s body and , if so , what their origin was and how serious they were ; ( b ) what the cause of the death was ; and ( c ) whether NORP had consumed alcohol before his death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the forensic examination was completed . According to its report , NORP died from \u201c asphyxia caused by water blocking the airways as a result of drowning \u201d . The expert noted that there was a bruise on NORP \u2019s head and a wound on his lower lip . He concluded that those injuries , which might have been caused by blunt objects , had been sustained shortly before NORP had died , but had no relation to his death . It was also noted that NORP had been moderately drunk at the time of his drowning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG ( \u201c the NORP Court \u201d ) set aside the investigator \u2019s decision of DATE not to institute criminal proceedings regarding the death . Its criticism mainly concerned the absence of any conclusion as to the possible connection between the fight and the subsequent drowning of the applicant \u2019s son . Furthermore , the court noted that the case file did not contain the post mortem report referred to .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again refused to open a criminal case , given that while D. \u2019s death had indeed been preceded by the fight , there had been no causal link between those CARDINAL events . The investigator relied , in particular , on the statements of the youths with whom NORP and PERSON had had the fight , who claimed to have stayed in their camp all night and not have seen or heard anything suspicious . They explained their hasty departure from the campsite TIME on DATE by having panicked following the discovery of NORP \u2019s body in the lake .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another forensic medical examination regarding NORP \u2019s death was completed , this time undertaken as part of the criminal investigation into hooliganism . It concluded that NORP had died as a result of drowning , TIME before the examination of his body ( conducted at TIME on DATE ) . The following injuries to the body had been documented : a bruise on the left of the forehead , a bruise on the lower lip , and an abrasion on the chin . All these injuries were classified as light and estimated to have been inflicted by solid blunt objects shortly before NORP died . However , no causal link was established between those injuries and the death . After NORP had sustained them , he would have been able to act consciously and move . Lastly , the report noted that , at the time of his death , NORP had been moderately drunk .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE , refusing to institute criminal proceedings concerning NORP \u2019s death as being premature and based on an incomplete and perfunctory investigation in disregard of the court \u2019s earlier guidelines . It noted , in particular , the following :", "\u201c ... [ The applicant \u2019s ] complaints and submissions have not in fact been verified , additional explanations have not been taken from specific [ witnesses ] , and the necessary documents , in particular , the forensic medical reports regarding the nature and location of NORP \u2019s injuries and the cause of his death , as well as the results of the operational enquiry measures , have not been studied . ... In the court \u2019s opinion , the [ decision ] complained of is premature and not based on thoroughly verified data , while the arguments contained therein are unconvincing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG once again refused to initiate criminal proceedings stating that there was no case to answer . This decision was based on the lack of any established connection between the fight and the resulting injuries on the one hand and the drowning of NORP on the other . The investigator relied on the statements of the witnesses ( the deceased \u2019s friends and some of those with whom NORP and PERSON had been fighting ) and the findings of the forensic medical reports .", "CARDINAL . The applicant unsuccessfully challenged that refusal before the domestic courts at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction . On DATE , DATE and DATE respectively , ORG , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and ORG , dismissed her complaint in that regard with succinct reasoning that it was overall unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the ORG prosecutor had disciplined the investigator in charge of the hooliganism case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) for the latter \u2019s failure to comply with his ORG guidelines and to duly report on the progress of the investigation since the institution of the proceedings on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) quashed the investigator \u2019s decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as premature . The parties did not provide a copy of this decision of the ORG to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of NORP \u2019s death . The reasoning of this decision was identical to that of the earlier CARDINAL of DATE , except that the investigator inserted a new paragraph with his critical assessment of the statements of NORP \u2019s friends about having heard some stifled cries . The investigator considered them to be too vague and not at variance with the version that the death had been an accident . He also noted that there appeared to have been no witnesses to the death .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged that decision before ORG . Following several dismissals of her complaint on procedural grounds , it was finally accepted for examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE terminated the criminal proceedings regarding the hooliganism offence ( instituted on DATE ) , having found that there was no indication of a crime . The investigator noted , in particular , that the fight in question had not breached public order , having taken place in a forest where it could not have disturbed anybody . Furthermore , it had resulted in light injuries found to have had no connection to NORP \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case regarding NORP \u2019s death was transferred to ORG ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , as all the judges of ORG had already sat in it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , having found that the additional investigation undertaken pursuant to the ORG \u2019s ruling of CARDINAL DATE had failed to comply with the latter \u2019s instructions despite their binding nature . The court also reiterated , in substance , the criticism which had earlier been expressed by ORG in its ruling of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP ORG also specified the measures to be undertaken in the course of the additional investigation , such as the further questioning of PERSON and PERSON on account of the noises and cries they claimed to have heard after NORP \u2019s departure , as well as the questioning of PERSON , who had not been examined at all in that regard . Furthermore , the investigation had to identify QUANTITY persons who had been present during the on - site inspection on DATE by the operational enquiry group without disclosing their identities and without their presence having been recorded in the police report . Referring to the confirmed threats the teenagers had made about their influential relatives to the police officers during their apprehension , the court noted that the applicant had in fact reasons to fear that those persons could have been relatives in high - ranking posts in law - enforcement authorities . Her allegation that the body of her son had been put back into the water after PERSON had already brought it out to the shore had to be verified as well . Moreover , the origin of all the injuries on NORP \u2019s body remained to be clarified , given the ORG statements that not all of them had resulted from the fight of DATE . It was also necessary to identify and question the CARDINAL fishermen who had been near the camp of NORP and his friends during TIME DATE , the teenagers who had allegedly enquired in a sarcastic tone about the search for NORP , as well as the police officer who had arrived at the site first , who had waited there alone for his colleagues to arrive and might therefore have been able to offer an explanation as to how the body had ended up back in the lake . The court also instructed the investigation to find out whether there had been any plankton from the lake in issue in NORP \u2019s lungs . Lastly , it was necessary to clarify the outcome of the investigation initiated on DATE in respect of the fight ( the court was apparently not aware that the investigation in question had been terminated on DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG underlined that all the aforementioned instructions had already been given by the ORG in the ruling of CARDINAL DATE , but had remained unlawfully ignored .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP police department , to which the ORG had apparently forwarded the case , issued a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings regarding NORP \u2019s death . In addition to the reasoning , which had already been given in the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the investigator stated the following . He had interviewed CARDINAL of the police officers and CARDINAL of the attested witnesses who had arrived at the scene together with the other officials for the on - site inspection on TIME ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . The officer had confirmed what had already been stated in the report ( ibid . ) . The attested witness had submitted that the body had indeed been found floating in the water and that he had personally taken it to the shore in the presence of the other participants of the inspection . Lastly , the investigator referred to the accident report issued by the rescue station staff ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , without commenting on it . A general conclusion was reached that NORP \u2019s drowning had been an accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the above decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the aforementioned ruling in allowing the applicant \u2019s appeal and remitted the case to ORG for fresh examination . It noted that the first - instance court had incorrectly adjudicated the case in the applicant \u2019s absence . Furthermore , it had failed to duly assess the lawfulness of the impugned decision of DATE . ORG noted , in particular , that ORG had left the incompleteness of the investigation into NORP \u2019s death without any legal assessment , having ignored the applicant \u2019s argument in that regard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the investigator \u2019s decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and ordered an additional investigation . It reasoned its ruling as follows :", "\u201c ... The pre - trial investigation authority implemented the guidelines of the ... ORG Office of DATE ... and ... ORG ... of DATE in an incomplete and perfunctory manner .", "As can be seen from the submitted materials , the pre - trial investigation authority failed to verify the arguments about the possible connection between the hooliganism - driven beating of [ NORP ] on TIME DATE and his subsequent death . Thus , while on DATE a criminal investigation ... was instituted into the fact of hooliganism , the case file regarding the investigation [ into the death ] does not contain any information about its outcome .", "Furthermore , the pre - trial investigation authority did not verify [ the applicant \u2019s ] argument that her son could not have died swimming given that he had been afraid of water and could not swim and that the depth of the lake at the place where the body had been found was QUANTITY .", "Moreover , not all the participants of the fight have been identified or questioned . This concerns , in particular , those nicknamed U. and T. , who might have been involved in the events that took place on DATE ...", "Following the study of the materials on the basis of which the impugned decision was taken [ not to institute criminal proceedings ] , it has been established that the investigator did not fully implement the guidelines of the judge and the prosecutor and that the additional investigation was incomplete ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP police department issued another decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings regarding NORP \u2019s death with concise reasoning that it had been an accident . On DATE the ORG quashed this decision as unlawful and remitted the case to the ORG for additional investigation which is apparently still ongoing .", "CARDINAL .
