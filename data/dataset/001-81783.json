He held registered shares of ORG ( the \u201c target company \u201d ) , an insurance company which was seated in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , respectively , the shareholder 's meetings approved the merging of the target company into the E - Versicherungsgruppe AG ( the \u201c acquiring company \u201d ) , which was seated in GPE . The shareholders of the target company were to receive shares in the acquiring company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the merger of the CARDINAL companies was announced pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ( Umwandlungsgesetz , see relevant domestic law , below ) in LAW ( PERSON der PERSON ) . The applicant maintains that he was unaware of this publication .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE a shareholder of the target company lodged a motion with ORG ( Landgericht ) with the aim of being allocated an additional number of shares . Having been informed that he did not have such a claim under the applicable law , the shareholder withdrew his request on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , which was represented by counsel , lodged a motion against the acquiring company before ORG with the aim of obtaining compensation ( bare PERSON ) for the alleged loss of value of the shares incurred by the merger pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW . The company further requested ORG to order the defendant party to submit the date of the most recent announcement of the merger in the public bulletin . Finally , the company requested the GPE court to transfer the case - file to the competent court in case it should lack jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed both parties that , pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , the court at the seat of the target company , which was not GPE , appeared to be locally competent . ORG invited both parties to submit their comments within DATE . This letter was served on the M - Company on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By telefax of CARDINAL DATE the plaintiff maintained that ORG should be regarded as having jurisdiction . In case ORG should not follow this opinion , the plaintiff alternatively requested to transfer the case - file to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant 's counsel further declared that he lodged all requests in the pending proceedings also on behalf of the applicant , as it was not clear whether the shares were owned by ORG or by the applicant personally .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the acquiring company requested an extension of the time - limit until DATE with regard to the upcoming DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without having heard the applicant , granted the requested extension . The applicant 's counsel was informed of this decision by court - letter dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE , which reached ORG on DATE , the acquiring company maintained that , according to the relevant provisions , ORG as the court at the seat of the target company was locally competent . It further pointed out that the action had been lodged out of the statutory time - limit of DATE following the final announcement of the merger in an official bulletin , which had expired on CARDINAL DATE . As the motion had been lodged with an incompetent court , it had not been properly lodged within that time - limit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant replied that the acquiring company had been acting in bad faith as it was the only party to the proceedings which knew about the impending expiry of the time - limit and had purposefully delayed the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By order of CARDINAL DATE ORG transferred the case to ORG , where it arrived on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the actions lodged on behalf of ORG and of the applicant inadmissible for having been lodged outside the statutory time limit . That court noted that the registration of the CARDINAL companies ' merger had been announced on behalf of ORG on DATE by publication in ORG and in a GPE DATE newspaper and on behalf of ORG on DATE in ORG and on DATE in the Official Bulletin of GPE . It followed that DATE time - limit started to run on DATE . ORG noted that the plaintiffs had filed their requests within the statutory time - limit with ORG . However , as that court had transferred the case to the competent ORG only after expiry of the time - limit , it had not been lodged in time . According to ORG , LAW , which provided that a law - suit remained pending even if it was transferred from a court which lacked jurisdiction , did not apply to the proceedings aimed at determining a shareholder 's compensation ( aktienrechtliches ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with the aim to declare his action admissible . Alternatively , he requested to be granted reinstitution into the proceedings ( Wiedereinsetzung in den vorigen Stand ) with respect to the time - limit . The applicant pointed out that he had not known at which date the merger had been announced in the official bulletin . Accordingly , he could not have known at which date the time - limit would expire . ORG had awaited the defending parties ' submissions without referring the case to ORG , as requested by the applicant . Under these circumstances , the applicant claimed that section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure should be applicable by analogy to the effect that the lodging with ORG had to be regarded as sufficient in order to comply with the statutory time - limit . Alternatively , the applicant claimed that he should be granted a reinstitution into the proceedings with regard to the fact that the delays which had occurred before ORG before the case was transferred to ORG were not imputable to him . Finally , the applicant maintained that ORG had failed to publicly announce the request filed by the other shareholder on CARDINAL DATE and to appoint a joint representative in order to safeguard the other external shareholders ' rights . He further maintained that his complaint should be declared admissible as a follow - up request to the first request lodged in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE ) rejected the applicant 's complaint . It noted that the merger had been announced on DATE in ORG and on CARDINAL DATE in the Official Bulletin of the Municipality of Hamburg . Confirming ORG finding relating to the expiry of the statutory time - limit and to the applicability of section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , ORG considered that only a strict application of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW guaranteed that the shareholders could have certain knowledge within a short period of time as to whether compensation would be paid . ORG further considered that the request lodged by the other shareholder in DATE was inadmissible . Accordingly , this request did not allow to file a follow - up request within the time - limit of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG expressed its doubts as to whether the rules on reinstitution into the proceedings were applicable to the present proceedings . In any event , the applicant had not been hindered to comply with the statutory time - limit through no fault of his own . Even though section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW contained a clear and unambiguous provision on jurisdiction , he had insisted that ORG had been competent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to accept the applicant 's constitutional complaint . According to that court , the applicant 's complaint did not have fundamental constitutional significance . Neither was the acceptance of the complaint indicated in order to enforce the constitutional rights which the applicant claimed had been violated . While it could not be excluded that ORG , when deciding on the applicant 's request for reinstitution into the proceedings , failed in a constitutionally questionable way sufficiently to consider the conduct of ORG , the applicant \u2013 who had learned in time about the extension of the time - limit granted to the defendant on DATE had failed to apply for a reduction of that extended time - subsidiarity . The remainder of the complaint did not have any prospect of success , as the applicant 's submissions did not disclose a violation of his rights under LAW . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The merging of shareholder companies was , at the relevant time , governed by LAW ) , which provided as follows :", "According to section CARDINAL , a shareholder could request compensation ( bare PERSON ) if the value of the shares he was allocated in the acquiring company did not equal the value of the shares he held in the target company .", "Section CARDINAL provided that the merger of CARDINAL companies had to be registered first in the commercial register at the seat of the target company and , subsequently , in the commercial register at the seat of the acquiring company . Each registration had to be announced by publication in ORG and in CARDINAL further periodical . The second publication organ was chosen by the commercial court by DATE for DATE and made public by notifying , inter alia , the chamber of commerce .

II ZB CARDINAL ) ruled on DATE that section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure should also apply by analogy to proceedings aimed at determining a shareholder 's compensation . This decision was based on considerations of legal certainty and the interest of an acceleration of the proceedings .
