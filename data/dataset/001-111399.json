The first applicant , ORG CARDINAL S.r.l . ( \u201c the applicant company \u201d ) , is a limited liability company operating in the television - broadcasting sector , with its registered office in GPE . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is the statutory representative of the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . By a ministerial decree of DATE , the appropriate authorities granted ORG CARDINAL S.r.l . a licence for nationwide terrestrial television broadcasting in accordance with PERSON no . PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , authorising it to install and operate an analogue television network . The licence specified that the applicant company was entitled to CARDINAL frequencies covering PERCENT of national territory . As regards the allocation of the frequencies , the licence referred to the national frequency - allocation plan , adopted on DATE . It indicated that the installations should be brought into line with the requirements of the \u201c assignment plan \u201d ( piano di assegnazione ) within DATE and that the measures taken to that end should conform to the adjustment programme ( programma di adeguamento ) drawn up by ORG ( PERSON per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni \u2013 AGCOM ) in conjunction with ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) . It appears from the PERSON judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that , under the terms of the licence , the allocation of frequencies was deferred until such time as the authorities had adopted the adjustment programme , on the basis of which the applicant company should have upgraded its own installations . The adjustment programme should , in turn , have taken into account the requirements of the national frequency - allocation plan . However , the plan was not implemented . A succession of transitional schemes that benefited existing channels were applied at national level , with the result that , even though it had a licence , the applicant company was unable to broadcast until DATE as it had not been allocated any frequencies .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company , through its statutory representative , made a number of applications to the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company served formal notice on the Ministry to allocate frequencies to it . In a note of DATE , the ORG refused its request .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company lodged an application with ORG against ORG and ORG ( a network of NORP television channels controlled by ORG ) , complaining that the authorities had not allocated it any broadcasting frequencies . The application was also directed against ORG because the PERSON channel had been authorised to broadcast on frequencies that should have been transferred to the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found in favour of the applicant company , holding that the authorities were required either to allocate the frequencies or to revoke the licence . Accordingly , it declared the note of DATE void .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed to the Consiglio di Stato . In judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , the PERSON dismissed the appeal and upheld ORG judgment . It noted that no deadline had been set in the licence for the authorities to adopt the adjustment programme drawn up by ORG in conjunction with the ORG , but that the applicant company had been given DATE to make improvements to its installations . Accordingly , the Consiglio di Stato found that the adjustment programme should have been approved promptly .", "The Consiglio di Stato added that ORG had to give a decision on the applicant company \u2019s request to be allocated frequencies , in accordance with a judgment delivered in the meantime by ORG ( DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company , because it had still not obtained the frequencies , brought proceedings against ORG in the PERSON , complaining that the judgment of DATE had not been executed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry extended the validity of the licence granted in DATE until the analogue switch - off date and allocated ORG CARDINAL S.r.l . a single channel with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON consequently held in judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE that ORG had properly executed its judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company brought a further application in ORG , arguing that the decree of DATE by which the frequencies had been allocated was insufficient in that , contrary to the terms of the licence , it concerned a single channel that did not cover PERCENT of national territory . In its application the company sought the annulment of the decree and an award of damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company signed an agreement with ORG ( the former ORG ) , which undertook to assign to it additional frequencies in accordance with the terms of the licence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pursuant to CARDINAL of the clauses of that agreement , the applicant company asked for the proceedings pending before ORG to be struck out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company applied to ORG to restore the case to its list . It sought the annulment of the decree of DATE by which the frequencies had been allocated , and an award of damages . It argued that the administrative authorities had not complied fully with their obligation to allocate additional frequencies and had failed to observe the agreement of CARDINAL DATE and the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of the agreement in question stated :", "\u201c ORG S.r.l . undertakes to request , by DATE , the striking out of application no . CARDINAL pending before ORG , to allow it to lapse for failure to submit a fresh application to schedule a hearing within the statutory time - limit and , by DATE , to waive the claims for compensation brought in that application , provided that , by the date on which the case lapses , this agreement , the decision allocating the additional frequencies and the decision of DATE have not in the meantime become invalid .", "The ORG , for its part , undertakes to comply fully with its obligation to allocate additional frequencies , and with this agreement and the decision of DATE . Should it fail to do so , ORG CARDINAL and the opposing authorities shall regain full possession of their respective procedural prerogatives . In the event that the assignment of the additional frequencies becomes invalid , it is specified that ORG CARDINAL S.r.l . may reactivate application no . PERSON only if it would be impossible in this situation for LOC Way ORG . to operate CARDINAL or more of the installations mentioned in Technical Attachment A. \u201d", "CARDINAL . The proceedings are currently pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , while its initial application was still pending before ORG , the applicant company had lodged a further application with the same court , seeking in particular an acknowledgment of its entitlement to have the frequencies allocated and compensation for the damage sustained .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the application , holding in particular that the applicant company had only a legitimate interest ( interesse legittimo ) , that is , an individual position indirectly protected as far as was consistent with the public interest , and not a personal right ( diritto soggettivo ) to be allocated frequencies for analogue terrestrial television broadcasting .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed to the Consiglio di Stato , arguing that , since it had been granted a licence by the appropriate authorities , it did in fact have a personal right . In particular , it contended that Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL did not comply with Community legislation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON decided to restrict its examination to the applicant company \u2019s claim for damages and not to rule at that stage on the request for allocation of frequencies .", "CARDINAL . It nevertheless observed that the failure to allocate frequencies to ORG . had been due to essentially legislative factors .", "CARDINAL . It noted that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) enabled the \u201c de facto occupants \u201d of radio frequencies authorised to operate under the previous system to continue broadcasting until new licences were awarded or applications for new licences were rejected , and in any event not after DATE .", "CARDINAL . It further noted that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) authorised the continuation of such broadcasts by entrusting ORG with the task of setting a deadline , on the sole condition that programmes were to be broadcast simultaneously on terrestrial frequencies and by satellite or cable . It pointed out that , in the event of failure by ORG to set a deadline , ORG had set CARDINAL DATE as the date by which programmes broadcast by the \u201c over - quota channels \u201d ( that is , existing national television channels exceeding the concentration restrictions imposed by section PERSON ) of PERSON no . ORG ) were to be broadcast by satellite or cable only , with the result that the frequencies to be allocated to licence holders such as the applicant company would have been freed up . The PERSON observed , however , that the deadline had not been complied with following the intervention of the national legislature : section CARDINAL of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL , which had subsequently become PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , had prolonged the activities of the over - quota channels pending the completion of an ORG investigation into the development of digital television channels . It added that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had subsequently , by a general authorisation mechanism , extended the possibility for over - quota channels to continue broadcasting on terrestrial frequencies until the national frequency - allocation plan for digital television was implemented , with the result that those channels had not been required to free up the frequencies intended for allocation to licence holders , such as the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . Law no . DATE had therefore had the effect , according to the Consiglio di Stato , of blocking the frequencies intended for allocation to holders of analogue licences and of preventing new operators from participating in digital television trials .", "CARDINAL . That being so , the Consiglio di Stato decided to stay the proceedings and requested the ECJ to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of the provisions , in LAW , on freedom to provide services and competition , Directive CARDINAL ( \u201c the Framework Directive \u201d ) , Directive CARDINAL ( \u201c the Authorisation Directive \u201d ) , Directive CARDINAL ( \u201c the Competition Directive \u201d ) and LAW , in so far as LAW referred to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ECJ gave judgment . It declared CARDINAL questions inadmissible , holding that it did not have sufficient information to give a ruling on them .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the question concerning LAW , the ECJ concluded as follows :", "\u201c By its first question , the national court asks the ORG , essentially , to state whether the provisions of LAW ] , in so far as LAW refers thereto , preclude , in television - broadcasting matters , national legislation the application of which makes it impossible for an operator holding rights , such as ORG , to broadcast without the grant of broadcasting radio frequencies .", "...", "By those questions , the national court is thus seeking to determine whether there are infringements of Community law for the purpose of ruling on an application for compensation for the losses flowing from such infringements .", "... Article CARDINAL ORG and , from the date on which they became applicable , LAW , LAW , the second sub - paragraph of LAW and LAW must be interpreted as precluding , in television - broadcasting matters , national legislation the application of which makes it impossible for an operator holding rights to broadcast in the absence of broadcasting radio frequencies granted on the basis of objective , transparent , non - discriminatory and proportionate criteria .", "That answer , by itself , thus enables the national court to rule on the application made by ORG for compensation for the losses suffered .", "Consequently , regard being had to the ORG \u2019s answer to the second , fourth and fifth questions , it is not necessary to rule on the first and third questions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the merits , the ECJ observed that the existing channels had been authorised to pursue their broadcasting activities as a result of a series of measures by the national legislature , to the detriment of new broadcasters which nevertheless held licences for terrestrial television broadcasting . It noted that these measures had entailed the successive application of transitional arrangements structured in favour of the incumbent networks , and that this had had the effect of preventing operators without broadcasting frequencies , such as the applicant company , from accessing the television - broadcasting market even though they had a licence ( granted , in the applicant company \u2019s case , in DATE ) . The ECJ held :", "\u201c ... PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... does not merely allocate to the incumbent operators a priority right to obtain radio frequencies , but reserves them that right exclusively , without restricting in time the privileged position assigned to those operators and without providing for any obligation to relinquish the radio frequencies in breach of the threshold after the transfer to digital television broadcasting . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ECJ added that the application of the transitional schemes was not in accordance with the new common regulatory framework ( ORG ) , which implemented provisions of LAW , in particular those on freedom to provide services in the area of electronic communications networks and services . It observed in that connection that several provisions of the ORG stated that the allocation and assignment of frequencies had to be based on objective , transparent , non - discriminatory and proportionate criteria . In the ECJ \u2019s view , such criteria had not been applied in the present case , since the status of the existing channels had not been amended under the transitional schemes and they had continued their broadcasting activities to the detriment of operators such as the applicant company , which , because it had not been allocated any broadcasting frequencies , had been unable to exercise its rights and make use of its licence .", "The ECJ therefore reached the following conclusions :", "\u201c ... it must be stated that , in the area of television broadcasting , freedom to provide services , as enshrined in LAW ORG and implemented in this area by the ORG , requires not only the grant of broadcasting authorisations , but also the grant of broadcasting radio frequencies .", "An operator can not exercise effectively the rights which it derives from Community law in terms of access to the television - broadcasting market without broadcasting radio frequencies .", "...", "Article CARDINAL ORG and , from the date on which they became applicable , LAW and of ORG on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services ( Framework Directive ) , LAW , the second subparagraph of LAW and LAW CARDINAL of ORG and of ORG on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services ( Authorisation Directive ) , and ORG Directive CARDINAL of DATE on competition in the markets for electronic communications networks and services must be interpreted as precluding , in television - broadcasting matters , national legislation the application of which makes it impossible for an operator holding rights to broadcast in the absence of broadcasting radio frequencies granted on the basis of objective , transparent , non - discriminatory and proportionate criteria . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , the PERSON concluded that it could not allocate frequencies in the government \u2019s place or compel the government to do so . It ordered the government to deal with the applicant company \u2019s request for frequencies in a manner consistent with the criteria laid down by the ECJ . It made the following observations in particular :", "\u201c The adoption by the authorities of a specific measure relates more to issues of performance and implementation than to damages : in cases involving an unlawful refusal to take an administrative measure that has been requested , the adoption of the measure does not amount to compensation , but rather to the performance of an obligation incumbent upon the authorities , unless the private party concerned has sustained any damage . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the request for the allocation of frequencies , the Consiglio di Stato observed :", "\u201c Where legitimate interests are at stake , however , it is not possible to envisage a specific means of redress because inaction , a delay or an unlawful refusal will always have an impact on a situation that was or remains unsatisfactory , with the result that there is nothing to restore ; the issue in relation to such interests concerns the practical implementation of any ruling setting aside the measure complained of .", "...", "Applying these principles to the present case , the PERSON finds that the appellant \u2019s request for an order requiring the authorities to allocate the network or frequencies is inadmissible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The PERSON deferred until DATE its final decision on the payment of compensation to the applicant company , holding that it was necessary to wait for the relevant regulations to be passed by the government before assessing the amount .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON requested both parties to comply with the following requirements by DATE . ORG was , firstly , to specify what frequencies had been available following the public tendering procedures in DATE and why they had not been allocated to the applicant company and , secondly , to justify its assertion that the licence granted to the applicant company had expired in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company , for its part , was asked by the Consiglio di Stato to submit a report on its activities DATE , and also to explain why it had not taken part in the DATE public tendering procedure for the allocation of frequencies .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON also asked ORG to explain why the national frequency - allocation plan for terrestrial television broadcasting had never been implemented . Lastly , it dismissed the applicant company \u2019s request for the suspension of the provisional authorisation granted to a channel belonging to the ORG group ( PERSON ) for the use of the frequencies .", "CARDINAL . In its reply , ORG explained to the Consiglio di Stato that the national frequency - allocation plan had been implemented only on DATE . According to ORG , this delay was due to several factors . Firstly , the legal situation was complicated because it was difficult to identify the available broadcasting frequencies as a result of the court decisions in which the over - quota channels had been allowed to continue broadcasting . In addition , the transitional arrangements introduced by LAW no . PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , which had allowed the channels in question to continue broadcasting in analogue mode , had prevented the plan from being implemented on account of the incompatibility between the interests of the channels likely to be allowed to broadcast under the plan and the interests of the channels that were legally entitled to continue their existing operations .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company submitted an expert valuation by the commercial bank PERSON assessing the damage sustained at MONEY ( ORG ) . The valuation was based on the profits achieved by PERSON , the over - quota channel which should have relinquished the frequencies allocated to the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the PERSON , on the basis of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ordered the Ministry to pay the applicant company the sum of EUR CARDINAL in compensation . It observed that , over DATE , ORG had acted negligently by having granted ORG CARDINAL S.r.l . a licence without assigning it any broadcasting frequencies .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON found that there was a causal link between the conduct of the administrative authorities and the damage alleged , and that the award of the licence to ORG . had not conferred on it the immediate right to pursue the corresponding economic activity ; accordingly , the compensation should be calculated on the basis of the legitimate expectation of being allocated the frequencies by the appropriate authorities .", "CARDINAL . In the opinion of the Consiglio di Stato , the fact that the frequencies had not been allocated until DATE was attributable to the authorities . Damage had thus been sustained as a result of an unlawful act for which the authorities incurred non - contractual liability , concerning both the breach of legitimate expectations and the delay in allocating the frequencies . The fact that the authorities had launched a public tendering procedure for the frequencies in DATE , although the situation in the broadcasting sector had not been clarified and there were outstanding technical issues , had been \u201c risky \u201d . The PERSON considered that the question of redress for the damage sustained by the applicant company should take this context into account . The authorities\u2019 conduct had not been characterised by \u201c significant gravity \u201d ( notevole gravit\u00e0 ) and the unlawful act was thus attributable to \u201c negligent \u201d and not intentional conduct on their part .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON added that the pecuniary damage should be assessed with effect from DATE , since ORG had ruled that the \u201c transition period \u201d after which legislation would have to be passed to allow licence holders to start broadcasting had expired on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As to the criteria for determining the damages to be awarded , the PERSON pointed out that , as regards the losses sustained , the applicant company had been fully aware , at the time of the call for tenders , from being allocated had been largely foreseeable . Accordingly , the applicant company should have known that it was unlikely to obtain the frequencies , at least in the short term . In addition , it could have purchased the frequencies under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Having regard to the above considerations , the Consiglio di Stato , without ordering an expert valuation , decided to award the applicant company ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the losses sustained . As regards loss of earnings , it found that , from DATE , the applicant company could have achieved profits but had been unable to do so because of the delay in allocating the frequencies ; the amount could be assessed at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . It refused to take into account the expert valuation submitted by the applicant company and held that it was unlikely that the company would have purchased shares in the market , even in the event that the over - quota channels had relinquished the frequencies . In the PERSON view , the comparison between the applicant company and the CARDINAL leading operators ( ORG and PERSON ) was unjustified , especially as it did not take into account the other nationwide operator ( La CARDINAL ) , which , although it had greater economic power than the applicant company , was nevertheless operating at a loss .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL the Constitutional Court , on the basis of LAW , reaffirmed the principle of the monopoly enjoyed by the ORG television corporation ORG on public - interest grounds . It held that the technical limitations on the number of frequencies justified the monopoly , and also laid down the requirement of objectivity and impartiality in public - service broadcasting .", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ( Nuove norme in materia di diffusione radiofonica e televisiva ) transferred control of public - service broadcasting from the executive to the legislature . A bicameral parliamentary committee was set up with responsibility for the general management and supervision of radio and television services . ORG \u2019s board of management was then appointed by ORG . A third channel of the ORG network was launched in DATE , with particular emphasis on regional programmes .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG declared unconstitutional the provisions of PERSON no . ORG establishing a monopoly or oligopoly on local broadcasting . In the light of that decision , commercial operators were authorised to run local television channels .", "CARDINAL . The allocation and voluntary redistribution of local frequencies subsequently encouraged the development of large regional or national operators , including the ORG group . The group \u2019s first channel was ORG , which started broadcasting nationwide in DATE ; by DATE , having taken over CARDINAL other channels ( ORG and GPE ) , PERSON had managed , together with ORG , to establish a \u201c duopoly \u201d of public and private operators .", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL of DATE , entitled \u201c Provisions governing the public and private broadcasting system \u201d ( GPE sistema radiotelevisivo pubblico e privato ) , transferred the power to appoint members of ORG \u2019s board from the parliamentary committee to ORG and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG declared unconstitutional the provisions allowing the CARDINAL channels controlled by ORG ( ORG , ORG and GPE ) to occupy a dominant position . It held that the provision whereby the same operator could hold several television - broadcasting licences on condition that it did not exceed PERCENT of the total number of national channels \u2013 that is , CARDINAL channels in DATE was not sufficient to prevent concentration of television channels , and was accordingly in breach of LAW in that it did not make it possible to guarantee the plurality of information sources . ORG considered that the existence of legislation to prevent dominant positions from being established was an essential requirement to justify the ORG \u2019s relinquishment of its monopoly on broadcasting . The creation of such dominant positions in this sector would not only have had the effect of changing the rules on competition but would also have led to the emergence of an oligopoly and would have breached the fundamental principle of plurality of information sources . ORG thus held that the mere coexistence of a ORG - owned company and private companies ( a mixed system ) within the broadcasting sector was not sufficient to secure respect for the right to receive information from several competing sources . As it had previously stated in decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , it reaffirmed that a ORG - owned company could not by itself ensure a balance precluding the establishment of a dominant position in the private sector .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a referendum , the NORP electorate rejected by a majority ( PERCENT ) a proposal to amend existing legislation by prohibiting a private entrepreneur from controlling CARDINAL television channel .", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL of DATE , which came into force on CARDINAL DATE , established ORG . Section PERSON ) of the PERSON imposed concentration restrictions in the television - broadcasting sector , prohibiting the same operator from holding licences to broadcast nationwide on PERCENT of the television channels operating on terrestrial frequencies .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provided that operators authorised to broadcast under the previous legal framework could continue to transmit their programmes at national and local level until new licences were awarded or applications for new licences were rejected , but in any event not after DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provided that ORG was to adopt , by DATE at the latest , a national frequency - allocation plan for television broadcasting , on the basis of which new licences were to be awarded by CARDINAL DATE at the latest .", "CARDINAL . In decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG adopted the national frequency - allocation plan ; subsequently , in decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , it adopted regulations on the conditions and procedure for awarding licences for analogue terrestrial television broadcasting .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL introduced a transitional scheme whereby existing national television channels exceeding the concentration restrictions imposed by section PERSON ) ( known as \u201c over - quota channels \u201d ) could continue broadcasting on a temporary basis on terrestrial frequencies after DATE , provided that they complied with the obligations imposed on channels holding licences and that their programmes were broadcast simultaneously on satellite or cable .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the same PERSON entrusted ORG with the task of determining the date by which , in view of the real and significant increase in viewers of cable or satellite television , the over - quota channels were to broadcast by satellite or cable only , thus relinquishing terrestrial frequencies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered a judgment concerning section CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL . It held that the transition period laid down in that provision was acceptable , given that at the time the law was passed the alternative means of transmission in GPE could not be said to have been competitive in relation to traditional analogue broadcasting , hence the need to introduce a transition period to encourage the development of digital broadcasting . However , ORG declared unconstitutional the failure to specify a fixed deadline for the expiry of the transition period . Referring to the technical conclusions set out in ORG \u2019s decision no . CARDINAL , resulting from a study of the number of cable and satellite television viewers in GPE , it ruled that DATE was a reasonable date for the expiry of the transition period .", "ORG held , in particular :", "\u201c ... the present NORP private television system operating at national level in analogue mode has grown out of situations of simple de facto occupation of frequencies ( operation of installations without licences and authorisations ) , and not in relation to any desire for greater pluralism in the distribution of frequencies and for proper planning of terrestrial broadcasting ... This de facto situation does not therefore guarantee respect for external pluralism of information , which is an \u2018 essential requirement\u2019 laid down by the relevant constitutional case - law ... In this context , given the persistence ( and aggravation ) of a situation which was ruled illegal in judgment no .

As PERSON and PERSON command together PERCENT of the television audience and over DATE of the resources in this sector , Mr PERSON exercises unprecedented control over the most powerful media in GPE .", "CARDINAL . This duopoly in the television market is in itself an anomaly from an antitrust perspective . The status quo has been preserved even though legal provisions affecting media pluralism have twice been declared anti - constitutional and the competent authorities have established the dominant positions of ORG and the CARDINAL television channels of ORG . An illustration of this situation was a recent decree of the Prime Minister , approved by ORG , which allowed the third channel of ORG and ORG \u2019s PERSON to continue their operations in violation of the existing antitrust limits until the adoption of new legislation .

The ORG notes that these concerns led the President of the Republic to oppose the previous version of the law .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is particularly concerned by the situation of ORG , which is contrary to the principles of independence laid down in ORG DATE ( DATE ) on public - service broadcasting .

In the ORG \u2019s opinion , internal pluralism must be achieved in each media sector at the same time : it would not be acceptable , for example , if pluralism were guaranteed in the print - media sector , but not in the television CARDINAL . Plurality of the media does not only mean , in the ORG \u2019s view , the existence of a plurality of actors and outlets , it also means the existence of a wide range of media , that is to say different kinds of media .", "ORG set out certain tools for promoting media pluralism , which include :", "\u2013 a legislative framework establishing limits for media concentration ; the instruments for achieving this include permissible thresholds ( to be measured on the basis of CARDINAL or of a combination of elements such as the audience share or the capital share or revenue limits ) which a single media company is allowed to control in CARDINAL or more relevant markets ;", "\u2013 specific media regulatory authorities with powers to act against concentration ;", "\u2013 specific measures against vertical integration ( control of key elements of production , broadcasting , distribution and related activities by a single company or group ) ;", "\u2013 independence of regulatory authorities ;", "\u2013 transparency of the media ;", "\u2013 pro - active measures to promote the production and broadcasting of diverse content ;", "\u2013 granting , on the basis of objective and non - partisan criteria , within the framework of transparent procedures and subject to independent control , direct or indirect financial support to increase pluralism ;", "\u2013 self - regulatory instruments such as editorial guidelines and statutes setting out editorial independence .", "In respect of the provisions in the Gasparri Law aiming at protecting media pluralism , the Commission considers at the outset that the mere increase in the number of channels which will be brought about by digital television is not sufficient in itself to guarantee media pluralism . Newly available channels may have very small audiences but with similar amounts of output . Finally , larger companies will enjoy greater purchasing power in a wide range of activities such as programme acquisitions , and will thus enjoy significant advantages over other national content providers .", "The Commission considers therefore that the threshold of PERCENT of the channels is not a clear indicator of market share . It should be combined , for instance , with an audience share indicator .", "As regards the second threshold set out in LAW , that is PERCENT of the revenue in ORG ) , the Commission considers that ORG certainly reflects a modern trend but should not , at least in this very broad definition , be used already at this stage instead of the \u2018 relevant ORG criterion , as its effect is to dilute the effectiveness of the instruments aimed at protecting pluralism . Indeed , it may allow an individual company to enjoy extremely high degrees of revenue shares in individual markets , whilst at the same time remaining below the PERCENT threshold for the whole sector .", "Indeed , the Commission notes that the combined effect of the new framework set out in LAW has relaxed the previous anti - concentration rules whose maximum permissible levels had been exceeded by PERSON and PERSON .

In the Commission \u2019s view , this approach is not satisfactory , as , if the status quo is maintained , it is likely that PERSON and PERSON will remain the dominant actors in NORP television . In this respect , the ORG recalls that while general anti - trust measures [ are aimed ] against the abuse of dominant positions , in the media sector dominant positions are forbidden as such .", "...", "In respect of the privatisation of ORG , which should lead to a lesser degree of politicisation of the public broadcaster , the ORG notes that change at ORG will allow for government control over the public broadcaster for an unforeseeable period of time . For as long as the present government stays in office , this will mean that , in addition to being in control of its own CARDINAL national television channels , the Prime Minister will have some control of the CARDINAL public national television channels .
