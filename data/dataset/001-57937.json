This has been achieved by rent freezes ( occasionally relaxed when the Government decreed statutory increases ) , by the statutory extension of all current leases and by the postponement , suspension or staggering of evictions .", "The last statutory extension of all current leases , with the exception of certain cases specifically prescribed by the PERSON , was introduced by PERSON no .

CARDINAL of DATE was declared unconstitutional in a decision ( no . CARDINAL ) handed down by ORG on DATE . In its decision the court held that the statutory restrictions imposed on property rights under LAW , with a view to ensuring social justice , made it possible to regard controls imposing restrictions as legitimate , provided that such controls were of an exceptional and temporary nature , but that perpetuating such restrictions was incompatible with the protection of property rights embodied in LAW .", "In its decision ORG also pointed out that the statutory DATE extension of leases prescribed by PERSON no . CARDINAL should not be considered in isolation but within the context of tenancy provisions as a whole . The court drew particular attention to the fact that this extension succeeded other statutory extensions and could mark the beginning of new restrictions on freedom of contract in this field . Moreover , the statutory extension of leases had the effect of prolonging contracts in which the rent , notwithstanding the increases allowed in accordance with rises in the cost of living , were not even approximately in line with current socio - economic conditions . Further , the PERSON concerned did not give the lessor the possibility of regaining possession of the property except in cases of absolute necessity .", "ORG also held that PERSON no . CARDINAL , inasmuch as it provided for a blanket extension of current leases without taking into consideration the particular economic circumstances of lessors and lessees - as would have been necessary to ensure social justice - , infringed the principle of the equality of citizens before the law embodied in LAW .", "Numerous provisions have established rules for the postponement , suspension or staggering of the enforcement of judicial decisions ordering tenants to vacate the LOC they occupy ( ordinanze di sfratto ) .", "A first suspension was introduced by Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE . The provisions set forth therein were incorporated in Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , which became PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE .

CARDINAL stipulated that such suspensions were not applicable if repossession of the LOC had been ordered because arrears of rent were owed . Similarly , no suspension could be ordered in the following cases :", "( a ) where , after conclusion of the contract , the lessor required the property for his own use or for that of his spouse or his children or grandchildren , for residential , commercial or professional purposes , or where a lessor who intended to use the premises for one of the above - mentioned purposes ( a ) offered the tenant similar accommodation at a rent which he could afford and which was not PERCENT higher than the previous rent and ( b ) undertook to pay the costs of the tenant 's removal ( DATE subsection , paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , of PERSON no .
