{"ITEMID": "001-4944", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "AUT", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "FIDLER v. AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , is an NORP national residing in GPE . In the proceedings before the ORG he is represented by Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the father of CARDINAL children , who were born out of wedlock in DATE and DATE , respectively .", "On DATE the Office for Youth and Family ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG , acting on behalf of the applicant \u2019s children , filed a request with ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) that the DATE amount of maintenance to be paid by the applicant be raised from NORP schillings ( ORG ) CARDINAL to ORG CARDINAL per child as of DATE . The applicant made a number of submissions opposing this request .", "On DATE the applicant requested that the DATE amount of maintenance be reduced to ORG CARDINAL per child as of DATE . He also requested legal aid . Subsequently , he requested that the amount be reduced to ORG CARDINAL per child . On DATE the applicant requested that he be released from his maintenance obligations for DATE .", "According to the Government the applicant was heard in an informal manner on DATE . According to the applicant no such informal questioning took place . He submits that on that date he only handed in documents relating to his legal aid request .", "On DATE the ORG decided that the applicant had to pay ORG CARDINAL in DATE maintenance per child for DATE . It reserved its decision as regards DATE , noting that further examination was necessary .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal . He submitted that ORG had disregarded his submissions and had failed to hear him . In particular , it had failed to take into account that , following his separation from the mother of his children , he had moved to an apartment which he had to renovate . The costs for this renovation had to be deducted from his income when calculating his maintenance obligations . Further , transport costs for reaching his work place , a newspaper publisher , which could during TIME shifts only be reached by taxi , also had to be deducted .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr Zivil - rechtssachen ) quashed ORG decision and referred the case back to it .", "ORG noted that , according to constant case - law , necessary costs for acquiring and furnishing an apartment had to be taken into account in calculating maintenance obligations , if CARDINAL parent , upon separation , had left the common apartment and its furniture to the other parent and the children . It appeared from the file that the applicant and the mother of his children had lived together until DATE . The applicant \u2019s submissions that , subsequently , he had moved to another apartment which he had to renovate , thus , needed to be examined . In this respect ORG ordered ORG to hear the applicant in person and to request him to submit documentary evidence in support of his submissions . Further , it ordered ORG to establish whether the applicant was unable to reach his workplace by public transport and , if so , what extra costs he incurred .", "On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to submit the said evidence .", "On DATE the applicant handed in documents including , inter alia , the tenancy agreement relating to the apartment at issue . According to the Government he was informally questioned by a court clerk ( GPE ) on that occasion . The applicant submits that no such questioning took place .", "On DATE ORG heard the mother of the children and the applicant \u2019s father as witnesses . According to the Government the latter was heard at the applicant \u2019s request . The applicant submits that his father was heard at the request of the children \u2019s mother .", "On DATE ORG appointed Mr. PERSON as expert and ordered him to file an opinion as regards the DATE income the applicant could have achieved as of DATE .", "On DATE the expert submitted his opinion , whereupon ORG on DATE requested to applicant to make comments , which he submitted on DATE .", "On DATE and again on DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s applications for a time - limit to be set for ORG decision ( PERSON ) . It noted that , according to the file , ORG had not yet heard the applicant on the question whether he had to acquire and to furnish an apartment following his separation from the mother of the children concerned and as to the costs incurred . ORG also noted the applicant \u2019s submissions that he had on DATE handed in the required documents and had been heard by a court clerk . However , there were TIME in the file . In any case , such an informal hearing could not serve as a basis for establishing the relevant facts and could , therefore , not substitute a formal hearing . The applicant should in fact have applied for a time - limit to be set for his being summoned to a hearing . As this hearing was necessary for the examination of the case , the matter was not yet ready for decision . Thus , his requests for a time - limit to be set for the taking of a decision could not be granted . In any case , ORG noted that , in view of the duration of the proceedings , ORG was called upon to summon the applicant speedily to a hearing and to give a decision without further delay .", "On DATE ORG issued a new decision . It upheld its decision of DATE as regards the applicant \u2019s maintenance obligations for DATE and further ordered him to pay varying amounts of maintenance for DATE and the first trimester of DATE as well as from DATE . All these amounts exceeded the DATE amount of ORG CARDINAL per child which the applicant had had to pay previously .", "ORG noted that it based its findings relating to the applicant \u2019s actual or potential income on the file , the submissions of the parties and the expert opinion . The children \u2019s maintenance claims had to be calculated as a certain percentage of the applicant \u2019s income . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s submissions that the costs for renovating his apartment had to be deducted from his income . In this respect the ORG relied on the statements of the witnesses heard , namely the children \u2019s mother and the applicant \u2019s father , whom it considered to be credible . It noted that , according to them , the apartment in which the applicant was now living , had been transferred to the applicant \u2019s mother upon her divorce from his father . It had been fully equipped and had not necessitated renovation . Moreover , the applicant had already used this apartment since DATE . As regards his income for DATE , when he had worked at a newspaper publisher , ORG accepted that an amount of ORG DATE had to be deducted as extraordinary transport costs for reaching his workplace .", "", "Finally , ORG , referring to ORG decision of DATE , which had ordered it to hear the applicant and to request further documentary evidence , noted that the applicant had presented himself in court and had , after discussion of the factual and legal issues of the case , handed in the required documents .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal . He complained in particular that ORG had failed to summon or hear him . Further , he contested , in general terms , the credibility of the witnesses heard by the ORG . He claimed he had lived with the mother of his children until DATE . Following their separation he had moved to his present apartment , which had been in an extremely bad state , not even having the necessary sanitary equipment , and he was thus bound to carry out considerable renovation works .", "On DATE ORG , sitting in camera in the absence of the applicant , partly upheld his appeal . It confirmed the applicant \u2019s maintenance obligations for DATE , but reduced his maintenance obligations for DATE and the first trimester of DATE on the ground that he had been either on sick leave or unemployed during this period and had taken up new employment within a reasonable time . His maintenance obligations , thus , could not be based on the potential income established by the expert , but had to be based on the amount of the social security benefits he actually received . Further , the ORG confirmed the applicant \u2019s maintenance obligations for DATE , but quashed the decision as regards maintenance from DATE and referred the case back to ORG as the applicant had again become unemployed in DATE .", "ORG dismissed the remainder of the applicant \u2019s appeal . It recalled that costs for acquiring and furnishing an apartment had to be taken into account in calculating maintenance obligations , if CARDINAL parent , upon separation , had left the common apartment and its furniture to the other parent and the children . ORG found in particular that , according to the results of the second set of proceedings , the applicant had not acquired his present apartment following his separation from the mother of his children . His father had rented the apartment in DATE , had transferred it to the applicant \u2019s mother in DATE in the course of divorce proceedings and the latter had assigned her rights to the applicant who had the apartment at his disposal at least as of DATE . Costs for the renovation of an apartment which became periodically necessary were , according to the case - law , not deductible from income for the purpose of calculating maintenance obligations . In the present case , the costs for the renovation of the apartment had not been caused exclusively by the applicant \u2019s separation from the mother of his children and by his leaving the common household . As the applicant no longer claimed that he had only acquired the apartment subsequently to this separation , it was not necessary to hear him as regards the costs of renovating the apartment at issue . Moreover , he had presented himself at ORG and had submitted documentary evidence . In connection with the other results of the proceedings , this evidence formed a sufficient basis for the decision .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal on points of law . He complained in particular that ORG had , despite explicit orders of ORG , failed to summon or hear him and that ORG had arbitrarily ignored its earlier decisions when dismissing his appeal .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , finding that it did not raise any important legal issue within the meaning of S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Non LAW ( Ausserstreitgesetz ) .", "In further proceedings , the applicant requested on DATE that his maintenance obligations be reduced retroactively as of DATE to ORG CARDINAL DATE per child . Later , he requested further reductions . He invoked again the costs of renovating his apartment , as well as a change in his financial situation . In a first decision of DATE the ORG fixed the applicant \u2019s maintenance obligations as of DATE . On DATE the ORG changed its decision and reduced the applicant \u2019s maintenance obligations as fixed by the decisions of DATE and DATE for DATE . The amounts fixed for the different periods varied according to the applicant \u2019s financial situation . Further , without giving any specific reasons , the court found that an amount of ORG DATE for renovating the applicant \u2019s apartment had to be deducted from his income when calculating his maintenance obligations . It does not appear from the file whether these proceedings are still pending ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
