{"ITEMID": "001-77008", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "QUARK FISHING LTD. v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , a GPE registered company ( PERCENT owned by island residents and PERCENT owned by NORP interests ) , was represented by PERSON PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "GPE and LOC ( \u201c LOC ) were acquired by the Crown by settlement . There were no indigenous peoples . DATE until DATE it was a British Dependent Territory and a Dependency of GPE . After DATE , PERSON ceased to be a dependency of GPE and became a British Overseas Territory as defined in GPE CARDINAL . GPE is responsible for its international relations . The government of the LAW comprises officials from GPE who are posted to and operate from GPE . There is no democratic mechanism . No one lives on the LAW apart from a transient group of scientists working for ORG .", "The applicant owns a fishing vessel \u2013 MV Jacqueline \u2013 which operated under a GPE flag and was specially equipped with long lines to fish the NORP toothfish , found in the waters of the LOC . Fishing in LOC waters is regulated pursuant to ORG ( \u201c CCAMLR \u201d ) to which GPE is a party . DATE total allowable catches are set by ORG to particular designated blocks of ocean . The coastal ORG countries enforce those limits . In the case of the LAW , the relevant coastal ORG is GPE . From DATE it operated a licensing system which limited the amount of fish caught by each licensed vessel .", "The PERSON was granted a licence for DATE . In DATE the applicant sought a licence as usual but was refused by the SGSSI authorities . It was unaware of the reasons .", "The applicant applied for judicial review of the refusal before ORG of GPE . Evidence was submitted indicating that ORG ( ORG ) had intervened in order to reduce the number of GPE flagged vessels receiving licences in favour of vessels from other coastal GPE to avoid adverse diplomatic repercussions in a sensitive area and had indicated that licences should be given to GPE vessels with the best conservation - compliance record , which in their view excluded the applicant . But for this intervention , the DATE ORG would have given a licence to the applicant . By an order of DATE , the Chief Justice declared that the DATE decision , taken on advice from the ORG and not pursuant to an instruction within the meaning of the SGSSI Order DATE ( SI CARDINAL , which forms the constitution of the territory ) , was not properly based on relevant matters to be taken into account and accordingly was unlawful . He ordered that the application be remitted for fresh consideration .", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG in GPE formally instructed the NORP Commissioner to instruct the SGSSI Director of Fisheries to allocate licences to any GPE flagged vessel , other than to CARDINAL vessels named in the instruction ( which did not include the applicant \u2019s ) .", "The applicant challenged the lawfulness of the instruction in ORG in GPE .", "On DATE the High Court judge found , noting the flawed basis on which the ORG had taken the view that the applicant had not complied with conservation measures , that the criteria on which the licences were granted had not been made clear or transparent and there had been manifest unfairness in the way in which the ORG had issued its instructions to exclude the applicant . The instruction was accordingly unlawful and quashed .", "On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision , making adverse comment on the way the authorities had acted . The applicant had sought damages for the losses from DATE and this claim , stayed during the earlier proceedings , was revived , relying on LAW No . CARDINAL .", "On DATE Mr Justice PERSON struck out the claim for damages , accepting the argument of the Secretary of ORG that Protocol No . CARDINAL had not been extended to the LAW .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal finding that the applicant was unable to bring a claim for damages based on LAW No . CARDINAL because the latter provision had not been extended to the LAW by GPE . It held that the issue of control over territory DATE which had founded the extraterritorial reach of ORG in other circumstances \u2013 was not relevant to a case such as that before it , where a declaration had to be made for the provision in question to apply .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , also finding that LAW No . CARDINAL did not apply to the LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
