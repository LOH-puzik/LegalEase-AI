FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 8;No violation of Art. 14+8", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;N. Valticos;R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG Mr Stjerna is a NORP national and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE he applied to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninhallitus , l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) of PERSON for permission to change his surname ORG ( pronounced \" ORG \" ) to \" Tawaststjerna \" . He maintained that his ancestors had used the proposed name and that he and other members of the ORG family had always felt it an injustice only to bear CARDINAL of the original name . Moreover , the use of his surname gave rise to practical difficulties as it was an old NORP form , was not well known and was difficult to pronounce . This meant that it was frequently misspelt ( as \" PERSON \" , \" S\u00e4\u00e4rna \" , \" Saarna \" , \" Seerna \" , \" ORG \" , \" GPE \" and \" Stjerba \" ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In an opinion of DATE submitted to ORG , ORG on Names ( nimilautakunta , n\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r namn\u00e4renden ) opposed the change . It had not been shown that the proposed name had been used by his ancestors because the ancestor in question , Mr PERSON , had been born out of wedlock . The ancestors cited were too far back to satisfy the requirements of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ( sukunimilaki CARDINAL/CARDINAL , sl\u00e4ktnamnslagen DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the course of an exchange of views with ORG on Names , on DATE the applicant stated that his name had given rise to a pejorative nickname \" kirnu \" in NORP derived from the NORP word \" k\u00e4rna \" ( \" churn \" ) . Moreover , in his view , the remoteness of the ancestors in question could not be a ground for refusing to authorise the name change . Referring to a genealogical report , he disputed the allegation that Mr ORG was not the father of Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG on Names recommended that the applicant \u2019s request be rejected ; it considered the proposed name inappropriate . Although PERSON had cited a telling argument in support of his request - the obscure nature of his name - and was a descendant of a person named GPE , his ancestor , who had died in DATE , was very far back and the suggested name would result in sources of inconvenience similar to his present name .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant told ORG on Names that his mail was delayed as a result of his name being misspelt . In line with the spelling recommended by CARDINAL of its members , he asked for his name to be changed to \" FAC \" ( as opposed to ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , on the basis of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for permission to change his name . It was not satisfied that the proposed name had been used by his ancestors in such a way as to become \" established \" , since the first one to bear his current name had been born out of wedlock . Since the proposed name had been used by ancestors who were very far back , it would not be appropriate to change his name to theirs .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed from ORG decision to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , which , in a judgment of DATE , upheld the ORG \u2019s decision by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL . It observed that it emerged from the written evidence that the applicant \u2019s ancestor , Mr PERSON was born in DATE and had been the illegitimate son of Mr PERSON GPE . For this reason alone the proposed name could not be considered to have been the \" established \" name of the applicant \u2019s ancestors as required by section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . In the light of this and the reasoning given by ORG there was no ground for altering the latter \u2019s decision .", "In the opinion of the minority the name ORG had been the \" established \" name of the applicant \u2019s ancestors . The fact that PERSON , the first of his ancestors to be called ORG , was born out of wedlock was irrelevant . In view of the inconvenience which the present surname was causing the applicant , ORG decision should be quashed and the case referred back to it .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to the Government a NORP surname guide of DATE listed CARDINAL which had fallen out of use and , in addition , CARDINAL names based on common NORP nouns and place names .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW provided that a surname may be changed on the condition that the person concerned could show :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) that the use of his current surname causes inconvenience because of its foreign origin , its meaning in common usage or its common occurrence or for any other reason ;", "( CARDINAL ) that the proposed surname has previously been used by himself or in an established way ( vakiintuneesti , h\u00e4vdvunnen ) by his ancestors and the name change may be considered appropriate ; or", "( CARDINAL ) that a change of surname may be considered justified by changed circumstances or by any other special reasons . \"", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act contained provisions on obstacles of a general character to authorising changes of surname . A new surname was not to be improper or otherwise one the use of which would be manifestly inconvenient . Save in particular circumstances , the new surname should not by virtue of its form or spelling be incompatible with domestic name practice ( paragraph CARDINAL ) ; or be a name very commonly used as a surname ( paragraph CARDINAL ) ; or be commonly used as a NORP name ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "A surname which was well known as the name of a particular NORP or foreign family could not , unless there were particular reasons for doing so , be approved as a new surname ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL .

ORG If ORG , after ORG on Names had given its opinion , found no grounds under sections CARDINAL for refusing to authorise an application for a change of surname , the application was published in ORG ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
