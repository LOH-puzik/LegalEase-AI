GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;John Freeland;N. Valticos;R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , a NORP national born in DATE , worked as a physicist in research institutes whose remuneration and pension system was the same as that of the civil service .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant retired in DATE and receives , in addition to the statutory pension , a supplementary pension ( PERSON ) paid to him by ORG of the Federation and the L\u00e4nder ( ORG und der L\u00e4nder - VBL - \" the ORG \" ) . ORG administers a supplementary old - age pensions scheme , which enables NORP civil servants or persons with an equivalent status to receive a progressive supplementary pension .", "CARDINAL . ORG As the total of the sums paid under the general old - age pensions scheme and the civil service supplementary scheme regularly exceeded the last net civil service salary , ORG and GPE representatives reached an agreement to amend the rules governing the ORG . These amendments , which came into force in DATE , also concerned persons who were already affiliated to the supplementary scheme or in receipt of a pension thereunder .", "On DATE , giving judgment in a series of test cases , ORG ( ORG ) upheld the validity of these amendments .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the ORG calculated the sum payable to the applicant under the amended scheme with the result that his supplementary pension was reduced .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed to ORG ( Schiedsgericht der ORG ) , challenging , inter alia , the legality of the amendments made to the rules governing the scheme .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under an arbitration agreement of CARDINAL and DATE Mr PERSON and the ORG had recognised the jurisdiction of the ORG \u2019s arbitration tribunals .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG On CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON appealed from that decision to ORG of ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG likewise dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal finding that the reduction in his supplementary pension resulting from the amendment of the rules governing the ORG was not unlawful .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal in ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) concerning the amendments to the ORG \u2019s rules made in DATE and DATE . Subsequently he also invoked other grounds .", "On DATE he extended the scope of his appeal to cover the decision of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Sitting as a panel of CARDINAL members , on DATE the Second Section of the First Division ( zweite Kammer des ersten GPE ) of ORG declined to accept the case for adjudication on the ground that the prospects of its succeeding were insufficient .", "ORG noted that the appeal was inadmissible in so far as it raised for the first time issues of fact or of law that could have been pleaded in the ordinary courts . However , it found the remaining complaints admissible , in particular those relating to the unfair character of the proceedings in ORG and the interference with the applicant \u2019s right of property . As ORG had ruled on the issues of fact and law at last instance in its judgments in the test cases of CARDINAL DATE , it was not necessary to file further appeals to exhaust the remedies in the ordinary courts .", "However , even in regard to the complaints declared admissible , ORG considered that the constitutional appeal lacked sufficient prospects of success . It gave the following reasons :", "CARDINAL . ORG There had been no violation of the applicant \u2019s right to be heard in a court ( ORG rechtlichen GPE ) . In particular there was nothing to suggest that the tribunals had not taken due account of evidence concerning the amendment of the ORG \u2019s rules . The decisions were essentially based on CARDINAL reports drawn up by expert commissions in DATE and DATE . It had not been necessary to take additional evidence .", "CARDINAL . ORG Even if it were accepted that pension rights came within the ambit of the constitutional right of property , there was nothing to indicate that there had been an infringement of that right . It was lawful to reduce pension rights by amending the rules which were of a private - law character .", "ORG had held that the pensions under the scheme administered by the ORG were a matter of private law and this view had not been contested by the applicant . ORG had moreover regarded the old - age pensions scheme in question as a collective insurance scheme ( PERSON ) , under which only the employers were considered to be insured , the employees ( ORG ) remaining mere beneficiaries ( ORG ) . Finally , ORG had examined whether the amendment of the ORG \u2019s rules had respected the interests of the employees and the principle of \" good faith \" ( PERSON ) and had taken the view that the measure in question had checked a development that was unacceptable socially and politically and had put an end to a situation that represented a considerable departure from the aims of the supplementary pensions scheme . In its opinion , the amendment of the rules was intended to consolidate all the old - age pensions schemes in order to meet the problems arising from economic and demographical changes and was based on a decision of principle taken by the ORG and GPE representatives .", "ORG concluded its reasoning in the following terms :", "\" This application of the civil law does not infringe any fundamental right . The objective protection afforded by the right of property is not undermined by the classification of the insurance contract as group insurance , in which the employees are mere beneficiaries , or in the assessment of their individual interests . The argument that the public interest , and notably the interest of all employees in the consolidation of their pensions schemes , called for a reform of those schemes is plausible and is in any event not open to criticism from the point of view of constitutional law . The interests of employees regarded as beneficiaries may be adequately protected by the organisations that represent them . In view of the superior interest of all civil service employees in having a sound and affordable pensions scheme , a collective defence of those interests would seem objectively appropriate , as it is the sole means of ensuring the necessary balancing of interests within the group . Whatever the case may be , the objective substance of the right of property does not require additional protection of the individual beneficiary . The same applies to the assessment of the merits of the new rules . This is based on both the principle of proportionality and the need to protect confidence in the preservation of acquired pension rights . \"", "Nor , it added , did the reversal of case - law by ORG , which had previously considered employees to be insured under the rules in question , interfere with the right of property , because case - law had no legislative force and could evolve .", "Finally , ORG observed that the amendment of the ORG \u2019s rules did not breach the principle of equality before the law or that of the freedom of association . The applicant \u2019s doubts as to the impartiality of the arbitrators were not relevant as the latter were not members of the judiciary , but sat on private - law arbitration tribunals .", "CARDINAL . ORG The decision was notified to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE that followed the lodging of the applicant \u2019s appeal in DATE , LAW dealt with CARDINAL cases concerning the compatibility of the new rules of ORG with LAW ) . Other appeals were lodged with it relating , inter alia , to redundancy notices served on employees ( decision of CARDINAL DATE ) , an employer \u2019s right to lock out strikers ( decision of CARDINAL DATE ) and the appeals filed by former civil servants of GPE challenging a provision of the LAW on German ORG which terminated the employment contract of CARDINAL persons ( decision of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
