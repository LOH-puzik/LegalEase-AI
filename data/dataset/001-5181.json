THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and detained in FAC , GPE , GPE . He is represented before the Court by PERSON , a business analyst , of GPE , GPE .", "A.", "The court proceedings", "On DATE , the applicant was convicted of robbing a PERSON of \u00a3 MONEY and possession of firearms . On DATE , he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for the robbery with DATE for possession of firearms , a total of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . He was represented under legal aid by solicitors and Counsel .", "During the trial , the applicant \u2019s counsel was denied sight of CARDINAL intelligence reports from the police and MICARDINAL which were presented to the judge by the prosecution . Counsel for the applicant applied for sight of the reports . This was denied by the trial judge who stated that the named informants were contained therein and invoked ORG . During the jury deliberations , following consultation with defence counsel who proposed amendments to the written direction , the judge directed the jury that on the evidence it was possible to find that the applicant was the driver of the getaway car , rather than as originally submitted by the prosecution , driver of the car used in the robbery . Counsel did not apply for the introduction of a lesser charge of accessory after the fact . The jury convicted the applicant , rejecting his defence of duress which was raised at trial .", "The applicant appealed against conviction with leave from a single judge of ORG . He claimed , firstly , that the judge introduced a new basis for convicting him ( that he was driving a getaway car rather than the vehicle used in the robbery ) at a late stage , namely during jury deliberations , which his counsel did not have a chance to address . Secondly , the judge \u2019s directions as to knowledge and participation in the robbery were muddled and inadequate in that the directions may have left the jury with the impression that it was open to convict the applicant as a principal even if all he did was to assist those who had committed a robbery to avoid apprehension and had no part in the planning and execution of the robbery .", "In DATE , the applicant made an out of time application to ORG for leave to appeal . In DATE , ORG refused leave to appeal to ORG . The applicant states he did not receive confirmation in writing of this decision until DATE .", "Conditions of imprisonment", "The applicant was held on remand for DATE and moved to CARDINAL prisons and for DATE he was held in a segregation unit .

According to him , Category A prisoners would also be executed in the event of a nuclear strike on GPE .", "He complains that he received delayed medical treatment for a suspected heart condition . He was taken to a local hospital for an appointment but because the consultant was not there he was taken back to prison without seeing him due to the potential security risk . The visit was rescheduled and took place DATE . No heart problem was found . The applicant was advised by his solicitor that there was no prospect of obtaining legal aid to pursue a case relating to the delay in seeing a cardiologist .", "The applicant was transported to ORG in DATE in an unheated van , locked in a metal cell in the rear of the van , wearing thin clothing with no food , water or toilet breaks for TIME . In DATE , his complaint to ORG was upheld who recommended the setting up of guidelines for the transfer of Category A prisoners . No proceedings were issued by the applicant against ORG .", "The applicant states that the security classification of Category A prisoners should be reviewed DATE . He has only had CARDINAL review of his Category A status in DATE since he was first held on remand and DATE after his conviction . He has had no review since . The result of the review security category status was sent to the prison governor in a letter dated DATE but the applicant says it was not communicated to him in writing until DATE . It was decided that he should remain a Category A prisoner . On DATE , the applicant wrote to ask why he had only had CARDINAL review and when his next review would take place but has not received a response nor pursued the matter further .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Disclosure of evidence to the Defence", "NORP v. Ward [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL . This case dealt with the question of what duties the prosecution has to disclose evidence to the defence . It laid down the proper procedure to be followed when the prosecution claims that certain material is the subject of public interest immunity . ORG held that it was the court , and not the prosecution , who would undertake the balancing exercise between the interests of public interest immunity and fairness to the party claiming disclosure .", "R v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON . ORG stated that that balancing exercise could only be performed by the trial judge himself examining or viewing the evidence , so as to have the facts of what it contains in mind ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
