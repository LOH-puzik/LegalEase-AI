NORP In DATE the first applicant concluded a DATE military service contract with ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE its housing commission allocated him a studio in a residence hall for students and employees of ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , located on FAC in GPE , and the applicants moved into this accommodation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant concluded another DATE military service contract .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the ORG daughter was born .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant rescinded his contract with ORG and resigned from military service , citing family circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was employed as a salesman by PERSON , a private company .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date and for unknown reasons the first applicant registered himself as a temporary resident at an address on P. Street in GPE . However , according to the applicants\u2019 submissions , the family continued to live in and pay charges for the Z. Street studio , which they had renovated and modernised at their own expense .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG instituted proceedings in ORG in GPE , seeking to evict the applicants\u2019 family from the Z. Street accommodation . Relying on Article CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the plaintiffs argued that because the first applicant had resigned from military service , he and his family were obliged to vacate the accommodation , which had been provided to them on a temporary basis in connection with the first applicant \u2019s military service .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , the applicants alleged that the first applicant had been \u201c cantoned \u201d or quartered in the disputed accommodation as a military serviceman , a fact which triggered a special duty on the part of the ORG to keep providing him with housing upon his resignation from the armed forces . Article CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of LAW , which concerned accommodation for DATE and temporary employees , did not apply in their case . They also noted that the first applicant had a dependent wife and young child , and that the family had no other accommodation in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing oral submissions of all interested parties and having examined the written evidence presented , the court ruled for the plaintiffs . It found that the disputed accommodation had been provided to the applicants on a temporary basis , as a privilege in connection with the first applicant \u2019s military service . Since it had been his decision to terminate the contract early , there was no right to keep the accommodation or any duty of the ORG to provide other accommodation under the applicable law . Article CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of LAW was therefore applicable and the applicants\u2019 family was legally obliged to vacate the Z. Street accommodation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . No copy has been provided to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , following a hearing attended by representatives of ORG but not by the first applicant . The court held , in particular , that his service contract had contained no clauses obliging the Ministry to provide him with housing during his service . The fact that he had been provided with temporary accommodation at the ORG \u2019s discretion did not mean that the ORG had a duty to accommodate him or his family after termination of the contract .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , ORG did not notify them of the date and time of the hearing of DATE . They further stated that on CARDINAL occasions \u2013 in DATE and sometime in DATE ( the applicants could not recall the exact dates ) \u2013 the first applicant had visited the ORG to enquire about the status of the proceedings , but did not receive any meaningful response .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , on DATE they were evicted from the Z. Street accommodation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG \u0432\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a GPE ) published the new ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the DATE Code \u201d ) , which was adopted on DATE and entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the first applicant lodged written complaints with the President of ORG concerning the delay in examining his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy President of ORG informed him that his case had already been decided and that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had been upheld .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the first applicant wrote to ORG with a request to be provided with a copy of the decision taken on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants received a copy of that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a request with ORG of GPE for leave to appeal in cassation out of time against the rulings of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE , on the grounds that they had not been notified of the latter ruling until DATE . They argued , in particular , that ORG had failed , in breach of the requirements of the applicable law , to notify them of the date and time of the appeal hearing and the decision taken in their case . They had hence been deprived of their statutory right to attend the appeal hearing and to lodge a cassation appeal within the statutory time - limit . They also argued that the lower courts had erred in their assessment of the facts and application of the law in their case . In particular , since the first applicant had resigned from military service in connection with family circumstances , his situation fell within the ambit of paragraph CARDINAL , not paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL of LAW . Accordingly , his family could only be evicted from the accommodation reserved for military personnel if they had been provided with other comparable accommodation . The applicants also relied on LAW of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as the basis for their entitlement to permanent accommodation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG request for leave to appeal out of time , noting that , in accordance with LAW of LAW such leave could only be granted within DATE of pronouncement of the decision subject to appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
