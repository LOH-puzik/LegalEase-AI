The record of the search and seizure , which contained a signature appearing to be that of the applicant , indicated that he had admitted having bought those drugs for his own use . However , once the drug seizure was documented , the applicant cut his neck with his key - ring as an indication of protest . The police called an ambulance , which documented the injury as being of a minor nature and provided the applicant with the required aid .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was placed under DATE administrative detention pending clarification of all the circumstances of the supposed drug offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was delivered to ORG ( \u00ab \u0420\u041e\u0412\u0414 \u043c. \u0404\u0432\u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f DATE ) , where , according to the applicant , police officer NORP beat him severely .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , NORP asked him not to raise any complaints in exchange for a promise that the police would turn a blind eye to any future misdemeanours from his side . The applicant accepted this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was delivered to ORG , where he was placed in a cell shared by CARDINAL inmates . According to the registration journal , he arrived there without any visible bodily injuries . During DATE of his detention he did not request or receive any medical assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he complained to a traumatologist in the GPE hospital that he was suffering from pain in the chest and was prescribed some antibacterial medication .", "CARDINAL . Having repeatedly sought medical assistance for continuous pain , on DATE the applicant was diagnosed with post - traumatic intercostal neuralgia and painful hypodermic indurations from both sides of the rib cage . He told the doctor that he had accidentally fallen down some stairs on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was hospitalised with the following diagnoses : right - lung pneumonia concentrated in the inferior lobe , fracture of CARDINAL of the breastbone and closed fracture of the seventh rib on the right side . He underwent treatment as an in - patient until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG ( \u201c the FAC \u201d ) that on DATE he had been beaten up by police officer NORP , as a result of which he had several rib fractures . He explained the delay in bringing that complaint by the alleged agreement with NORP ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which he considered to have been breached .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hospital where the applicant had been treated submitted all the related medical documentation ( namely the X - ray films , the medical history sheet and other medical records ) to the GPE Deputy Prosecutor at the latter 's request . As it would be later admitted in the course of the investigation , the content of those documents was never reflected in the investigation paperwork .", "CARDINAL . Overall , in the period from DATE ORG refused CARDINAL times to open a criminal case against NORP on the basis of the applicant 's complaints . All those refusals were subsequently quashed by ORG or by ORG as unlawful , premature or groundless .", "CARDINAL . The major investigative steps taken and the omissions indicated by the higher - level prosecution authorities were as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG questioned police officer NORP and the investigator dealing with the applicant 's own criminal case , who denied the alleged ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ambulance doctors who had provided the applicant with medical aid on account of the cut to his throat on DATE were questioned and noted that he had not raised any illtreatment allegations , whereas the cut itself had been an insignificant injury . The therapist who had hospitalised the applicant in DATE was also questioned , but could not remember any details .", "CARDINAL . At about the same time it was found out that the medical documentation seized earlier from the hospital was missing .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG criticised his lower - level colleague for not having questioned the applicant and his family members . Among the other omissions he pointed out the failure to conduct a medical forensic examination of the applicant with a view to establishing the nature , date and gravity of the injuries complained of .", "CARDINAL . That criticism was repeated in DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a forensic medical examination was conducted to clarify which of the applicant 's versions concerning the date and origin of his injuries \u2013 from the alleged beatings on DATE or from the accidental fall on DATE was more plausible . The examination was limited to an analysis of the few medical documents which were available and concluded that both dates were possible for the applicant 's injuries at issue , whereas their nature and origin could not be established in the absence of the X - ray films of the material time , as well as the other essential medical documentation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the attested witnesses present at the applicant 's arrest on DATE stated that they had not witnessed any illtreatment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's mother , who was questioned in DATE , stated that after his release on DATE the applicant had complained that he had been beaten by the police and of pain in the chest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instructed the investigator , inter alia , to find the applicant 's medical documentation and to question the inmates with whom he had been sharing a cell in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE efforts were taken to find the applicant 's cellmates . The whereabouts CARDINAL of them were established . CARDINAL inmates did not remember the applicant complaining of ill - treatment or being in need of medical aid , whereas the fourth one mentioned that the applicant had complained to him that he had been beaten by the police without giving any further details .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG criticised the investigator for not having undertaken an inquiry in respect of the loss of the applicant 's medical documents . In DATE such an inquiry was held , but to no avail . The GPE Deputy Prosecutor stated that he had handed the documents to his superior , who had retired in DATE and whose current place of residence was unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another forensic medical examination was held . It confirmed the conclusions of the earlier CARDINAL , also referring to the absence of the X - ray films as an impediment to more specific conclusions .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was questioned for the first time in the framework of the investigation of his allegation of ill - treatment . The administration of the prison where he was serving his sentence at the time questioned him at the investigator 's request . According to the investigation documents , he stated that he had earlier explained his injuries by an accidental fall because he did not want to bring the police officer to criminal liability , without giving any further details .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was X - rayed , as a result of which a consolidated fracture of CARDINAL rib was confirmed . The film was lost in the course of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG noted that the investigation had fallen short of meeting any of its or ORG earlier instructions , given on TIME occasions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third forensic medical examination was held . This time it was based on a visual examination of the applicant and took place in the prison where he was serving his sentence . As the X - ray films both of DATE and of DATE remained missing and the ORG machine in the prison was not operational , the expert made a general conclusion that the applicant might have had his rib broken in DATE . In any event , it appeared impossible to clearly establish the date , nature and origin of his injuries given the considerable lapse of time . The report contained a general observation that , as a rule , establishing the precise time of a fracture was possible only within DATE after it had taken place , as later consolidated fractures appear the same .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued the fourteenth and last decision on the refusal to open criminal proceedings against police officer NORP on the basis of the applicant 's complaints . It noted that all possible investigative measures had been taken , but had failed to yield any substantiation of the applicant 's allegations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE respectively ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and ORG upheld the above ruling . The reasoning of the CARDINAL courts was confined to a finding that the requirements of LAW had been fulfilled , with no facts established in proof of the applicant 's allegation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE and DATE respectively , ORG , ORG and ORG found the applicant guilty of possession of illegal drugs and theft and sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested ( with the reasons for the delay before his arrest being unclear ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of some CARDINAL counts of theft committed during DATE and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The final sentence under both verdicts \u2013 of DATE and of CARDINAL DATE was set at DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the charge of the drug offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal as related to another verdict ( of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
