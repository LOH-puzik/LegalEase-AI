Mr. PERSON , a NORP national born in DATE , is currently living in GPE ; he was resident in GPE from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE in DATE and was engaged by the firm of ORG at ORG . He stayed there for DATE . Subsequently , he had a succession of different occupations : mechanic in another firm at ORG , manager of a restaurant , independent insurance and building - loans broker . The last - mentioned activity , which consisted of negotiating and concluding , for example , life - insurance and savings contracts with NORP workers , provided him , as he himself stated , with a very good DATE income .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) imposed on him a suspended sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for an offence against LAW ( Betaeubungsmittelgesetz ) . ORG ( Landgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE .", "These proceedings are not here in issue .", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings to which the present case relates began in DATE .", "Mr. PERSON was arrested on DATE on suspicion of having committed a further offence against LAW ; on DATE , he was granted the assistance of an officially appointed lawyer , namely Mr. PERSON , of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The trial opened before ORG on DATE and continued on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE . The applicant was defended by Mr. PERSON and , at certain TIME , by Mr. PERSON , a member of the same firm .", "On DATE , the court sentenced Mr. PERSON to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for an offence against LAW and for tax evasion ( Steuerhinterziehung ) : it was found to be proved that in DATE the accused had illegally imported into GPE QUANTITY of cannabis resin of NORP origin , hidden in his car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON filed an appeal on points of law ( Revision ) . In his memorial of DATE , setting out the grounds of appeal , he relied , inter alia , on LAW , which provides that several accused persons may not be defended by one and the same lawyer ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Mr. PERSON explained that he had previously represented another person who on the occasion in question had , according to ORG findings , been Mr. PERSON \u2019s accomplice .", "Mr. PERSON was released on DATE and returned to GPE .", "On DATE , the Federal public prosecutor ( ORG ) moved that the appeal be held inadmissible on the ground that it had been filed by a defence counsel who , on his own admission , was not entitled to represent the applicant .", "On DATE , Mr. PERSON applied for leave to proceed out of time ( Wiedereinsetzung in den vorigen Stand ) in order to lodge a fresh appeal , which appeal he in fact filed at the same moment . On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) allowed the application ; it had first sought the opinion of the public prosecutor who , without giving reasons , had indicated that he was in favour of such a course .", "On DATE , ORG granted Mr. PERSON \u2019s request of DATE to be appointed official defence counsel to file the memorial setting out the grounds of appeal ; DATE it relieved Mr. PERSON of his duties .", "CARDINAL . In his memorial of DATE , which was CARDINAL pages in length , Mr. PERSON complained solely of procedural errors ( PERSON ) . He listed CARDINAL , most of which concerned decisions of ORG refusing to appoint an expert or to summon , question or have questions put to witnesses . The last of the alleged errors related to LAW : recalling that Mr. PERSON had previously defended another person whom ORG had convicted , on DATE , as an accomplice of Mr. PERSON , Mr. PERSON maintained that this recourse to a common defence counsel had been contrary to the interests of both accused ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In its observations in reply ( ORG ) of DATE , the public prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG submitted that the appeal was inadmissible . It considered that Article CARDINAL prevented Mr. PERSON , just as it did Mr. PERSON , from acting in the case as officially appointed lawyer . Mr. PERSON replied on DATE . He pointed out , amongst other things , that since he had never defended Mr. PERSON \u2019s accomplice , Article CARDINAL did not apply to him .", "On DATE , the Federal public prosecutor invited the above - mentioned office to comment on the complaints that had been made ; in his view , it was at least doubtful whether the appeal was inadmissible de plano .", "On DATE , the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office filed its supplementary observations ( weitere Gegenerklaerung ) , dated DATE ; it sent a copy to Mr. PERSON . In accordance with the practice in such matters ( Instruction no . CARDINAL of the Instructions on Criminal Procedure and Administrative Fines Procedure - Richtlinien f\u00fcr das PERSON ) , the observations reproduced for each complaint the relevant documents in the case - file , in particular the requests made by the applicant \u2019s lawyer during the trial and the decisions taken by ORG thereon . As regards LAW , the public prosecutor \u2019s office referred to its earlier observations , including those of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On application by the Federal public prosecutor \u2019s office , ORG decided on DATE to hold a hearing ( ORG ) on DATE . Mr. PERSON and his client , who had returned to GPE , were notified of this on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON applied to be officially appointed as the applicant \u2019s lawyer for the hearing of DATE .", "The President of ORG ( Strafsenat ) of ORG refused the application on DATE . In his view , an accused ( Angeklagter ) who was at liberty was not entitled to such an appointment for hearings in an appeal on a point of law ; there was no legal requirement at that stage for him either to appear in person or to be represented by a lawyer ( LAW paras . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As regards compliance with procedural rules ( verfahrensrechtlich ) , an appeal court ( GPE ) would examine the impugned decision on the basis of the written grounds of appeal ; as regards any substantive complaints ( bei sachlichrechtlicher Beanstandung ) , it would affect of its own motion a review that was not subject to any limitations . Furthermore , on this occasion neither the facts of the case nor the legal issues it raised justified the appointment requested .", "In the objections ( Gegenvorstellungen ) he raised on DATE , Mr. PERSON cited a judgment of DATE of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , holding that , in addition to the cases provided for by law , legal aid had to be granted for hearings in appeals on a point of law in \" serious \" ( \" schwerwiegend \" ) cases if the person concerned was unable to pay a lawyer of his own choosing . And , he submitted , Mr. PERSON was in such a situation , for a final conviction would lead to his expulsion . Mr. PERSON asked ORG to indicate whether he should supply particulars of the applicant \u2019s assets in order to substantiate ( glaubhaft machen ) the latter \u2019s lack of means . According to Mr. PERSON , Mr. PERSON was obviously ( offensichtlich ) not in a position to pay a lawyer . He had come to GPE as a migrant worker and had returned to GPE after spending a long ( laengeren ) period in GPE prison . It was evident that he had no savings .", "Mr. PERSON requested that , if need be , the matter be referred to the ORG for decision .", "On DATE , the President of ORG confirmed his decision of DATE refusing the application ; he took the view that the above - mentioned judgment of DATE did not concern a case that was comparable to the applicant \u2019s .", "CARDINAL . The hearing was held on DATE , in the absence of the applicant and of Mr. PERSON . According to the minutes , ORG heard the judge acting as rapporteur and then the submissions ( Ausfuhrungen ) of an official of the Federal public prosecutor \u2019s office ( Bundesanwaltschaft ) in favour of rejecting the appeal . After deliberating in private , the court gave on the same day judgment dismissing the appeal .", "The judgment held firstly that the appeal was admissible : Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not prevent Mr. PERSON from representing Mr. PERSON before ORG . On the other hand , that Article had not been complied with at first instance since Mr. PERSON had previously defended the applicant \u2019s accomplice . However , ORG , referring to a judgment of its ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , added that an appeal on a point of law based on that Article could succeed only if the representation of several accused by CARDINAL and the same lawyer proved to be really defence . And on this occasion it had not been established that there was any conflict of interests .", "ORG then rejected the remainder of the complaints : some were examined in detail and held to be without foundation and the others were considered more briefly and held to be manifestly ill - founded .", "The judgment , which was CARDINAL pages in length , was served on Mr. PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , Mr. PERSON lodged an appeal with ORG . Alleging a violation of ORG , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW , he repeated the submissions made by his colleague Mr. PERSON before ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He argued that it was only through a defence counsel that Mr. PERSON could have availed himself of his right to be heard : he lived in GPE , lacked financial resources and had an insufficient command of NORP . In addition , the legal issues involved were particularly complex , as was shown by the length of the memorial setting out the grounds of appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and ORG decision to hold a hearing . Mr. PERSON should therefore have been given the opportunity of stating his views on the submissions of the Federal public prosecutor \u2019s office . Again , the consequences of an unfavourable judgment would have been such as to make the official appointment of a lawyer essential : for the applicant , dismissal of the appeal meant his undoing in GPE and the breakdown of his marriage and family life .", "Mr. PERSON , who requested that legal aid be granted to the applicant , asked ORG to indicate whether he should supply particulars of his client \u2019s assets in order to substantiate ( glaubhaft machen ) the latter \u2019s lack of means .", "In a ruling given on DATE by a panel of CARDINAL judges , ORG decided not to hear the appeal on the ground that it did not offer sufficient prospects of success . ORG found nothing arbitrary in the decision of the President of ORG . Moreover , the case was not \" serious \" , within the meaning of the above - mentioned judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . Finally , Mr. PERSON could have remained in GPE and attended the hearing before ORG , if need be with the assistance of an interpreter .", "CARDINAL . After his arrest on DATE , Mr. PERSON had remained in custody until DATE , partly in detention on remand and partly to serve sentences that had been imposed on him .", "CARDINAL . If the accused has not chosen a defence counsel , the trial court will appoint CARDINAL in the following cases ( listed in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) :", "- the trial at first instance is before ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) or ORG ;", "- the accused is charged with an indictable offence ( PERSON ) ;", "- the proceedings may result in the accused \u2019s being prohibited from exercising a profession ;", "- the accused is deaf or dumb ;", "- the accused has been interned for DATE by order or with the approval of a court and has not been released DATE before the opening of the trial ;", "- the question arises whether the accused should be detained for mental examination ;", "- the case concerns preventive detention proceedings ( PERSON ) ;", "- a decision has been taken prohibiting the previous defence counsel from taking part in the proceedings .", "An appointment will also be made in other cases , either by the court of its own motion or at the accused \u2019s request , if such a step appears necessary on account of the seriousness of the act in question , the factual or legal complexity of the case , or if it is obvious that the accused can not conduct his own defence ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The official appointment of a lawyer by the trial court covers not only the proceedings before that court but also the written stage of any appeal on a point of law . If necessary , the trial court will make a special appointment for the latter stage .", "CARDINAL . An accused ( ORG ) who is in custody does not have an enforceable right to attend hearings in an appeal on a point of law - whether before the appeal court or ORG ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Judicial Code - Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz ) - , but he may be represented thereat by a lawyer ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) . If he has not chosen a lawyer and is not brought to the hearing , the President of the court having jurisdiction will appoint CARDINAL for him if he so requests ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) .", "An accused who is at liberty may appear in person or be represented by a lawyer at the appeal hearing ( LAW para . CARDINAL ) . According to the case - law of ORG , defence counsel can be assigned to him only under LAW para . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , since Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL does not apply to hearings in an appeal on a point of law ( ORG in PERSON , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "Furthermore , ORG has held that defence counsel is to be appointed by the court of its own motion and at the expense of the ORG in serious cases ( schwerwiegende GPE ) if the accused can not pay for a lawyer of his own choosing ( PERSON , vol . DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The court concerned may dispose of an appeal on a point of law without hearings in the following cases only :", "- where it finds the appeal inadmissible ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) ;", "- where , on a reasoned application by the public prosecutor \u2019s office , the court considers unanimously that the appeal is manifestly ill - founded ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) ; and", "- where the court finds unanimously that an appeal filed in the interests of the accused is well - founded ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) .", "In all other cases the court has to hold a hearing before taking its decision ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) ; before ORG , there are hearings in CARDINAL per cent of the appeals on points of law lodged in criminal cases .", "When the public prosecutor \u2019s office applies for an appeal to be rejected as manifestly ill - founded , it has to communicate its submissions and the reasons to the appellant ; the latter may file a reply within DATE ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL requires that the accused and his lawyer be informed of the date and place of the hearing ; if it is not possible to contact the former , notification to the latter is sufficient .", "CARDINAL . Appeal hearings open with the rapporteur \u2019s address ; this is followed by the statements and submissions of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , the accused and his defence counsel . The appellant is heard first and the last address to the court is always made by the accused ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the former version of LAW , which was in force until DATE , several accused could be represented by a single counsel if this was not contrary to the interests of the defence . As it was often difficult for courts to detect or establish such conflicts of interests , Article CARDINAL was modified in DATE : the new text , which has been applicable since DATE , does not allow several accused to be defended by a common defence counsel .", "However , ORG ( ORG ) held on DATE and CARDINAL DATE that an appeal on a point of law based on a violation of LAW could succeed only if recourse to a common defence counsel was in fact contrary to the interests of the defence ( ORG in PERSON , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . ORG followed these precedents in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the present case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The Government stated that this interpretation has since been accepted by all FAC of ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
