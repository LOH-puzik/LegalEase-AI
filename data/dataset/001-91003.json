The applicant was born in DATE and is serving a sentence of imprisonment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was apprehended by police officers N and O. According to him , they beat him up and some bystanders , who did not realise that he was being beaten up by police officers , called the police . According to a letter dated DATE , produced by the Government , ORG of the ORG informed the applicant \u2019s representative that on DATE there had been no call for police assistance in the area where the applicant had been apprehended .", "CARDINAL . After his arrest the applicant was taken to hospital where a doctor diagnosed him with \u201c an injury ; a bruise on the left shin ; an injury on the left shoulder . \u201d The applicant was then brought to a police station and stayed there for DATE on suspicion of drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained to the prosecutor about the police brutality . As follows from a copy of the decision dated DATE , submitted by the Government , ORG refused to initiate criminal proceedings against officers N and O. It found that the applicant had resisted lawful arrest by swinging his hands and otherwise trying to escape . Thus , the officers had had to handcuff him . The investigator in charge of the applicant \u2019s criminal case at the material time affirmed that the applicant had not alerted her to any unjustified recourse to force against him . Apparently , the applicant was not apprised of the decision of CARDINAL DATE . According to the Government , that decision was quashed in DATE and a further inquiry was ordered . The outcome of that inquiry remains unclear .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also raised the ill - treatment matter at the trial ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

At the trial the applicant pleaded that he had spent DATE on DATE at home . On DATE had called him , but being short of time he had arranged to meet her DATE . It appears that the police monitored that conversation on the second handset . According to the applicant , on DATE in the course of his meeting with PERSON , he was approached by police officers who forcibly pinned him to the ground , handcuffed him and beat him up .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the trial court to call PERSON , Mr S and Mr R , who could , he alleged , confirm that \u201c he had been at home DATE on DATE and that he had not met PERSON on that day \u201d . The court rejected that application as premature . The applicant reiterated the request at a hearing on DATE and also asked to call PERSON , his aunt , who had allegedly been at home with him on DATE . The court rejected both applications as \u201c premature and unfounded \u201d . At the hearing on DATE the applicant \u2019s lay representative again requested to call PERSON , PERSON and another unspecified person ( apparently Mr R ) , and PERSON can be seen from the hearing record , the court decided that \u201c it was unnecessary to examine those persons \u201d . Thereafter , the applicant unsuccessfully asked to have included in the file written statements made by PERSON , PERSON and a Ms Y confirming the applicant \u2019s alibi for DATE . The prosecution did not object to the above applications made by the defence .", "CARDINAL .

The request was dismissed by the trial court . According to the Government , PERSON . was mentioned in the list of persons to be called to testify at the trial but she did not appear at the trial .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the ORG of GPE found the applicant guilty of unlawfully procuring and being in possession of drugs with the intention of selling them and of selling a large supply of drugs .

PERSON claimed that she had just bought the drugs from the applicant and offered to assist the officers in the applicant \u2019s arrest . She called the applicant on the telephone and asked for drugs . The applicant agreed and fixed a meeting for DATE . The police arrested the applicant at that meeting , performed a search on his person and seized a large quantity of drugs ;", "ii ) the deposition by PERSON made during the pre - trial investigation in which she confirmed the statements made by the officers . In her oral testimony at the trial PERSON retracted her earlier deposition ;", "iii ) the statements by eyewitnesses who were present during the applicant \u2019s arrest and search on DATE and who testified that a large quantity of drugs had been seized from the applicant ;", "iv ) the depositions by an attesting witness , PERSON , who was present at the arrest of PERSON on DATE .

The applicant appealed against the trial judgment arguing inter alia in his additional statement of appeal as follows :", "\u201c [ T]he court arbitrarily refused the defence \u2019s application to examine as witnesses PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and QUANTITY other persons who could confirm [ the applicant \u2019s ] alibi , namely the fact of his presence at home TIME on DATE . That refutes his involvement in the offences of which he has been charged by the prosecution on the basis of PERSON pre - trial statement made under duress ... No other evidence of the applicant \u2019s guilt has been adduced ... \u201d", "On DATE ORG upheld the trial judgment . It did not address the trial court \u2019s refusal to hear witnesses on the applicant \u2019s behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG , sitting as a supervisory - review court , reduced the applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE imprisonment . On DATE ORG of GPE examined an application by the applicant for supervisory review .
