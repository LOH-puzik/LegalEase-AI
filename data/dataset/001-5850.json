MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON PERSON , CARDINAL lawyers practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant took part in ORG of GPE . He was a candidate of the GPE labour party .", "In his electoral district , the quota for election was CARDINAL votes . The applicant obtained CARDINAL first preference votes , and was therefore not elected . After the fifteenth count of votes , the applicant had CARDINAL votes . At the sixteenth count of votes , ORG declared elected another candidate , PERSON , with a count of CARDINAL votes .", "On an unspecified date , the applicant instituted proceedings before FAC . He alleged that according to the relevant provisions of LAW of DATE , he should have been declared \u201c eliminated \u201d at the sixteenth count of votes . Under NORP law , the consequence of the \u201c elimination \u201d of a candidate is that another candidate could benefit from the preferences given to him , and that the votes of that candidate should in a subsequent Causal Election be re - transferred to the first candidate . The applicant observed that had his elimination taken place , he would have benefited from the votes of PERSON He therefore requested ORG to order the correction of the electoral results with all consequences .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . It held that it had jurisdiction to consider the merits of the case , which concerned a matter of interpretation of the electoral law . However , it observed that according to LAW , when CARDINAL candidates remain after the elimination of the others , no transfer of votes should occur and the candidate having more votes is elected , without a quota . As this provision should be applied notwithstanding any other provision of the same LAW , ORG concluded that ORG had correctly applied the law and given a proper interpretation of LAW .", "The applicant lodged an appeal before ORG . He alleged , in particular , that LAW was not applicable in his case , which did not concern the election of a candidate , but the procedure before the declaration that a candidate was elected .", "ORG lodged an incidental appeal , requesting ORG to declare that the applicant had failed to comply with the procedure prescribed by law to contest the results of the election .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG accepted ORG incidental appeal . It observed that according to LAW , \u201c if any question shall arise in relation to any transfer of votes , the decision of the [ Electoral ] Commission ... shall be final unless an objection is made in writing by any candidate or agent before the declaration of the poll ... \u201d . ORG had held that this provision was not applicable , as it referred to a transfer of votes that had been made , while the applicant was complaining about a transfer which had not been made . However , ORG could not subscribe to this opinion , as LAW regulated any question about transfer of votes and made no distinction between votes which had already been transferred and votes which had not been transferred . LAW was thus applicable to the present case . As it was not disputed that the applicant failed to contest in writing the decision and performance of ORG , it was clear that he had side - stepped an essential and statutory - established procedure , with the consequence that ORG could not take the matter into consideration .", "In the meanwhile , the applicant had submitted his candidature to the so - called ORG . This expression indicates the elections to ORG consequent to the vacancy of electoral seats by candidates which , having been elected in CARDINAL electoral districts , should retain CARDINAL seat and vacate the other .", "ORG took place on DATE . The applicant was not elected .", "He subsequently filed an electoral petition before ORG , challenging once again the procedure followed by ORG . He reiterated the objections concerning ORG raised before ORG and alleged that contrary to the relevant internal provisions , ORG failed to take into account , at the beginning of the counting , the votes he had obtained during ORG DATE . The applicant moreover stressed that he had been discriminated vis - \u00e0 - vis the candidates who , having been eliminated in ORG , had re - acquired the first preferences they had passed on to the elected candidate PERSON", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s plea . Interpreting the relevant national regulations , it concluded that the first count of votes in ORG was a process completely independent from ORG . As concerned the discrimination alleged by the applicant , ORG observed that the difference in treatment was justified by the fact that the candidates who were eliminated in ORG , and therefore could re - acquire the preferences they had passed over to PERSON , had contributed to the election of the latter , who subsequently vacated his post . As the applicant had not been eliminated in ORG , he had not contributed to the election of PERSON"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
