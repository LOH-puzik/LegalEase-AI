The purchase agreement categorised the land as forest .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a registration certificate was issued for the plot of land . It categorised the land as forest and determined special conditions on use of the plot , namely , that restrictions applied to the use of the whole plot and that there were surface water protection zones .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the first applicant asked FAC to establish as a legal fact that there used to be some buildings on the ORG plot . On DATE the ORG established as a legal fact that there used to be some buildings ( a cattle shed and a storehouse ( galvid\u0117 ir klojimas ) there . The court noted that the first applicant was the owner of a plot of forest land on which construction of new buildings was prohibited , unless it was a reconstruction of a former residential property . The court found that a former residential property had been situated outside the boundaries of the first applicant \u2019s plot but held that if the requested legal fact was established , he would be able to reconstruct the buildings previously sited there ( nusta\u010dius pra\u0161om\u0105 fakt\u0105 , parei\u0161k\u0117jas \u012fgis teis\u0119 atstatyti jo valdomame \u017eem\u0117s sklype buvusius statinius ) . A representative from the LOC environmental protection department of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the PERSON environmental protection department \u201d ) had no objections to the establishment of the legal fact .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant asked the authorities to issue him with the relevant documents necessary for construction . The PERSON environmental protection department stated that the construction of a building had to comply with ORG ; the existing flora had to be preserved and the method of waste collection had to be decided on . The permanent committee on construction of LOC verified the documents submitted by the first applicant and recommended that he be issued with a building permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LOC issued the first applicant with the documents necessary for construction , in accordance with the domestic regulations , in particular with ORG no . DATE ( see paragraph DATE below ) . It was indicated that anyone intending to carry out construction work was required to preserve existing flora , and was not allowed to block the shore of the lake or interfere with the existing landscape .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE issued the first applicant with a permit to build a DATE house ( non - residential building ) . The permit was valid for DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the plan of the building was specified ( the facades were modified ) and the amendments were verified by the PERSON environmental protection department .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG issued a certificate about the DATE house PERCENT finished and following that , on DATE the house was registered in ORG ) as PERCENT finished .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG received a report via a hotline for allegedly illegal construction work . On DATE the authorities estimated the distance between the house and the lake at QUANTITY , and between the terrace of the house and the lake at QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office started court proceedings and asked the domestic courts to revoke the recommendation to grant the first applicant building permission ; to annul the building permit and oblige the applicants to demolish the building at the expense of the established guilty parties , that is the applicants , LOC , and the PERSON environmental protection department . The prosecutor claimed that the building permit could not have been issued in accordance with the relevant provisions of domestic law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the prosecutor \u2019s complaint , holding that the legal facts had been established in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It had not been until DATE that ORG had held that the sole fact that the storehouses had been sited on a specific plot of land , without any proof that a residential building had been sited there , did not mean that there had previously been a residential property there ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG further held that in accordance with relevant legislation in force at the time , it was possible to construct new residential buildings in the place of former buildings , as well as to reconstruct existing residential buildings and construct necessary storehouses ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Moreover , it had been established that any construction work in the forest could only be started after having received building permission and in accordance with the relevant plans . That legislation had been repealed after ORG had declared that the domestic regulations were in breach of the laws and , by extension , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court thus held that the case - law on construction in the forest had been established after the building permit had been issued to the first applicant . The court further held that the applicants had built the building lawfully , there was no evidence as to any negative consequences of the construction for the environment or the public interest . The court also observed that in the applicants\u2019 case it would be unreasonable and unjust to apply the measure established in LAW to oblige the applicants to demolish the buildings ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Moreover , the court was not convinced that the environment would be restored to its previous state if the buildings were demolished because the demolition would also cause some environmental damage .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor appealed . On DATE ORG allowed the prosecutor \u2019s appeal . The court held that LOC had established as a legal fact that there used to be a cattle shed and a storehouse on the applicants\u2019 plot of land ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . A DATE house could not be constructed as it did not fall within the category of buildings that could be constructed in the forest . Even the ORG had emphasised that the construction of new buildings was prohibited on that plot . The building permit had obviously been issued to the first applicant unlawfully and , in the appellate court \u2019s view , the latter had asked the court to establish a legal fact for the sole purpose of constructing a house . The court also held that neither the PERSON on ORG nor the PERSON on Land provided for any exceptions , so the right to construct buildings on the plot of forest land had never existed . The court thus ordered the first applicant to demolish the buildings at the expense of the applicants , LOC and the PERSON environmental protection department . ORG did not explain how the costs of demolition had to be divided between the CARDINAL parties .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , LOC and the PERSON environmental protection department lodged an appeal on points of law . The applicants claimed that the appellate court had breached the principle of lex retro non agit by assessing the documents , issued in DATE , in view of the ruling of ORG . They also claimed that the appellate court had breached their legitimate expectations to execute their proprietary interests in accordance with the domestic regulation in force at the time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that relevant laws provided that the only buildings that could be constructed in the forest were timber storehouses and other buildings for forestry equipment . There were no provisions allowing construction of residential or commercial buildings in the forest . It was in certain cases possible to change the purpose of the land , but as the land in question was situated in a surface water protection zone , any such change was prohibited . The court held that although the applicants referred to ORG ( see paragraph DATE below , hereinafter the \u201c Regulation \u201d ) , none of the provisions of that Regulation could be interpreted as allowing construction of the buildings in question . There was no argument that the buildings in question had been constructed where farm buildings had previously been sited , thus the provision of the Regulation allowing construction where residential buildings had previously been sited did not allow the applicants to construct a summer house . The court thus held that the construction had been illegal . As regards the removal of the consequences of illegal construction , the court held that it was crucial to assess the consequences of the illegal construction for the environment and the public interest , the consequences of the demolition of the buildings , the possibility of restoring the environment to its state before the illegal construction , and whether the persons who had acquired property rights had acted in good faith . In cases where the construction was in breach of the territorial planning documents and/or the imperative requirements of environmental protection , heritage protection and protection of protected areas , a decision to legalise the illegal construction could not be taken . The court thus had to assess whether the construction in question should have been carried out at the relevant time . It held that legalisation of the buildings in question was impossible and that demolition had to take place ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . As to the applicants\u2019 argument that the appellate court had breached the principle of legitimate expectations , the court held that the construction in question had been prohibited by the relevant domestic legislation in force at the time . Even if the applicants had misinterpreted the provisions of the ORG , ORG had found the ORG to be inconsistent with the law , and , by extension , with LAW on DATE , DATE after the building permit had been issued to the first applicant . The applicants should therefore have been able to understand the consequences of constructing illegally and to avoid them . Although the authorities were partly responsible for the illegal construction , that fact per se did not mean that all illegal construction had to be legalised in order to protect the legitimate expectations and proprietary interests of the owners . The legal regulation established the responsibility of the authorities for the unlawful issue of the construction permit . As a result , the court upheld the decision of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the bailiff asked LOC to explain the order to enforce ORG decision . On DATE ORG dismissed the bailiff \u2019s request because she had failed to provide specific details as to what required clarification .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicants asked the bailiff to suspend the execution of the judgment and that their request was refused .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants applied to ORG to overrule the bailiff \u2019s refusal to suspend the execution of the judgment and to suspend it until the case had been examined at ORG . On DATE ORG held that domestic law did not oblige the bailiff to suspend the execution of judgments if the applicants had lodged an application with ORG . However , LAW provided that there would be grounds for reopening the proceedings if ORG found that a domestic court decision had breached an applicant \u2019s rights under the Convention or one of its Protocols ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court held that if the national court \u2019s order to demolish the building was executed , the possibility of reopening the proceedings after a positive outcome for the applicants in ORG would become complicated . On the other hand , if ORG adopted a different decision , the demolition of the buildings would still be possible . The court observed that the applicants\u2019 building did not infringe the rights of third persons as it was sited on a plot of forest land that belonged to the applicants . As a result , ORG suspended the execution of the judgment pending a decision by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG lodged a separate complaint , but on DATE ORG upheld the first - instance decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
