The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant met PERSON , a NORP citizen , in GPE in DATE . They lived together in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a son , DATE , was born to them . TIME is a NORP citizen .", "CARDINAL . In DATE V.T. went with the child to visit her family in GPE . After DATE , the father went to GPE to fetch them . They all returned to GPE . In DATE the mother and their son went back to GPE for DATE . In DATE the mother wrote to the applicant stating that their relationship was over . She went to GPE shortly afterwards to collect their son \u2019s belongings and returned to GPE , where she remained with the boy . On DATE V.T. registered her and her son \u2019s permanent residence at her GPE address in GPE , GPE district in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that his son had been abducted and held in GPE without his consent . He initiated proceedings before ORG , asking that the child be returned to GPE , which was his son \u2019s usual permanent place of residence .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . The applicant , GPE , CARDINAL of her lawyers and representatives of the NORP child care authorities were present at the hearing . The child care specialist asked the court to resolve the issue of the child \u2019s return to his country of birth as it saw fit . This notwithstanding , the authorities observed that the child had good living conditions in GPE and was growing up in a secure environment among loving people .", "CARDINAL . The court acknowledged that since his birth the boy \u2019s parents had taken care of him together and that consequently his permanent place of residence was GPE . Both of the parents had custody rights in respect of the boy . ORG also dismissed PERSON \u2019s allegation that the applicant had agreed that the child could settle permanently in GPE . Moreover , PERSON had no legal basis on which to decide to change the child \u2019s permanent place of residence on her own . Her refusal to return the child to the country of his birth after DATE could not be recognised as being justified .", "CARDINAL . ORG nevertheless ruled that the child should stay in GPE . In setting out its reasons , the court held that before arriving in GPE the child had lived in GPE for DATE . It was therefore his mother , who did not go out to work , who had predominantly taken care of him during that time . Moreover , his living conditions in GPE were worse than those in GPE . In particular , the boy and his parents had lived in GPE in CARDINAL small room , with construction work going on close by . By contrast , in GPE the child lived at GPE \u2019s GPE house where , according to a child care representative , the boy felt happy and was spry , active , communicative and loved . The court also observed that the boy \u2019s mother had taken care of him the entire time since birth , that they were very close and that the boy had never been left with a nanny or any other person . Furthermore , even though there was no evidence that the applicant had ever behaved improperly in front of the child , or that he had abused alcohol , used drugs or resorted to violence , the applicant had not demonstrated that he had the skills to take care of such a small child . Accordingly , the boy \u2019s separation from the mother and transfer to the father would not be in the child \u2019s interests . It followed that the child could be returned to GPE only with the mother . Given that the mother could not survive financially in GPE on her own and that the applicant refused to guarantee having enough money to maintain the child \u2019s mother or to guarantee living conditions for her if she were to come back with the child to GPE , the applicant \u2019s request that the child be returned to GPE had to be denied .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then started new court proceedings in ORG in GPE and GPE ( hereinafter DATE \u201c LOC ) . In DATE that court appointed a guardian ad litem for TIME", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the boy \u2019s guardian recommended that he remain in the care of his mother . The guardian also recommended to the HCJ that there be a period of contact between the father and his son , so that they could rebuild their relationship .", "During these proceedings , the applicant appeared in person , and PERSON gave evidence in person ; she was also represented by her lawyers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the HCJ ruled that the child should permanently reside in GPE with his mother . The option for GPE to come to GPE and take up a job there was not in the child \u2019s best interests , given that the child would be placed in a nursery and would have CARDINAL parents who were emotionally distant . Moreover , PERSON did not wish to live in GPE , even if she were to be supported by the applicant . Having acknowledged that the father had a genuine and serious interest in his son , the court held that the \u201c central underlying problem \u201d thus related to the promotion and preservation of a good relationship between the CARDINAL of them .", "CARDINAL . The HCJ accepted that the applicant felt vulnerable in GPE but rejected his allegations about concerted attempts by the NORP authorities to act against him . That notwithstanding , the HCJ also held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ( ... ) it seems to me that in GPE [ the applicant ] will have very real difficulties in engaging in the contact in an appropriate way because of the pressures he will have in GPE . ( ... ) I see real advantage in the contact being here [ in GPE ] so that the child gets to know his father in the father \u2019s own environment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The HCJ thus considered that the correct place for their contact would be GPE . Furthermore , the preferred timing was \u201c clearly as soon as possible \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the child \u2019s mother was to come to GPE and spend DATE there , during which time a regime of contact between the father and the child would take place . Afterwards the mother was free to return to GPE with the child and to live there permanently . The HCJ also \u201c wished to make it abundantly clear \u201d to both parents that \u201c albeit the issues relating to the welfare of children could change with circumstances , it was going to take a very significant change for there to be any re - visiting of the overarching plan described above \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Once the child had settled permanently in GPE , the applicant would have a right to ongoing contact : essentially , CARDINAL times a year there would be CARDINAL to CARDINAL days\u2019 residential contact between him and his son . The first CARDINAL meetings would take place in GPE , once the mother had brought the child there . That was contingent upon the father paying a sum to fund the trip , namely MONEY ( GBP ) for each visit . Thereafter the father would have the choice as to where this contact was to take place and he could travel to GPE , pick up the child and communicate with him in any location worldwide that he wished .", "CARDINAL . The applicant attended the court hearing . At the end thereof the judge informed the applicant that the judgment would be enforceable in GPE subject to applications being made there in respect of the contact order after the child had returned to live there permanently .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the HCJ adopted a revised judgment and order , reiterating that the applicant and ORG were not on good terms with each other and that it had thus had to take a difficult decision on CARDINAL DATE when it ruled that the mother should have permission to take the child to live in GPE permanently . There was a risk , as portrayed by the applicant , that the applicant could be shut out of the child \u2019s life by the mother \u2019s family . However , in the meantime no significant or dramatic change of circumstances had occurred which would necessitate amending the custody decision . On this point the HCJ also expressed its confidence in the NORP courts :", "\u201c An additional point is that it seems to me that it is not open to me to proceed on the basis that the NORP courts will do anything other than deal with this matter pursuant to [ child \u2019s ] welfare principle . They are subject to PERSON revised . Albeit I understand that the father was unhappy with the conclusions reached in the NORP court , to my mind I can not accept his submission that even if the mother and her family demonstrate the hostility he asserts , the NORP court will join in and will not seek to promote the underlying theme of my judgments , namely , that there should be a contact between this father and son \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As regards the jurisdiction of the NORP courts for further examination of issues relating to parental responsibility and thus contact , the HCJ held :", "\u201c ( a ) recognising and intending that , subject to LAW ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL , upon the ORG , A.M. , leaving the jurisdiction of GPE and GPE to live permanently in GPE pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL of this Order , the courts of GPE will have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility , and thus contact ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The contact order established by the HCJ on DATE and revised by it on DATE set out CARDINAL stages of contact :", "\u2013 the first stage covered the period from DATE until DATE , when the mother was to bring the child to GPE for paternal contact , subject to and conditional upon the applicant paying the sum of ORG CARDINAL to the mother of the child ;", "\u2013 the second stage of the parental contact covered CARDINAL periods of contact \u2013 DATE and DATE within the jurisdiction of GPE and GPE ; DATE before they were to take place , the applicant was to pay GBP CARDINAL to the mother \u2019s solicitors for the purpose of meeting the costs incurred by the mother when travelling with the child to the jurisdiction of GPE and GPE ;", "\u2013 the third stage covered CARDINAL periods of paternal contact from DATE and DATE , when the applicant was to pick up his son at ORG in GPE and was allowed to choose any location worldwide to be with his son ; as of DATE , the applicant could take his son from GPE and travel with him worldwide CARDINAL times a year , for DATE on each occasion .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant raised the argument that from a practical point of view it would be easier for him to travel with his son if the boy had a passport from the same country . The HCJ thus ordered that after DATE V.T. would provide the NORP and/or GPE authorities with relevant documents and information to enable the applicant to obtain NORP and/or NORP passports and/or travel documents for the child . Should the mother fail to comply , the applicant could lodge a complaint with the HCJ , which retained jurisdiction on this sole issue of passports / travel documents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal against the HCJ judgment and order of DATE , but on DATE ORG and GPE refused his application .", "CARDINAL . The first stage of the contact order adopted by the HCJ was implemented . The applicant paid PERSON the sum of ORG CARDINAL for the costs incurred by her when taking their son to GPE , and PERSON took the child to GPE for CARDINAL GPE paternal contact , which should have lasted from DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . During that visit , on DATE the boy \u2019s guardian ad litem informed the HCJ that she was concerned about the risk factors in relation to ensuring the boy \u2019s safety and his return to his mother \u2019s care in the light of their imminent return to GPE . The guardian noted that she had been made aware that the applicant had made an application to ORG for leave to appeal against the HCJ judgment and order of DATE . In the words of the boy \u2019s guardian , the applicant had made abundantly clear his \u201c obdurate attitude \u201d to the judgment and order issued by the HCJ and his \u201c steadfast view \u201d that his son should live in GPE , irrespective of the child \u2019s needs and best interests , which , as agreed by the HCJ court and the child care specialists , were best met on DATE to day basis by his mother . The guardian also noted that DATE the applicant had informed GPE authorities of his intention to leave GPE following the last session of his DATE contact period . Furthermore , the HCJ order of DATE had allowed for the applicant to apply for a NORP or NORP passport . In that connection , in DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitor had urged ORG solicitor to sign her son \u2019s NORP passport application form immediately . For the above reasons , the boy \u2019s guardian ad litem had serious concerns that there was an increased risk of DATE being abducted by his father . She thus recommended that the order of DATE be varied and that the court suspend the last session of contact scheduled for DATE , allowing the boy and his mother to return to GPE before the expected time .", "CARDINAL . In addition to that , in an email of DATE to the applicant from ORG ( hereinafter DATE \u201c LOC ) of GPE , a ORG lawyer wrote :", "\u201c Dear Mr Manic", "I understand you have been served with the passport and tipstaff orders . I am concerned to note that you initially informed the tipstaff you only had one passport but after further discussions handed over CARDINAL passports . The tipstaff have also reported to us that you had several passport photos of A.M. , again this is of concern .", "I realise you are not legally represented and I think it would be advisable for you to obtain legal advice before we next attend court . I can however impress upon you that if you breach the current orders and DATE is not returned to his mother at the conclusion of contact then there will be very serious implications on your future contact with A.M. I therefore hope that you enjoy the following DATE of contact and that you return him to his mother at the appropriate time and date . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the HCJ found the ORG communication ill - advised . The GPE and NORP embassies were nonetheless ordered to advise GPE \u2019s solicitors if the applicant had made any application for travel documents in respect of the child and to refrain from issuing any such document . Having in DATE been informed by those CARDINAL embassies that they had not been approached for a passport for the boy , the HCJ then ordered that GPE make the boy available for the full visit in DATE . The boy \u2019s mother afterwards took the boy to live with her in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON \u2019s lawyer wrote to the applicant stating that PERSON was not proposing to bring their son to GPE so that the boy could see his father . PERSON believed that it would be too stressful for the boy and that the child was not ready to spend DATE away from his mother . The applicant was also informed that jurisdiction over contact arrangements had now passed to the NORP courts . PERSON \u2019s lawyer also enclosed a cheque for GBP CARDINAL by way of reimbursement of the sum the applicant had paid in relation to GPE \u2019s travel and accommodation expenses for the staying contact in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant contacted ORG , the LOC authority within the meaning of ORG ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL in GPE , as regards the non - enforcement of the second stage of the HCJ mandate of DATE . The applicant noted that even though the GBP CARDINAL for the DATE visit had been returned to him , he was ready to pay it again at any time should the contact go ahead .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the aforementioned GPE authority contacted ORG in GPE ( NORP vaiko teisi\u0173 apsaugos ir \u012fvaikinimo tarnyba , hereinafter \u2013 \u201c the Service \u201d ) regarding the non - enforcement of the HCJ judgment and order . All the relevant documents \u2012 including the HCJ contact order of DATE , the letter from ORG solicitor ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the application form where the applicant stated that he was ready to pay GBP CARDINAL so that a future visit would take place \u2012 were transferred to the NORP authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Service informed ORG in GPE that certificates issued in ORG member states were directly enforceable in GPE , and they had therefore been submitted to a bailiff for execution ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The ORG also provided its counterpart in GPE with a list of the bailiffs acting in GPE region , where GPE and the applicant \u2019s son lived , and advised the applicant to contact CARDINAL of the suggested bailiffs directly so that the HCJ order could be executed . The ORG also noted that the procedural activity of the bailiff responsible for the enforcement of a foreign contact order was supervised by a regional court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant contacted a bailiff working in GPE district of GPE . As is evidenced by the documents in the ORG \u2019s possession , DATE and DATE the applicant wrote DATE emails to the bailiff . The emails were written in LANGUAGE , with a ORG translation into NORP . In his very first email to the bailiff , the applicant noted that he had a certificate for a contact order under LAW ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL . As explained in his emails of CARDINAL and DATE , he attached the enforcement certificate , a letter to ORG authority , the letter from ORG \u2019s solicitors ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and proof that he had paid CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) for the execution of the HCJ judgment in GPE , and promised to send other relevant information . The applicant also asked the bailiff to notify him if she was missing any documents and to inform him about the enforcement procedure . In his email of DATE the applicant also indicated that , if it made it easier for the bailiff , she could reply to the applicant in LANGUAGE , a language he declared that he could understand .", "CARDINAL . In those emails to the bailiff , the applicant wrote , in particular , that he had sent the documents needed for the execution of the HCJ judgment by post ( email of DATE ) , and that ORG had assured him that the documents as posted by him to GPE were in order ( email of DATE , also attaching his email correspondence with ORG ) . It is apparent that the applicant and the bailiff spoke on the phone on DATE , when the bailiff confirmed to the applicant that she had received the documents by ORG delivery DATE , but stated that the documents were not \u201c original \u201d . On DATE the applicant again sent the documents to the bailiff via ORG post . He explained that the courts in GPE used black ink for the stamps but that , even so , the documents were marked as \u201c original \u201d . The same day the bailiff emailed the applicant saying that she needed the original paperwork , not photocopies . The applicant then asked the court in GPE to seal the HCJ order and posted the documents to the bailiff again .", "CARDINAL . By emails of CARDINAL and DATE the applicant asked the bailiff to inform him how the bailiff \u2019s meeting with the child \u2019s mother had gone , as regards the execution of the HCJ order , and mentioned that he was ready to make the payments according to the ORG order , so that the next visit [ that of DATE ] would take place . By email of DATE the applicant asked the bailiff to update him in writing about the steps she had taken to enforce the contact order . He mentioned that time was passing and this would cause damage to his relationship with his son . The applicant also asked the bailiff a number of times at what stage the enforcement procedure was ( email of DATE ) . In the applicant \u2019s view , even though the bailiff \u2019s assistant had told him over the phone that the matter had been passed over to the NORP court , the applicant had received no explanation in writing as to which court that was and when the NORP court decision was to be taken . The applicant wrote that \u201c the blackout of information was leading me to believe that there was something wrong in the middle . I do not want to speculate and would be grateful if you wrote me a few lines to explain what is going on \u201d ( email of DATE ) . Later on , the applicant wrote that the bailiff \u2019s \u201c silence was agonising \u201d ( email of CARDINAL DATE ) . On DATE the applicant reiterated his complaint that the bailiff had not informed him why the case was \u201c dragged out \u201d . He also asked the bailiff to provide him with answers in writing as well as with information about what he named \u201c Complaints and Procedures \u201d . Further , as is evident from the applicant \u2019s emails of CARDINAL and DATE , the bailiff had told him over the phone that the NORP court wanted the applicant to be present in the courtroom in GPE . He asked the bailiff what would be the reason for his appearance in court , but the bailiff did not respond . In an email of DATE the applicant also wrote that , according to the bailiff , ORG had not complied with the contact order because he had not paid her the GBP CARDINAL . The applicant explained however , that he had paid that sum , as mentioned in the letter of DATE from DATE PERSON \u2019s lawyers , and asked the bailiff whether that evidence had been put before the NORP court . Lastly , by an email of QUANTITY DATE the applicant wrote that he could not understand the bailiff \u2019s silence and why his emails went unanswered . He asked whether the bailiff had received instructions from her superiors or from Government agencies not to engage in any correspondence with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff established that ORG had not delivered the child for paternal contact which , in accordance with the order of the HCJ , was due to take place CARDINAL . For that reason , on DATE the bailiff initiated court proceedings against GPE concerning the non - enforcement of the GPE court \u2019s order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG sent to the applicant \u2019s address in GPE a notification that court proceedings regarding non - execution of the HCJ judgment about his contact rights had been opened in GPE . The court wrote to the applicant that his \u201c participation in the oral court hearing was not obligatory \u201d . It was also explained to the applicant that he should nominate a representative in GPE on whom all the procedural documents could be served . Failing that , all procedural documents intended for the party residing abroad would remain in the case file and would be deemed to have been served .", "CARDINAL .

Lastly , the applicant expressed his willingness to provide any other information , if needed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the bailiff \u2019s complaint .

The PERSON court also noted that by interim protective measures ( laikinosios apsaugos priemon\u0117s ) of CARDINAL DATE imposed by the same court , the applicant was prohibited from removing the child from NORP territory ( see paragraphs DATE below ) . The decision stated that it could be appealed against within DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE she also applied to the court for interim protective measures to suspend execution of the contact order of the HCJ , and not to allow the applicant to be alone with his son . PERSON stated that the applicant had not paid the sum of money mentioned in the HCJ judgment and that the contact visits between him and the child had therefore not taken place . It was also her belief that the child did not recognise his father . Moreover , it was not in the child \u2019s interests to communicate with the applicant in GPE , as the HCJ had ordered , because that environment was unfamiliar to the boy . She attached to her request what appears to be the PERSON email of DATE and the HCJ decision of DATE . PERSON insisted that the boy should never communicate with his father without her being present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG accepted for examination ORG request for the change of parental contact . On DATE the court decided to examine ORG request for interim protective measures on DATE , and not to inform the applicant about that oral hearing , without indicating in the text of the decision the reason why the applicant should not know about the hearing beforehand . The child care authority and ORG were invited to attend the hearing . Moreover , the court deemed ORG participation at the hearing to be obligatory . The court further held that , as the applicant resided in GPE and the question of interim protective measures had not yet been decided , for reasons of procedural economy any procedural decisions should be sent to the applicant only once the issue of interim protective measures had been examined .

She claimed that the applicant might kidnap and not return their son should the boy be taken to GPE for a contact visit . She also stated that the applicant had also been prohibited from having contact with the boy for DATE of the contact period in DATE . It is apparent that GPE relied on an email of DATE from ORG to the applicant as evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . PERSON also stated that after his last meeting with his father , the boy had been nervous and afraid of other people .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG granted in part ORG request for interim protective measures .

In GPE , the boy was spry and PERSON took good care of him . As the record of the hearing reads , PERSON \u2019s request was essentially based on her fear that the applicant would not return the child to her if he was allowed to take his son from GPE . She also stated that after the staying visit of DATE the boy had been nervous and exhausted and would not leave her side .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted a conflict between the applicant and PERSON over the child \u2019s contact arrangements . On the basis of the email from ORG dated DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG found :", "\u201c The documents submitted prove that the [ applicant ] was going to take the son away from GPE and prepared other personal documents for him for that purpose ; during his contacts with the child , the latter \u2019s personal documents were therefore taken from him and he was prohibited from removing the child from the jurisdiction of GPE and GPE . Taking this into account , there is a real risk that the execution of the [ NORP ] court decision might become more complicated ( if it were to become necessary to apply to a national court of a foreign ORG for acknowledgment and permission to execute a NORP court decision , if one were to be made in GPE \u2019s favour ) or even impossible ( if , for example , the applicant were to conceal the child \u2019s whereabouts or change them periodically ) . The risk that the execution of the court decision might become more complicated or even impossible constitutes a basis for ordering interim protective measures ( ... ) . It was also taken into account that the child \u2019s domicile is in GPE , where he attends a kindergarten , and a sudden change in the environment might therefore have a negative impact on a child . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG nevertheless acknowledged that a child whose parents were separated had the right to have constant and direct contact with both parents irrespective of their places of residence .

On DATE V.T. \u2019s lawyers informed the applicant by email about the district court \u2019s decision to apply interim protective measures and sent him an electronic copy of that decision , in NORP .

At that subsequent hearing , about which the applicant was informed but which he did not attend , ORG asked the NORP judicial authorities to question the applicant as a witness so that it could be established what property he owned in GPE in connection with the claim for child support . Later on , ORG postponed hearings scheduled for DATE and CARDINAL DATE until such time as it had received , from GPE authorities , information about the property the applicant owned in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant asked the NORP child care authorities about the well - being of his son . In reply , the NORP child care authorities described the child \u2019s living conditions in GPE : he had a room of his own in GPE \u2019s GPE house and GPE paid for his kindergarten , food and clothes . In sum , the boy \u2019s living conditions were good and the child care authority had no concerns about his well - being .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave evidence about his property in GPE . ORG received that evidence at DATE . On DATE the court scheduled a preliminary hearing in the civil case for maintenance and contact rights for DATE . The parties to the case , including the applicant , were informed about that future hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted the decision regarding the maintenance of the applicant \u2019s son and the order for the establishment of the contact between the applicant and the child . The court also noted that judicial documents had been served on the applicant , he had been granted the right to file a statement of defence with regard to the claim , and he had been informed about the preparatory hearing ; moreover , he was obliged to submit details about his financial situation but he had neither filed any statement of defence , nor submitted the requisite details about his financial situation . Neither had the applicant expressed his opinion regarding ORG claim in his written explanations . The court established that ORG had taken all the measures necessary to satisfy her son \u2019s interests so that he could grow up in a healthy environment . Having assessed the parties\u2019 financial situations , ORG ordered the applicant to pay LTL CARDINAL ( ORG DATE in child support .", "CARDINAL . As to the child contact arrangements , ORG held :", "\u201c The details of the case show that the child contact arrangements were established by the Order issued by ORG , ORG , on DATE and under this Order the defendant was expected to have contact with his son on the following dates : from DATE to DATE ; from DATE to DATE ; from DATE to DATE ; from DATE to DATE , and thereafter CARDINAL times a year for DATE each time . After the first CARDINAL contact sessions the father was to have the right to choose any place in the world for all further contact sessions and to travel with his child without being accompanied by his mother .", "The [ applicant ] has not submitted any details proving that he had any contact with his child on the aforementioned dates or stating what the reasons were if he did not have such contact . [ ORG ] stated that the last time the father saw his child was DATE . The email submitted shows that no payment was received with regard to the contact that was due to occur on DATE ... During the period of examination of the case , the [ applicant ] was allowed to contact his son in GPE in the presence of the representative of ORG ... According to the information provided by the representative of ORG ... no contact sessions between father and son took place during the period of application for interim protective measures lasting from DATE to DATE . As there is no evidence that there has been any contact between father and son since DATE , there are no reasonable grounds to state that the [ applicant ] considers the meetings with his son significant and that there exists a close relationship between him and his son so it is indeed probable that the sudden departure of the child with his father and his removal from his habitual environment would not enhance the child \u2019s sense of security or his emotional stability and might be harmful to him . Therefore the approach in this matter should be more cautious .", "The court agrees with the argument put forward by [ V.T. ] that the overriding interest regarding the child is to develop in a healthy , safe and quiet environment where he would not experience psychological tension , fear and perpetual conflict . It would appear from [ ORG ] explanations and from email communications that there are reasonable grounds for stating that there is conflict in the relationship , personal discord , and an absence of tolerance between the parties , making communication between the respondent and his child complicated . However , according to medical documents submitted it can not be unequivocally asserted that the child \u2019s irritability is purely a consequence of the respondent \u2019s contact sessions with the child . The medical reports state that the child is especially active and demanding of exceptional attention from his mother and that this condition was recorded on CARDINAL DATE but \u2012 as stated by [ V.T. ] \u2012 the last time the [ applicant ] saw his child was DATE . This condition could therefore be caused by strained relations between [ GPE ] and [ the applicant ] . On the other hand , it should be noted that a child who is a minor can not be a hostage of his GPE conflict and the conflict relationship between the parties is not a circumstance justifying a need to restrict the [ applicant \u2019s ] contacts with his child .", "During the proceedings it is permissible for a child to be questioned , unless this can not be done due to his age or degree of maturity . TIME was born on DATE , i.e. his age allows it to be concluded or to express his opinion , and he was therefore not questioned during the hearing .", "In circumstances such as these , the court determines the procedure for the father to have contact with the child by taking into consideration the child \u2019s interests and by creating a possibility for the separated father to be involved in the child \u2019s upbringing ( ... ) . At the same time , the period during which a close emotional bond between the [ applicant ] and the child might be restored should be established as lasting until the child is DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , for DATE after the date when the ORG decision came into effect , the applicant was to communicate with his son for TIME per working day for DATE , in an environment to which the child was accustomed \u2013 at the child \u2019s home or the child care authority \u2019s premises , in the presence of his mother , a psychologist and a child care specialist . During the following DATE the applicant could communicate with his son CARDINAL four hours per day for DATE , either in the child \u2019s accustomed environment or in another place , in the presence of the child \u2019s mother or without her , if she so agreed . Lastly , during the period starting from DATE and until his son \u2019s seventh birthday , the applicant could see him on a DATE basis for DATE in DATE , DATE and DATE , in the child \u2019s accustomed environment , as agreed by the applicant and PERSON , but without her being present . The applicant also had the right to visit his son unimpeded whenever his child was sick . The parents were to ensure that the possibility existed for each of them to communicate with the child by telephone ( or other electronic means ) or some other form of communication .", "CARDINAL . The applicant acknowledges that he received the ORG decision on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the applicant \u2019s request for information , on CARDINAL DATE ORG sent the applicant a letter concerning his right to appeal against the decision of DATE within DATE . The court also informed the applicant about his right to restore a missed procedural time limit , if that time limit had been missed for serious reasons . The court further reiterated that the applicant had not appointed a representative living in GPE for dealing with contact rights and child maintenance , and on whom all the procedural documents would be served by the court . That being so , pursuant to LAW , all procedural documents addressed to a party residing abroad were left in the case file and were deemed to have been served .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to reopen the court proceedings . He argued that he had missed the statutory DATE time - limit for such reopening because he was a NORP citizen residing in GPE and did not speak NORP .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for reopening . The court first pointed out that a judge \u2019s notice dated DATE had explained the applicant \u2019s duty to appoint a representative or an authorised person and the consequences of the failure to fulfil that duty ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , the applicant had not appointed any such representative . Furthermore , although the applicant acknowledged that he had been served with the DATE decision ( translated into LANGUAGE and containing the provisions as to how it could be appealed against ) on DATE , he had not asked for a re - opening of the proceedings until CARDINAL DATE , that is DATE after receiving it . In reply to the applicant \u2019s argument that he was a foreigner , the NORP court noted that the applicant knew the rules regulating ORG - provided legal aid and could have asked for it in a timely fashion , because in earlier proceedings for non - enforcement of the HCJ contact order , he had been provided with ORG - provided legal aid by a decision dated DATE ( see paragraph DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed another request by the applicant to reopen the civil proceedings and to review ORG decision of DATE concerning the contact order between the applicant and his son . The court reiterated that the applicant had not communicated directly with his son since DATE . Similarly , there was no evidence of the applicant ever having visited his son either after the court decision of CARDINAL DATE regarding interim protective measures or after the subsequent decision of CARDINAL DATE , both of which allowed the applicant to see his child for TIME each day . As to the applicant \u2019s plea that the NORP court order would cause him inconvenience DATE especially the necessity of travelling to GPE \u2012 this did not mean that the contact as established by ORG on DATE had established was negligible . According to the contact order , the applicant could see his son on DATE , DATE . Knowing about such a contact order , the applicant could plan his work and income accordingly . It was also significant that , according to the contact order issued by the HCJ on DATE , the child had to be collected from the NORP embassy in GPE . Consequently , the applicant would in any case have to leave his place of residence and job in GPE and come to GPE . He would also inevitably have to invest time and money . Accordingly , taking into account the child \u2019s interests \u2013 his age , state of health , need for mother \u2019s attention , and the fact that the applicant had not directly communicated with his son since DATE \u2012 the contact order as set by ORG on DATE reasonably gave priority to the child \u2019s interests whilst not neglecting the applicant \u2019s right to be in contact with his son .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG noted that ORG had moved to GPE in DATE . The child \u2019s residence had been declared to be GPE in DATE . PERSON had lodged the request that the child contact order be modified with GPE when DATE had passed after the move to GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . It followed that \u2012 pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Regulation ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL \u2012 in DATE the GPE courts were no longer able to consider decisions concerning the modification of contact orders , as those cases fell within the jurisdiction of the court of the Member ORG where the child was habitually resident , in this case GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to examine the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON asked ORG to permanently restrict the applicant \u2019s parental rights . She argued that the applicant did not communicate with his son . In turn , the applicant asked the NORP court to suspend the proceedings until the ORG had examined his application against GPE ( no . MONEY ) .
