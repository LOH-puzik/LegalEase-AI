AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , born in DATE and living in PERSON . She is represented before the Court by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "A.", "On DATE criminal proceedings were opened against the applicant and her husband , GPE , respectively , on suspicion of their having brought into circulation large amounts of narcotic drugs ( GPE grosser Mengen Suchtgift ) . On CARDINAL DATE the investigating judge discontinued the proceedings against the applicant . He noted that the applicant had denied being involved in any criminal act . As GPE had availed himself of the right not to give evidence against his wife ( PERSON ) , it was unlikely that the applicant \u2019s defence would be disproved .", "On DATE the ORG convicted GPE amongst others of the above charges . In its reasoning , the court , referring to statements made by GPE , noted several times that the applicant had contributed to the commission of the offence at issue .", "Having regard to the above judgment , ORG ) requested the re - opening of the proceedings against the applicant on DATE . ORG noted that GPE had previously availed himself of the right not to give evidence against his wife . His statements in the proceedings before ORG therefore constituted new evidence .", "On DATE ORG ( Ratskammer ) of FAC ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) granted the re - opening request .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested . Subsequently , the investigating judge ordered her detention on remand , finding that there was a suspicion of her having committed the above offence , as well as a danger of absconding . On DATE she was released on bail .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) quashed the order to re - open the proceedings and referred the case back to FAC . It found that the latter should have carried out further investigations into the precise contents of GPE \u2019s statements before ORG . On DATE ORG of the Graz Regional Court again decided to re - open the proceedings . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was dismissed by ORG on CARDINAL DATE . She was finally acquitted on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed an action claiming compensation for unlawful detention under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of the Compensation ( Criminal Proceedings ) Act DATE ( Strafrechtliches Entsch\u00e4digungsgesetz ) . She argued that her detention DATE and DATE had been unlawful as she had been arrested before the order to re - open the criminal proceedings had become final .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s action , finding that she was entitled to compensation . It held that , as a general rule , arrest and detention of a suspect could lawfully be ordered even before the re - opening order became final as the appeal against it had no suspensive effect . The investigating judge was bound by the order to reopen the proceedings . Furthermore , ORG noted that , at the time the applicant \u2019s detention was ordered , there was a reasonable suspicion against her as GPE had incriminated her in the proceedings before ORG . Having regard to the sentence she risked incurring , namely one to DATE imprisonment , and to the fact that she was unemployed at that time and not well integrated in society , the court also found that at that time a danger of absconding had properly been assumed by the investigating judge . However , it followed from the decision of CARDINAL DATE that the order to re - open the proceedings had been premature and therefore unlawful . The court accordingly concluded that the applicant \u2019s detention , being based on that defective order , had likewise been unlawful .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) allowed the appeal of ORG and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . It noted that the order to re - open proceedings which had been discontinued meant that they were resumed at the stage of the preliminary investigation . The re - opening order served as a legal basis for the continuation of the proceedings and also for the suspect \u2019s arrest and detention , even before it became final , as the appeal against it did not have suspensive effect . The investigating judge was bound by that order and had no competence to review its lawfulness . The fact that , in the present case , the order had later been quashed by the appellate court did not retrospectively render unlawful the applicant \u2019s detention , which had duly been based on a reasonable suspicion and the danger of absconding . The decision was served on CARDINAL DATE .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "The relevant provisions of LAW ) , in the version in force in DATE , provided as follows :", "According to section CARDINAL , ORG of the competent criminal court could , upon ORG request , re - open proceedings against a specific suspect which had been discontinued , if criminal liability for the offence had not become statute - barred and new evidence was adduced which appeared likely to lead to the suspect \u2019s conviction ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . An appeal against ORG decision could be lodged with ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "As section CARDINAL was silent on the question whether or not such an appeal had suspensive effect , the general rule laid down in CARDINAL LAW applied , namely that an appeal against the decision of ORG had no suspensive effect ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
