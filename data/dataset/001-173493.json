UKRAINE", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Tribunal established by law);Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed (Article 41 - Pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction);Non-pecuniary damage - award (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Ganna Yudkivska;Yonko Grozev", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company was a NORP joint - stock company registered in GPE . At the relevant time it operated a commercial air carrier business ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company brought a claim for damages , in particular loss of profit , against ORG . The claim was based on a delay on the defendant \u2019s part in issuing a safety certificate , which the ORG had been required to issue in DATE by a court judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the claim in part .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Appeal quashed the first - instance court \u2019s judgment and rejected the claim , mainly on the grounds that the applicant company had failed to prove the loss of profit it had claimed . It considered the estimates of the loss profit speculative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reversed the ruling of ORG and upheld the judgment of the first instance court . ORG held that because the defendant \u2019s inaction prevented the applicant company from operating its business as from DATE , the first instance court was correct in accepting the information about the applicant company \u2019s gross income for DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the ruling of ORG and upheld the ruling of ORG . ORG considered that no causal connection has been proven between the defendant \u2019s culpable inaction and the alleged loss of profit . It held , in particular , that the applicant company had failed to prove that it had realised a profit , rather than gross income , prior to DATE , or that its income for DATE came from operations which required a safety certificate .", "CARDINAL . Following communication of the case and unsuccessful friendly settlement negotiations , on DATE the Government informed the ORG of their intention to resolve the issue raised by the application . They produced a unilateral declaration , in which they acknowledged a breach of LAW and offered to pay the applicant company a sum to cover any pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage together with any costs and expenses . The ORG requested that the ORG strike out the application in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company objected to the striking out of its application , wishing to have its merits determined with a view to obtaining appropriate redress . It argued , in particular , that under domestic law the unilateral declaration , unlike a ORG \u2019s judgment finding a violation , would not provide grounds for reexamination of its case by ORG . The Government \u2019s unilateral declaration would therefore not lead to actual restoration of the applicant company \u2019s rights .", "CARDINAL . The Government were invited to comment and on DATE informed ORG the relevant domestic legislation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and QUANTITY below ) . They submitted a letter from ORG informing ORG there was no relevant domestic caselaw on the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company \u2019s only shareholder , East / West , informed the ORG that on DATE ORG had declared the applicant company bankrupt and opened liquidation procedure and on DATE had declared it liquidated . Accordingly , East / West requested that any just satisfaction award due to the applicant company be paid to GPE . Asked to comment , the Government responded on DATE that they \u201c do not object against the applicant \u2019s request as to the payment to its sole shareholder the awarded compensation and , thus , leave this question on the ORG \u2019s discretion \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
