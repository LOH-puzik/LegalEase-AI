CARDINAL of them , the applicant , had dropped a black jacket . PERSON pointed to the group as the perpetrators , so the police arrested all CARDINAL of them and took them to a police station .", "CARDINAL .

The victim , the applicant and CARDINAL other arrested persons ( Ka . and ORG . ) were taken to the police station in the same car . During the first identity parade , set up soon after the arrest , the victim did not recognise the applicant as the perpetrator .", "CARDINAL .

During the hearing defence witnesses GPE and ORG stated , inter alia , that they had not been with the defendants the whole time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Riga ORG acquitted the defendants and released them from detention . As far as the applicant was concerned , the lower court indicated , in particular , that the scene of the alleged crime had not been identified , and the victim could not indicate who had attacked him , with the exception of co - defendant P. ; that his statements concerning the applicant \u2019s clothes and height did not match those of the applicant ; and that the victim had not stated that the applicant had beaten him and on what parts of the body ; similarly it was not stated that the applicant had stolen the victim \u2019s belongings . Finally , the court refused to admit in evidence the results of the identity parade and also refused to cross - examine the victim and the defendants . It emphasised that the record of the identity parade had been drawn up contrary to the domestic law , in that the defendants were presented in the parade after having spent DATE in custody , and their clothes and appearance differed considerably from those of the others in the parade ; also , no photographs were taken of those in the parade and there was no statement by the victim confirming which characteristics had caused him to recognise the defendants .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution lodged a protest reiterating the arguments set out in the bill of indictment .

Invited by the court to express an opinion about whether the court could commence adjudication in the absence of the witness PERSON . , the applicant confirmed that he had no objection .", "CARDINAL . Questioned during the appellate hearing about the circumstances of the attack , the victim stated that although it was dark , at the moment of the attack he had had a clear view of the faces of his attackers , but that immediately after the arrest he could not recognise them , because it was dark and the co - defendant \u2019s splint was not visible .", "CARDINAL . Witness Kv . retracted his statements given to the prosecutor during the pre - trial investigation . The statements of the police officers were read out .", "CARDINAL . Before summing up , defence counsel argued that the objection was also based on the statements of the QUANTITY police officers , who should be summoned to the appellate court hearing . Without giving reasons , the defence also asked for GPE and ORG to be summoned .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court dismissed the defence \u2019s requests for witnesses to be heard , arguing that they had all already been cross - examined . The defence did not object to the court investigation being brought to a close .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the defendants and sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The court preferred to give weight to ORG . \u2019s statements given during the pre - trial investigation , because , as a friend of the applicant \u2019s co - defendant , his statements given during the hearing of the appellate court in the presence of his friend were not to be treated as objective . In relation to the statements given by ORG . , the court noted that he had not changed the statements he had made during the pre - trial investigation and before the court of first instance , and that his statements did not differ in substance from those given by ORG . The court also did not consider that there were contradictions in the victim \u2019s statements and that it was not crucial that he could not tell precisely which defendant had kicked him and how many times . The court gave weight to the fact that during the court hearing the victim could describe the situation and explained that he had tried to cover his face instead of observing the actions of each perpetrator . In connection to the varying statements about the exact place of the fight , the appellate court observed that it was explained by the fact that neither the victim nor the defendants lived in GPE . As regards statements about the visual description of the perpetrator \u2019s clothes , the court did not consider the slight differences in the statements crucial , given that the events took place at TIME . The court said that even without the identification parade the defendant \u2019s guilt had been proved by other evidence . The court noted that the victim had recognised the applicant during the confrontation .", "CARDINAL . In their appeal on points of law the applicant and his counsel based their case on the shortcomings identified by the lower court . In connection to the ORG statements the applicant noted", "\u201c ... the court investigated the case incompletely . [ It ] did not summon all the witnesses , and the statements they had given before the lower court were not read out and [ were not ] taken into account \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the appellate court \u2019s judgment . It noted that the appellate court had excluded from the evidence the contested records of the identification parade . The ORG noted that the appellate court had analysed in detail and assessed all the statements provided by the victim S. , as well as the statements of ORG . provided during the pre - trial investigation and during the court hearing , and also the statements of ORG . which had been read out during the hearing , and other evidence described and analysed by the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . It noted that the question concerning the defence \u2019s request in relation to witnesses had been examined and decided in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code provides that when a court session is opened the presiding judge is to ask the defendant and his representative whether they request new witnesses to be summoned or the submission of new evidence and inclusion thereof in the criminal matter . The person who submits a request shall specify particular circumstances which should be clarified by the questioning of witnesses or the submission of other evidence . The court shall ask the opinions of other participants in the proceedings concerning each request in accordance with Article CARDINAL of this Code , and shall make a ruling . Refusal of the request shall not deprive the person whose request has been refused of the right to submit the request during the court hearing .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL sets out that the appeal court may summon witnesses who have testified before the first - instance court to a court session if the appeal court deems it necessary .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL stipulates that parties to appeal proceedings have the right to request witnesses to be summoned who have not been heard by the first - instance court .
