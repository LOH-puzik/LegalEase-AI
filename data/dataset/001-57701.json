SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses - claim dismissed", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP citizen . He is a university lecturer and resides in PERSON in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr ORG was not selected for appointment to an academic post at ORG . As he considered that the decision was discriminatory and that the recruitment board had been biased , he appealed to ORG ( universitets- och h\u00f6gskole\u00e4mbetet , \" ORG \" ) , which requested a specially established university committee to submit a written opinion . In this opinion , which was dated DATE , the committee stated , inter alia , that in his appeal Mr ORG had accused the person eventually selected for the post , PERSON , of having obtained it by means of secret pressure exercised on CARDINAL of the members of the recruitment board by a Professor PERSON ( who had also taken part in the recruitment procedure ) as a reward for PERSON assistance in a campaign led by Professor PERSON against Mr Helmers .", "On DATE the ORG , at last instance , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the appointment decision .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the applicant , who considered that the university committee \u2019s statement amounted to defamation , had reported the matter to the police . However , the Chief District Prosecutor of PERSON chose not to pursue the investigation and his decision was upheld on appeal , ultimately by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then decided to use his entitlement under LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) to bring a private prosecution for defamation or , alternatively , aggravated defamation ( f\u00f6rtal or grovt f\u00f6rtal , LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , brottsbalken ) and for making false statements ( osant intygande , LAW , LAW , of LAW ) , against one of the members of the special university committee , PERSON , and against its secretary , PERSON was also accused of having incited Mr F. to commit the offences ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ) . The maximum sentence prescribed by law for aggravated defamation was DATE imprisonment .", "Mr ORG also availed himself of the possibility under LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW of joining an action for damages to the private prosecution , and he sought compensation in the amount of MONEY from each of the accused .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) held a public hearing on DATE , at which the applicant and the defendants had the opportunity to address the court .", "On DATE the court delivered its judgment . It noted that the special committee \u2019s summary of Mr Helmers\u2019 appeal satisfied the objective criteria of defamation in that it was likely to discredit the applicant in the eyes of others . However , the court found that neither PERSON had incurred any criminal liability : PERSON could not be held responsible for the committee \u2019s statements as she had only been the rapporteur and not a decision - taking member ; it was true that PERSON had not been under any duty to make a statement as he had not been present when the committee examined Mr NORP appeal , but it had to be considered justifiable for him , as a member of the committee , to join its opinion . After examining the correctness of the summary , ORG concluded :", "\" It was not an easy task for the committee to summarise Mr Helmers\u2019 long submissions which , in the opinion of the court , were also difficult to interpret . The summary made must therefore , as Mr F. and PERSON have maintained , be considered as a reasonable interpretation of what Mr PERSON has put forward . In any event , it has not been established that Mr F. knowingly made any untrue statements . \"", "ORG furthermore found no evidence to support the allegation that PERSON had made a false statement or incited PERSON to commit a criminal offence . The applicant \u2019s private prosecution was accordingly dismissed and the claim for compensation was also rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr ORG appealed to ORG ) of GPE and PERSON . He submitted , inter alia , the following .", "ORG had , contrary to well - established case - law , excluded criminal liability on the part of PERSON on the ground that she had only been rapporteur and not a decision - taking member of the committee .", "The summary made by the special committee was untrue as a matter of fact . The fact that one of the professors involved in the recruitment procedure , Professor PERSON , had for a long time led a campaign against Mr PERSON had become a matter of public knowledge throughout the whole of LOC , as could be seen from legal textbooks , parliamentary documents , newspaper articles and radio and television programmes . It was also well - known that Professor PERSON had sought to have abolished the subject for the teaching of which the impugned appointment procedure took place and this was evidenced by , amongst other things , a complaint to the Chancellor of ORG ( justitiekanslern ) and an appeal by the students to ORG . Mr PERSON claimed that in view of the above facts , his appeal submissions to the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) could not possibly be construed as anything more than a challenge , on account of bias , of Professor PERSON \u2019s involvement in the appointment decision . He stated that this must have been clear both to PERSON and PERSON and that they were thus both guilty of defamation because of their libellous statement in the committee \u2019s opinion .", "He added that , even if ORG had not found it to be an easy task to summarise his submissions , the same could not hold true for the defendants , who had been in possession of all the documents in the appointment case for DATE . In this connection , he also pointed out that his appeal submissions had referred to all the relevant facts and these were well - known to those concerned at the university department in question .", "Finally , he requested ORG to hold an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG received PERSON and PERSON reply to Mr ORG appeal . This reply was sent to PERSON DATE , together with a note indicating that the case could be decided without an oral hearing and that he had DATE to file his pleadings with the court . Mr Helmers submitted these on DATE and they were forwarded to the accused DATE , together with a note similar to the one sent to Mr Helmers .", "DATE the parties lodged a number of further written observations with the court . Mr Helmers claimed that some of the material submitted by the defendants was irrelevant as it was a mere appeal to political prejudices and he asked the court to refuse it . He referred in particular to CARDINAL newspaper articles written by others and a press release issued by the Secretary to ORG DATE , all of which material related to a previous application by Mr ORG to the ORG ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , which had been declared inadmissible on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG decided the case on the basis of the written evidence , without having held any public hearing . It rejected the applicant \u2019s plea that some of the material submitted by the defendants should be ruled inadmissible . As to the merits , the court found both PERSON responsible for the committee \u2019s opinion of DATE , which it considered was likely to discredit the applicant in the eyes of others . The judgment went on to state :", "\" The scope of criminal liability for defamation is limited by the provision contained in LAW , section CARDINAL , second sub - paragraph , of LAW . A person who has uttered a defamatory statement is thus free from liability , inter alia , if he was under a duty to make a statement and the information given was true or had a reasonable foundation . The legislature has included appointment cases among those in which there may be a conflict between opposing interests .", "The circumstances were such that both PERSON were under a duty to make a statement . The fact that PERSON gave his opinion only later is of no relevance in this context . The summary must furthermore , just as ORG found , be considered as a reasonable pr\u00e9cis of what Mr Helmers put forward in his memorial supporting his appeal . Mr F. and PERSON therefore had a reasonable foundation for the information they provided . Accordingly they can not be convicted of defamation . Nor can the ORG uphold the prosecution brought against them on the charge of having made false statements or that brought against PERSON on the charge of having incited these offences .", "As a result of this conclusion in respect of the GPE criminal liability , Mr Helmers\u2019 claim for damages must be dismissed - just as ORG found . \"", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , claiming that a number of serious breaches of procedural law had occurred at first instance and that although he had pointed out these irregularities to ORG , it had given a judgment on the merits based on new evidence without having held an oral hearing . In support of his complaints Mr Helmers also invoked LAW and the serious and far - reaching consequences the outcome of the proceedings would have for him .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW of LAW , lower courts must not as a rule give judgment in criminal cases until the accused has been able to defend himself at an oral hearing . Exceptions to this rule do , however , exist , particularly at appellate level . Thus , LAW , section DATE , as worded at the relevant time ( it was subsequently amended with effect from DATE ) , provided :", "\" ORG may decide the case without a hearing if the prosecutor appeals only for the benefit of the accused or if an appeal lodged by the accused is supported by the opposing party .", "The case may be decided without a hearing if the lower court has acquitted the accused or discharged the offender or found him to be exempted from punishment by virtue of mental abnormality or if it has sentenced him to a fine or ordered him to pay a money penalty ( vite ) and there is no reason to impose a more severe sanction than those mentioned above or to impose any other sanction ... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG has the power to review questions both of law and of fact . However , there are some limits on its jurisdiction . LAW , for instance , lays down that ORG may not normally change the lower court \u2019s assessment of the evidence to the disadvantage of the accused without the evidence in question being produced afresh before ORG ; LAW , LAW ( as amended by LAW and CARDINAL ) , also contains a rule prohibiting the appellate court , in cases where the appeal is lodged by the accused or by the prosecutor for the benefit of the accused , from imposing a sentence which can be considered more severe than that imposed at first instance ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
