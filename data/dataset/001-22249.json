According to the applicants , the judge already showed his partiality and negative attitude against the applicants at that time . At a later hearing , in which PERSON stated that he would prove his innocence , the judge expressed his doubts by noting that \u201c it would be a difficult task \u201d . Also when CARDINAL of the ORG co - accused hid his face from photographers , the judge stated that \u201c it has never been necessary for honest men to hide themselves in this courtroom \u201d . According to the applicants , the presiding judge was indifferent , chatting to other judges when the applicants\u2019 witnesses were heard and once even cut his nails at that time .", "At the CARDINALth hearing , on DATE , the prosecutor brought a further alternative charge of aggravated fraud against the applicants . They requested the court to dismiss the alternative charge without considering the merits , alleging that denying the primary charge would automatically mean admitting the alternative one . Thus the way in which the charges were framed destroyed their defence . On DATE ORG dismissed the request , recalling that alternative charges were not forbidden by law and finding that they did not prevent the applicants\u2019 effective defence .", "On DATE , at the CARDINALth hearing of the case in which the parties presented their final pleadings , PERSON announced that he had DATE instituted private prosecution proceedings against the presiding ORG judge for an alleged offence while in office as he had dismissed the objection to the alternative charge presented earlier : it was claimed that , therefore , the judge was biased and should step down from the bench . On DATE ORG dismissed the claim concerning disqualification of the judge , finding that the charges brought by the applicant did not as such constitute grounds for such disqualification . Furthermore the decision to reject the claim concerning the alternative charges did not indicate the judge \u2019s preconceived attitude to the case as alleged by PERSON . ORG further found that the allegations concerning the judge \u2019s behaviour during the hearings were unsubstantiated .", "In the main proceedings ORG convicted PERSON of , inter alia , CARDINAL counts of aggravated fraud and CARDINAL counts of incitements to aggravated embezzlement . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and ordered to pay FIM CARDINAL ( MONEY ) in compensation . Mr PERSON was convicted of , inter alia , CARDINAL aggravated frauds and CARDINAL incitements to aggravated embezzlement .

PERSON was also taken into custody immediately after the hearing even though he had not been in detention during the trial .", "The applicants both appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tt ) which , on DATE , upheld ORG decision , finding that the alternative charges did not prevent the applicants\u2019 defence or otherwise violate their right to a fair trial . Concerning the disqualification of the judge ORG found that the decision to dismiss the applicants\u2019 plea concerning the prosecutor \u2019s alternative charges was given at the CARDINALth hearing and PERSON made his allegations DATE at the CARDINALth and last hearing . PERSON , further , submitted his allegations concerning the judge \u2019s behaviour at the last hearing even though he claimed that the judge \u2019s impartiality had been obvious during the whole proceedings . ORG concluded that Mr PERSON \u2019s purpose by bringing the charge against the judge was to make the judge his adversary and to prevent the court from giving its decision . Having examined the main issue ORG rejected some charges and reduced PERSON sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and PERSON sentence to DATE months\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "On DATE ORG dismissed , without having a hearing , the charge brought by PERSON against ORG judge , finding no evidence of the alleged offence .
