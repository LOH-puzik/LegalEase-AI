The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Munich II Public Prosecution Office charged the applicant with coercion to engage in sexual activity in CARDINAL cases and with sexual coercion in another CARDINAL cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG , after taking evidence at DATE of hearing , issued a decision limiting the prosecution to charges concerning CARDINAL incidents which had taken place DATE . The court provisionally discontinued the proceedings in respect of all the other offences the applicant had been charged with ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , in view of the penalty the applicant could expect for the CARDINAL remaining incidents . The applicant was further informed that if he was convicted the court could take into account findings made in respect of the other incidents when setting his sentence .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of coercion to engage in sexual activity , committed DATE , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In its findings of fact , ORG stated that DATE and DATE the applicant had forced P. , aged DATE at the relevant time and suffering from a moderate mental disorder and an autistic and speech disorder , to satisfy him manually or orally on CARDINAL further occasions ( out of the CARDINAL offences the applicant had initially been charged with , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court had regard to P. \u2019s extensive description of different incidents , which happened either in the house the applicant and PERSON were both living in or in the applicant \u2019s car . P. had notably explained how the applicant had regularly , when his wife and son were absent , brought her into his apartment or in the basement boiler room , had undressed himself and had instructed her how to satisfy him , partly while playing pornographic films . The applicant had systematically threatened P. that she would have to return to a home for the disabled if she did not comply with his requests . From CARDINAL to DATE , when the applicant \u2019s wife and son were on holiday , the applicant had forced P. to satisfy him orally at least twice and to satisfy him manually on CARDINAL further occasions in their house or in the basement boiler room . The veracity of PERSON consistent statements was confirmed by further witnesses and CARDINAL psychological expert opinions on GPE credibility and ability to testify .", "CARDINAL . ORG explained that it had restricted the conviction to the CARDINAL events that had taken place DATE . It had discontinued the proceedings in respect of the CARDINAL further charges under LAW but was convinced that in CARDINAL cases there had been incidents comparable to the CARDINAL of which the applicant was formally convicted . It had simply been impossible to determine their exact time and place due to the victim \u2019s speech disorder .", "CARDINAL . In the impugned passages of the judgment , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c The chamber is convinced on the basis of the credible statement by the injured party that in addition to the CARDINAL cases DATE and DATE on which judgment was passed , CARDINAL other comparable cases occurred . The injured party herself said that the applicant had coerced her to perform sexual acts from DATE . From DATE , the frequency of these incidents had increased and the applicant had demanded sexual gratification from her approximately DATE . Even if CARDINAL were to disregard DATE and DATE and DATE in favour of the applicant and also to presume that from DATE , such incidents occurred DATE there are CARDINAL cases . Following the deduction of a further safety margin the chamber assumes that there were CARDINAL more , comparable cases during the total period from DATE to DATE .", "...", "On the other hand , the chamber considers as an aggravating element that it is convinced that , in addition to the CARDINAL incidents in DATE which the accused has been convicted of , there have been CARDINAL comparable incidents since DATE . A conviction for those events was only made impossible by the victim \u2019s incapacity to substantiate them in terms of the time and the place where they happened in a manner making it possible to define them as procedural offences ( offences in the procedural sense ) . As it could no longer be determined with certainty in which cases the accused , by his threats , made the victim satisfy him orally or manually , the chamber will proceed on the basis that there were CARDINAL further cases of manual satisfaction . \u201d", "( \u201c PERSON aufgrund der glaubhaften PERSON , dass es neben den vier abgeurteilten GPE i m Zeitraum DATE bis DATE zu QUANTITY , vergleichbaren PERSON .

In an appeal on points of law to ORG , the applicant complained that ORG had breached the presumption of innocence guaranteed by LAW by taking CARDINAL unproven incidents into account as an aggravating factor meriting a more severe sentence , despite the fact that the proceedings in relation to them had been discontinued under LAW .", "CARDINAL .
