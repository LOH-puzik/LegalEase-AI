POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "At the material time the applicant was an editor - in - chief of a local DATE \u201c PERSON \u201d .", "Apparently , on an unspecified date a municipal authority allocated certain municipal apartment to CARDINAL of the local councillors , which caused widespread indignation in the local community .", "On DATE the weekly published an article in which the applicant reported on a conflict between GPE , CARDINAL of the local councillors , and the director of the local social assistance centre . The article contained a statement that \u201c FAC had instigated CARDINAL or CARDINAL supervision procedures in respect of the centre \u201d and that his activities concerning the centre had been aimed at \u201c delaying a public explanation of the conflict [ between GPE and the director of the centre ] to the constituency \u201d .", "On DATE the DATE published an article entitled \u201c Turning Things On Their Head \u201d ( \u201c ORG ogonem \u201d ) in which certain disagreements between FAC and the director of the centre as to the policy which should be followed by that centre were described .", "On DATE the weekly published another article , reporting on a session of ORG , during which a motion to remove ORG from his post of a member of the municipal executive board had been discussed . The article quoted certain arguments advanced by the councillors during the debate , referring to the lawfulness of the procedure and to various local controversies as they found their expression during the debates . It also summarised PERSON statements in the following way :", "\u201c Consistent \u201d J.C. once again presented his arguments . ( ... ) He reiterated his objections concerning ORG , threw in , for good measure , \u201c a municipal apartment for CARDINAL councillor \u201d , [ an issue of ] LOC for the \u201c PERSON \u201d \u2013 which he branded a \u201c gang \u201d . Many supervision procedures found his complaints about the FAC groundless , and [ the question of the apartment and the LOC ] he had invented himself ! Nothing like that had ever occurred . \u201d", "Another article on local politics , entitled \u201c What \u2019s up \u201d , was published on DATE . In this article its author reported on the last meeting of the local municipal council and also purported to explain to the reader the subtleties of the local politics and personal conflicts behind them .", "Following these publications ORG lodged a private bill of indictment with ORG , charging the applicant with defamation in that he had published CARDINAL articles blackening the plaintiff \u2019s reputation .", "In a judgment of DATE that court found that the applicant had committed a criminal offence of defamation punishable under LAW of DATE and conditionally discontinued the proceedings , fixing a probation period of DATE . It also obliged the applicant to apologise to the plaintiff in writing .", "The operative part of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c Having regard to the fact that the publication in DATE in issues ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of PERSON , a DATE of which [ ORG ] was an editor , of articles \u201c A. against ORG and \u201c What \u2019s up \u201d containing untrue information that GPE , who in the present case acted as a private prosecutor , had invented the issue of the [ municipal ] apartment and that he had \u2018 himself acknowledged that he had overstepped the limits of his competence by conducting many investigations on behalf of ORG , but without a relevant authorisation\u2019 amounted to making public such allegations about the plaintiff \u2019s conduct as could expose him to a risk of losing the public trust necessary for him to carry out his public function , amounted to a criminal offence provided for by LAW", "( ... )", "discontinues the criminal proceedings against the accused and sets the period of probation for DATE . \u201d", "The court observed that the applicant had published in the DATE a number of articles on local politics . They were aggressive towards PERSON and had shown him in a bad light . It was suggested that he had a tendency to fantasise and to overstep the limits of his competence . It was also implied that he was vexatious and unreliable and had abused his powers . The texts and the charges contained therein could therefore expose FAC to the risk of lowering him in public opinion .", "The court referred to the sub - titles of the text published on CARDINAL DATE , which had read as follows : \u201c PERSON forgot ! \u201d , \u201c Personal ambitions are at play here \u201d , \u201c Detrimental to the interests of the municipality \u201d , \u201c He invented it himself ! \u201d . The court observed that these sub - titles well conveyed the essence of the author \u2019s hostility towards GPE", "The court noted that the article had made reference to some municipal apartment . It further noted that it was aware of the fact that a municipal apartment had in the past been assigned to CARDINAL of the local politicians , a fact which created an uproar in GPE . The applicant had undoubtedly taken a certain shortcut when saying in the article of DATE :", "\u201c [ the question of the apartment and premises ] he had invented himself ! Nothing like that had ever occurred . \u201d", "In this connection , the court referred to numerous pieces of evidence referring to the public debate concerning that apartment and concluded that in the light of this evidence the suggestion that ORG had invented the whole story of the apartment was clearly erroneous .", "The court further observed that subsequently , on DATE , the DATE had published an article entitled \u201c What \u2019s up \u201d , purported to explain to the reader the subtleties of the local politics . The article had contained the following statement on J.C :", "\u201c He had himself admitted that he had overstepped his powers , having conducted many investigations on behalf of the municipal authorities , but without any relevant authorisation \u201d .", "The court observed that ORG had never admitted that he had been conducting any such investigations which could be established , for example , from TIME of the session of the municipal council held on DATE . Hence , the reference to both the alleged non - authorised investigations and to the admission that he had allegedly overstepped his powers was clearly untrue . Having regard thereto , the court considered that the applicant had failed to observe his fundamental obligation as a journalist , in particular in that he had failed to check the veracity of information he had published . In the proceedings before the court he was unable to refer to any source on which he had based his pertinent statements . It was open to him to consult the detailed records of the sessions of the local council , which he had failed to do .", "In the absence of convincing evidence to support the applicant \u2019s allegations and innuendos , the court concluded that when publishing the first CARDINAL articles he had published untrue information , which amounted to a criminal offence of defamation punishable under LAW .", "Referring to the conditional discontinuation of criminal proceedings , the court observed that the offence was not dangerous and that the applicant did not have any criminal record .", "The applicant appealed , submitting , inter alia , that the judgment amounted to a breach of his freedom of expression .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed his appeal , considering that the assessment of the evidence by the lower court was not arbitrary . It observed that the applicant had failed to show that he had any factual basis for his allegations when publishing the articles . No evidence had been submitted to the court to show that ORG had indeed admitted that he had overstepped the limits of his competence , as the applicant implied in the first article . Nor was it true that ORG had invented the issue of the municipal apartment having been assigned to CARDINAL local politician . The published statements being untrue , they amounted to defamation .", "The court also noted that under the case - law of ORG freedom of expression covered the transmission of information but not of misinformation ; conveying facts , not mendacious innuendos . Lastly , the court observed that the appeal referred to the applicant \u2019s notes prepared for the purpose of writing the articles , but that the case was limited to the examination of the texts as they were eventually published , i.e to the untrue and laconic phrases used in the articles .", "On DATE ORG , in a decision to which under applicable provisions of law no written grounds were prepared , dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill - founded .", "Under LAW of LAW of DATE , applicable at the material time , whoever disseminated untrue statements about another person \u2019s acts or character with an intention of lowering him or her in public esteem or of making him or her lose the public trust necessary for that person to carry out his or her public functions , committed a criminal offence punishable by a prison sentence of DATE .", "Pursuant to LAW , criminal proceedings could be conditionally discontinued , if the seriousness of the offence , punishable by a prison sentence of DATE , was not significant , if the circumstances in which it had been committed had been established , if the perpetrator did not have a criminal record and if his personal circumstances and qualities justified a conclusion that he would respect the legal order during the probation period .", "Under LAW , the court , when deciding to discontinue the proceedings for the probation period , could impose certain obligations on the accused : to pay appropriate compensation to the victim of the offence , to apologise to him / her , or to carry out certain work in the public interest .", "Under LAW , the court could fix a probation period of DATE , running from the date on which the judgment became final .", "Criminal proceedings could be resumed if during the probation period the offender disregarded the obligations imposed by the court , acted in flagrant breach of public order , or , in particular , committed a new criminal offence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
