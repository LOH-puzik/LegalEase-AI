The applicant , being handcuffed , was suspended from a metal bar CARDINAL tables , and Y. , together with NORP , delivered numerous blows with a rubber truncheon to various parts of his body . Subsequently a mask was put on the applicant \u2019s face , and other police officers continued to beat him until TIME The applicant signed numerous confessions . In the TIME NORP and NORP checked on him . As they considered that he had not been sufficiently cooperative , the applicant \u2019s ill - treatment continued until DATE .

According to the applicant , on DATE Y. and NORP again tried to obtain confessions from him , this time to several counts of murder . As the applicant resisted , he was handcuffed and beaten by CARDINAL officers for TIME . Thereafter he was placed face - down on the floor and immobilised with a chair .

Yet another forensic medical expert examination , which had been assigned on DATE and completed on DATE , reported the same injuries as before and classified them as minor . Given the ongoing cicatrisation process , it was impossible to establish their origin with precision : the wounds could have been caused either by electric burns or by blunt objects . The report further noted that , according to the medical file , it could not be ruled out that they had been caused by electric shocks . Lastly , the expert answered in the positive the investigator \u2019s question as to whether the wounds in question were in places within the applicant \u2019s reach ( \u201c accessible for self - infliction \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator at ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , to whom the case had apparently been transferred , discontinued the criminal investigation into the ill - treatment allegations , concluding that no indication of a crime could be discerned in the actions of the police officers . This decision was based , on the one hand , on the submissions of the applicant and CARDINAL co - accused ( found to be unreliable ) , and , on the other , on statements by CARDINAL police officers , including NORP and NORP , who either denied any coercion or submitted that they did not know anything ( found to be trustworthy ) . While both NORP and NORP admitted that they had questioned the applicant following his arrest on DATE , they maintained that he had confessed to some of the crimes under investigation of his own free will . When asked how he could explain the electric burns on the applicant \u2019s ankles , ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c I can explain them by the sheer inventiveness of this person , who could make explosive devices and who tortured his victims with devious methods . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigator also mentioned the medical certificate issued by the GPE doctor in respect of the applicant \u2019s injuries , without commenting on it .

Moreover , [ the applicant ] showed [ the investigators ] an underground cache of firearms and ammunition .", "However , later these persons [ the applicant and his co - accused ] , who have previous convictions and are bound by joint responsibility , retracted their earlier statements . In an attempt to escape criminal liability for particularly serious crimes , they , personally and with the assistance of their lawyers , sent complaints to various authorities attempting to cast doubt on their own depositions by allegations that they had been beaten by the police and that they had confessed under duress .", "The allegations of [ the applicant ] and the other co - accused are refuted by the ... statements of the police officers . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the above decision , concluding that it was not based on a comprehensive and objective investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s cellmates in the ORG at the material time , PERSON , when questioned by the investigator , confirmed that the applicant , on returning to the cell after his questioning , had had injuries and had hardly been able to stand on his feet . The other cellmates , who were also questioned , did not remember anything of that kind .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG investigator again discontinued the criminal investigation , finding nothing criminal in the police ORG actions . The decision was identical to that of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed this second decision also , for non - compliance with instructions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG investigator in charge of the ill - treatment investigation wrote to ORG ( his superior ) that it would be more appropriate to transfer the case to the ORPO dealing with the criminal case against the applicant . He noted that the ORG had criticised his decisions and made the following comment in that regard :", "\u201c ... compliance or non - compliance with those instructions would not have had any influence whatsoever on the conclusions reached in this case . This case has no prospect of judicial examination . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the pre - trial investigation in the criminal proceedings against the applicant ( and the co - accused ) was completed and the case was sent for trial to ORG ( \u201c the Regional Court \u201d ) , acting as a court of first instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG investigator , who was still in charge of the ill - treatment investigation , discontinued the proceedings by a decision worded identically to his earlier decisions of DATE and DATE . The only new part was a remark that the applicant \u2019s cellmates had been questioned and had not confirmed his allegations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s criminal case and decided that it was necessary to undertake an official investigation ( \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0456 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0441\u043b\u0456\u0434\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f ) into the GPE allegations about their ill - treatment by the police . This investigation was entrusted to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . It was noted in the court \u2019s ruling that the official investigation in question was required \u201c to take into account not only the explanations of the persons who took part in the investigative measures involving the defendants , but also the medical documents and expert reports on their injuries available in the case file \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the ORG \u2019s decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The case file does not contain a copy of this ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG investigator once again discontinued the investigation for lack of corpus delicti in the police ORG actions . In addition to the earlier reasoning it was noted that , despite all possible efforts , it had been impossible to establish the origin of the applicant \u2019s injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the above - mentioned decision as based on an incomplete investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG investigator again discontinued the case with a decision identical to that of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a letter to the ORG which stated as follows :", "\u201c During the judicial proceedings all the defendants changed their original statements and alleged that they had been subjected to ill - treatment ( sometimes amounting to torture ) during the pre - trial investigation , as a result of which they were forced to incriminate themselves and plead guilty to criminal offences which they had not committed .", "The statements of the defendants are indirectly confirmed by some of the materials in the case - file .", "The court requested the [ ORG ] DATE to undertake an official investigation into the GPE allegations .", "This judicial request was addressed to the ORG because the earlier investigation by the [ local prosecuting authorities ] had been superficial and failed to take into account all the arguments and the medical documents .", "All the materials in the case - file were forwarded to the [ ORG ] on DATE .", "However , in spite of numerous reminders , the judicial request has not been complied with .", "The examination of the evidence was completed on DATE , and the proceedings were stayed pending the [ ORG \u2019s ] conclusion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG wrote to the President of ORG that , on the instructions of the ORG , it had thoroughly investigated the GPE allegations of ill - treatment and dismissed them as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant , along with CARDINAL other persons , guilty of premeditated murder committed with particular cruelty , for profit , repeatedly and following conspiracy by a group of persons , as well as banditry , illegal firearms handling , carjacking , deliberate destruction of the property of others , and multiple counts of theft and armed robbery . The applicant was additionally found guilty of illegal drug possession . He was sentenced to a total of DATE imprisonment , with confiscation of all his personal property . The court relied on , among other things , the applicant \u2019s confessions made during the pre - trial investigation \u2013 in particular , on DATE even though he had retracted them in the judicial proceedings . It also relied on the material evidence ( firearms and ammunition ) shown by the applicant to the police on CARDINAL and DATE . The court found that the applicant \u2019s allegation of ill - treatment in police custody had been thoroughly examined by the official investigation and had been rightly dismissed as unsubstantiated . The term of the applicant \u2019s sentence was to be calculated from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , both personally and through his lawyer , appealed in cassation . He submitted that the first - instance court had distorted the facts of the case and that his conviction had been based mainly on confessions obtained from him by coercion and in breach of his right to legal assistance . He emphasised in this connection that ORG had relied on the investigation of his illtreatment allegations , which had earlier been recognised as superficial and otherwise flawed . It was for that reason that the trial court had decided to entrust the official investigation of his allegations to ORG , since the earlier investigation undertaken by the local prosecution authorities had not taken into account all his arguments or the medical documents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further emphasised that he ( as well as the other defendants ) had never been assigned victim status in the criminal investigation regarding the ill - treatment allegations . He noted that on DATE the ORG had discontinued the investigation , finding that there was no case to be examined , and ORG assignment of the official investigation to the ORG had never been implemented . The applicant pointed out that the fact that he had sustained injuries had not even been mentioned in the final decision . Lastly , he criticised the first - instance court for not having given any consideration to his continued detention in the ORG ( for DATE instead of the legal maximum of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal in cassation . It concluded that his guilt was sufficiently proved by the evidence , including his own confessions . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint of a violation of his right to legal assistance , ORG noted that he had had his rights in that respect explained to him following his arrest on DATE and that he had been legally represented thereafter . In so far as his allegation of ill - treatment was concerned , ORG referred to the investigation into the matter by the prosecution authorities undertaken at the request of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG returned the case file on the ill - treatment allegations to the ORG as \u201c no longer required \u201d .
