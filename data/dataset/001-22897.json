CYPRUS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was accused of rape and committed for trial before ORG . It was alleged that the applicant had raped the complainant at his surgery during a urological examination .", "According to the applicant , during the investigation proceedings , the police did not believe the complainant \u2019s allegations . This led to a strong reaction from the complainant \u2019s lawyer , a person with political connections who , in a letter dated DATE to the Chief of Police , called for the immediate replacement of the investigating officer , which was done without informing the applicant .", "The applicant contends that the new investigating officer carried out a search at the applicant \u2019s surgery \u2013 where the alleged offence took place \u2013 without a search warrant , in the presence of the complainant and her lawyer , but in the absence of the applicant and his lawyer who were not even notified of the search . The new investigating officer took a statement from the complainant which was different from an earlier one in which she had said that she was not certain that she had actually been raped .", "The police investigations in respect of the rape for which the applicant was convicted started on DATE of the incident , i.e. CARDINAL DATE . The applicant was interrogated by the police about his involvement in this incident during TIME . He was acting on legal advice . The knickers and other objects connected with the case against the applicant were taken by the police also that day and were delivered on CARDINAL DATE to the Government forensic expert ( who testified during the trial as a prosecution witness).The expert proceeded to make scientific tests in order to discover whether there was Vaseline on any of the objects delivered to her by the police .", "At the pre - trial stage , the defence asked for the discovery of a number of documents and the knickers of the complainant , which were in the prosecution \u2019s possession . The defence wished to submit the knickers to scientific examination by its own experts in order to challenge the finding of the prosecution expert , a civil servant , that there was Vaseline on the knickers . When the prosecution refused , the defence successfully applied on DATE to ORG which , on DATE , ordered discovery on condition that the knickers remained in the prosecution \u2019s possession with access being arranged for the defence examination .", "On an ex parte application for certiorari by the Attorney General before a single judge of ORG , enforcement of the order was suspended . Then on DATE , after hearing the parties , the single judge granted judicial review and quashed ORG order on the grounds of an excess of jurisdiction .", "The applicant appealed . On DATE the appeal was dismissed by a majority of CARDINAL to CARDINAL in ORG . It held that , in the absence of a specific provision in the law of criminal procedure , the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue an order for discovery , and that neither Articles CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) and CARDINAL ) of the LAW nor LAW ) of the LAW , empowered the court to issue such an order . ORG considered that the handing over of the knickers to the defence might lead to their destruction and thus deprive the prosecution of the possibility of presenting its case fairly in court . The court also held that whether the denial of a scientific examination would render the proceedings unfair was a matter which could only be examined at the end of the trial , but that ORG could not take positive measures to ensure the fairness of those proceedings .", "ORG , inter alia , stated :", "\u201c The issue of the orders in questions , and in particular the order for the handing over of exhibits , may possibly lead to other complications , damaging to the proper administration of justice .", "Such a possibility \u2013 the destruction or alteration of an object relevant to the proof of the case DATE will have devastating consequences on the prosecution case , and the orders in question , intended to render the trial fair , will produce the opposite result ...", "There is no legislative or procedural authorisation for dealing before the trial with issues of what is disclosable , substantial , relevant or irrelevant . The course adopted by ORG does not safeguard the right to a fair trial . On the contrary , it offends the principle of equality of arms and only contributes to delays , in violation of Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW . ... \u201d", "Thereafter the hearing before ORG commenced . On DATE the prosecution began with the production of evidence before the court . Prosecution witness CARDINAL was the complainant herself . During DATE of her testimony she was asked by the prosecution to view the knickers and she identified them as those she had worn at the time of the rape . Expert evidence in relation to the knickers was produced by the prosecution on DATE , with the testimony of prosecution witness CARDINAL , PERSON , an expert at ORG . The knickers became evidence at the trial on DATE . She stated that DATE after the offence she had \u201c washed \u201d the pants in certain chemical liquids , thus managing to extract all the Vaseline from it , which she then preserved in a tube which was also produced as an exhibit in court .", "Furthermore the expert excluded the possibility of there being a substance in the material out of which the knickers were made which was of the same chemical composition as Vaseline and the possibility of a finding , after a further examination of the knickers , that Vaseline had existed on them . No evidence contradicting this opinion or creating doubts as to its correctness was produced by the defence .", "On DATE , ORG found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . The ORG based its decision mainly on the credibility of the complainant in respect of whom the court stated the following :", "\u201c Our global view is that [ the complainant ] is completely credible . Her evidence has all those elements which characterise and determine the credibility of evidence and we note the consistency , completeness , accuracy , naturalness and cogency of her whole relation , beyond , as we have already observed , the very good impression she made in the witness box . We also find nothing with reference to the matters discussed above , which affects or weakens this view of ours . On the contrary , [ the complainant \u2019s ] evidence has passed the test of trial with reference to its contents and the rest of the evidence as well as with reference to the question of any motive . We would simply mention the fact that no motive was attributed to [ the complainant ] and no submission was made that her version is made up and no such suggestion was made by [ the applicant ] in his unsworn statement , but she was only cross - examined as we have noticed in relation to those parts of her version which concerned her statements to the police ... \u201d .", "ORG found that the evidence of the complainant was further corroborated by the fact that she made the first complaint to CARDINAL persons whose testimony was accepted by the court . The court also took into account in corroboration of the complainant \u2019s allegations the fact that , according to a prosecution expert , evidence of Vaseline was found on the knickers which the complainant had been wearing at the material time , thus supporting her claim that the applicant had put Vaseline on her . In defence , it was argued that it had not been proved that the knickers in question were the pair worn by the complainant at the material time . However , ORG was satisfied from the evidence that the knickers on which Vaseline had been found were those of the complainant .", "It appears that the defence did not argue before ORG that the non - discovery of the knickers had the effect of depriving the applicant of a fair trial .", "Regarding the complaint of the defence that the police and the prosecuting authorities did not perform their duties impartially , ORG stated that the case had to be determined on the basis of the evidence and that \u201c to the extent that any actions of the police or other persons involved in the case concerned the evidence , we do not find anything which could affect our view regarding the credibility of [ the complainant ] \u201d . ORG also dismissed this complaint , on appeal , as being unsubstantiated .", "ORG further held that the allegation of the applicant that he had had an unfair trial because the prosecution failed to disclose to the defence a number of statements made by the complainant to the police which might have been relevant to the defence , was not substantiated , given the fact that this matter was neither pursued nor clarified during the cross - examination of the complainant .", "As regards the defence argument that , soon after the incident , the complainant \u2019s lawyer addressed a letter to the Attorney ORG and ORG in which no clear reference to the offence of rape was made , the court found this to be \u201c fully understandable in view of the circumstances , the letter itself explaining the reason for the lack of certainty as to whether there was rape or only attempted rape in view of the fact that the difference between the CARDINAL is , as was meant to be , of legal significance and many times this is not easy to define \u201d .", "The applicant appealed against his conviction to ORG .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and confirmed the applicant \u2019s conviction .", "Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the Criminal Procedure PERSON . CARDINAL provide as follows :", "\u201c When the accused pleads \u201c not guilty \u201d then , through a written request to the prosecution , he is entitled to be supplied with copies of the written statements and the documents which were obtained during the investigation of the criminal offence with which he is charged . \u201d", "\u201c At every preliminary enquiry and at every trial , the court shall have the discretionary power to regulate the course of the proceedings in any way which may appear desirable and which is not inconsistent with the provisions of this PERSON . \u201d", "Where the offence is of a sexual nature , the evidence of the complainant must be corroborated . By virtue of an express statutory provision LAW of the Evidence Law , PERSON . CARDINAL a first complaint constitutes corroborative evidence per se ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
