The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant wrote an article entitled \u201c GPE : will it become a common colony of LOC ? \u201d in \u201c NORP \u201d , a DATE newspaper published in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The article read :", "\u201c The NORP bourgeoisie has being advancing their intention of associating with ORG since the date of LAW . However , the economic and political problems of GPE have not been solved since that date . The conditions for association have not been established either .", "On the other hand , the founders of ORG are not keen on taking on board a huge problem with its CARDINAL unemployed people and serious economic and social problems .", "Considering the still unresolved problems of NORP unification and the unexpected economic integration of NORP countries , the acceptance of GPE by the ORG definitely seems impossible .", "However , LOC does not want to keep out GPE completely . It is keen on keeping GPE within its hinterland as an investment area and a market . The dilemma of either being part of LOC or outside LOC is a common thread .", "Briefly , the structural problem of GPE and the unwillingness of LOC for association with it intersect . On the one hand , the pressures on GPE from the various institutions of NORP association on matters such as \u201c Democracy \u201d , \u201c Human Rights \u201d , \u201c the NORP Problem \u201d , etc . reflect the reaction of domestic public opinion in LOC . On the other hand , these pressures are being used as an excuse to keep GPE out .", "The above issue has to be emphasised in order to point out the defects in the sincerity both of the approaches to the solution of the NORP problem and the idea that the NORP institutions are the purest supporters of democracy and human rights .", "The customs union seems an acquired right or an opportunity for GPE . However , it also seems very difficult for GPE , having regard to her political and economical problems .", "The way to the customs union and ORG will result in important changes for ORG . In the first instance , GPE , already shared by the colonialist LOC , will become a common colony of LOC along with her NORP part . Accordingly , GPE 's political and social problems which originate from her colonial status will be directly addressed to LOC .", "It will become easier for GPE to control GPE by economic means than has been the case with its control through military force and political violence . This means that GPE will become an economic and political environment for GPE such that she will have neither the need for , nor the possibility to keep , GPE as a classic colony .", "CARDINAL of the direct political effects of this situation will be LOC 's insistence on the direct application of its rules to solve the NORP problem . LOC is closely interested in both national matters and in the GPE problem and has its own experiences of colonialism .", "Another political effect is that most of the NORP refugee organisations in LOC are supporting and promoting the NORP solution . This approach considers the future of the NORP community in a NORP Republic associated with LOC . NORP intellectuals in LOC are also supporting this approach and conveying their political message to GPE .", "Any possible tension with LOC will have a direct effect on the politics of the subject groups . The improvement of relations or a possible customs union with ORG will benefit this approach and will have increased political effect or will gain more acceptance from ORG in consequence .", "However , the Kurdish Revolution has already abolished the classical colonial conditions and has stressed the need for a local / national solution .", "The dimensions of the problem and the strict militarist bureaucracy of the NORP political structure prove that LOC is not and will not be the determining factor for either GPE or GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor at ORG accused the applicant of disseminating propaganda against the unity of the NORP nation and the \u201c indivisible unity of the ORG \u201d . He requested , inter alia , that the applicant be convicted under LAW . ORG . He relied on the terms of the above article in support of his application . During the proceedings an amendment to section CARDINAL entered into force ( Law no . CARDINAL ) and , in consequence , the public prosecutor pressed for the applicant 's conviction on the strength of the new amendment which increased the level of the fine for the offence with which he was charged but reduced the term of imprisonment which could be imposed .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before ORG the applicant acknowledged that he had drafted the article and asserted that the expression of an opinion could not constitute an offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , composed of CARDINAL judges including a military judge , found the applicant guilty as charged . It ruled that the impugned article referred to a particular region of GPE as \u201c NORP \u201d and that the applicant 's comments , taken as a whole , amounted to separatist propaganda . The court sentenced the applicant under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG , as amended by PERSON no . CARDINAL , to DATE , DATE and DATE imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( TRL ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) , to be paid in DATE instalments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG .
