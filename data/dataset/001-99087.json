During the ensuing investigation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the CARDINAL officers , sergeants GPE and GPE , stated that they saw the applicant jump over a fence , enter the yard of a Mr GPE , and head towards GPE 's henhouse . After waiting for TIME and making certain that the applicant was trying to steal hens , the officers , both of whom were armed with pistols loaded with live cartridges , intervened . They split up and approached the yard from different directions . When the applicant noticed them , he jumped the fence and started running through empty plots towards the nearby GPE neighbourhood . Despite several warnings , he did not stop . Then CARDINAL of the officers drew his pistol and fired at him with the intention of stopping him . At that moment the applicant was at QUANTITY from the officer and turned sideways . After that he kept on running . The other officer continued the chase , fired twice in the air , and caught up with the applicant QUANTITY from the place where he had been shot .
