Prisoners wishing to attend had to sign up with their supervisors ( wychowawca ) . Subsequently , a list of persons approved for a particular GPE had been prepared by remand centre staff , with the help of a special computer program . The system had been designed to select prisoners on a rotation basis , according to their classification groups and in a way so as not to mix prisoners classed as dangerous detainees with those who did not require any special security measures . At times , however , individual prisoners were rejected because they did not belong to the group authorised to attend Mass on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Consequently , the applicant \u2019s treatment was changed slightly . It was also established that the first symptoms of that disorder had appeared prior to the applicant \u2019s detention , in DATE . An expert in dermatology , appointed by the domestic court , excluded the possibility that the applicant had developed the illness because of contact with an allegedly dirty and mouldy mattress .

The evidence which was obtained by the civil court , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s medical history , witness testimony and the report of an expert in dermatology , had disproved the applicant \u2019s allegations that he had contracted his skin condition in the remand centre because his mattress had been dirty and damp and that his illness had been inadequately treated .", "CARDINAL .
