ORG of the ORG of ORG ( PERSON tiesas ORG lietu departaments ) examined separately each branch of the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . First of all , the ORG considered whether the applicant had a right to claim compensation for an apartment of the same standard under domestic law . The ORG established that a draft law on compensation referred to in DATE , paragraph CARDINAL of ORG had not been enacted , and that consideration therefore had to be given to whether tenants\u2019 right to compensation derived from the Laws on the Return of Real Estate to ORG and on ORG in GPE . The first of those laws did not provide for such compensation rights , but for social rights to retain the right to lease ( section CARDINAL ) , to statutory rent limits ( CARDINAL ) and to have another apartment allocated in the event of eviction ( sections DATE ) . Under the second law only former owners or their legal heirs , not tenants , were entitled to compensation . The ORG concluded that the applicant did not have a subjective right to compensation in order to acquire an apartment of the same standard on the basis of the above - mentioned laws .", "CARDINAL . The ORG then proceeded to examine whether such a right to compensation could be derived from ORG , since under LAW that law every person has a right to request adequate compensation for pecuniary or non - pecuniary damage suffered as a result of an administrative act ( administrat\u012bvais akts ) or action of a public authority ( faktisk\u0101 r\u012bc\u012bba ) . The ORG considered whether the elements of an action of a public authority were found in the relevant actions or omissions of the ORG authorities ( whether the person had a right to such act and whether , by such act , his or her subjective rights or interests might have been affected ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since the applicant did not have a right under domestic law to privatise the apartment in the denationalised building , he could not request the authorities to ensure such rights or to ensure that they were protected during the process of denationalisation of the building where his rented apartment was located . Therefore , the denationalisation of the building was not an action of a public authority in so far as the applicant was concerned ( within the meaning of ORG ) and was not subject to administrative proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Taking into account that the drafting and enactment of laws was the prerogative of the ORG \u2019s legislative power , the alleged omission of ORG to draft a law on compensation was not an action of a public authority ( within the meaning of GPE ) and , thus , was not subject to administrative proceedings .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s running a risk of having to pay higher rent and losing his home , the ORG noted that the applicant was dissatisfied with the implementation of the ORG \u2019s policy , which is not an action of a public authority and therefore can not be reviewed in administrative proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Finally , as concerns the allegedly discriminatory regulations of ORG , the ORG considered that examination of such a claim fell within the competence of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the ORG dismissed the claim as inadmissible on the grounds that it was not subject to administrative proceedings and that the applicant did not have a right of claim .", "CARDINAL .
