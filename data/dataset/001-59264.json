According to the public prosecutor \u2019s office , the applicant had failed to transfer , on behalf of PERSON , part of the amounts due under the contract to the NORP partner and had spent it for PERSON own purposes , thus causing damage of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of aggravated embezzlement and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine , under LAW and DATE ( a ) of LAW .", "ORG found that , in the context of a commission - contract scheme valid DATE and DATE , the applicant , acting on behalf of PERSON , had failed to transfer part of the amounts collected from the NORP partner to the NORP partner , contrary to what he should have done under the contract ; in fact , he had spent it for PERSON own purposes .", "ORG noted the applicant \u2019s defence that he had simply failed to pay the necessary attention to his contractual duty to transfer the amounts in question ; that he had not been aware until DATE that the amounts in question had been available for transfer ; that PERSON subsequent failure to fulfil its contractual obligations had simply been due to its inability to recover some outstanding debts ; and , finally , that he had entered into a verbal agreement with the NORP partner about the use of part of the amounts in question .", "However , taking into consideration the testimony of a Mr S. and of CARDINAL further witnesses , ORG was convinced that the applicant had deliberately failed to transfer the amounts in question in order to finance the activities of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against ORG judgment , whereas the public prosecutor \u2019s office accepted it .", "In his appeal the applicant sought to be acquitted on the ground that the findings of fact in his case had been erroneous .", "CARDINAL .
