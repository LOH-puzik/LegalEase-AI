BELGIUM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The purpose of the ORG \u2019s request is to obtain a decision from the ORG as to whether the facts of the case do or do not disclose a violation by GPE of the obligations binding on it under LAW para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The relevant facts of the case as they appear from ORG and memorial , the Government \u2019s memorial , the documents produced and the addresses of the representatives appearing before the ORG may be summarised as follows :", "CARDINAL . PERSON , a NORP citizen , born on DATE , and a company director , has his residence at GPE . At the time of lodging his ORG with the Commission ( DATE ) , he was imprisoned in the central gaol at PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings having been instituted against him by the Procureur du Roi at GPE for obtaining money by menaces , fraud and fraudulent conversion , the PERSON was arrested on DATE and subsequently charged with a number of offences of fraud , fraudulent conversion , forgery and uttering forged documents , issuing uncovered cheques and fraudulent bills as well as obtaining credit by false pretences .", "On DATE , he was found guilty by ORG on DATE out of QUANTITY counts and sentenced to a DATE \u2019s imprisonment and a fine of MONEY .", "On DATE , ORG in GPE modified this judgment against which both GPE and the prosecution had appealed on CARDINALth and CARDINALth DATE . It found all the charges to be established including those on which GPE had been acquitted at first instance , stressed the seriousness of the offences and referred to his previous convictions . It accordingly increased his principal sentence to DATE imprisonment and further decided that on serving his sentence he should be \" placed at the disposal of the Government \" for DATE thus granting an application by the prosecution which had been rejected by ORG .", "On DATE , the Applicant appealed to ORG against the judgment of ORG and against that of ORG . He lodged a memorial on DATE . The ORG department ( parquet ) at ORG did not avail itself of its right to file a counter - memorial . A public hearing took place before the second chamber of ORG on DATE ; the Applicant himself was present at that hearing but not his counsel . ORG heard the report of Judge PERSON , its rapporteur , and then the submissions of the PERSON g\u00e9n\u00e9ral , Mr. PERSON , to the effect that the CARDINAL appeals should be dismissed . In its judgment delivered DATE , after deliberations held in private the ORG dismissed the CARDINAL appeals .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG which he lodged with the Commission on DATE ( No . CARDINAL ) , GPE complained of the judgment of CARDINALst DATE and the judgments on appeal of DATE and DATE . Protesting his innocence and alleging the violation of ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL , article DATE ) of the LAW , he presented numerous complaints almost all of which were declared inadmissible by the Commission on DATE and CARDINALth April CARDINAL . On DATE , however , the ORG accepted CARDINAL complaint which related to the question whether the presence of a member of ORG department at the deliberations of ORG was compatible with the principle of \" equality of arms \" and hence with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "In fact , the PERSON g\u00e9n\u00e9ral , Mr. PERSON , was present at the ORG \u2019s deliberations in accordance with LAW which provides \" ... in cassation proceedings the ORG g\u00e9n\u00e9ral has the right to be present , without voting , when the ORG retires to consider its decision \" . It may be observed that this Decree has recently been replaced by certain provisions of the new LAW of CARDINALth DATE ) which was not yet in force when ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s appeals . The above - mentioned provision of the CARDINAL Decree has been re - enacted , in substance , in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Following the decision of CARDINALth April CARDINAL declaring this complaint admissible , a ORG ascertained the facts of the case .", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG and ORG , the PERSON maintained that the presence of a member of ORG department at ORG at the deliberations of DATE had violated Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . Without disputing that there is a considerable difference between the respective functions of ORG department at ORG and the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2019s department at the courts below , he stressed that in accordance with the law the former does sometimes appear as a party even though this did not happen in this case . Furthermore , the ORG department at ORG does , in the view of the Applicant , exercise supervision over the GPE g\u00e9n\u00e9raux at ORG ( section CARDINAL of GPE of DATE ) ; a very strong statutory tie , therefore , links him with them , his subordinates , even if in practice the supervision in question is nowadays rather discreet . Again , the ORG department at ORG was , in the great majority of cases , the opponent - at any rate potential - of the convicted persons who appealed to the highest court in GPE : the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral usually submitted that their appeals should be dismissed and his opinion was nearly always adopted - as in this case - by the judges . Then the Applicant stressed that the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral , after having developed his submissions at the end of the hearing in open court , also participated in its private deliberations from which the parties are excluded . This caused a violation of the rights of the defence and , particularly , of the principle of \" equality of arms \" , as it was defined in the opinions given by the Commission in the PERSON , ORG , PERSON and GPE cases ( Applications Nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , QUANTITY , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and DATE , ORG , Vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL to CARDINAL and CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) . The Applicant specified that he did not mean , however , to raise the slightest doubt as to the absolute conscientiousness with which ORG fulfils its function or to suggest that the ORG department might attempt unduly to influence the court in any direction other than that of strict justice . In other words , GPE was not criticising persons but rather the institution which gave an advantage to ORG department . Admittedly , the legislation in issue dated back for DATE and ORG had decided on CARDINAL occasions that it did not need to amend it . The legislation , however , dated from a time of absolute monarchy and carried that stamp ; furthermore , the incorporation of the LAW into the domestic law of a ORG necessarily \" kept bringing to light new controversial points which had not been noticed by the national legislature \" .", "In his observations of DATE , DATE after the lodging of the LOC , GPE further complained that he had not been able to reply to the submissions of ORG department at ORG : he had not been informed of this submission before the hearing of DATE nor did he have the right to the last word at that hearing .", "The Applicant applied for the repeal of the legislation under attack and claimed pecuniary damages .", "CARDINAL . On the failure of the attempt made by ORG to arrange a friendly settlement , ORG drew up a ORG as required under LAW article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . This ORG was adopted on DATE and transmitted to ORG on DATE . ORG expressed therein , by CARDINAL votes against CARDINAL , the opinion that Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW was not violated in the present case . CARDINAL members of the majority expressed a joint concurring opinion and the CARDINAL members forming the minority expressed their dissent in a joint opinion .", "CARDINAL . After the case was referred to the ORG , the PERSON returned to and developed some of his earlier arguments in a document which the ORG appended to its memorial . As regards his main complaint , the PERSON stated that he associated himself with the opinion of the minority of the Commission .", "Arguments of the ORG and the Government", "CARDINAL . Unlike the Government , the Commission considers unanimously that Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW is applicable in the present case to the proceedings in cassation .", "In the view of the majority of the Commission , however , the presence of a member of ORG department attached to ORG at the deliberations of DATE was not incompatible with this text . In actual fact , this highest court in GPE does not deal with the merits ( fond ) of cases ( Article CARDINAL of the LAW and LAW of DATE ) ; save in certain exceptional matters , irrelevant to this case , ORG sole function is to decide questions of law . The ORG department is confined to assisting ORG in the exercise of its functions . That department does not , ordinarily , conduct prosecutions and it has not the character of a party ( LAW ) . In almost all cases it is completely independent of the Minister of ORG and has no right of direction over the ORG department which is attached to the courts of first instance and appeal and which is the prosecuting authority in normal cases . The participation of the ORG department at the deliberations of ORG does not , therefore , conflict with the principle of \" equality of arms \" , even when it is examined in the light of the precedents set by ORG ( PERSON , ORG , PERSON and GPE cases ) .", "The Delegates of the Commission brought to the attention of the ORG the joint dissenting opinion of CARDINAL members of the Commission : these members of the Commission were of the opinion that the participation of the ORG department at the deliberations of ORG did not comply with the requirements of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) .", "The Commission did not deem it necessary to express an opinion on the \" new \" complaints which appeared in GPE \u2019s above - mentioned observations of CARDINALth DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; in the ORG \u2019s view , the Applicant presented them only as special aspects of the principle of \" equality of arms \" which the majority of the Commission did not consider to be violated .", "In its memorial of CARDINALnd DATE and at the hearing held on DATE , the ORG requested the ORG :", "\" to decide whether or not , in the course of the proceedings before ORG in the GPE case on DATE , there was a violation of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW , insofar as this provision requires a fair trial , by reason of the participation of the representative of ORG department in the deliberations of ORG \" .", "CARDINAL . The Government does not dispute that a member of ORG department at ORG , after submitting in open court that the Applicant \u2019s appeals should be refused , was present in a consultative capacity at the deliberations of DATE , but maintains that this did not involve any violation of the right guaranteed by LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "That highest court in GPE does not deal with the merits of cases ( Article CARDINAL of the LAW and LAW of DATE ) . In spite of its judicial nature , which has been developed through a long evolution , ORG fulfils a function which has never ceased to have some relation with the work of the legislature . Established in the interests of the law itself , ORG judges judgments and not persons , save in certain exceptional matters which are irrelevant to the present case . It is not therefore the function of that ORG to decide disputes concerning civil rights and obligations or to determine criminal charges ( d\u00e9cider , soit des contestations sur ses droits et obligations de caract\u00e8re civil , soit du bien - fond\u00e9 de toute accusation en mati\u00e8re p\u00e9nale ) within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) , as that provision has been interpreted in a series of decisions by the bodies set up to ensure the observance of the Convention .", "As regards the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2019s department at ORG , it must be distinguished fundamentally from the ORG department attached to the courts below . As a general rule , it has not the character of a party ( LAW DATE ) ; in the very rare cases where under the relevant law the department assumes the position of a party and institutes prosecutions the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral is not present at the deliberations ( Article CARDINAL of the Decree of DATE ) . As the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral is not concerned with the question of the guilt of the accused , he is neither their adversary nor the tool of the prosecution . For example , there is nothing to prevent him from submitting to the ORG that an appeal in cassation brought by ORG department at ORG should be dismissed or from putting forward on his own initiative grounds for setting aside a conviction ; and there are statistics to show that this is often the case . The ORG department attached to ORG is not , therefore , in alliance with the ORG department attached to the courts below ; besides , the ORG g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at ORG exercises , in practice , over that department supervision of a purely doctrinal and scientific nature without the least power of direction ( LAW of DATE ) . Furthermore , the ORG g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at ORG is entirely independent in his relations with the Minister of Justice .", "In short , the role of the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral is of the same kind as the functions of ORG itself : it consists , ordinarily , in no more than giving technical and objective assistance to the ORG in order to ensure the observance of the law , consistency in judicial precedent and good drafting of the judgments . To sum up , the ORG g\u00e9n\u00e9ral attached to ORG \" forms part of , and is identified with \" , the ORG like the judges . In these circumstances , the presence of CARDINAL of the members of ORG department at the deliberations did not upset the \" equality of arms \" to the detriment of the Applicant . There was some inequality in this case but it worked to the advantage of GPE ; unlike him , the ORG departments attached to the lower courts whose decisions were challenged in cassation did not have an opportunity to put forward their arguments in open court on DATE ( LAW ) ; those departments did not even avail themselves of their right to reply in writing to the memorial filed by the appellant on DATE . In the ORG \u2019s view , the GPE case can not be compared with the PERSON and GPE cases ; the present case is closer to the PERSON and NORP cases in which ORG and ORG did not find any violation of LAW ) .", "For the rest , the legislation in dispute is DATE , in which time it has never been subjected to criticism in GPE by writers or the Bar who are , however , most attentive to everything which relates to the rights of the defence . On CARDINAL occasions , ORG decided explicitly to maintain this legislation , the first time without any change ( at the time of the passing of the Act of DATE ) , the second time in substance and after examination of the question from the point of view of LAW ) . These circumstances raise something like a presumption in favour of the compatibility of the legislation in question with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) ; they also show that the participation of ORG department at the deliberations of ORG does not open the door to abuse .", "As to GPE \u2019s \" new \" complaints , they are inadmissible because they were not included in the original ORG . The Government considers that they are in any event unsustainable ; in its view , it is just because ORG department is not a party that its submissions are made at the end of the oral proceedings without being communicated in advance to the parties .", "In its memorial of DATE and at the oral hearing held on DATE , the ORG asked the ORG :", "\" to hold that , having regard to the role which NORP law confers on the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral attached to ORG and to his special position in NORP judicial procedure , his presence in a non - voting capacity at the ORG \u2019s deliberations as expressly provided for in that legislation is not of such a nature as to violate the principle of \u2018 equality of arms\u2019 where , as in the present case , the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral is not himself a party to the proceedings as applicant ;", "to decide in consequence that , in the proceedings which took place in the GPE case before ORG on DATE , there was no violation of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW by reason of the presence of the representative of ORG department , Mr. PERSON , PERSON g\u00e9n\u00e9ral , at the deliberations of the judges \" ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
