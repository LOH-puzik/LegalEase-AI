After they questioned PERSON again , he explained that in fact he and PERSON had taken a bus and had gone to the city centre , in the area where a large market was located . There they had played with a ball alongside a small canal dividing the CARDINAL carriageways of a busy main road .

On DATE they questioned PERSON , a friend of the family , who alleged to have received an anonymous telephone call concerning PERSON . Later on , the police investigated CARDINAL other anonymous calls , which did not reveal anything as to PERSON 's whereabouts and were most likely hoaxes provoked by the wide publicity which the case had attracted .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE it decided that the examination of the case was to continue behind closed doors , as it concerned classified information about operative methods of the police .

On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint about delays ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , arguing that the proceedings had been unnecessarily protracted . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , finding that the proceedings had indeed lasted too long , instructed GPE to accelerate them .", "CARDINAL .

In those proceedings the GPE ORG examined under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) a claim by the applicant against ORG and ORG .

In a judgment of DATE GPE allowed the applicant 's claim and awarded him the full amount of damages sought , which was MONEY ( ORG ) , the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) .

NORP In DATE GPE allowed the applicant 's claim against the Government and dismissed his claims against the remaining defendants . Referring to the ORG 's obligations under LAW and LAW on the Rights of the Child , it found that the Government was under an obligation to ensure that PERSON was being afforded the necessary protection and care .

The Government had had the necessary financial resources and the procedural possibility to allot them . They had , moreover , been approached with numerous requests by the applicant .

The courts awarded the applicant ORG DATE , the equivalent of approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . State liability for damages is provided for in the ORG and ORG of DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .

In certain cases , where the domestic courts consider that the provisions of the ORG are inapplicable , they examine claims against ORG bodies under the general law of tort , laid down in LAW of DATE . LAW provides that everyone is to make good any damage which they have caused to another . By DATE , a person who has entrusted another with performing a job is liable for the damage caused by that other person in the course of or in connection with the performance of the job . CARDINAL of the prerequisites of liability in tort under those provisions is the wrongfulness of the impugned conduct .", "CARDINAL .
