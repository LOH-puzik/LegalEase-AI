The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the town of GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . Prior to DATE the legal representation of defendants in criminal proceedings could be conducted only by a licensed advocate . The advocate \u2019s rights and obligations , and the required standards of professional competence and conduct were set forth in a separate ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . Other persons , including those holding a university law degree , were excluded from providing legal representation in criminal cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the relevant provisions of LAW unconstitutional and the parliament introduced relevant amendments to the LAW in DATE ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was involved in a traffic accident , in which his car collided with another car . On DATE , criminal proceedings concerning the accident were instituted against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant signed an agreement with Mr M. for legal representation in the above - mentioned criminal proceedings . The latter was a lawyer , who held a university degree in law and who had a private legal practice , but who was not a licensed advocate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator allowed PERSON to act as defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Dimitrov Court \u201d ) held a committal hearing in the case and decided to remit the case for additional investigation on the grounds that the applicant \u2019s right to mount a defence had been breached during the pre - trial investigation . The court noted that , in accordance with LAW , the right to provide legal assistance is conferred upon advocates and other legal specialists ( the term used to describe degree - educated practicing lawyers who have not been called to the Bar ) , but the right of the latter to act as defence counsel required to be defined by a specific piece of legislation . As there was no such law authorising a legal specialist with a private practice , such as Mr M. , to provide legal assistance in criminal matters , the decision of the investigator to allow such a specialist to take part in the case had been unlawful and therefore the applicant \u2019s right to mount a defence had been violated . The court ordered additional investigation with the participation of an advocate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , claiming that limiting his right to a free choice of defence counsel was contrary to the LAW and the decision of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE , in reply to a request by the applicant that criminal proceedings be instituted against the relevant judge of ORG for alleged deliberate failure to comply with the decision of ORG concerning the right to a free choice of defence counsel , ORG informed the applicant that the court had rightly decided to remove PERSON from the applicant \u2019s case because he was not a licensed advocate .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant asked ORG to remit his case for further investigation on the grounds that his right to mount a defence had been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court rejected his request . The court established that the applicant \u2019s right to mount a defence had been complied with as a result of the participation of Mr O. in the additional investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant notified the court that Mr O. was not his defence counsel and that he had seen him only once , in DATE , when he had pointed out to the investigator that he needed defence counsel but did not wish to be represented by Mr O. because he had not been freely chosen by him . Therefore , he contested the court \u2019s conclusion that his right to mount a defence had been complied with .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected his appeal on the grounds that decisions as to the remittal of a criminal case were not subject to appeal in cassation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected a request by the applicant that Mr M. be allowed to represent him as his defence counsel because the law did not provide that a private practice lawyer could act as defence counsel in a criminal case . At the same time , the court accepted the refusal by the applicant to have PERSON O. appointed as his defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the same court returned the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE without consideration on the grounds that the contested decision was not subject to a separate appeal .", "CARDINAL .

During a court hearing on CARDINAL DATE ORG examined a request from the applicant asking it to accept his dismissal of a lawyer , PERSON , who had been appointed by the court to represent him after the decision of DATE , and to appoint his wife as his representative . The court allowed his request in part . It allowed the applicant \u2019s wife to be his defence counsel but rejected the applicant \u2019s dismissal of PERSON on the grounds that the applicant had complained on numerous occasions about a violation of his right to mount a defence and therefore determined that he should be legally represented .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote a letter dismissing PERSON claimed that the appointed advocates , PERSON and PERSON , had only formally represented him and had not properly defended him . He noted , however , that he did need defence counsel , although not a formally admitted one .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court rejected the applicant \u2019s dismissal letter , stating that he had claimed that he needed defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court rejected the applicant \u2019s request to remit the case for additional investigation .

The applicant appealed against that judgment , claiming , inter alia , that his right to a free choice of defence counsel had been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE in part . The court noted that there had been no procedural violations that would require the judgment to be quashed .

The applicant appealed in cassation to ORG , claiming , inter alia , that his right to a free choice of defence counsel had been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG . In reply to the applicant \u2019s complaint of a violation of his right to mount a defence , the court noted :", "\u201c It is not worth paying attention to the arguments [ submitted in ] the cassation appeal by the convict that his right to mount a defence was violated , because , in rejecting the request of the convict , the court reasonably noted that , in accordance with LAW , only a person who is the bearer of an advocate \u2019s licence for practice in GPE is allowed to act as defence counsel and PERSON is not the bearer of such a licence . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
