It would appear that the balance in their accounts is MONEY ( ORG ) , DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL and DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , respectively . PERSON also has MONEY ( ORG ) and CARDINAL NORP schillings in his accounts .", "CARDINAL . Until the DATE economic reforms , the commercial banking system consisted of basic and associated banks . Basic banks were as a rule founded and controlled by socially owned companies based in the same territorial unit ( that is , in CARDINAL of GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE DATE or ORG and GPE ) . The founders of GPE were thus CARDINAL socially owned companies from GPE ( such as GPE , Gorenje Bira Biha\u0107 , GPE , GPE , PERSON ) and Pamu\u010dni kombinat Vranje from GPE . CARDINAL basic banks could form an associated bank , while preserving their separate legal personality . In DATE Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo , GPE , GPE and some other basic banks thus founded an associated bank \u2013 PERSON . Similarly , in DATE GPE and a number of other basic banks founded GPE udru\u017eena Banka GPE . In the SFRY there were CARDINAL basic and CARDINAL associated banks ( GPE , PERSON , PERSON , GPE , GPE , PERSON GPE , GPE , PERSON and PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Being hard - pressed for hard currency , the SFRY made it attractive for its expatriates and other citizens to deposit foreign currency with its banks . Such deposits earned high interest ( the DATE interest rate often exceeded PERCENT ) . Moreover , they were guaranteed by the ORG ( see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON and Other Financial Institutions Act DATE ) . The ORG guarantee was to be activated in case of the bankruptcy or \u201c manifest insolvency \u201d of a bank at the request of the bank ( section CARDINAL of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Insolvency Act DATE and the relevant secondary legislation ) . None of the banks under consideration in the present case made such a request . It should be emphasised that savers could not request the activation of the guarantee on their own . They were nevertheless entitled , in accordance with LAW DATE , to collect their deposits at any time , together with accrued interest , from basic banks ( see sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of that Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Beginning in DATE , the commercial banks incurred foreignexchange losses because the dinar exchange rate depreciated . In response , the SFRY set up a system for \u201c redepositing \u201d of foreign currency , allowing commercial banks to transfer ORG foreign - currency deposits to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , which assumed the currency risk ( see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE ) . Although the system was optional , commercial banks did not have another option as they were not allowed to maintain foreign - currency accounts with foreign banks , as was necessary to make payments abroad , nor were they allowed to grant foreign - currency loans . Virtually all foreign currency was therefore redeposited with the ORG . It should be emphasised , however , that only a fraction of that money was physically transferred to the ORG ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and DATE , DATE ; see also decision ORG CARDINAL of ORG DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to GPE , the redepositing scheme functioned as follows . Pursuant to a series of agreements between that bank , GPE , ORG and ORG , GPE had to ship on a DATE basis any difference between foreign currency deposited and foreign currency withdrawn to ORG . The foreign currency so shipped was recorded as a claim of GPE against the ORG . ORG maintained in the present case that ORG then shipped all those funds to the ORG , but they failed to provide any proof in that regard . They proved only that a part of those funds had been shipped back to GPE at the request of that bank to meet its liquidity needs ( in the period when more foreign currency was withdrawn than deposited ) . The exact figures are : in DATE DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL , CARDINAL was shipped to GPE and DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL back to GPE ; in DATE DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL was shipped to GPE and DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL back to GPE , in DATE DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL was shipped to GPE and DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL back to GPE , and so on . In total , DATE DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL was shipped to GPE and DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( that is , PERCENT ) back to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Another relevant factor is that basic banks were granted dinar loans ( initially , interest - free ) by the ORG in return for the value of the redeposited foreign currency . The dinars so received were used by basic banks to give credits , at interest rates below the rate of inflation , to companies based , as a rule , in the same territorial unit ( for instance , in the case of FAC , such credits were given to PERSON , PERSON , \u0160ipad \u0160ator Glamo\u010d , PERSON , ORG , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , and so on ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the redepositing system was brought to an end ( by virtue of section CARDINAL of ORG DATE , as amended on DATE ) . Banks were given permission to open foreign - currency accounts with foreign banks . GPE , like other banks , seized that opportunity and deposited in total MONEY with foreign banks in the period from DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . Within the framework of the DATE reforms , the SFRY abolished the system of basic and associated banks described above . This shift in the banking regulations allowed some basic banks to opt for an independent status , while other basic banks became branches ( without legal personality ) of the former associated banks to which they had formerly belonged . On DATE Ljubljanska Banka GPE thus became a branch ( without legal personality ) of PERSON and the latter took over the former \u2019s rights , assets and liabilities . By contrast , ORG became an independent bank with its headquarters in GPE and a number of branches in GPE ( including the GPE branch at which PERSON had accounts ) . Moreover , the convertibility of the dinar was declared and very favourable exchange rates were fixed by the ORG . It led to a massive withdrawal of foreign currency from commercial banks . The SFRY therefore resorted to emergency measures restricting to a large extent the withdrawals of foreign - currency deposits . For example , as of DATE , when section CARDINAL of ORG DATE was amended , savers could use their savings only to pay for imported goods or services for their own or close relatives\u2019 needs , to purchase foreign - currency bonds , to make testamentary gifts for scientific or humanitarian purposes , or to pay for life insurance with a local insurance company ( before , they could use their deposits also to pay for goods and services abroad ) . In addition , section CARDINAL of a decision of ORG of DATE , which was in force until DATE , and section DATE of a decision of the ORG of DATE , which ORG declared unconstitutional on DATE , limited the amount which savers could withdraw or use for the above purposes to DEM CARDINAL at a time , but not more than DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL per month .", "CARDINAL . The SFRY disintegrated in DATE . In the successor GPE , foreign currency deposited beforehand is customarily referred to as \u201c old \u201d or \u201c frozen \u201d foreign - currency savings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE GPE took over the statutory guarantee for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings from ORG ( see section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) . Although the relevant statutory provisions were not clear in that regard , ORG held that the guarantee covered \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings in domestic banks only ( see its report CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . While during the war all \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings remained frozen , withdrawals were exceptionally allowed on humanitarian grounds and in some other special cases ( see the relevant secondary legislation ) .", "CARDINAL . After the DATE - CARDINAL war , each of ORG the ORG \u201d \u2013 and ORG ) enacted its own legislation on \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings . Only the PERSON legislation is relevant in the present case , given that the branches in issue are situated in that Entity . In DATE the PERSON assumed liability for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings in banks and branches placed in its territory ( see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE and ORG ) . Such savings remained frozen , but they could be used to purchase ORG - owned flats and companies under certain conditions ( section CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL , as amended in DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the PERSON enacted new legislation .

In addition , all proceedings concerning \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings ceased by virtue of law ( see section CARDINAL of that Act ; that provision was declared constitutional by decision U CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . ORG has examined numerous individual complaints about the failure of GPE and its Entities to pay back \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings at the domestic branches of GPE and GPE : it held that neither GPE nor its Entities were liable and ordered instead the ORG to help the clients of those branches to recover their savings from GPE and GPE , respectively ( see , for example , decisions ORG CARDINAL of DATE , ORG CARDINAL of DATE and ORG CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo became a branch , without legal personality , of GPE and the latter took over the former \u2019s rights , assets and liabilities . Pursuant to the companies register , the GPE branch acted on behalf and for the account of the parent bank . On DATE the amount of foreign - currency savings at the GPE branch was MONEY , but it would appear that CARDINAL was in the vault of the GPE branch on DATE . While it is unclear what happened with the remaining sum , it is likely that most of it ended up in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . A domestic bank , GPE , was set up in DATE . It assumed PERSON liability for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings at the GPE branch . In DATE ORG GPE carried out an inspection and noted many shortcomings . First of all , its management had not been properly appointed and it was not clear who its shareholders were . ORG therefore appointed a director of GPE . Secondly , as a domestic bank , GPE could not have assumed a foreign bank \u2019s liability for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings , as this would impose new financial obligations on the ORG ( as the ORG was the statutory guarantor for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings in all domestic banks ) . ORG ordered that a closing balance sheet for the GPE branch of ORG as at DATE be drawn up urgently and that its relations with the parent bank be defined . However , according to the companies register , ORG had remained liable for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings at ORG GPE branch until DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , it continued to administer the savings of clients of the GPE branch ; those savings were used in the privatisation process in the PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; and a domestic court ordered GPE to pay those savings in CARDINAL case ( see ORG v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG placed that domestic bank under its provisional administration for the reason that it had undefined relations with the foreign PERSON .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of an amendment to LAW , in DATE ORG extended the statutory time - limit for the deletion of war - time entries in the companies register until DATE . Shortly thereafter , in DATE ORG decided that the domestic GPE was not the successor of the GPE branch of the foreign PERSON ; that it was not liable for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings in that branch ; and that , as a result , the DATE entry in the companies register stating otherwise must be deleted .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the domestic GPE sold its assets and let out LOC and equipment belonging to ORG GPE branch to a NORP company which , in return , undertook to pay debts of GPE .

In DATE the competent court started bankruptcy proceedings against the domestic GPE . They are still pending .", "CARDINAL . The GPE branch of GPE has at all times had the status of a branch without legal personality . The size of \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings at that branch was MONEY ( MONEY ) on DATE .

It is unclear what happened with its funds , but given the manner in which the redepositing scheme was administered ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it is likely that most of them ended up in GPE .", "CARDINAL .

Indeed , it is clear that they repaid such savings of NORP - Herzegovinian citizens in NORP - Herzegovinian branches of NORP banks . However , ORG provided decisions of ORG ( PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL - DATE , PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL of CARDINAL and PERSON ORG ) holding that the term used in that legislation ( gra\u0111anin ) meant a NORP citizen and argued that it was not excluded that the NORP - Herzegovinian citizens in issue were also NORP citizens or that an ad hoc agreement had been concluded .", "CARDINAL .

After futile attempts to register the GPE branch of ORG as a separate bank ( see the correspondence between the ORG and ORG of DATE stressing the unlawfulness of such proposals as GPE had meanwhile become an independent ORG and PERSON a foreign bank ) , GPE nationalised and then , in DATE , restructured ORG itself . A new bank , PERSON , took over GPE domestic assets and liabilities .

ORG has thereafter rendered numerous judgments ordering the old Ljubljanska Banka to pay \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings in its GPE and GPE branches together with interest . It held that the relationship between the old Ljubljanska Banka and its clients at those branches was of a privatelaw nature . The fact that some foreign currency had allegedly been shipped to the ORG and that succession negotiations were pending was considered irrelevant . Similarly , it considered irrelevant the decisions regarding the status of the GPE branch set out in paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above . CARDINAL such judgment , concerning the GPE branch , has become final ( judgment P CARDINAL of DATE ) .

Although the latter treaty is not yet in force and CARDINAL respondent GPE are parties to it as of DATE ( GPE , GPE and the former GPE ) , it is a well - established principle of international law that , even if a ORG has not ratified a treaty , it may be bound by one of its provisions in so far as that provision reflects customary international law , either codifying it or forming a new customary rule ( see PERSON v.

It means that both sides would make an effort , in good faith , to bring about a mutually satisfactory solution by way of a compromise , even if that meant the relinquishment of strongly held positions earlier taken . It implies a willingness for the purpose of negotiation to abandon earlier positions and to meet the other side part way . The language of the Agreement can not be construed to mean that either side intends to adhere to its previous stand and to insist upon the complete capitulation of the other side . Such a concept would be inconsistent with the term \u2018 ORG . It would be the very opposite of what was intended . An undertaking to negotiate involves an understanding to deal with the other side with a view to coming to terms . Though the ORG does not conclude that LAW in connection with paragraph II of Annex I absolutely obligates either side to reach an agreement , it is of the opinion that the terms of these provisions require the parties to negotiate , bargain , and in good faith attempt to reach a result acceptable to both parties and thus bring an end to this long drawn out controversy ...", "The agreement to negotiate the disputed monetary claims , in this case , necessarily involves a willingness to consider a settlement . This is true , even though the dispute extends not only to the amount of the claims but to their existence as well . The principle of settlement is not thereby affected . Article CARDINAL does not necessarily require that the parties resolve the various legal questions on which they have disagreed . For example , it does not contemplate that both sides are expected to see eye to eye on certain points separating them , such as whether the disputed claims legally exist or not , or whether they are government or private claims . As to these points , the parties , in effect , have agreed to disagree but , notwithstanding their contentions with regard to them , they did commit themselves to pursue negotiations as far as possible with a view to concluding an agreement on a settlement ...", "The ORG considers that the underlying principle of the LOC Cases is pertinent to the present dispute . As enunciated by ORG , it confirms and gives substance to the ordinary meaning of \u2018 ORG . To be meaningful , negotiations have to be entered into with a view to arriving at an agreement . Though , as we have pointed out , an agreement to negotiate does not necessarily imply an obligation to reach an agreement , it does imply that serious efforts towards that end will be made . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
