NORP The applicant is a stateless NORP from GPE who was born in DATE and is currently in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE and requested asylum and a residence permit . Before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) , he stated that he was a stateless NORP from GPE and that he had left his home because of the war . His wife and their CARDINAL children still lived in GPE with his parents . On CARDINAL occasions , the applicant claimed , he had been the victim of serious harassment at NORP road blocks . The first time he had been with CARDINAL other young men in the car and the NORP soldiers had hit them and forced them to sit on crushed glass . ORG had intervened and helped them . He further stated that he had never been politically active or deprived of his liberty but that some of his cousins had been active within ORG for DATE and currently worked for ORG . Moreover , he invoked the generally very unstable and dangerous situation in GPE . He submitted his NORP identity card , birth certificate and a NORP passport issued on DATE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant a permanent residence permit on humanitarian grounds . It first noted that the applicant had presented no individual grounds on which he could be considered a refugee or a person otherwise in need of protection . However , having regard to the very complex security situation and the difficult humanitarian conditions in GPE , ORG considered that he should be allowed to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) in PERSON convicted the applicant of aggravated rape and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and expulsion from GPE with a prohibition on returning before DATE . With regard to the expulsion decision , the court found that the applicant had no connection to GPE and had only been in the country for DATE . Moreover , according to his own statements , his wife and CARDINAL children were living in a refugee camp in GPE . ORG had also been heard and had submitted that there were no impediments to the applicant 's expulsion . Thus , having regard to the very serious crime which the applicant had committed , he should be expelled from GPE . Still , the prohibition on returning to GPE was limited to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment , including the expulsion decision , to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) which , in DATE , upheld the lower court 's judgment in full . On DATE ORG ( ORG domstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant requested the Government to repeal the expulsion order against him and to grant him leave to remain in GPE . Before the Government he claimed , inter alia , that he had in fact been politically active while living in GPE but that he had not informed ORG about it because he had been afraid . He further alleged that he had received several death threats both from the military part of ORG and from ORG . The threats had been sent to his mother in GPE and his brother had sent them to him . He did not know why the threats had been sent to him just at that point in time but he suspected that the members of ORG and ORG had heard that he had been convicted of rape in GPE and imprisoned . This would make it very dangerous for him to return . In support of his claims , he submitted some documents in LANGUAGE as well as some letters in LANGUAGE which he claimed were threats ( see below under paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Upon request by the ORG , ORG submitted its observations on the case . It considered that the applicant had not shown that it was probable that he was a refugee or a person otherwise in need of protection in GPE and , hence , there were no impediments to the enforcement of the expulsion order . However , it noted that an expulsion to GPE might be difficult from a practical point of view .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government rejected the request . It found that there was neither any impediment to the expulsion nor any special reasons to revoke the expulsion decision and grant the applicant leave to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By fax of DATE the border police informed the applicant that he would be expelled from GPE as soon as possible , probably on CARDINAL or DATE , and would be transported to GPE , GPE . It further informed the applicant that ORG Office in GPE had issued him with a new , valid passport . The ORG had also told the police that travelling from GPE to GPE posed no problems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , the applicant requested the ORG to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG a suspension of his expulsion to GPE . He claimed that , when living in GPE , he had worked for ORG together with some family members . His family was one of the biggest in GPE and his uncle had held a high position in the political sphere . The applicant had also been an active politician and was therefore well known and recognised by most . ORG had not liked this and had therefore threatened to kill him . For this reason , he had often been stopped , questioned and beaten when travelling between GPE and GPE . Moreover , due to his political involvement , he had also been imprisoned by the NORP and severely tortured . This experience had scared him so much that he had decided to stop his political work . However , when he had stopped working for ORG , the NORP government had imprisoned and tortured him . Since that time , he had suffered from ORG ( PTSD ) . After leaving prison , he had started importing and selling clothes from GPE . Since the border police still suspected him of being politically active , they had continued to question and beat him every time he tried to leave or enter GPE . Moreover , when his work for ORG was over , they had threatened him and he had been afraid to stay in GPE . Thus , he had fled to GPE where he had been refused asylum and sent back . He had then tried to go to GPE but had been refused leave to remain there as well . In a last attempt he had travelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before the Court , the applicant further alleged that he had received death threats from ORG in DATE and threats from ORG some time during DATE . Since these CARDINAL organisations controlled GPE he was convinced that he would not be able to hide from them . He produced copies of various documents , inter alia , the following :", "A medical report , dated DATE , stating that the applicant was suffering from PTSD and was in need of psychological and social care . It was signed by Dr PERSON , psychiatrist at the GPE community mental health centre .", "A medical certificate , dated DATE , by PERSON , physician at PERSON prison . It stated that the applicant was suffering from anxiety and insomnia and was taking antidepressants . At DATE he had deliberately cut his arm and had been treated for DATE at the psychiatric care unit . He was considered to be suffering from PTSD .", "Some copies of documents in LANGUAGE which had not been translated , but allegedly were marriage and family certificates proving that the applicant was related to leaders within the political organisations of ORG and ORG .", "A copy of an undated letter in LANGUAGE which had been translated into LANGUAGE . It was from ORG and addressed to the applicant 's family in GPE . It stated that , according to information that the ORG had obtained , the applicant should be careful since he would be killed no matter where he was found .", "A copy of a letter in LANGUAGE which had been translated into LANGUAGE . It was from ORG , the West of GPE , and was addressed to the applicant 's family , warning them that they should be careful and cautious because the applicant was being pursued and would be killed wherever he was found . He should remain outside the country in order to protect his life . The letter was not dated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to apply Rule CARDINAL and suspend the expulsion until further notice in order to obtain some further information from the Government . In particular , the Government were requested to inform the ORG whether the expulsion of the applicant to GPE would be possible and , if so , how such an expulsion would be carried out practically in order to ensure that he would arrive in GPE without a breach of his rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Following the ORG 's request , on DATE the Minister of ORG , on behalf of the Government , stayed the enforcement of the expulsion order until further notice . However , the applicant , who had been conditionally released from prison on DATE , was kept in detention awaiting his expulsion in accordance with a decision by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government replied to the ORG 's request . They first observed that since ORG had seized power in GPE in DATE , the human rights situation in GPE had drastically deteriorated , with a strong negative impact on the civil population . However , the NORP migration authorities had expressed the opinion that , although there were other \u201c severe conflicts \u201d ( sv\u00e5ra mots\u00e4ttningar ) in GPE , it did not amount to an \u201c armed conflict \u201d ( v\u00e4pnad konflikt ) within the meaning of LAW . Hence , stateless NORP from GPE were not automatically granted residence permits in GPE and , in the ORG 's view , an expulsion of the applicant to GPE was possible . This said , they pointed out that the police authority responsible for the enforcement of the expulsion order had informed them that , due to the decision to stay the enforcement , there were at present no specific plans to enforce the applicant 's expulsion order . Moreover , the police authority had assessed that , currently , it was in general not possible to travel via GPE when enforcing expulsion orders to GPE , since the NORP border to GPE was temporarily closed . Hence , if an expulsion to GPE were to be enforced , it would probably be carried out via GPE , following an evaluation to ensure that it could be carried out in a safe manner .", "CARDINAL . The Government further stated that in all cases of enforcement of expulsion orders , NORP officials were obliged to accompany the alien to the country / region stated in the expulsion order . The enforcement of the order was only considered to be completed when the alien was received by the country of destination and the NORP authorities were responsible for the alien during the entire enforcement procedure until its completion . If authorities of another ORG provided assistance , the responsibility still remained with the NORP authorities . Thus , NORP officials responsible for the enforcement were obliged to intervene if an alien should be subjected to ill - treatment by the authorities of a third ORG . They were not allowed to hand over the alien to the authorities of a third ORG in order for them to complete the expulsion procedure . Moreover , the NORP officials had to ensure that the alien was allowed to enter the country of destination and was received by that country . Also , an enforcement could only be initiated if there was some degree of certainty that the alien would be received by the country of destination .", "CARDINAL . In his comments in reply to the information provided by the ORG , the applicant claimed that he had a right to a permanent residence permit in GPE on the basis of his political opinions and work for ORG in GPE DATE . He had primarily spoken at public gatherings and organised demonstrations and he had been imprisoned and tortured by GPE in DATE and by ORG in DATE . Both ORG and ORG would try to kill him if he returned . Moreover , he would not be safe if he were returned via either GPE or GPE and thus there was no safe manner for carrying out the expulsion order without exposing him to serious risk . As there were no direct flights to GPE , the NORP authorities would not be able to accompany him all the way to GPE or to ensure his safety .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of LAW , LAW ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , a crime may , apart from ordinary sanctions , result in special consequences defined by law . Expulsion on account of a criminal offence constitutes such a consequence and the decision in this respect is made by the court in which the criminal proceedings take place .", "CARDINAL . Provisions for expulsion on this ground are laid down in the new Aliens Act ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereinafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) which replaced the old LAW ( PERSON , CARDINAL ) on DATE . However , since the rules on expulsion on account of a criminal offence remain the same in substance under LAW as under the old LAW , reference will only be made to LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW CARDINAL and DATE Act , an alien may not be expelled from GPE on account of having committed a criminal offence unless certain conditions are satisfied and the person 's links to NORP society have been taken into account .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the court must have regard to the general provisions on impediments to the enforcement of an expulsion decision . Thus , under the provisions of LAW , LAW , there is an absolute impediment to expelling an alien to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . Furthermore , a risk of persecution generally constitutes an impediment to enforcing an expulsion decision .", "CARDINAL . A decision to expel an alien on account of having committed a criminal offence is , according to LAW , LAW ) of LAW , enforced by the police authority . If the police authority finds that there are impediments to the enforcement , it shall notify ORG , which shall refer the matter to the Government to examine whether the expulsion can be executed ( LAW , LAW ) . If there are no impediments to the enforcement , the alien shall normally be sent to his or her country of origin or , if possible , to the country from which he or she came to GPE ( LAW , Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , LAW of LAW , if the Government find that a judgment or decision to expel a person on account of having committed a criminal offence can not be executed or if there are otherwise special reasons not to enforce the decision , the Government may repeal , in part or completely , the judgment or decision of the court . When considering whether to repeal an expulsion order , the Government shall above all take into account any new circumstances , namely circumstances that did not exist at the time of the courts ' examination of the criminal case . In the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to this provision ( Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , strong family ties and severe illness are given as examples of such \u201c special reasons \u201d that may warrant revocation of an expulsion order . In accordance with LAW , LAW , of ORG ( Regeringsformen ) , the Government may also issue a pardon or reduce a penal sanction or other legal effect of a criminal act .", "CARDINAL . NORP In cases where the expulsion order is not revoked , the Government may still grant a temporary residence permit and work permit . For as long as such a permit is valid , the expulsion order may not be executed ( Chapter CARDINAL , Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a leading decision concerning an asylum seeker from GPE , ORG made an assessment of the general situation in GPE and possibilities to enforce expulsion / deportation orders to the area . ORG found that the situation in GPE could not be regarded as an \u201c armed conflict \u201d ( v\u00e4pnad konflikt ) but assessed that there were other \u201c severe conflicts \u201d ( sv\u00e5ra mots\u00e4ttningar ) in GPE within the meaning of LAW , LAW , of LAW ( which was also in line with an earlier decision by ORG , dated DATE , ORG DATE , and decisions by ORG on CARDINAL and DATE ) . This implied that a personal assessment of the individual circumstances in the case had to be made and that a causal link had to be established between the personal risk of the alien and the conflicts in the area . Since the asylum seeker in the case at hand had only invoked the general situation , the ORG found that he was not in need of protection in GPE . Still , the ORG noted that the border crossings to GPE had been closed since DATE and that , currently , it was not practically possible to enforce expulsion / deportation orders to GPE . In DATE negotiations between , inter alia , ORG and the NORP authorities had resulted in a ceasefire and there was hope that the borders might be re - opened in the foreseeable future . On the basis of the above , the ORG decided to reject the asylum seeker 's application for asylum and a residence permit but to grant respite with the enforcement of the deportation order until DATE , during which time the ORG would carefully follow the developments in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Since ORG seized power over GPE in DATE , GPE has closed all borders into GPE and imposed an almost complete blockade , affecting every aspect of civilian life . In DATE GPE designated GPE a \u201c hostile entity \u201d . Due to the blockade , the humanitarian situation in GPE is now considered to be at its worst since DATE as PERCENT of the CARDINAL population in GPE are dependent on the limited international aid that the NORP allow to enter .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG and GPE agreed on a ceasefire aimed at halting NORP rocket attacks on NORP territory in return for GPE lifting the blockade . However , GPE insists that \u201c normal business \u201d can not resume at the NORP Rafah border crossing until ORG releases an NORP soldier captured by GPE militants DATE . Thus , it would appear that the ceasefire has not improved the situation for GPE 's population , except to reduce the number of NORP incursions and the number of rockets fired by NORP militants . Still , GPE opened the Rafah border crossing to GPE for DATE on DATE as a goodwill gesture before DATE . According to sources CARDINAL people were allowed to leave GPE , essentially those requiring medical treatment or holders of foreign residence permits , and CARDINAL persons entered the area .", "CARDINAL . Following its takeover in DATE , ORG established its own security forces , ORG , and , according to international sources , it enforced laws selectively according to its priorities . In DATE ORG named a de facto High ORG for GPE and ORG - affiliated members replaced ORG prosecutors and judges . In DATE ORG militants took over FAC in GPE . This increased lack of law and order in GPE eroded public confidence in security forces and many NORP sought protection from clans and family groups . The press reported widespread abuse , torture and corruption by the security forces . However , ORG ( ICRC ) has stated that it has regained full access to all facilities ( prisons and detention centres ) in GPE , including those administered by ORG and PERSON ( the military wing of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . According to reports , ORG has hit hard against the opposition in GPE . However , the sole fact of being a member or sympathiser of ORG has not given rise to persecution . Persons without political influence or a political agenda do not run any significant risk . Moreover , ORG 's civil organisation ( that is , excluding the militant parts ) has been allowed to continue its work and ORG members holding the chairmanship in municipal sectors have not been replaced . Reportedly , it is primarily persons who openly criticise ORG who risk being persecuted , irrespective of whether they belong to ORG . Within ORG , persons who are capable of mounting violent resistance against ORG or who have close connections to the ORG leadership in GPE , are most exposed to persecution . It is generally not a problem to have worked for ORG police forces while ORG was in power or to be employed by ORG police forces DATE . Still , it appears that certain acts of revenge occur against persons who have committed various kinds of abuse against the population in GPE . Family members of persons wanted by ORG are not exposed to an elevated risk of persecution as there does not appear to be any pattern of collective punishment within the internal NORP power struggle .", "CARDINAL . ORG issues passports for NORP in GPE and GPE . As long as the LOC border crossing is closed , there will remain significant difficulties to return or to enforce deportations to GPE . It is uncertain when the crossing will re - open ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
