On DATE the pre - trial investigation was declared complete and the case was sent to the trial court , which commenced the proceedings on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in a hearing in which the victims ' representative took part , allowed the prosecutor 's application for the applicant 's ( as well as the other co - defendant ) remand in custody . The court agreed with the prosecutor 's argument that the applicant had been putting pressure on the victims , which had led to changes in their testimonies . According to the applicant , his own argument , on which the court allegedly failed to comment , was that the changes in the victims ' statements in the court might have been explained by the investigator 's pressure on them in the course of the pre - trial investigation , which they were not any longer subjected to during the trial . The applicant was arrested in the hearing room .", "CARDINAL . He repeatedly and unsuccessfully requested to be released under an undertaking not to abscond . The applicant argued that there was no evidence of his guilt , that he had never faced any criminal charges before and had received some government awards . Furthermore , he referred to the facts that he had a permanent place of residence and elderly parents to take care of , and that his health had deteriorated in detention .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of trafficking in human beings and production and distribution of pornographic materials , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , with prohibition on working in any film , video or computer programme production and distribution area .", "CARDINAL . Overall , ORG held over DATE hearings . It issued rulings requiring the presence of the victims and witnesses , enforceable by the police , on some ten occasions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that verdict and remitted the case to the same first - instance court for fresh examination . The main point of criticism was the vagueness of the verdict , including , in particular , the charges against the co - defendants , the classification of the films in which the victims had appeared as pornographic , and the conclusions that the victims had been both deceived and coerced by the co - defendants . The appellate court made a general conclusion that the investigation of the case by the first - instance court had been unbalanced and incomplete . It released the co - defendants under an undertaking not to abscond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to examine the case itself as a court of first instance .", "CARDINAL .
