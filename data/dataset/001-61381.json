It held that pursuant to LAW , an appeal on points of law was admissible if a party to the proceedings could not act as a result of a procedural step taken by the court . According to the law then in force , compulsory administration became effective on the date on which the relevant entry was made in ORG ; the applicant bank 's own statutory body was therefore empowered to act on its behalf until that date and to appeal against the ruling of ORG on the registration of the compulsory administration in ORG . ORG had then to notify its ruling to the applicant bank . However , in the present case the applicant bank had validly appealed against the ruling concerned to ORG , which had considered it on the merits . Seeing that the ruling was not reasoned , notification of it could not improve the procedural position of the applicant bank . ORG added that the fact that the applicant bank had not received the text of the ORG 's proposal for the entry concerning the compulsory administration in ORG did not remove the applicant bank 's right to act in proceedings before the court as provided for in LAW .", "In so far as the appeal on points of law concerned the entry of the first extension of the compulsory administration in ORG , ORG pointed out that section CARDINAL of the LAW as in force at the time when compulsory administration had been imposed provided that compulsory administration became effective on the date on which the relevant entry was made in ORG , the functions of the statutory body of the bank being suspended by the appointment of a compulsory administrator until the compulsory administration ended . In the present case , on DATE the statutory body of the applicant bank had been replaced by the compulsory administrator , who alone was entitled to appeal in the proceedings concerning the proposal for an entry concerning the extension of compulsory administration to be made in ORG .

On DATE ORG likewise declared inadmissible the applicant bank 's appeal on points of law against ORG ruling of CARDINAL DATE . It stated , inter alia , that LAW provided that an appeal on points of law was admissible if the person who acted as a party to the proceedings lacked the capacity to be the party to those proceedings . The applicant bank claimed that the compulsory administrator had not had the capacity to be the party to the proceedings . ORG stated that in the present case the applicant bank had the capacity to be a party to the proceedings ; another question was who could act on its behalf before the court .", "ORG then examined the conditions of admissibility of the applicant bank 's appeal on points of law under LAW . It stated that according to the law then in force , compulsory administration became effective on the date on which the relevant entry was made in ORG ; on that date the statutory body of the bank was replaced by the compulsory administrator . Article CARDINAL(b ) \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provided that the court decided on the contents of the entry in ORG without holding a hearing . It specified the date of the entry in its decision . The entry had to be effected within DATE after the decision had been taken . ORG underlined that the date of the entry in ORG was not to be confused with the date on which the decision authorising the entry was delivered , with the date of its notification , or with the date on which the court approved the decision by issuing the certificate of legal validity . The court concluded that the compulsory administrator alone was entitled to appeal in the proceedings concerning the proposal to make an entry in ORG of the second extension of the period of compulsory administration . However , the appeal against ORG ruling of DATE had been lodged by PERSON who had acted on the basis of a power of attorney issued by PERSON , chairman of the applicant bank 's ORG , on CARDINAL DATE . Consequently , the applicant bank had not had the right to have its appeal examined on the merits by the appellate court .", "CARDINAL .
