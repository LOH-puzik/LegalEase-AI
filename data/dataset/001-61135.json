The applicant was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was suspected by police officers in LOC in robbery . The view was taken by ORG that it was necessary to place a hidden battery - powered listening and recording device in the applicant \u2019s home . An application was therefore made to the Chief Constable for the instalment of such a device , which was authorised on DATE , pursuant to the non - statutory LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to install the device , the police decided to arrest the applicant and his partner in connection with another matter ( credit card fraud ) and to remove them and their children from their home . Enquiries into the credit card fraud had previously lapsed without any arrest or questioning of the applicant or his partner . However , ORG of ORG and ORG , an officer in the intelligence bureau of ORG , decided to revive the investigation for the purpose of removing the applicant and his partner from their home for long enough to enable the installation of the listening device .", "CARDINAL . WDC Fletcher briefed CARDINAL officers about purported grounds for arresting the applicant and his partner for credit card fraud , without informing them of the intended installation of the device .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the CARDINAL officers arrested the applicant \u2019s partner in her home and shortly thereafter arrested the applicant . Both were taken to the police station . The officers seized the keys to the applicant \u2019s home and car . Officers from ORG then used the house key to enter the applicant \u2019s home and install the listening device . They also had a copy of the key cut to enable them to enter the house at DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant and his partner were released from police custody on TIME DATE after being interviewed . Neither was charged , but both were released on police bail and required to report back to the police station on DATE . The applicant \u2019s keys to his home and car were returned to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his partner attended the police station in accordance with their bail and were interviewed again . Neither was charged at that time or subsequently with credit card fraud . During their interview police officers entered their home using the duplicate key in order to renew the battery in the listening device .", "CARDINAL . During DATE , police officers again entered the applicant \u2019s home to renew the battery in the listening device .", "CARDINAL . As a result of conversations that were recorded between the applicant and J , his co - defendant in the criminal proceedings , both men were arrested in DATE . They were charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The trial was at ORG in DATE . An application was made , in a voir dire procedure , on behalf of the defendants for the tape recorded evidence to be excluded under section CARDINAL of ORG on the basis that it had been obtained unlawfully and in breach of LAW . This application was rejected by the trial judge on DATE . The judge found that the officers who carried out the arrests on DATE did have reasonable grounds for suspecting those whom they arrested and that if further information had arisen at the interviews or from the other enquiries which were carried out it was possible that charges would have been brought for those matters . He did find that the removal of the applicant \u2019s keys was in breach of the search and seizure requirements of PACE , that the taking and use of the house key constituted a civil wrong , that there was a trespass to the applicant \u2019s home and that minor criminal damage had taken place . However , balancing the various factors , including the fact that the tape - recordings amounted to confessions of serious crimes involving the possible use of firearms , that there was no suggestion of improper inducement or incitement to commit the offences and that there was no dispute about the content of the conversations , the judge ruled the evidence admissible .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the ruling on admissibility , the applicant and his co - defendant changed their pleas to guilty . They were each sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after being granted leave to appeal , the applicant \u2019s appeal against conviction was dismissed by ORG ( NORP v. PERSON and PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s petition for leave to appeal .", "In DATE , the applicant was released on licence .", "CARDINAL . Guidelines on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations ( ORG of DATE ) provided that only chief constables or assistant chief constables were entitled to give authority for the use of such devices . The Guidelines were available in the library of ORG and were disclosed by ORG on application .", "CARDINAL . In each case , the authorising officer had to satisfy himself that the following criteria were met : ( a ) the investigation concerned serious crime ; ( b ) normal methods of investigation must have been tried and failed , or must from the nature of things , have been unlikely to succeed if tried ; ( c ) there was good reason to think that use of the equipment would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction , or where appropriate , to the prevention of acts of terrorism ; d ) the use of equipment was operationally feasible . The authorising officer had also satisfy himself that the degree of intrusion into the privacy of those affected by the surveillance was commensurate with the seriousness of the offence .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL Act provides a statutory basis for the authorisation of police surveillance operations involving interference with property or wireless telegraphy . The relevant sections relating to the authorisation of surveillance operations , including the procedures to be adopted in the authorisation process , entered into force on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , these controls have been augmented by Part II of ORG ( \u201c RIPA \u201d ) . In particular , covert surveillance in a police cell is now governed by sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of RIPA . ORG also establishes a statutory Investigatory Powers Tribunal to deal with complaints about intrusive surveillance and the use of informants by the police ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
