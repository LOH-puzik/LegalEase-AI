On DATE ORG again examined and allowed the applicant 's claims . The introductory part of the judgment referred in detail to the applicant 's submissions concerning the conditions of his detention . Then the court reasoned as follows :", "\u201c Pursuant to Section CARDINAL of LAW , damage sustained by a citizen as a result of his unlawful conviction , criminal prosecution , unlawful application of measures of restraint , such as detention on remand or an undertaking not to leave a place of residence , unlawful imposition of an administrative punishment , such as arrest or correctional works , shall be compensated in full in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law by the ORG of GPE , and , where the law so provides , by the treasury of the subject of the Federation or the municipal treasury , irrespective of whether they occurred as a result of the misconduct of investigating officials , the prosecutor 's office or the courts .", "Under LAW of LAW , if a citizen sustained non - pecuniary damage ( physical or psychological suffering ) as a result of actions violating his or her non\u00adpecuniary rights or interests , and also where it is expressly provided for by law , the court may order the wrongdoer to pay him monetary compensation .", "In assessing the amount of the compensation for non - pecuniary damage , the court takes into account the degree of the wrongdoer 's fault and all other relevant circumstances . The court must also take account of the intensity of physical and moral suffering relating to personal characteristics of the person who sustained the damage .", "Under LAW of LAW , compensation of non - pecuniary damage to the citizen is effected irrespective of the wrongdoer 's fault if the damage was inflicted by [ the citizen 's ] unlawful conviction , prosecution , unlawful application of a measure of restraint , such as detention or an undertaking not to leave their place of residence , unlawful imposition of an administrative punishment in the form of arrest or correctional service and dissemination of information damaging to the [ citizen 's ] reputation .", "Section CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides that in assessing the amount of compensation to be awarded , the court must take into account the nature of the physical and psychological suffering inflicted upon the victim , and also the degree of fault on the part of the wrongdoer in cases of fault - based liability .", "The court assesses the intensity of the physical and psychological suffering on the basis of the factual circumstances in which the harm was caused and also the personal characteristics of the victim .", "According to the record of arrest issued on DATE and the decision of DATE remanding [ the applicant ] in custody , the plaintiff was placed in custody .", "The plaintiff 's place of residence was searched on DATE .", "By a decision of DATE the prosecutor 's office of GPE charged the plaintiff with participation in a criminal gang , robbery , concerted and aggravated murder , abduction , bribery and unlawful possession of arms .", "By a decision of DATE ORG terminated the criminal case against [ Mr ] PERSON ... with reference to LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( lack of corpus delicti ) . By the same decision the court lifted [ Mr ] PERSON 's measure of restraint , namely remand in custody , and recognised his right to rehabilitation .", "The court has established beyond doubt that [ Mr ] PERSON 's unlawful prosecution and detention had caused him mental and emotional suffering , which is to be compensated by the ORG of GPE irrespective of the fault of the investigation and prosecution officials and in accordance with the procedure established by law . Examining the respondent 's argument that the applicant had failed to prove the alleged non - pecuniary damage , the court considers that the fact of [ the applicant 's ] criminal prosecution and lengthy detention had caused him mental and emotional suffering . The parties did not contest the unlawfulness of the plaintiff 's prosecution and detention , which is also confirmed by ORG decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings [ against him ] . Furthermore , the court finds unsustainable the defendant 's argument that ORG is not the appropriate defendant . The applicable legislation , in particular Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , provide that compensation for non - pecuniary damage in comparable situations is recoverable from ORG of GPE at the expense of the ORG of GPE .", "In assessing the amount of compensation to be awarded for non - pecuniary damage the court takes account of the degree of a wrongdoer 's fault and other relevant circumstances , and also the intensity of the physical and moral suffering of a victim , factual circumstances which the harm was caused and personal characteristics of the victim . As to the amount of compensation , the court does not find it possible to grant [ the plaintiff 's ] claims in full , considering the amount claimed to be excessive and rejecting the plaintiff 's reference to several legal writers ' works as unsustainable .", "Accordingly , taking into account the requirements of reasonableness and justice , the court considers it appropriate to order the defendant to pay [ Mr ] PERSON compensation for non - pecuniary damage in connection with his criminal prosecution and detention in the amount of RUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL [ approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The parties appealed against the judgment . The applicant challenged the amount of the court award as insufficient and insisted on a larger sum . It appears that the respondent submitted , among other things , that the applicant had failed to substantiate his allegations concerning the allegedly appalling conditions of his detention . In his objections to the respondent 's appeal the applicant stressed that his submissions represented well - known facts and needed no proof , because they had been acknowledged by ORG in the PERSON case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined and dismissed the parties ' appeals against ORG judgment .

The appeal decision referred to the applicant 's detailed submissions concerning the conditions of his detention .

The number of visits was limited to CARDINAL per month .", "CARDINAL . The relevant extracts from ORG of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Overcrowding is an issue of direct relevance to the ORG 's mandate . All the services and activities within a prison will be adversely affected if it is required to cater for more prisoners than it was designed to accommodate ; the overall quality of life in the establishment will be lowered , perhaps signi\ufb01cantly . Moreover , the level of overcrowding in a prison , or in a particular part of it , might be such as to be in itself inhuman or degrading from a physical standpoint .", "CARDINAL . A satisfactory programme of activities ( work , education , sport , etc . ) is of crucial importance for the well - being of prisoners ... [ P]risoners can not simply be left to languish for DATE , possibly DATE , locked up in their cells , and this regardless of how good material conditions might be within the cells . The ORG considers that one should aim at ensuring that prisoners in remand establishments are able to spend a reasonable part of DATE ( TIME or more ) outside their cells , engaged in purposeful activity of a varied nature ...", "CARDINAL . Speci\ufb01c mention should be made of outdoor exercise . The requirement that prisoners be allowed TIME of exercise in the open air every day is widely accepted as a basic safeguard ... It is also axiomatic that outdoor exercise facilities should be reasonably spacious ...", "CARDINAL . Ready access to proper toilet facilities and the maintenance of good standards of hygiene are essential components of a humane environment ...", "CARDINAL . The ORG would add that it is particularly concerned when it \ufb01nds a combination of overcrowding , poor regime activities and inadequate access to toilet / washing facilities in the same establishment . The cumulative effect of such conditions can prove extremely detrimental to prisoners .", "CARDINAL . It is also very important for prisoners to maintain reasonably good contact with the outside world . Above all , a prisoner must be given the means of safeguarding his relationships with his family and close friends . The guiding principle should be the promotion of contact with the outside world ; any limitations upon such contact should be based exclusively on security concerns of an appreciable nature or resource considerations ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . As the ORG pointed out in DATE ORG , prison overcrowding is an issue of direct relevance to the ORG 's mandate ( cf . ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) . An overcrowded prison entails cramped and unhygienic accommodation ; a constant lack of privacy ( even when performing such basic tasks as using a sanitary facility ) ; reduced out - of - cell activities , due to demand outstripping the staff and facilities available ; overburdened health - care services ; increased tension and hence more violence between prisoners and between prisoners and staff . This list is far from exhaustive .", "The ORG has been led to conclude on CARDINAL occasion that the adverse effects of overcrowding have resulted in inhuman and degrading conditions of detention ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . The phenomenon of prison overcrowding continues to blight penitentiary systems across LOC and seriously undermines attempts to improve conditions of detention . The negative effects of prison overcrowding have already been highlighted in previous ORG ...", "CARDINAL . In a number of countries visited by the ORG , particularly in central and eastern LOC , inmate accommodation often consists of large capacity dormitories which contain all or most of the facilities used by prisoners on a DATE basis , such as sleeping and living areas as well as sanitary facilities . The ORG has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when , as is frequently the case , the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions ... Large\u00adcapacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives ... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level ; further , in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insuf\ufb01cient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions .", "CARDINAL . The ORG frequently encounters devices , such as metal shutters , slats , or plates \ufb01tted to cell windows , which deprive prisoners of access to natural light and prevent fresh air from entering the accommodation . They are a particularly common feature of establishments holding pre - trial prisoners . The ORG fully accepts that speci\ufb01c security measures designed to prevent the risk of collusion and/or criminal activities may well be required in respect of certain prisoners ... [ E]ven when such measures are required , they should never involve depriving the prisoners concerned of natural light and fresh air .
