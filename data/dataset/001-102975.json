The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Under the NORP Federal Hunting Law ( Bundesjagdgesetz ) , owners of hunting grounds with a surface of CARDINAL hectares are de jure members of a hunting association ( ORG ) , while owners of bigger plots of land manage their own hunting district . The applicant owns CARDINAL landholdings in GPE - Palatinate which are smaller than QUANTITY in a single block . He is thus an automatic member of a hunting association , in the instant case of the municipality of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who is opposed to hunting on ethical grounds , filed a request with the hunting authority to terminate his adherence to the hunting association . The authority rejected his request on the grounds that his adherence was prescribed by law and that there was no provision on the termination of adherence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought proceedings before ORG . Relying in particular on the ORG 's judgment in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( [ ORG ] nos . ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIII ) , he requested the court to establish that he was not a member of the hunting association of the municipality of Langsur .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the administrative court rejected the applicant 's request . It considered that ORG law did not violate the applicant 's rights . With regard to the PERSON - judgment the administrative court considered that the situation in GPE differed from the one in GPE . It observed , in particular , that the NORP owners of hunting grounds , by way of their adherence to the hunting association , were in a position to influence the decision - making process on how the hunting rights should be exercised . Furthermore , they had a right to receive a share of the profits derived from the exploitation of the hunting rights . All owners of plots which were too small to allow a proper management of hunting rights adhered to a hunting association . The court also considered that the hunting associations did not only serve the leisure interests of those who exercised the hunting rights , but imposed certain specific obligations on them , which served the general interest , in particular the duty to manage the game stock with the aim of maintaining varied and healthy game populations and to avoid damages caused by wild game . They were furthermore obliged to comply with specific quotas set by the administration for the hunting of game . These duties applied in the same way to the owners of hunting grounds more the CARDINAL hectares of area , notwithstanding the fact that these bigger plots were not regrouped in hunting associations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the Rhineland - Palatinate Administrative Court of Appeal and ORG rejected the applicant 's appeals on the same grounds as the administrative court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) refused to admit the applicant 's constitutional complaint for adjudication . It noted , at the outset , that the provisions of LAW did not violate the applicant 's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his property , but defined and limited the exercise of this right in a proportionate way . The relevant provisions pursued legitimate aims , were necessary and did not impose an excessive burden on the landowners .", "CARDINAL . When defining the content and the limits of property rights , the legislator had to weigh the proprietors ' legitimate interests against the general interest . He had , in particular , to respect the principles of proportionality and of equal treatment . The limitations imposed on the exercise of property rights must not infringe the core area of the protected right . The margin of appreciation allocated to the legislator depended on the specific context ; the stronger the social context , the wider the margin of appreciation .", "CARDINAL . Applying these principles to the instant case , ORG considered that the applicant 's obligatory adherence to a hunting association did not violate his property rights . The core - area of that right was not infringed . LAW pursued legitimate aims and limited the property rights in a proportionate way . Encompassed in the notion of \u201c management and protection of the game stock ( PERSON ) \u201d , it had the aim to preserve the game in a way that was adapted to the rural and cultural conditions , and to ensure a healthy and varied wildlife . Under LAW , game keeping was not only an instrument to prevent damages caused by wild - life , but also to avoid any impediment to the agricultural , forestry and fishery exploitation of the land . These aims served the general interest .", "CARDINAL . The obligatory adherence to a hunting association was an appropriate and necessary means to achieve these aims . Referring to paragraph CARDINAL of the above - cited PERSON judgment , ORG considered that the ORG had acknowledged that it was undoubtedly in the general interest to avoid unregulated hunting and encourage the rational management of game stocks . The obligatory adherence to a hunting association was also a proportionate means . The impact on the property rights was not particularly serious and did not outweigh the general interest in a rational management of game stocks . Furthermore , LAW endowed every member with the right to participate in the decisionmaking process and to receive a share of the profits derived from the lease of the hunting rights .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further considered that there was no violation of the applicant 's freedom of conscience . Referring to paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON judgment , it accepted that the applicant 's convictions attained a certain level of cogency , cohesion and importance and where therefore worthy of respect in a NORP society . Accordingly , ORG considered that the applicant 's complaint might fall within the scope of freedom of conscience , but that there was , in any event , no violation of that right . The applicant was neither enjoined to exercise the hunt himself , nor to participate in it or to support it . The fact that he had to tolerate the exercise of the hunt on his premises did not result from his own decision , but was the result of the legislator 's legitimate decision . The right to freedom of conscience did not encompass the right that the whole legal order was submitted to one 's own ethical standards . If the legal order distributed the right to exploit a certain property to several claimholders , the owner 's conscience did not necessarily outweigh the other claimholders ' constitutional rights . If the applicant 's landholding \u2013 and that of other owners who were opposed to hunting DATE were removed from the hunting association because of their convictions , the whole system of property ownership and of the management of the game stock would be jeopardised . The right to freedom of conscience did not outweigh the general interest in the instant case .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further considered that the applicant 's complaint did not come within the scope of the right to freedom of association , because the NORP hunting associations were of a public nature . Vested with administrative , rule - making and disciplinary prerogatives , they remained integrated into ORG structures . There was thus no doubt that the association was not simply qualified as \u201c public \u201d in order to remove it from the scope of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further considered that the applicant 's right to equal treatment had not been violated . There was an objective reason which justified drawing a distinction between the owners of landholdings QUANTITY in area and those CARDINAL hectares in area . Contrary to the situation in GPE , which had been examined by ORG in the PERSON judgment , ORG applied to the whole surface of GPE and was binding on all landowners . The owners of land QUANTITY in area had the same duties in game keeping as those adhering to hunting associations .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG observed that the administrative courts had considered the PERSON judgment and had accentuated the differences between the NORP law and LAW as applicable at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . Article QUANTITY of LAW provides :", "\u201c Mindful also of its responsibility toward future generations , the ORG shall protect the natural bases of life by legislation and , in accordance with law and justice , by executive and judicial action , all within the framework of the constitutional order . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Bundesjagdgesetz ) provides that the hunting right encompasses the right to manage and protect the game stock on a particular area of land , to exercise the hunt and to take possession of the game . The hunting right is linked to the duty to manage and protect the game stock ( PERSON ) .", "Under LAW of that section , the management of the game stock is aimed at maintaining varied and healthy game populations at level compatible with land care and cultural conditions and at avoiding game damage .", "\u00a7 CARDINAL distinguishes between the hunting right ( PERSON ) and the right to exercise the hunt ( ORG des Jagdrechts ) .
