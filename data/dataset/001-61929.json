FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . In DATE and DATE he and another person contracted to guarantee a bank loan granted to N. As ORG was eventually unable to meet the reimbursement conditions , the applicant and his co - guarantor each paid the bank CARDINAL NORP markkas ( FIM ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) , excluding interest , in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE N. applied for a debt adjustment in accordance with the DATE LAW ( laki yksityishenkil\u00f6n velkaj\u00e4rjestelyst\u00e4 , lag om skuldsanering f\u00f6r privatpersoner CARDINAL \u2013 \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) and proposed a payment schedule for the court \u2019s approval . The applicant opposed the request , arguing that such an adjustment could lead to an unjustified deprivation of his property , consisting of his claim against N. The applicant argued that ORG was young and healthy and could be expected to be able to reimburse his debts to the guarantors in due course . In the alternative , the applicant requested that the adjustment of ORG \u2019s debts be postponed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after ORG had found employment , ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON granted him a debt adjustment and adopted a payment schedule which was to take effect on DATE and remain in force for DATE . The applicant \u2019s claim against ORG was reduced to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . ORG considered that ORG \u2019s solvency had been significantly weakened on account of his previous unemployment and unsuccessful business activities . Given that ORG was already able to reimburse ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) per month to his creditors at the time of the court \u2019s examination , it was not possible under LAW to postpone the entry into force of the payment schedule . ORG gave the following reasons :", "\u201c ... With reference to PERSON submission , ORG notes that under ORG it is possible to reduce the amount of a claim and even to write a claim off . Considering that a guarantee always involves a risk as to the possible obligation to pay the creditor and the possibility of recourse against the principal debtor , ORG finds that the claim in question can not be considered as a possession that would enjoy inviolable protection under LAW . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Among DATE \u2019s CARDINAL other creditors was F. bank , with a claim amounting to ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) , of which ORG retained ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) as part of his payment schedule .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , contending that the almost total extinction of his claim against ORG violated his property rights under the Convention . No legislation on debt adjustment had existed at the time when the applicant had contracted to guarantee ORG \u2019s debts . Furthermore , the extreme step of writing off his claim discriminated against him as a private creditor who , unlike creditor banks , would receive no compensation from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) upheld ORG decision and its reasoning . The applicant was refused leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act was enacted during a recession in the NORP economy , one of its purposes being to reduce the high volume of unpaid debts owing to banks . The banks received substantial subsidies from the ORG in compensation . Under LAW , a court may write off debts on condition that the debtor agrees to a payment schedule in favour of the creditors determined by the court ( section CARDINAL ) . The court assesses the income needed to cover the debtor \u2019s essential living expenses and to meet any obligation to pay allowances ( sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The excess income is to be used to pay off the creditors during a fixed period in amounts determined by the court ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . If the debtor fails to comply with the payment schedule or contracts a new debt , the schedule may be annulled , thereby enabling all creditors to claim payment as if no debt adjustment had been granted ( section DATE ) . If the debtor \u2019s ability to pay or other conditions change significantly while the reimbursement scheme is in force , the debtor must inform the creditors within DATE ( section CARDINAL ) . Both the debtor and the creditors may seek to have the payment schedule amended , extended or annulled while it remains in force or , in certain circumstances , within DATE from the adoption of the schedule ( sections CARDINAL and DATE ) . If the payment schedule is amended in favour of the creditors , it may be extended by a period corresponding to the period during which the debtor \u2019s ability to pay had improved ( section DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The court may hear submissions from CARDINAL or several creditors , guarantors and co - debtors before deciding on the request for debt adjustment ( section CARDINAL ) . An appeal lies to the relevant appellate court , unless it is specifically prohibited or concerns a procedural matter ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the court could obtain , at the request of a creditor , the relevant information on the possible existence of circumstances which could lead to the refusal of an application for debt adjustment . Since DATE the court can also obtain this information of its own motion .", "CARDINAL . In its parliamentary bill ( no . DATE ) , the government noted that an insolvent private individual seldom had enough possessions to repay a creditor , as the bankruptcy costs had priority . Neither could a declaration of bankruptcy eliminate a natural person \u2019s future responsibility for his or her debts . Allowing an adjustment of the overall debts and fixing a payment schedule could help the debtor meet his or her future financial obligations , provided he or she complied with that schedule . Such assistance would also reduce the overall cost to society . The courts should seek to adjust a debt in the manner least detrimental to the creditor and only to the extent that such an adjustment was necessary to remedy the debtor \u2019s financial situation . Since underlying contractual terms should be interfered with as little as possible , the partial or total extinction of a claim should be considered as a very last resort . The possibility of ordering a payment schedule to remain in force for DATE would enable the creditors to receive at least partial satisfaction . It was noted that somewhat similar legislation for debt adjustment had been , or was being , enacted in countries such as GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE LAW was amended , inter alia , so as to tighten further the conditions for granting a debt adjustment ( section CARDINAL and section CARDINAL ) . A further amendment provided for the possibility of extending the payment schedule for a further DATE , for exceptional reasons and provided the creditor was also a private individual ( section CARDINALa ) . These amendments were not applicable to the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . The Netherlands Government agreed with the respondent Government \u2019s views and drew attention to ORG ( Wet schuldsanering natuurlijke personen ) which came into force in the GPE in DATE and was similar to the NORP legislation .", "CARDINAL . In their view , declaring that the full or partial repayment of debts was no longer enforceable ipso jure at the end of a debt - repayment procedure did not contravene LAW No . CARDINAL . Both the NORP and GPE laws on debt adjustment served the public interest as they were aimed at preventing personal bankruptcy . As a result of bankruptcy , people were frequently discouraged from setting up an income - generating activity , since by so doing they would face claims from old creditors . Bankruptcies also placed a heavy burden on society and creditors did not benefit from having to pursue bankrupt debtors for DATE on end . Debt - adjustment procedures sought to satisfy all parties concerned by striking a proper balance between their respective interests . This complied with the letter and spirit of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . They noted , finally , that a guarantor voluntarily took the risk that not all the funds he or she might have to pay to a creditor could be recovered from the debtor . The ORG did not afford protection against such a risk .", "CARDINAL . ORG joined the respondent Government in arguing that the debt adjustment provided for in the respective States\u2019 legislation did not contravene the rights which LAW No . CARDINAL afforded to creditors .", "CARDINAL . LAW of DATE ( LAW relating to Voluntary and Compulsory Debt Settlement for Private Individuals \u2013 gjeldsordningsloven ) contained provisions similar to those found in the NORP legislation . LAW served vital societal goals and struck a balance between competing interests . The primary purpose of the LAW was to rehabilitate individuals with serious and permanent debt problems by affording them an opportunity to regain control over their financial affairs , in the absence of which they easily became dependent on the social welfare system on a permanent basis . In addition , the LAW was intended to ensure that debtors would fulfil their obligations as far as possible and that the distribution of a debtor \u2019s assets would be organised properly . The position of creditors was not to be weakened any more than strictly necessarily .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government likewise agreed with the arguments of the respondent Government and referred to GPE ( skuldsaneringslagen ) of DATE . This legislation essentially corresponded to the NORP legislation and was of vital importance to society as it sought to rehabilitate individuals with very large debts , affording them a chance to lead a decent life . The legislation applied to residents in a \u201c qualified \u201d state of insolvency who appeared unable to pay their debts within the foreseeable future . In the longer term , severe insolvency not only created suffering for the individual concerned but also resulted in a loss of production , an increased need for care and treatment , and an expansion of the grey sector of the economy .", "CARDINAL . The debt - adjustment legislation also had a preventive effect , as it lessened the interest of credit institutions and others in lending money without verifying the prospective debtor \u2019s solvency . This in turn reduced the risk of individuals facing a serious debt burden .", "CARDINAL . The rehabilitating purpose of the legislation was weighed against the individual LOC interest in maintaining their claims . Hence a further purpose of the NORP legislation was to protect the creditors as a group , since the debtor would be paying at least part of his or her debt to each of them . Creditors were thus likely to receive a better dividend on their claims than would otherwise have been the case .", "CARDINAL . By DATE , CARDINAL applications had been lodged and CARDINAL persons had been granted a debt adjustment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . When the NORP legislation was being considered ( Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , it was noted that debt adjustment would not amount to a deprivation of property , even though it would limit the creditor \u2019s possibility of asserting a claim or even extinguish it . A claim against a debtor in a \u201c qualified \u201d state of insolvency would largely be of a merely formal nature , as the creditor could hardly expect to receive any payment . Through debt adjustment , the creditor could obtain payment of at least part of the claim \u2019s nominal value . Against this background , and bearing in mind the significant general interest in favour of debt adjustment , ORG concluded at the time of enacting LAW that a scheme to that effect would not contravene LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that even if LAW No . CARDINAL came into play , any interference with the rights of creditors was justified as regards a bankruptcy system involving the cancellation of debts in whole or in part . Cancellation of debts was a common feature of many bankruptcy schemes in the western world , including that of GPE . Debtors could get into financial difficulties for reasons which were not of their own making . Bankruptcy schemes were aimed at rehabilitating the debtors , both financially and socially . The absence of these schemes could have adverse social consequences , as the very existence of debts might prevent an individual from carrying on certain activities . If debtors who had failed in business could not be discharged from their debts , this could act as a deterrent to entrepreneurship and responsible risk - taking .", "CARDINAL . Creditors such as the applicant could protect their position by not dealing with a particular debtor ; by inquiring into the debtor \u2019s financial position ; by asking for a security ; by taking out an insurance policy ; or by obtaining a guarantee from CARDINAL party . At any rate , creditors were presumed to be acting in the knowledge of insolvency law and its consequences ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
