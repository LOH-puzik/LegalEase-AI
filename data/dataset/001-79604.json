CARDINAL ) and continued :", "\u201c As we have indicated [ counsel for the applicant ] accepts that we are not in a position to grant a declaration of incompatibility , on the one hand ...

[ Counsel for the applicant ] , while reserving his position , does not dissent from that course , and [ counsel for Mr PERSON ] said that he understood , and indeed accepted that it was thereby being assumed in [ his favour ] that there is at least arguable an LAW right , such as he asserts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG 's conclusion on the meaning of section CARDINAL was that a union could rely as a legitimate ground for expulsion on the conduct of the expelled member so long as that conduct was not the fact of being a member of a political party . It found that a union could not rely on conduct which was a \u201c necessary act for the purpose of being or continuing to be a member \u201d ( at paragraph CARDINAL of its judgment ) . It specifically rejected the submission advanced by the applicant that included in the concept of membership ( and thus amounting to conduct on which the union was not permitted to rely ) was conduct as a member , or in the capacity as a member , of a political party ( paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . A second ET again upheld Mr PERSON 's complaint by way of decision promulgated on DATE . It rejected the applicant 's defence that Mr PERSON 's expulsion was entirely attributable to his conduct ( apart from the fact of membership of the ORG ) for the purpose of section CARDINAL , holding that the expulsion was \u201c primarily because of his membership of the BNP \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL of its judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal to the ORG against the second decision of the ET .", "CARDINAL . In consequence of the second decision of the ET , the applicant has been obliged to re - admit PERSON to the membership of the Union . It is in breach of its own Rules in so doing . Had the applicant not re - admitted Mr PERSON , it would have been liable to pay him compensation in such sum as the ET considered just and equitable ( subject to a statutory minimum of , currently , just over CARDINAL,CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) , with no upper limit ) .
