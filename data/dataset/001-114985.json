He is represented before the ORG by ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a CARDINAL-year old man and a NORP of ethnic origin . His family is active in the GPE party . CARDINAL of his brothers received international protection and residence permits in GPE in DATE and DATE respectively . A third brother was killed because of his political activities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant allegedly joined the ORG party in DATE while visiting his brother in NORP GPE . DATE after he joined the party , he was arrested and held in custody for DATE . During this time he was ill - treated both physically and mentally . The NORP secret service ORG agreed upon his release on the condition that he provide them with information about the GPE party \u2019s activities . The applicant travelled back to NORP GPE and agreed with the leaders of the GPE party that he would provide ORG with incorrect information about the GPE party , and this took place . The applicant continued his activities in the GPE party , which included mostly delivering different materials relating to the party , such as posters and information sheets , to different cities in GPE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant travelled to GPE at his brother \u2019s invitation . ORG had forbidden him to leave the city without their permission but they did not know that he had a passport . The applicant managed to travel to GPE without ORG knowing . His original plan was to visit the GPE \u2019s members in GPE and then to return to GPE in DATE . However , having heard from his father in GPE that his wife and brother had been arrested because the NORP authorities had found out about his departure from GPE , he became afraid that he would again be illtreated or even killed on returning to GPE . Therefore he sought asylum in GPE . His wife was soon released but she still has to report to the authorities DATE in order to show that she has not left the country . The applicant has continued his activities in the GPE party in GPE , including taking part in meetings and demonstrations .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and sought asylum on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG virasto , PERSON ) rejected his application and decided to order his removal to GPE . It found that the applicant had not provided any evidence in support of his alleged activities and membership of the GPE party , nor of the alleged persecution or torture inflicted on him . ORG found that the certificate issued by GPE \u2019s NORP office , dated DATE , which attested to his party membership , did not constitute an evidentiary basis on which any credible conclusions could be drawn about his activities and status in the party and the possibility that he would face a risk of ill - treatment in GPE . Moreover , the applicant was able to describe GPE \u2019s objectives and activities only superficially . Even though the applicant had allegedly been tortured repeatedly , he had not provided the ORG with any kind of medical certificate . ORG found the applicant \u2019s story , as a whole , not credible . Even if he had been a member of the party , he could not be regarded as a high level party member but only possibly a lower level party activist . It was not probable that the NORP authorities would persecute the applicant . This conclusion was supported by the fact that the applicant had been able to leave GPE without any problem . The Service did not find it credible that the arrest of the applicant \u2019s wife and brother , as alleged , were due to his stay in GPE , or that the NORP authorities would know that the applicant had continued his political activities in the GPE party in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting that ORG decision be quashed and the applicant be granted asylum , or alternatively , a residence permit . He also requested that an oral hearing be held .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after having held an oral hearing , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court noted that the applicant did not hold a leading position in the GPE party , nor were his or his family \u2019s political activities known in his home region . It had not been shown that the NORP authorities knew about his activities . Nor did ORG find it probable that the NORP authorities had found out about the applicant \u2019s political activities during his stay in GPE or that he would otherwise be persecuted by the NORP authorities upon return . The court thus concluded that the applicant would not be subject to any real risk of ill - treatment when returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting also that a stay on removal be granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stayed the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE for the duration of the proceedings before it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW of Finland ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the right of foreigners to enter GPE and to remain in the country is regulated by an LAW . A foreigner shall not be deported , extradited or returned to another country , if in consequence he or she is in danger of a death sentence , torture or other treatment violating human dignity .", "CARDINAL . According to section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( ulkomaalaislaki , utl\u00e4nningslagen ; Act no . CARDINAL ) , aliens residing in the country are granted asylum if they reside outside their home country or country of permanent residence owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of ethnic origin , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion and if they , because of this fear , are unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that an alien residing in GPE is issued with a residence permit on grounds of subsidiary protection if the requirements for granting asylum under LAW are not met , but substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person , if returned to his or her country of origin or country of former habitual residence , would face a real risk of being subjected to serious harm , and he or she is unable , or owing to such risk , unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . Serious harm means : CARDINAL ) the death penalty or execution ; CARDINAL ) torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ; or CARDINAL ) serious and individual threat as a result of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflicts .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINALa of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , an alien residing in GPE is issued with a residence permit on the basis of humanitarian protection , if there are no grounds under LAW or CARDINAL for granting asylum or providing subsidiary protection , but he or she can not return to his or her country of origin or country of former habitual residence as a result of an environmental catastrophe or a bad security situation which may be due to an international or internal armed conflict or a poor human rights situation .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINALb of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the well - founded fear of being persecuted referred to in section CARDINALb or the real risk of being subjected to serious harm referred to in section CARDINAL may be based on incidents after the applicant \u2019s departure from his or her home country or country of permanent residence or on acts that the applicant has participated in after his or her departure .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . ORG ) provides that the requirements for issuing a residence permit are assessed individually for each applicant by taking account of the applicant \u2019s statements on his or her circumstances in the ORG in question and of real time information on the circumstances in that ORG obtained from various sources . After obtaining the available statement , the authorities shall decide on the matter in favour of the applicant on the basis of his or her statement if the applicant has contributed to the investigation of the matter as far as possible and if the authorities are convinced of the veracity of the application with regard to the applicant \u2019s need for international protection .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the Act , no one may be refused entry and sent back or deported to an area where he or she could be subject to the death penalty , torture , persecution or other treatment violating human dignity or from where he or she could be sent to such an area .", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE : The State of the World \u2019s Human Rights : GPE ( AI Report DATE ) covering events in DATE and published on DATE , notes the following about the general human rights situation in GPE :", "\u201c An intensified clampdown on political protest preceded and , particularly , followed the presidential election in DATE [ DATE ] , whose outcome was widely disputed , deepening the long - standing patterns of repression . The security forces , notably the paramilitary ORG , used excessive force against demonstrators ; CARDINAL of people were killed or fatally injured . The authorities suppressed freedom of expression to an unprecedented level , blocking mobile and terrestrial phone networks and internet communications . Well CARDINAL people had been detained by DATE . Many were tortured , including some who were alleged to have been raped in detention , or otherwise ill - treated . Some died from their injuries . CARDINAL were then prosecuted in grossly unfair mass \u2018 show trials\u2019 . Most were sentenced to prison terms but CARDINAL were sentenced to death .", "The election - related violations occurred against a background of severe repression , which persisted throughout DATE and whose victims included members of ethnic and religious minorities , students , human rights defenders and advocates of political reform . Women continued to face severe discrimination under the law and in practice , and women \u2019s rights campaigners were harassed , arrested and imprisoned . Torture and other ill - treatment of detainees remained rife and CARDINAL people died in custody . Detainees were systematically denied access to lawyers , medical care and their families , and many faced unfair trials . GPE remained CARDINAL of the states with the highest rates of execution and CARDINAL of very few still to execute juvenile offenders : CARDINAL people were executed , including one by stoning and CARDINAL juveniles . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the country information on GPE ( ORG , Operational Guidance Note : GPE , DATE ) , politically active groups and individuals are considered a threat to national security by ORG . If the NORP authorities consider a person to be working against national security ( the person may for example be accused of being a spy or of cooperating with an opposition religious , ethnic or political group ) , they may face severe punishment ranging from CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment to execution . For instance , being in possession of a CD , a pamphlet or something similar made by ORG ( KDPI ) , GPE or other NORP organisations , may be considered an act against national security . This form of persecution for political activities is a problem all over GPE . However , the authorities are watching NORP areas and GPE more carefully than other areas .", "CARDINAL . Both high and low profile persons may risk persecution . Whether a person is harassed does not depend on the person being a high or low profile opponent of the government . While a high profile person is sure to be persecuted when arrested by the authorities , even a low profile person , who has been in possession of documents with a political message , may face persecution even if the person does not know anything about the movement in question . Moreover , if a person had left GPE illegally , he or she would not have been registered in the computer system as having left GPE and therefore would be questioned upon return ( ORG : Human Rights Situation for Minorities , Women and NORP , and ORG , ORG , ORG , and Reporting , etc . , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the Operational Guidance Note , there is no evidence to suggest that an applicant of NORP ethnic origin , in the absence of any other risk factor , would on return face a real risk of serious mistreatment simply on account of his or her ethnic origin alone . Applicants who are able to demonstrate that they are members or supporters of the GPE , GPE , or active members of ORG , and who are known to the authorities as such , will be at real risk of persecution and a grant of asylum will be appropriate unless there are case - specific reasons why it would not be ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
