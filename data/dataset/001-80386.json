A number of newspapers and TV stations devoted coverage to the play and several provisions of LAW , which the applicants were supposed to have breached , were cited in some of those newspapers . On DATE the DATE PERSON newspaper ran the headline \u201c The play that led the general to rebel \u201d , referring to an army general having severely criticised the ruling ORG and its leader PERSON because of the play staged by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first , third and fourth applicants were arrested by police officers from the anti - terror Branch of the GPE police headquarters and placed in custody .

The applicants did not have access to their lawyers while in police custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appeared before the judge at ORG in GPE . According to the verbatim records of this meeting , the applicants were accused of the offence of \u201c incitement of the public to an armed uprising against the armed forces \u201d , contrary to LAW in force at the time .", "CARDINAL . The applicants all stated that there was nothing in the play which could be interpreted as an incitement to an uprising . Nevertheless , the judge ordered their detention on remand , pending the introduction of criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor at ORG filed an indictment with that court and charged the applicants and CARDINAL other persons with the above mentioned offence . CARDINAL of the QUANTITY persons is the playwright . The other QUANTITY people had assisted in the staging of the play in various cities in CARDINAL way or another .", "CARDINAL . According to the indictment , the play was based on the perception that there was a risk of an attack , in the form of a military coup , against NORP . In CARDINAL part of the play , a number of NORP are gathered and discuss possible ways of avoiding that risk . CARDINAL person suggests that NORP should establish an armed force as a deterrent , regardless of the existence or otherwise of the risk of a military coup .

One of the CARDINAL judges on the bench of the trial court was a military officer . In their defence petitions submitted to the trial court , the applicants stated , inter alia , that the play was set in an imaginary country called \u201c PERSON \u201d and had nothing to do with GPE ; the dialogue in the play constituted \u201c artistic events \u201d . The play included a number of expressions and opinions , but it was not possible to regard them as incitement to armed rebellion .", "CARDINAL . During the criminal proceedings , the prosecutor requested the trial court to convict the applicants of the offence of \u201c incitement to hatred or hostility on the basis of a distinction between social classes , race , religion , denominations or region \u201d , contrary to LAW then in force , and not for the offence mentioned in the indictment .", "CARDINAL .

The playwright was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The other CARDINAL defendants were acquitted .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the judgment and argued that the mental element ( mens rea ) of the offence was lacking ; the words uttered by them as actors should be regarded as \u201c artistic events \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor also appealed against the judgment and argued that the applicants had staged the play at various locations and , as such , they should have been convicted and sentenced separately in respect of each occasion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment in so far as it concerned the applicants and the playwright , and upheld the acquittal of the other CARDINAL defendants . ORG , in line with the prosecutor \u2019s submissions , held that the applicants had staged the play at various locations and , therefore , they should have been convicted and sentenced in respect of each occasion .", "CARDINAL . Following the decision of ORG , the case was referred back to the trial court and the criminal proceeding against the applicants recommenced . In their observations submitted to the trial court , the applicants argued that the play staged in the CARDINAL locations had been based on the same script . They could not , therefore , be regarded as multiple offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court convicted the applicants once more of the offence under LAW and sentenced them to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for each time the offence had been committed , i.e. DATE , and the payment of a fine . In assessing the sentence , the trial court considered as aggravating factors \u201c the time and the locations where the plays were staged , the identities and personalities of the applicants and their social status \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed and argued that they were students and young amateur actors who were not well known . The play had been staged in theatres with an audience of CARDINAL persons . Due to the fact that the staging of the play in different locations was regarded both as an aggravating element as well as a separate offence , they were being punished multiple times . The applicants also submitted that , although they had staged the play a total of CARDINAL times , in CARDINAL of the locations they had staged the play twice in DATE , which , they argued , should count as CARDINAL offence only .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment and held that the staging of the play on DATE on CARDINAL occasion should have been regarded as one offence for the purpose of sentencing .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the trial court again convicted the applicants of the offence defined in LAW and sentenced each applicant to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment as well as to the payment of MONEY fine ( MONEY at the time ) .

The playwright was sentenced to DATE imprisonment for having written the script .", "CARDINAL . Parts of the script that were reproduced in the trial court \u2019s judgment , included the following :", "\u201c \u2013 So , what else did Allah mention in his book , did he mention taking up arms and rebelling against the ORG ?", "\u2013 If that ORG does not rule by the rules of Allah and instead adopts laws as it wishes , enforces those laws against its citizens in order to force them to obey , resorts to the use of arms when they refuse to obey , then yes , just like the ORG behaves . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the trial court , the play had given a message to NORP about a perceived need for the public to take up arms against the armed forces of the State . By mentioning the possibility of a military coup , the military had been portrayed as an oppressive group . Members of the armed forces were referred to as non - religious persons or as persons affiliated to other religions . A need by real NORP to take up arms against such members of the armed forces had thus been depicted in the play . This , in the opinion of the trial court , amounted to incitement to hatred and enmity on the basis of a distinction based on class , race and religion , within the meaning of LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The appeal lodged by the applicants was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A full description of the relevant domestic law may be found in GPE v.
