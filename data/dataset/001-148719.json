The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . After its declaration of independence on DATE , a brutal war started in GPE . It would appear that CARDINAL people lost their lives and CARDINAL people were displaced in the course of the war .

In accordance with that Agreement , GPE consists of CARDINAL Entities , ORG and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to atrocities then taking place in GPE , on DATE ORG passed LAW establishing ORG for the former GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , headquartered in GPE . CARDINAL individuals have already been convicted and proceedings are ongoing for CARDINAL accused . In the period from DATE until DATE , local prosecutors in GPE and GPE were required to submit case files to the ORG for review ; no person could be arrested on suspicion of war crimes unless ORG had received the case file beforehand and found it to contain credible charges ( the \u201c Rules of the Road \u201d procedure ) . Moreover , the ORG had primacy over national courts and could take over national investigations and proceedings at any stage in the interest of international justice .

Pursuant to LAW , the families of missing persons are entitled to DATE financial support under some conditions , notably if they were supported by the missing family member until his or her disappearance and if they are still in need of support ( in other words , if they are not in paid employment and do not receive welfare benefits beyond PERCENT of the average salary paid in GPE ) .
