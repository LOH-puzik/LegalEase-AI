Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr PERSON is an NORP wine merchant residing at GPE ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a ORG ) visited the applicant \u2019s undertaking to carry out an inspection under section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW , as amended ( Weingesetz no . CARDINAL , \" LAW \" ) . He took CARDINAL types of samples from CARDINAL tanks of DATE white wine . The tanks were sealed and officially seized ( section CARDINAL , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "After having left the CARDINAL counter - samples ( Gegenproben ) with the applicant , he sent the CARDINAL official samples ( PERSON ) to ORG ( Landwirtschaftlich - chemische PERSON , \" ORG \" ) to be examined ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . Each sample consisted of CARDINAL bottles . In addition , he drew from each of the tanks a reserve sample ( PERSON ) , for use should a further analysis prove necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG drew up a report containing the results of a chemical analysis of the samples , which revealed an abnormally low level of natural extracts and mineral substances . It also set out the conclusions reached by an official wine quality control panel ( amtliche PERSON , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This panel had found on CARDINAL DATE that the wine in the samples had been diluted with water .", "As the levels were below those required by LAW ( Weinverordnung ) , ORG suspected Mr Brandstetter of contravening section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( a ) and ( b ) of LAW in conjunction with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( f ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( relating , inter alia , to the offering for sale to the public of \" imitation wine \" and adulterated wine ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG had informed ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) of its suspicions in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , whereupon ORG ( GPE ) instituted proceedings against Mr Brandstetter under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In order to prepare his defence , the applicant had the counter - samples analysed in GPE by Mr PERSON of ORG ( Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr PERSON , \" ORG \" ) . On DATE Mr Niessner reported that the level of natural extracts and mineral substances was not below the required minimum . However , the tasting of the samples by a quality control panel on DATE had confirmed that water had been added to CARDINAL of them ( by CARDINAL votes out of CARDINAL ) , but had been unable to establish with certainty whether this was so for the other ( CARDINAL votes out of CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At a first hearing on DATE Mr Brandstetter pleaded not guilty and requested ORG to take expert evidence with a view to establishing that his wine was not \" imitation wine \" and had not been adulterated .", "Accordingly , ORG instructed PERSON of ORG to carry out an expert examination . PERSON had not been involved in the first analysis of the official samples by ORG , or in the drawing up of its report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the second hearing , the court took evidence from PERSON . According to him , the difference between the results of that examination and the results obtained by PERSON showed that in CARDINAL of the analyses a grave error had been committed ; he recommended that the reserve samples should be analysed in order to clarify the position . The court directed him to draw up a report on this matter .", "Mr Brandstetter maintained that the difference in the findings could also be explained by a circumstance to which he had already drawn the attention of the police on DATE . This was that ORG had used a dirty bucket to draw the samples and had poured them into bottles in which there had been a residue of water . The Inspector had emptied the remaining bottles only after the applicant had protested . The applicant \u2019s wife and CARDINAL sons , who were called as witnesses , confirmed his statements .", "The ORG and his assistant , who were also heard as witnesses , claimed on the other hand that the bucket had been clean and that the liquid which remained in the bottles had been wine used to rinse them . The ORG had explained this to Mr Brandstetter when the latter had complained and , moreover , he had subsequently emptied the bottles in question .", "CARDINAL . The analysis of the reserve samples was carried out at ORG on DATE under the supervision of PERSON . It resulted in similar conclusions to those concerning the first samples , but there was no tasting by a quality control panel .", "In his report of CARDINAL DATE PERSON stated that the new analysis had corroborated the first examination carried out by ORG and therefore raised serious doubts with regard to the examination effected by PERSON , of ORG . The scientific findings corresponded to the conclusions of the quality control panels which had identified the addition of water in all the samples except CARDINAL . As with the results of the tasting , they revealed the prohibited addition of water and sugar , and a level of natural extracts and substances below that required by LAW . The applicant \u2019s products could not , however , be classified as \" imitation wine \" . Various statements by PERSON and members of his family during the hearing ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) must have been wrong in view of the results of the chemical analysis , in particular statements concerning the use of a dirty bucket by ORG . Furthermore it was impossible to determine from the outside whether the liquid residue in the green bottles was wine or water .", "CARDINAL . A new hearing was held on DATE . The applicant \u2019s lawyer criticised PERSON opinion because the latter \u2019s close links with ORG deprived him of the necessary objectivity in relation to the first analysis and could have led him to defend the results of that examination against those reported by PERSON . In addition , the expert had exceeded his duties by expressing a view on questions of fact and of law instead of merely carrying out a chemical analysis . Consequently , the defence requested further investigative measures , namely the drawing of new samples from the CARDINAL tanks which had been seized , the taking of evidence from several other experts , including Mr Niessner , and the consultation of the minutes of the quality control panel . The defence also alleged that the rules laid down for a tasting had not been complied with . Again , the court - appointed expert had not explained the differences between the conclusions of the CARDINAL institutes . He had merely expressed his view that those of ORG were erroneous and that those of his own ORG were correct .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted PERSON of adulterating wine ( section GPE ) ( a ) of LAW ) and fined him QUANTITY . It also ordered the forfeiture of the wine contained in the CARDINAL tanks seized - a total of QUANTITY - ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) and the publication of the judgment ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "Its judgment was based for the main part on PERSON opinion . It cited long passages from that opinion which were in its view conclusive because they revealed a convincing , detailed , precise and exhaustive examination of the differences in analysis of the CARDINAL institutes . However , the court refused to take into account certain of the expert \u2019s statements which improperly dealt with questions of law and the assessment of evidence .", "In determining sentence , the court regarded the fact that Mr Brandstetter had made false allegations as to the manner in which the ORG had carried out his duties as an aggravating circumstance .", "CARDINAL . In addition , ORG rejected the application for further investigative measures . The court did not consider it to be relevant in so far as it concerned the tasting procedure , because the results of this procedure did not constitute conclusive evidence . The drawing of new samples would in its view be superfluous , in particular as it could not be ruled out that the wine , which in the meantime had remained in the sealed tanks , had undergone an alteration with regard to its composition . The same was true of the request to hear new experts , because no doubts existed as to the reliability of ORG conclusions , which had in part been confirmed by those of ORG , or as to PERSON objectivity .", "CARDINAL . Mr Brandstetter appealed . He repeated his request for further investigative measures and argued that by dismissing it ORG had disregarded the rights of the defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE ) upheld the contested decision .", "It noted that the applicant had not raised objections to the expert when he had first been appointed , but only on seeing his report . PERSON objectivity was not in doubt . He was especially experienced and conscientious and had in no way been involved in the analysis of the first samples , had criticised the conclusions not only of ORG but also , in certain respects , those of his own ORG , and had explained in detail the differences between the CARDINAL reports . The citation of extracts from the expert \u2019s opinion in the judgment could not be criticised . As it was a conclusive opinion , it was not necessary to seek new evidence ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . Nor was it necessary to inspect the minutes of the quality control panel \u2019s meeting since ORG report contained a summary of the tasting procedure , which moreover could provide only indicative evidence of a subsidiary nature in relation to the evidence resulting from the chemical analysis .", "CARDINAL . On his conviction becoming final , Mr Brandstetter had intended to bring an action for damages against GPE alleging its liability for the unacceptable procedural errors ( PERSON ) which had been made by the courts in the proceedings concerning the quality of the wine .", "In order to ensure that the evidence was preserved ( Beweissicherungsantrag , LAW ) , he requested that additional samples be taken from the sealed tanks . His request was dismissed by ORG on DATE , but on his appeal ORG reversed this decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG appointed as expert PERSON , who was a member of the staff of ORG branch in ORG and who had not been involved in the proceedings concerning the quality of the wine . It instructed him to supervise , on DATE , the drawing of new samples from the tanks , and then to analyse them .", "In his report of DATE , Mr Flack found differences between the results of his analysis of these new samples and the results of the analyses by ORG of the official samples and the reserve samples obtained on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . These differences could , in his opinion , not be explained by alterations in the composition of the wine with the passing of time , or by the effects of measures to preserve the wine authorised by the court . They were in his view due to the addition of substances capable of increasing the natural extract content ( alcohol , glycerine , minerals ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE before officially submitting his report , Mr Flack had informed ORG of his conclusions . The court , of its own motion , instituted criminal proceedings against Mr Brandstetter on a charge of tampering with evidence ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "Mr Flack was appointed as expert by the court and submitted his report on DATE . He confirmed the earlier findings and noted that the composition of the new samples was similar to that of the counter - samples drawn on CARDINAL DATE and analysed by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of this expert opinion , the public prosecutor \u2019s office sought Mr Brandstetter \u2019s conviction for tampering with evidence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Hearings were held before ORG on DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "The accused contended that it had been physically impossible for him to interfere with the counter - samples taken on CARDINAL DATE , because he had been absent from his business LOC before they had been sent to ORG . He stated that all the measures taken to preserve the wine in question had been carried out in the presence of and had been monitored by ORG who had drawn the first samples .", "Mr Brandstetter affirmed that some of the bottles containing the counter - samples , which he had sent to ORG ( Landwirtschaftlich - chemische ORG ) at GPE , had been broken during transport , but the bottleneck , which had remained intact , of CARDINAL of them showed clearly that the seals had not been disturbed .", "He maintained that PERSON , the expert who had analysed the counter - samples ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , could attest to this . He asked that Mr Niessner be called as a witness in order to prove that the seals fixed by ORG on the counter - samples had been undisturbed when these samples had been given to ORG and that the wine examined by PERSON was identical to the wine examined by ORG . The latter \u2019s first findings were therefore not correct and the quality of the wine at the time when the first samples were drawn in DATE had been identical to that of the wine analysed by Mr Flack in the course of the proceedings for securing evidence . The defence further requested that Mr ORG be appointed as a second expert in order to report on the quality of the wine he had analysed .", "The court granted the first request , but refused the second . Accordingly , at the second hearing , PERSON was called as a witness . He confirmed that the seals had been intact in so far as he had been able to judge at the time , but stated that the possibility of interference could not be completely ruled out because it was not the usual practice to carry out a detailed forensic examination . However , no question was put to the witness either by the prosecution or by the defence concerning the quality of the applicant \u2019s wine , or in respect of another possible explanation for the above - mentioned differences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "The court accepted Mr Flack \u2019s opinion that only the subsequent addition of substances could explain the significant differences in the analyses . It considered the latter \u2019s opinion to be logical and convincing , in particular because it was consistent with PERSON conclusions in the proceedings conducted under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . As regards the physical impossibility alleged by the applicant , the court referred to \" notorious methods \" ( gerichtsbekannte GPE ) which consisted of replacing the contents of a sealed bottle by heating the container and carefully removing the seal and the cork or by injecting substances with a syringe through the cork . The fact that CARDINAL of the bottles had been broken might indeed have been due to the failure of such attempted interference .", "The court ruled that there was no need to appoint PERSON as a second expert , because he had already submitted a report on the quality of the wine , which he had analysed as a private expert , and because the results of his analysis had already been thoroughly discussed in PERSON report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed PERSON appeal ( GPE ) against that judgment .", "In its view , ORG had not disregarded the evidence submitted by the applicant , namely the broken bottle neck of CARDINAL of the counter - samples , whose seal was intact ; moreover the sample in question could not be used as evidence because it had not been analysed . The results of the examination of the counter - samples by ORG were contradicted by those of the analysis of the official samples by ORG and , according to the convincing opinion of Mr Flack , this discrepancy could be explained only by the fact that substances had been added to the counter - samples .", "ORG had also taken into account the identical conclusions which PERSON had reached in the earlier proceedings , and the testimony of the witness Mr PERSON on the possibility of interfering with a sealed bottle . It had also described the notorious methods for carrying out such operations . It had therefore based its conclusion on sufficient reasons .", "Consequently , ORG did not consider it necessary to consult a new expert as the accused had requested , since the conditions laid down in LAW were not satisfied ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr Brandstetter served DATE of his sentence . The remaining term was suspended following a pardon granted by the President of the Republic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings had been instituted at the request of the public prosecutor against Mr Brandstetter for defamation . According to the public prosecutor \u2019s office he had wrongly accused ORG of irregularities in taking the first samples on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In so doing he had exposed the latter to the risk of disciplinary sanctions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sentenced the applicant to a suspended term of DATE imprisonment for defamation on account of the following statement made by him to the police on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and taken down at his express request :", "\" [ ORG ] also used for this purpose [ for drawing the wine samples ] a bucket which was rather dirty . When the bottles were being filled up , I noticed that they contained water , which presumably had been left over after rinsing . However , he told me that this was of no importance . \"", "These assertions , which were false and which he knew to be false , could have led to the opening of disciplinary proceedings against the ORG , because they gave the impression that he had not emptied the bottles when the applicant had asked him to do so ; in fact the contrary had been established .", "The court based its findings on the evidence adduced in the proceedings concerning the quality of the wine and in particular on the expert opinion and testimony of PERSON , the statements of the ORG and his assistant , the statements of the applicant and the members of his family and the judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld ORG judgment in its entirety .", "In so far as Mr Brandstetter had claimed that the impugned statement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was justified in the exercise of the rights of the defence ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) and could not therefore constitute criminal defamation , the court referred to well - established case - law and academic opinion , according to which such rights could not extend to conduct which did not merely serve an accused \u2019s defence , but also adversely affected the rights of another person through allegations of such a nature as to amount to a new criminal offence . As the applicant had consciously aroused false suspicions in respect of the Inspector , LAW was applicable .", "The court also took the view that the public prosecutor \u2019s office had not tacitly waived its right to institute proceedings , even though it had not acted immediately . Finally , it found no procedural defect in the way in which ORG had assessed the evidence . The latter court had examined the findings of the proceedings in detail , in a logical and coherent manner in relation to the evidence , and had drawn plausible conclusions concerning the subjective element . The appeal court regarded it as decisive that the bottles , irrespective of whether they had been rinsed with water or wine , could not contain a significant quantity of liquid once they had been emptied in the way described in a credible and convincing manner by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an application by Mr Brandstetter , the Attorney - General ( ORG ) lodged a plea for a declaration of nullity in the interests of the law ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes ) directed against the composition of ORG . ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) allowed the appeal on DATE and remitted the case to ORG .", "At the hearing on DATE the defence alleged that CARDINAL of the judges present had already participated in the first appeal proceedings and should therefore withdraw . The court adjourned the hearing until DATE when it sat in a composition that was in conformity with the law ; it confirmed the judgment of DATE in its entirety ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently asked the Attorney - General to lodge a further application for a declaration of nullity in the interests of the law , but unsuccessfully .", "At this time he discovered that the judgments of DATE and DATE reproduced almost word for word the observations ( the \" croquis \" ) of ORG ( GPE ) filed with ORG on DATE , which had not been served on him and of which he himself had had no knowledge at the time .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a ORG may draw samples from wine tanks of the firm inspected and send them for analysis to ORG . A sealed counter - sample must be left with the firm in question . Furthermore , a reserve sample must be drawn , for use should a further analysis be necessary . The tanks may subsequently be sealed ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "ORG analyses the official samples and draws up a report setting out its findings , as well as the results of a tasting by the official wine quality control panel ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . The panel is composed of a Chairman ( the Director of ORG ) and CARDINAL expert tasters appointed by ORG . It decides , by a qualified majority ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL or CARDINAL , CARDINAL out of CARDINAL , etc ) , whether the quality of the wine corresponds to its designation . The tasting , the conditions of which are laid down in internal rules , is not conducted in public . The identity of its members - who are under a duty of confidentiality - is not disclosed ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL) ) .", "If the results of the analysis provide grounds for suspecting that a criminal offence has been committed , ORG must report this to the competent public prosecutor or court ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards expert evidence in court , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) stated at the time :", "\" If the court has doubts concerning the findings or the opinion of ORG , or if it considers that the findings or the opinion require elaboration , or if reasonable objections are raised against them , it must take expert evidence from an official of ORG who has been involved in the preparation of the analysis or the opinion in question so that he may explain or discuss in greater detail the conclusions or opinion of that ORG \" .", "In all other aspects the provisions of LAW are applicable . In particular if any doubts persist or if the findings of an expert \" are unclear , vague , contradictory \" , etc . ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) , the court may call another expert .", "Under the terms of LAW , only the prosecutor and the defence counsel or the accused are entitled to put questions to witnesses and experts . Nevertheless , the court may authorise experts to examine witnesses and the accused .
