From DATE he was based in GPE .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON narodne \u010dasti \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) of GPE ( GPE republika GPE ) sentenced the applicant \u2019s father in absentia on the basis of the LAW on the Punishment for Crimes and Offences against ORG ( ORG o kaznovanju zlo\u010dinov in prestopkov zoper slovensko narodno \u010dast , enacted on DATE , ORG of ORG and ORG of GPE no .

The applicant requested that the judgment be quashed and the case be remitted to the first - instance court for re - examination owing to the violation of the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s defence rights .", "On DATE the applicant amended his request , arguing that his father had not acted against the interests of the nation . He attached copies of CARDINAL documents which he claimed that his father would have submitted in his defence had he had an opportunity to attend the trial .", "ORG later joined the proceedings in the applicant \u2019s case to the proceedings instituted by ORG , successors of PERSON , who had also been sentenced in the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request and partly upheld PERSON \u2019s and S.B \u2019s request , with effect also for the applicant . By virtue of its decision , ORG quashed the penalty of confiscation of PERCENT of all of the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s property , owing to the lack of reasoning on that point . As to the applicant \u2019s fresh submissions of DATE , ORG found that they had been lodged out of time . As to the complaint concerning the trial in absentia , ORG held that it was not competent to deal with questions of fact and as a result could not consider the question whether the applicant \u2019s father had in fact been a fugitive . It added that the trial in absentia of his father would in any event have also been justified on the other grounds referred to in the ASNH , namely that he had been \u201c unavailable \u201d .", "Referring to ORG ( PERSON sodi\u0161\u010de ) decision of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , ORG furthermore found that the ASNH did not have an unlawful retroactive effect . In the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s case , his conviction was based on sufficiently established facts , namely his membership of ORG and certain specific acts of political collaboration with the occupier . The relevant provision of the ASNH , which represented the basis for his conviction , was therefore not a lex incerta and had not been applied arbitrarily .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG .", "On DATE the Constitutional Court found that it could only deal with the alleged violations relating to ORG judgment and that it had no jurisdiction to consider the complaints concerning the trial in DATE since it had taken place before the LAW had entered into force . As to the issue of lex certa , it referred to its previous decisions providing criteria for assessing laws enacted prior to the entry into force of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . It found that ORG , applying the above - mentioned criteria , had sufficiently and convincingly explained its decision . It concluded that the applicant \u2019s complaints were manifestly ill - founded .", "On DATE the ORG decision was served on the applicant .", "On DATE ORG ( U - I-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) decided that the courts in GPE should not rely on the provisions of LAW DATE , which had established the jurisdiction of military courts at the material time , if they had been used , inter alia , to incriminate persons purely on the ground of their status and had not had regard to the particular acts of the accused .
