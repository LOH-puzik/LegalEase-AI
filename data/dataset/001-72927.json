The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of drug trafficking involving QUANTITY of hashish and sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . He finished serving his sentence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the provisions of LAW came into force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the course of a judicial investigation opened on DATE , the applicant was arrested at his home . A number of searches , notably at his home address , led to the discovery of CARDINAL bags of cannabis resin weighing QUANTITY each , and various sums of cash amounting to MONEY .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was placed under formal investigation and detained pending trial on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG found the applicant guilty of a drug offence and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , ordering in addition his exclusion from NORP territory for DATE . It gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c We have here a young man who returned from GPE in DATE , with no job or verifiable income , who , having tried his hand in turn at property , trading in linen , crockery , air conditioners , foie gras and , incidentally , counterfeit CARDINAL [ NORP ] franc notes ( ? ? ) , found himself , somehow or other \u2013 he repeatedly tried to explain this with a story about profitable \u2018 air ORG \u2013 in possession of a considerable pile of money , CARDINAL old [ NORP ] francs , at his home ( see DCARDINAL ) , scattered about and hidden in the unlikeliest places ( such as the maintenance hatch under the bath ! ! ) .", "Better still , the arrest on TIME CARDINAL DATE resulted in the seizure , without a warrant , of CARDINAL bags of drugs , consisting of QUANTITY of prohibited substances , laid out , packed and wrapped in a manner bearing little resemblance to a craft industry .", "Nobody claimed them DATE which CARDINAL of H. or PERSON was delivering to the other ? ?", "What is known is that PERSON was in possession of QUANTITY of the same kind of resin ( see the expert report , DCARDINAL ) and CARDINAL [ French ] francs in cash , stored in the glove box of his car .", "The circumstances outlined above amount to CARDINAL strands of evidence against PERSON , which elicited nothing more than vague and inconsistent explanations in which he accused PERSON of being the delivery man , claimed ignorance as to the nature of the CARDINAL bags ( ! ! ! ) , and referred again and again , as a kind of \u2018 judicial trump ORG , to the money - spinning air conditioners ( repeatedly ) and the savings of his late brother ( A. ) .", "A third body of evidence results from shadowing , tracking and telephone - tapping .", "Treading stealthily like a GPE and acting like a secret agent , before and after DATE , PERSON moved about a good deal , showing a preference for TIME , twisting and turning constantly , keeping a sharp lookout where necessary , and receiving his \u2018 contacts \u2019\u2019 vehicles in his garage ( albeit for very short amounts of time ) ... So what was going on ? ?", "What was going on his counsel argued , as , subsequently , did counsel for NORP and NORP , was indeed \u2018 trading\u2019 , but in linen , foie gras ( in \u2018 LOC ) , counterfeit banknotes , trousers , but never hashish .", "This cunning strategy was supported by the statements of PERSON ( DCARDINAL ) , and indeed those of ORG and C.", "Furthermore , and above all , no air conditioners , foie gras or trousers were seized on DATE ; what was physically observed in this case was hashish , and a sizeable quantity of it .", "Accordingly , PERSON , who already has several convictions , having , in particular , been sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment in DATE for a drug offence , can not lay claim to any favourable consideration , not least because of the particularly well - organised nature of his activities ( the court has left aside the pagers , mobile phones , etc . used for \u2018 ORG ) . The public prosecutor , for his part , has sought an DATE prison sentence and the court agrees with and imposes that penalty , which is still mild when it is borne in mind that the defendant is subject to the rules on recidivism ; a proportionate fine and continued detention , in addition , in order to ensure that the sentence is executed and that the offence is not repeated ; lastly , as an additional penalty , exclusion from national territory for DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also sentenced the applicant \u2019s mother and the woman he lived with , PERSON , to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , suspended , for handling the proceeds of drug offences .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG increased the applicant \u2019s sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and upheld the exclusion order . It observed , among other things :", "\u201c By LAW , a person is deemed to be a recidivist when , having already been convicted with final effect of an offence punishable by DATE imprisonment , he or she commits a further offence carrying a similar sentence within DATE of the expiry of the limitation period for enforcing the previous sentence .", "That was so in the case of ORG , who , having been sentenced by ORG on DATE , after adversarial proceedings , to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for offences under the regulations on buying , possessing , using , trading in and transporting drugs , punishable under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , as applicable at the time , by a term of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , and having completed that sentence on DATE , committed the offences with which he was charged , which likewise carry a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to LAW , in the course of DATE and DATE .", "In convicting him on the charges set out in the order committing him for trial , the court below made a correct analysis of the facts of the case and drew the necessary legal inferences . Its judgment must therefore be upheld as to the finding of guilt .", "Despite having been convicted on DATE of drug offences relating to the possession of QUANTITY of cannabis resin , PERSON , with no declared income since DATE , had no hesitation in committing further drug offences , making a substantial profit which he shared with his family and amassing a sizeable fortune which he invested shrewdly .", "A total of QUANTITY of cannabis resin \u2013 a substance extremely harmful to the health of young people , in particular those living in poverty , who are exposed to the illegal and dangerous activities of unscrupulous individuals \u2013 was found at his home . He also asked PERSON , who had sought his help in finding honest work , to sell hashish on his behalf .", "Accordingly , both the nature and the seriousness of the accused \u2019s conduct , reflecting a deep - seated inclination to crime for financial gain regardless of the risk to other people \u2019s lives and occurring at a time when he was subject to the rules on recidivism , dictate that he should be sentenced to DATE imprisonment ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law , arguing , among other things , that his classification in law as a recidivist contravened the rule governing the application of successive criminal laws , ORG having retrospectively applied the harsher provisions of the new legislation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed his appeal . It held that ORG had been justified in deeming him to be a recidivist , on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... where a law introduces new rules on recidivism , for them to apply immediately it is sufficient for the offence constituting the second component of recidivism \u2013 which the offender may choose to commit or not to commit DATE to have been committed after the law \u2019s entry into force . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant is due to become eligible for release on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant provisions of LAW , as in force before DATE , were as follows :", "\u201c Anyone who , having been sentenced for a serious crime [ crime ] to a term of imprisonment DATE , commits , within DATE of the expiry of that sentence or of the time allowed for its enforcement , a further serious crime or other major offence [ d\u00e9lit ] punishable by imprisonment shall be sentenced to at least the statutory maximum penalty for that offence and , at most , twice that penalty . \u201d", "\u201c The same shall apply to persons who have been sentenced for a major offence [ d\u00e9lit ] to a term of imprisonment DATE and , within DATE , are found guilty of the same offence or of a serious crime punishable by imprisonment .", "Anyone who , having previously been sentenced to a shorter term of imprisonment , commits the same offence within the same period shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least twice the previous sentence , provided that it does not exceed twice the statutory maximum sentence .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

DATE ORG held :", "\u201c ... the increase in the sentence in the event of recidivism amounts to an additional penalty not for the first offence but for the second , which the offender may choose to commit or not to commit . Accordingly , new legislation may , without having retrospective effect , lay down the penalties that may be imposed in future for offences committed while it is in force ; the offender can not request the application of the penalties under the previous legislation for an offence committed since the new legislation has been in force , his status as a recidivist being determined by the new legislation . \u201d ( PERSON . crim . , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON )", "CARDINAL .
