Investigators of the PERSON district prosecutor \u2019s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers for lack of the elements of a crime in their actions .

In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , setting aside the refusal of DATE , a senior prosecutor from the GPE prosecutor \u2019s office held that , in the course of an additional inquiry , the investigator should establish exactly what each of the police officers had done when restraining the applicant and placing him in their car , in particular if the injury had been inflicted by seizing the applicant by his neck . The prosecutor also held that it was necessary to give a legal assessment of the question whether there had been any need to apprehend the applicant , who was minor , on account of his swearing . The prosecutor noted that the relevant administrative proceedings had been brought against the applicant \u2019s father , and no statements concerning those events had been taken from the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

O. , the investigator , maintained his findings made in the decision of DATE , stating that the applicant \u2019s allegations had not been confirmed by the results of the preinvestigation inquiry .", "CARDINAL . The investigator relied on the police ORG explanations that at TIME on CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s brother had disobeyed their command to stop a motorcycle without a registration plate which he had been driving . The applicant had been sitting on the passenger \u2019s seat . After the police officers had finally managed to stop the motorcycle at the petrol station , the applicant \u2019s brother had refused to produce his driving licence .

NORP The investigator \u2019s decision also referred to statements by other third parties , in particular PERSON , who worked at the petrol station and stated that he had seen the applicant falling onto the tarmac himself , resisting the police officers taking him to their car and trying to escape . PERSON stated that the police officers had not beaten up or strangled the applicant , but had \u201c restrained him \u201d . The applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s complaint that PERSON had given false statements was dismissed by an investigator of the LOC prosecutor \u2019s office on the grounds that false explanations given in the framework of a pre - investigation inquiry , as opposed to false statements given in the course of a criminal investigation , were not punishable as a criminal offence ( decision of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother lodged an application ( \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0430 ) with the Krasnogvardeyskiy ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .

The applicant \u2019s mother appealed against the decision , seeking , inter alia , to declare the refusal to institute criminal proceedings of CARDINAL DATE unlawful and unfounded . On DATE ORG quashed the decision , noting that ORG should not have examined the application , as the applicant \u2019s mother had lacked authority to act on the applicant \u2019s behalf , and should not have examined the lawfulness of the police ORG actions in its review under LAW CCrP ( which concerned the lawfulness of NORP decisions ) . Since ORG had not examined whether the refusal to institute criminal proceedings of CARDINAL DATE was lawful and well - founded , ORG could not deal with that issue on appeal .", "CARDINAL .
