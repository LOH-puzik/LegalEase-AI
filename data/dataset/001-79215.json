On DATE , at GPE 's request and with the approval of ORG ( ORG ) attached to GPE ( Bezirkshauptmannschaft ) , GPE withdrew the applicant 's visiting rights . It noted that , at the first arranged visit on DATE , the applicant had insulted PERSON and told PERSON that her mother was an evil witch and a whore . PERSON had subsequently suffered from anxiety , sleep disturbances , gastro - intestinal problems and pneumonia . The court further noted that even before the visiting agreement had been concluded , the arrangements for and exercise of the applicant 's visiting rights had been complicated by the applicant 's constant aggression towards GPE The court found that the repeated threats against her mother were seriously jeopardising PERSON 's mental development . Accordingly , the applicant 's visiting rights were not in the best interest of the child ; on the contrary , they were harmful to her mental and physical well - being .", "CARDINAL .

The decision became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON instituted proceedings with FAC seeking to adopt PERSON requested that the court overrule the applicant 's refusal to give the required consent .", "CARDINAL . NORP The district court summoned the applicant to a hearing scheduled for DATE . In written submissions of CARDINAL DATE the applicant informed the court that he had not changed his attitude towards the adoption request and still objected to adoption . A hearing was therefore not necessary . He added that the letter should be regarded as his submissions in the case . In further submissions to ORG , the applicant filed a motion accusing judge PERSON , the competent judge of GPE , of bias , and reiterated his request for visiting rights .", "CARDINAL . The district court subsequently informed the applicant that a hearing in the adoption proceedings was necessary and that any unexcused absence was punishable by a pecuniary penalty ( Ordnungsstrafe ) . On DATE the applicant informed the court that he was unable to attend the hearing scheduled for DATE , as he was attending lectures at ORG . He further referred to his motion accusing judge ORG of bias , and submitted that his case would not be given objective consideration . He could , however , agree to another date under different circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President ( Vorsteher ) of the Linz - Land District Court dismissed the applicant 's motion accusing judge ORG of bias . On DATE ORG upheld this decision . It noted that the applicant had referred to a statement made by judge PERSON during a hearing in DATE in the proceedings concerning the withdrawal of his access rights in respect of PERSON However , the applicant had not complained at the time of any alleged bias on the part of the judge . The motion had therefore been submitted out of time . On DATE the President of the Linz - Land District Court rejected a further motion by the applicant accusing judge ORG of bias , for the same reasons .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant gave evidence to ORG in GPE under letters rogatory . At the hearing he argued that he had developed a close relationship with his daughter in DATE . He had not lost interest in his daughter and still wished to obtain visiting rights . However , PERSON had sought to prevent any contact . In further written submissions to the court he argued that he did not know PERSON , who had no family ties with his daughter . His daughter 's alleged psychological problems had been caused by her mother , who herself had similar problems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Linz - Land District Court heard evidence from PERSON , PERSON and GPE On DATE the court , with the approval of ORG attached to GPE , overruled the applicant 's refusal to give consent and granted PERSON permission to adopt PERSON It noted that PERSON had developed a close relationship with PERSON , who had said she was in favour of the adoption as she regarded PERSON as her father . The adoption would secure PERSON 's position within the family and also act as a material safeguard , as PERSON was able to support her financially . With regard to the applicant , the court found that his allegedly close relationship with PERSON did not correspond to reality . The last contact visit , during DATE , had been disappointing for the child , as the applicant had taken no initiatives , had not complied with the child 's wishes for a special DATE present and , during dinner , had not spoken with the child for DATE . In the past the applicant had repeatedly tried to interfere in the relationship between PERSON and her mother , causing PERSON to develop physical and psychological problems . He had not made any effort to prove his feelings for PERSON in practice . Furthermore , he had not made maintenance payments for DATE . The court therefore considered that the applicant 's objection to the adoption was unjustified .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision . He complained that the lack of a public oral hearing in the presence of his daughter , PERSON and PERSON was contrary to LAW . He had not been able to put questions to PERSON and PERSON or challenge the criticism made of him in several reports by the social - welfare authorities . In particular , no evidence had been heard from him concerning the accusation that he had told PERSON that her mother was an evil witch and a whore . He further complained that the court had not instructed him to request an opinion from an expert in child psychology . He was of NORP origin , and adoption in these circumstances was tantamount to a denial of CARDINAL of the child 's genetic background . Furthermore , without an expert opinion there was nothing to substantiate the courts ' findings that he had caused PERSON 's physical and psychological problems . The court should also have instructed him to request that evidence be heard from the social workers who had submitted negative reports about him . Instead , it had based its findings on their written submissions . Finally , the applicant contended that there were not sufficient reasons for PERSON 's adoption . PERSON could instead request joint custody with the child 's mother and undertake to make maintenance payments on a contractual basis . The applicant 's visiting rights had been withdrawn only temporarily and he had not failed to make efforts to keep in contact with PERSON had been paying maintenance for PERSON for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It found that , even in the absence of an oral hearing in the presence of all the parties , which in the proceedings at issue was not obligatory , the applicant had been given a proper hearing for the purposes of LAW . In that regard it noted in particular that FAC had made several attempts to hear evidence from the applicant ; this had eventually been possible only by issuing letters rogatory to another court . The applicant had declared at the beginning of the adoption proceedings that he did not wish to participate further in the proceedings , that his personal appearance before the district court was not necessary and that the letter to that effect should be regarded as his personal statement . Moreover , the applicant had had sufficient opportunity to comment in written submissions , namely in the appeal proceedings , on the accusations made against him . The court further considered that it had not been necessary to seek an expert opinion or to hear evidence from the social workers concerned . In this regard it noted that the regional court had already confirmed the applicant 's aggressive behaviour and its consequences in its decision of DATE , and had rejected the applicant 's arguments to the contrary . Nor had the applicant , in his present appeal , been able satisfactorily to show that his conduct had not been the reason for the child 's problems . The district court had given sufficient and extensive reasons why the adoption should be authorised , namely by referring to the applicant 's conduct . Finally , the regional court noted that the fact that PERSON was in a better financial position than the applicant had not been a reason for granting the adoption . Accordingly , it did not go into the applicant 's arguments regarding the maintenance payments . It refused the applicant leave to lodge an ordinary appeal with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) . This decision was served on the applicant 's counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALa of LAW ( Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) provides that adoption requires a written contract between the person seeking the adoption and the person to be adopted in addition to authorisation by a court .", "CARDINAL .
