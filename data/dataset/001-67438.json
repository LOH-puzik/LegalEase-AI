In his sentencing remarks the judge stated :", "\u201c PERSON , you have pleaded guilty to these CARDINAL offences . They do vary , in my view , in their gravity , the really serious one , of course , is the last one , the indecent assault on young PERSON .", "You say you were totally ( inaudible ) by alcohol at the time and you could n't remember what you were doing , and , the letter you have written to me shows refreshing honesty . Drink has been your ruination . ...

He was released to ORG where he was under the supervision of PERSON , a probation officer .", "On DATE the applicant was recalled to prison for breach of his licence provisions . The applicant received his recall pack , containing the reasons for his recall , DATE after his recall . The reasons given were that he had breached his licence conditions by continuing to drink excessively ; failing to attend a programme designed to address his behaviour , and by grabbing a female worker 's arm and pulling her as well as generally making inappropriate comments of a sexual nature . The applicant challenged the bases for his recall stating that they were factually incorrect and instructed solicitors , PERSON , to represent him at ORG hearing set for DATE , DATE after he was re - detained .", "From DATE to DATE the applicant 's solicitors contacted both ORG at ORG and ORG asking for disclosure ; there was little response .", "On DATE the applicant 's oral hearing in front of ORG was deferred at his request because the statement of PERSON ( the female whose arm the applicant is alleged to have grabbed ) had been served on them that morning which not only mentioned a further witness to the assault , PERSON , but was also incorrect as to a material fact .", "DATE and DATE ( the date of the deferred hearing ) requests for disclosure continued and , in DATE , produced the following statements : PERSON , a probation officer ; PERSON , a fellow sexual offender who witnessed the inappropriate comments ; PERSON ; PERSON ; PERSON , the hostel cook and a further statement from PERSON .

The panel was satisfied on the evidence before it that you have been reluctant or unable to comply fully with the conditions and restrictions placed on you in that , despite a formal warning and a final warning , you continued to drink excessively resulting on occasions in your admission to hospital and you have not complied with your licence conditions to address your alcohol - related offending behaviour .", "The panel also accepts on a balance of probabilities that you did make comments of a sexual nature about a female hostel worker and that on DATE you did grab the arm of PERSON and pulled her towards you in a manner which she reported as feeling like a sexual act to her . The panel regards these actions as highly inappropriate and underline a serious lack of insight and judgment . The panel also noted that you failed to return to your hostel on a number of occasions by the curfew time .", "CARDINAL . The panel had regard to reports of ongoing concerns at your lack of motivation to address your alcohol and sexual - related offending behaviour and also noted the entrenched nature of your alcohol abuse which you yourself are reported to have described as having consumed your life .

It is stated that you were refused admission to an ASRO programme meeting because you arrived in an inebriated state . You yourself accepted that you had been drinking . ...", "CARDINAL . Your index offences , the breaches of your licence , your inability to avoid excessive alcohol consumption when back in the community , the inappropriate sexual comments and grabbing PERSON arm , the need for you to start to undertake work on your alcohol and sexual - related offending behaviour all indicate to the panel that you continue to present considerable risk of harm to the public and especially young males and females . ... \u201d", "The applicant 's solicitors instructed counsel concerning the possibility of seeking judicial review of the decision of ORG .

( CARDINAL ) This section applies where a court which proposes to impose a custodial sentence for a sexual or violent offence considers that the period ( if any ) for which the offender would , apart from this section , be subject to a licence would not be adequate for the purpose of preventing the commission by him of further offences and securing his rehabilitation .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG to subsections ( CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) below , the court may pass on the offender an extended sentence , that is to say , a custodial sentence the term of which is equal to the aggregate of -", "( a ) the term of the custodial sentence that the court would have imposed if it had passed a custodial sentence otherwise than under this section ( \u201c the custodial term \u201d ) ; and", "( b ) a further period ( \u201c the extension period \u201d ) for which the offender is to be subject to a licence and which is of such length as the court considers necessary for the purpose mentioned in subsection(CARDINAL ) above .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) The extension period shall not exceed -", "( a ) DATE in the case of a sexual offence ; and", "( b ) DATE in the case of a violent offence .", "( CARDINAL ) The term of an extended sentence passed in respect of an offence shall not exceed the maximum term permitted for that offence . \u201d", "Release and recall of prisoners on licence is governed by Part III of the Criminal Justice Act DATE :", "\u2013 release of prisoners on licence ( section CARDINAL ) ;", "\u2013 recall of offenders sentenced to extended - sentences ( section DATE ) .", "Prisoners , once released on licence , are liable to recall by the Secretary of ORG , either with a recommendation by ORG or , if it seems expedient in the public interest to recall the prisoner before such a recommendation is practicable , by the Secretary of ORG alone . ORG and the Secretary of ORG will normally exercise this power of recall following a recommendation by ORG responsible for the prisoner 's supervision ; it is not necessary for the prisoner to have committed an offence .", "Review of the decision to recall is carried out by ORG . Where a prisoner is recalled by the Secretary of ORG without a recommendation by ORG , the Secretary of ORG must refer him to ORG . A prisoner serving an extended - sentence has the right to require the Secretary of ORG to refer his case to ORG upon recall : s. CARDINALA of LAW ( inserted by LAW ) . GPE the prisoner is entitled to DATE reviews of detention .", "ORG is required to sit in a judicial capacity when hearing representations concerning recall decisions . An extended - sentence prisoner has no right to an oral hearing ; ORG retains discretion over the nature of the review they conduct . The common practice is that the representations will be considered on paper except where ORG are of the opinion that there are crucial issues which require an oral hearing . Nevertheless ORG advised ORG that they intended to implement oral hearings in the case of extended - sentence prisoners , bearing in mind that an extended - sentence prisoner who is recalled faces a much longer period in custody than an ordinary determinate sentence prisoner .", "On DATE , in The Queen ( on the application of PERSON ) v. ORG and the Secretary of ORG for ORG ( DATE EWCA Civ DATE ) ORG considered the recall of a prisoner who had been sentenced to an extended - sentence and recalled to prison after release on licence due to alleged breaches of his licence and inappropriate conduct involving alcohol . Lord Justice PERSON held , firstly , that LAW applied to decisions relative to recall and continued detention :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In short , when an offender is detained during the extension period of CARDINAL sentence , such detention must be subject to review by a judicial body . No court has ordered his detention during that period : prima facie the sentencing court took the view that he could be dealt with in the community during that period . ... In cases of extended sentences under LAW , it is the executive which decides upon an offender 's recall during the extension period , and because that detention has not been ordered by a court it must be supervised by a judicial body . Otherwise there is a danger of an arbitrary decision being made by the executive . As it happens it is so supervised , because section CARDINALA of the CARDINAL Act so provides through the mechanism of ORG ... \u201d", "Secondly , he found that it was inconsistent with the LAW to place any burden of proof as to lack of dangerousness on the prisoner and held that section CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE must be construed so that ORG was obliged to conclude that it was no longer necessary to detain the recalled prisoner unless the ORG were positively satisfied that the interests of the public require that he should be confined .", "Thirdly , he concluded that ORG was entitled to consider hearsay evidence . While Article CARDINAL case - law referred to the necessity of oral hearings , it did not require that there should as a matter of course be cross - examination of witnesses to establish facts on which the ORG relied . Fairness would sometimes require this , however , and ORG had to take account of the extent to which allegations are disputed , and bear in mind the extent to which they have been fully tested in cross - examination , when deciding what weight to give to these factors . In the circumstances of the instant case , he found that the lack of possibility to cross - examine witnesses on certain disputed aspects of the applicant 's conduct was not unfair where ORG heard the applicant himself and the disputed matters were not key factors in their decision as to the risk which he presented .", "Section CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides :", "\u201c It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
