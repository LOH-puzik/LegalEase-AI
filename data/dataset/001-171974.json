According to LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( no . GPE , L\u00f6g um prentr\u00e9tt ) the publisher or editor is liable for the publication if no author is identified .

He also stated that he had tried to establish the ORG credibility and the truthfulness of the allegations by interviewing the sisters , A \u2019s son , the police , CARDINAL of the ORG employers , another alleged victim and other people mentioned by the sisters in their writings , who could confirm that the allegations were not appearing for the first time because of A \u2019s candidacy , but had been known to the family and the police for DATE .

As regards the issue of legality , ORG came to the conclusion that LAW of LAW did not apply to material published solely on the internet and that section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , could not be applied by analogy in the case . However , ORG stated that a supervisory obligation was placed on editors of web media , where articles were published without identifying the authors , and that the editor was obliged to ensure that material published on web - based media did not cause others harm or interfere with a person \u2019s private life . Therefore , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim that the case was wrongly directed against him .", "CARDINAL . As regards the merits of the case , the judgment contained the following reasons :", "\u201c The impugned statements were published on [ Pressan ] on DATE after [ A ] had , along with CARDINAL people , declared his candidacy for ORG . It was a gathering of CARDINAL elected members , established by law by ORG , which would prepare a proposal for a new constitution . There would be general elections , where the same rules about eligibility and the right to vote applied as in the NORP election \u201d ...", "When the statements in sections A - C are compared to the ORG writings on their website on DATE , the court has to agree with [ the applicant ] that both the headline in section A and the statements in sections B and C are verbatim from their letter . [ ... ] Furthermore , it can not be overlooked that the ORG allegations were not emerging for the first time because of [ A \u2019s ] candidacy ; they had been proclaimed for DATE and were known to many , including the police . [ The applicant ] was therefore not publishing allegations that were being directed against [ A ] for the first time , but disseminating further allegations regarding offences that had emerged long before . [ The applicant \u2019s ] arguments about the public having the right to be informed about the candidates in public elections can not be ignored . By introducing themselves publicly to gain voters\u2019 confidence and to persuade people to vote for them , [ candidates ] in a way become public persons and can not expect all media coverage about them to be as positive as their own . Disputes , resolved and unresolved , regarding their earlier behaviour are matters to which one can expect attention to be drawn . By competing for voters\u2019 attention , candidates usually undertake to be heavily criticised and have to tolerate this up to a point , although that point should be determined on a case - by - case basis . [ The applicant ] did not present the ORG allegations as his own , he just disseminated them further . Therefore , he will not be held accountable for the statements which are directly quoted from the sisters , which the latter have confirmed before the court to be theirs . The court does not agree with [ A ] that [ the applicant ] went beyond the limits of his freedom of expression under LAW . ...", "The statements in sections D and E were published on DATE when the elections for ORG were over . [ A \u2019s ] daughter had discussed the ORG writings about her father in a television interview and declared , inter alia , that he was not a public person and that allegations about child abuse did not belong in the media . The sisters reacted to this criticism on their website and then [ Pressan ] published their reactions . [ ... ] No new discussions about [ A \u2019s ] case were initiated by the sisters this time , their writings were by way of reply . The statement in section D that appeared as a headline on [ Pressan ] quotes the ORG replies but is partly rephrased . The statement in section E published in an article on [ Pressan ] is mostly directly quoted . However , this statement can be understood as a statement by the media itself . Even though the statement is not directly quoted , it is of a general nature and refers to child abusers in general . The sisters have also testified before the court that they consider that they have been correctly quoted . So the court concludes that [ the applicant ] did not go beyond the limit of the freedom of expression guaranteed in LAW , with the statements in sections D and E. \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE A appealed to ORG against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG partly overturned ORG judgment and found defamatory the statements in sections A , B , D and part of the statement in section C , consisting of insinuations that A was guilty of having abused children , and ordered the applicant to pay , LAW , CARDINAL GPE ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) for non - pecuniary damage , plus interest in compensation and LAW ( CARDINAL ORG ) for A \u2019s legal costs before ORG and ORG . Under Article CARDINAL of the Penal Code the statements were declared null and void .", "CARDINAL . As regards the issue of legality , ORG noted that the author of the articles had been identified and that the applicant had confirmed that he had agreed to the publication of the articles . ORG also confirmed that LAW of LAW did not apply to material solely published on the internet . Furthermore , ORG stated that LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW could not be applied by analogy to the case . However , the applicant had a supervisory obligation which entailed that he should conduct his editorial duties in such a way that the published material would not harm anyone by being defamatory . ORG referred in this respect to a ORG judgment of DATE . Therefore , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim about the case being wrongly directed against him .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits of the case , the judgment contained , inter alia , the following reasons :", "\u201c The court can agree with [ the applicant ] that candidates for assignments in the public interest have to endure a certain amount of public discussion of their ability and skills and attributes and whether or not they can be trusted to bear this kind of responsibility . However , this can not justify that [ A ] , without any further or additional information , was accused of this criminal act in the media , [ act ] punishable by LAW . Here it has been taken into account that [ A ] has not been found guilty of the conduct nor has he been under investigation because of it . It does not change anything that the journalist discussed the matter with [ A ] and others , who claimed they could testify about the incident , while working on the story and [ A ] rejected the allegations . In the light of the aforementioned , the limitation on the freedom of expression had to be justified in accordance with LAW . \u201d ..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
