CARDINAL of DATE , ORG did not suffer from any mental disorder , but had \u201c accentuated \u201d personality traits . The conditions he had suffered as a child and head injuries had led to the development of emotional instability , excitability , anxiety and demonstrative behaviour . This explained the difficulties in his adapting to school life and his behavioural deviations , which required psychiatric help . At the time of committing the offences he was accused of PERSON had not suffered from any temporary psychiatric disorder \u2013 that was apparent from the lack of evidence of his being in a psychotic state accompanied by delirium or hallucinations .

NORP The psychologist who participated in the forensic examination stated that after his promotion in DATE until the time of the events PERSON had been in a \u201c subjectively complex \u201d situation . This had included an increased volume of work and management of a new team . PERSON \u2019s qualities such as perfectionism , being highly demanding toward himself and others , needing to control all areas of professional activity and intolerance towards colleagues lacking diligence or competence had required , in the given situation , full use of his physical and personal resources . At the same time he had not been as enthusiastic about his new job as he had been about his previous job .

However , on TIME of the party he had been busy at work and after leaving for DATE , had expected to be called back . He had therefore been in a state of emotional tension . The fact that his wife and her father had been late for the party and the subsequent strained conversation he had had with her , coupled with his work - related anxiety and the feeling that the party had not gone as planned , had amplified the accumulated emotional tension and exhaustion . At the time of committing the offences PERSON had not been in an emotionally disturbed state .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , an investigator from ORG at ORG of GPE , addressed the Minister of the ORG with a recommendation on measures to be taken with a view to rectifying the circumstances that had been conducive to the crime being committed . The recommendation noted that according to the forensic psychiatric examination , PERSON had been found to be of sound mind . However , since childhood he had been under the supervision of a neuropathologist on account of his psycho - emotional instability , but this had not been taken into account by the military medical panel which had found him fit to serve in the police . In the course of the psychological examination it had been established that CARDINAL of the reasons for his psychologically traumatic situation had been his promotion to the position of chief of the NORP branch of ORG of the ORG . Referring to the findings of the forensic examination ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the recommendation mentioned that PERSON had not been as interested and enthusiastic about his new duties as he had been about his previous work in the criminal police . Significant limitations on his independence and permanent accountability together with a lack of satisfaction from his work had led to emotional tension .", "CARDINAL . The recommendation went on to say that on DATE PERSON had undergone an appraisal . ORG had decided that he corresponded to the position he held and considered his promotion a possibility . However , the investigation established that PERSON had not been fit for the position of chief of the NORP branch of ORG of the ORG due to his moral and professional qualities . In particular , he had a poor knowledge of police service in the domain of public security and was irritable with his subordinates . ORG had therefore had a very perfunctory attitude towards its duties , and the appraisal had not corresponded to the objectives set by the applicable regulations . Improper performance of duties by staff members of the human resources services of the agencies of the interior and their perfunctory attitude towards recruitment and the promotion of staff had led to persons unfit due to their personal and professional qualities being promoted to senior positions . Furthermore , ORG had failed to conduct explanatory work with its staff to ensure respect for the rule of law , despite its functioning being based precisely on the principles of respect for human rights and humanism . The actions of PERSON had thus discredited the police .", "CARDINAL . The recommendation concluded that the above - mentioned failures on the part of the agencies of the interior had contributed to D.E committing serious crimes . It advised that measures should be taken aimed at their rectification .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the date PERSON was convicted , ORG also issued a special ruling . It stated that in the course of the trial it had been established that in his childhood PERSON had been treated for conditions related to mental disorders and disorders of the central nervous system in medical institutions of agencies of the interior . However , those circumstances had not been taken into account when PERSON had been accepted to serve in the police and subsequently promoted to chief of the NORP branch of ORG of the ORG , even though the relevant medical data had been available at the institutions that provided medical care to the staff of the agencies of the interior . There had thus been a breach of section CARDINAL of LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Order of the Ministry of the Interior of DATE and section CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the Order of the Ministry of the Interior of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court noted that in the course of the trial it had been established that when committing the offence PERSON had used cartridges that had been manufactured in ORG which had supplied cartridges to , in particular , ORG of the ORG . According to information submitted by the factory , no instances of cartridge theft were reported . The court thus concluded that , while holding the position of chief of the NORP branch of ORG of the ORG , PERSON had obtained the cartridges in breach of the Instruction concerning the storage of firearms established by Order of ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE and had later used them for committing particularly serious offences .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the irregularities in the functioning of ORG which had contributed to the offences committed by PERSON , the court ruled that it would draw the attention of the Minister of the Interior to the said irregularities and invite him to take measures aimed at their rectification .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants sued PERSON for damages . The first applicant claimed compensation for medical expenses in the amount of MONEY ( RUB ) , and the second applicant in the amount of RUB CARDINAL . Each applicant also claimed RUB CARDINAL as compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Nagatinskiy ORG of GPE partially allowed the claims . The court established that PERSON had been responsible for causing injuries to the first and second applicants . The court awarded RUB CARDINAL ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) to the first applicant and RUB CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) to the second applicant for pecuniary damage . It stated , in particular , that whereas the first applicant \u2019s medical expenses in the amount of RUB CARDINAL had been necessarily incurred , he had also claimed RUB CARDINAL in respect of surgery he would have to undergo in order to extract a bullet from his anterior mediastinum . However , according to the forensic expert examination conducted , such surgery was not recommended since the bullet was separated from the tissue and did not pose a danger to the first applicant \u2019s health , whereas any attempt to extract it might lead to unexpected complications . Having regard to the defendant \u2019s financial situation and making its assessment on an equitable basis , the court also awarded RUB CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) to the first applicant and RUB CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) to the second applicant for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the first and second applicants instituted proceedings against ORG , ORG and ORG for damages , arguing that they had suffered injuries as a result of the unlawful actions of a ORG official . PERSON participated in the proceedings as a third party .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Nagatinskiy ORG of GPE dismissed the first applicant \u2019s claim . The court stated that under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , the ORG was liable for the unlawful actions of a ORG official performed in the course of his duties . However , if a ORG official caused damage as a result of activities unrelated to exercising the duties of the ORG service , he was liable under LAW . The court found that in the case at hand PERSON \u2019s unlawful actions that had caused damage to the first applicant had taken place TIME at the PERSON shopping centre , outside PERSON TIME and the territorial jurisdiction of the NORP branch of ORG of the ORG . They had therefore been unrelated to his duties as a ORG official . The fact that at the relevant time he had held the position of chief of the NORP branch of ORG of the ORG and had had the rank of major did not constitute grounds for the ORG \u2019s liability under LAW , as it had been established that PERSON had caused damage as a result of activities unrelated to the duties of his service . The court also dismissed the first applicant \u2019s arguments that the ORG should be held liable for the damage because ( i ) at the time of the events PERSON had been dressed in police uniform ; ( ii ) he had used cartridges that had belonged to the NORP branch of ORG of the ORG ; ( iii ) under LAW of LAW a police officer carried out his or her duties irrespective of the time , place or his or her position ; and ( iv ) PERSON had been dismissed from service for discrediting the police . The court held that under LAW of LAW , as a general rule a police officer carried out his or her duties taking into account his or her position , duty TIME and whereabouts . Exceptions to that rule were provided in section DATE ) and ( CARDINAL ) and concerned instances where a police officer had to take urgent measures to provide assistance to victims of offences , save lives , prevent a crime being committed or apprehend a person suspected of committing an offence . In such cases a police officer had to perform his or her duties irrespective of his or her position , duty hours and whereabouts . However , this was not the situation at hand and therefore PERSON had not been acting in the exercise of his ORG duties and there were no grounds to hold the ORG liable for his actions . The fact that he had been wearing police uniform and had used cartridges that had belonged to the NORP branch of ORG of the ORG had no bearing . The fact that PERSON had been dismissed for discrediting the police meant that his actions had been incompatible with the status of a police officer , but not that he had performed the actions that had caused damage to the first applicant in the course of his duties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment . It noted that there was no evidence that would unequivocally confirm that the actions in question had been performed by PERSON in the course of his duties as a civil servant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Nagatinskiy ORG of GPE dismissed the second applicant \u2019s claim . The court \u2019s reasoning was identical to that in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE in respect of the first applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment . As in its decision of DATE , it noted that there was no evidence that would unequivocally confirm that the actions in question had been performed by ORG in the course of his duties as a civil servant .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , having regard to the special ruling of ORG of DATE , the first and second applicants applied for the civil proceedings to be reopened in the light of newly discovered circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Nagatinskiy ORG of GPE dismissed their requests in CARDINAL separate rulings . It held that there were no significant new circumstances that would warrant reopening the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant underwent a polygraph test to assess her perception of the police officers after the events of DATE . According to the results of the test , on DATE she had taken PERSON for a police officer and , as a result of the events , had developed feelings of fear and apprehension towards police officers .", "CARDINAL . Between DATE and DATE an expert psychological examination was conducted with a view to establishing how the fact that at the time of the events PERSON had been wearing police uniform had affected the third applicant \u2019s psychological state . According to the results of the examination , police uniform affects a person \u2019s behaviour as in general people tend to display loyalty and obedience towards symbols of authority due to the latter \u2019s legitimacy and conventionality and their fear of reprisal in the event of their refusal to obey . The fact that the perpetrator had been wearing police uniform had undoubtedly affected the third applicant \u2019s behaviour and psychological state and had limited her ability to choose a behavioural pattern aimed at protecting her life and health . At the time of the examination the third applicant felt an uncontrollable fear of officials wearing police uniform . When she saw CARDINAL she felt anxiety , apprehension and panic . There was a direct connection between the events and the third applicant \u2019s psychological state characterised by depression , emotional tension and instability , negative feelings , the tendency to avoid new experiences , a pessimistic outlook on life and a change in moral values .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant instituted proceedings against ORG for damages . She argued that damage had been caused as a result of a police officer \u2019s unlawful exercise of his powers . She argued , in particular , that ( i ) PERSON had used firearms that he had obtained in the course of his service in the police ; ( ii ) any judicial decision recovering damages from PERSON would remain unenforced since , being convicted to life imprisonment , he would have no sources of income and therefore no assets to recover the judgment debt from ; ( iii ) the polygraph test had proven that on TIME of the events the third applicant had taken PERSON for a police officer ; and ( iv ) according to the results of the expert psychological examination , the fact that PERSON had been wearing police uniform had affected the third applicant , rendering her defence difficult .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE dismissed the claim . Relying on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and referring to PERSON \u2019s conviction , the court found no evidence that damage had been caused to the third applicant by the unlawful actions of a law - enforcement officer . The court found that the claim had been brought against the wrong defendant and that it should have been brought against PERSON It dismissed the argument that any judgment against PERSON would remain unenforced as speculative . The third applicant \u2019s reference to the fact that PERSON had used cartridges that had belonged to ORG of the ORG was also dismissed as \u201c being based on a wrong assessment of the facts established by the court \u201d . The court also stated that the third applicant \u2019s personal perception of the perpetrator dressed in police uniform did not constitute grounds for allowing the claim . It further noted that the reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law in the statement of claim constituted an arbitrary interpretation of judicial decisions irrelevant to the case .", "CARDINAL .
