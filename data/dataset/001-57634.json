The question of time in connection with a change will depend on how long it takes to organise a new preventive supervision programme . ... The Court does not find that the lack of any time - limit in the decision is a ground for considering it unfair . Nor is it correct to consider the decision unfair because the accusations made against [ the applicant ] might lead to charges being filed against him . A punishable offence may justify a change to a more severe security measure , but this decision is then based on the aims of the security measures and is not considered as a punishment . If the instant case is pursued and [ the applicant ] convicted , the question whether it is fair to use both placement for a time in a security ward and punishment will have to be considered when sentence is passed .

If this possibility of having a further review by a court did not exist , the alternative would be to allow an authorisation period sufficiently long for the court to feel reasonably certain that there would be no further need to impose security measures after it expired .
