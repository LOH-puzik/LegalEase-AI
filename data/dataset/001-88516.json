SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant ran a contracting business dealing with excavation and drilling of wells for fresh water and geothermal heating . In DATE and DATE he purchased CARDINAL excavators , for which he obtained financing from CARDINAL credit institutions . According to the CARDINAL contracts for purchase by instalments , the excavators were to remain the property of the credit institutions until the full purchase price had been paid . The interest fixed in the contracts was CARDINAL and PERCENT , respectively .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicant \u2019s contracting business went bankrupt . As a consequence , by a decision of ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON of DATE , a third credit institution , which apparently had acquired title to the CARDINAL contracts mentioned above , claimed possession of the CARDINAL excavators . According to the applicant , the credit institution did not render any account to him concerning the further administration of the excavators but he learned much later that they had been sold to a buyer in the GPE , allegedly for a price much below their market value .", "CARDINAL . Apparently , title to the CARDINAL contracts were later acquired by a fourth credit institution , ORG ( hereinafter \u201c NORP \u201d ) . In DATE , ORG applied to ORG ( kronofogdemyndigheten ) for a payment order ( betalningsf\u00f6rel\u00e4ggande ) against the applicant . It claimed MONEY ( SEK ; corresponding to MONEY ( ORG ) ) in recovery of the debt and DATE interest on overdue payments of PERCENT . According to the applicant , neither that application nor ORG injunction to reply was served on him .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG issued a payment order , in accordance with ORG \u2019s application . The decision stated that the applicant had been served with the ORG \u2019s reply injunction but had failed to contest the bank \u2019s claim . According to the applicant , as with the application by ORG and the ORG \u2019s reply injunction , he did not receive the payment order . It appears , however , that the order was sent to his registered address at GPE . This address was not changed by the applicant although , after the bankruptcy , he bought a caravan , moved away from the house he had been renting and came to live , for DATE , at various temporary places . Allegedly , in DATE , he reported to the authorities that he lived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received from a debt - recovery company owned by ORG a claim for repayment of the debt , now amounting to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL plus SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in accrued interest . Apparently without having received a reply from the applicant , ORG subsequently applied to ORG for enforcement of the DATE payment order .", "CARDINAL . In a reply to the ORG dated DATE , the applicant contested the claim which , he asserted , was completely unknown to him and , in any event , statute - barred . He further stated that , if the case was not dismissed , he wished to see the original documents relating to the debt with his signature .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed ORG \u2019s claim . Basing itself on the incorrect assumption that the debt in question concerned a consumer credit \u2013 for which a DATE period of limitation applied , as opposed to DATE for a commercial credit DATE , the ORG found that the DATE payment order was no longer enforceable .", "CARDINAL . Handelsbanken appealed to ORG . By a letter of DATE , the applicant \u2019s legal counsel requested that ORG be ordered to give information on how and when ORG \u2019s application for a payment order and the ORG \u2019s subsequent decision of DATE had been served on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . DATE , ORG informed counsel for the applicant by telephone that the entire file had been destroyed , as DATE had passed since the DATE decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected ORG \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of DATE . The reasons were , however , different from those given by the ORG . ORG noted that , under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( Preskriptionslagen , CARDINAL ) , the running of the period of limitations was interrupted by an application to a court or to ORG , such interruption , however , requiring additionally that the debtor had been served with the creditor \u2019s application . The court further stated that the burden to prove that such service had taken place rested with the creditor , in this case ORG , which had had the opportunity to secure evidence in this respect . Noting that the only proof of service that had been presented was the statement in the decision of DATE that the applicant had been served with the ORG \u2019s reply injunction , the court concluded that ORG had failed to show that the running of the period of limitation had been interrupted .", "CARDINAL . Handelsbanken appealed to ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) . Confident that the appellate court would find in his favour , the applicant stated , in a submission of DATE , that there seemed to be no reason to have an oral hearing since the case concerned \u201c a simple matter of law \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Further on DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) , requesting that ORG decision of DATE be set aside due to a miscarriage of justice ( domvilla ) . He claimed that the decision had been taken without his having been duly served with the injunction to reply , in accordance with the provisions of LAW ( PERSON ) . He did not invoke any evidence .", "CARDINAL . Handelsbanken argued in these proceedings that the payment order had been sent in the applicant \u2019s name to his registered address . In relation to the applicant \u2019s claim that he had not had any contact with ORG after the excavators had been reclaimed in DATE , ORG stated that it had sent letters by ordinary mail to the applicant on CARDINAL occasions DATE requesting him to pay the debt . Due to a special agreement with the postal service any letter not successfully delivered to the addressee would usually be returned , but none of the letters sent to the applicant had allegedly been returned . Furthermore , ORG had already applied for enforcement of the payment order in DATE but had been informed by ORG , in a report of CARDINAL DATE , that the applicant lacked attachable property . In the same report , the ORG stated that it had been in contact with the applicant during the course of the matter . Furthermore , ORG asserted that , according to a note made by the above - mentioned debt - recovery company , the applicant had called the company on DATE and asked for copies of \u201c everything \u201d . Consequently , ORG strongly doubted that the applicant , before receiving the application for enforcement on DATE , had been unaware of its claim and the payment order .", "CARDINAL . The submissions of ORG were sent to the applicant but he did not submit any comments in reply .", "CARDINAL . In the present proceedings before the ORG , the applicant claimed that after his bankruptcy he had not had any contact whatsoever with ORG until DATE when he received the application for enforcement of the payment order . He had felt that the ORG had caused him harm in the bankruptcy proceedings and had not wished to have any further contact with the ORG . He further rejected ORG \u2019s assertion that he had called the debt - recovery company in DATE . In any event , he asserted that such a contact could not have cured the failure in DATE to properly serve him with the injunction to reply in the payment order proceedings . These statements were , however , not submitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request in regard to miscarriage of justice . The court first rejected ORG \u2019s objection that the case should be dismissed on the ground that the matter was already pending before ORG ( lis pendens ) . In so doing , it stressed that ORG case concerned the question whether the claim was statute - barred whereas the case before ORG determined whether any procedural error had been committed in the handling of the claim . With regard to the substance of the latter issue , the court noted that the decision of ORG stated that the applicant had been duly served and considered that there was no reason to question the accuracy of this statement . Consequently , there had not been any miscarriage of justice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( H\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused leave to appeal against the above decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the enforcement proceedings , pending before ORG , the applicant changed his view on the necessity of an oral hearing following the decision by ORG in the proceedings concerning miscarriage of justice . Thus , he asked ORG to hold a hearing , at which he wished to be heard about the service of documents in the case . The court , however , informed the parties that it found a hearing unnecessary . The applicant was given an opportunity to submit final observations in writing . He did so and , at the same time , reiterated his request for a hearing .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG reversed ORG decision of DATE . The appellate court interpreted the preparatory works ( prop . CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL et seq . ) of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG , CARDINAL ) and found that the requirement to serve the application for a payment order on the debtor in order to interrupt the running of the period of limitations did not apply to situations where the matter had been finalised with a decision by ORG . Instead , the requirement of service , contained in this rule of exception , was aimed at cases where a creditor applied for a payment order and then withdrew the claim before service had taken place , with the purpose of starting a new period of limitations . Consequently , in assessing the period of limitations in the present case , it was irrelevant whether the payment order had been properly served or not . That period should therefore be counted from DATE , the date of the ORG \u2019s decision . The court noted that it was undisputed that ORG \u2019s claim for enforcement had been introduced within DATE from DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to examine the applicant \u2019s objection that the payment order had been issued under such circumstances that there were reasons to quash it . The court noted that a writ of execution could be quashed in enforcement proceedings only in highly exceptional situations . Noting that the applicant \u2019s objection had been examined in the case concerning miscarriage of justice and that that examination had not led to the order being quashed , the court found no reason to question the validity of the payment order as a writ of execution .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal therefore concluded that there were no impediments to the enforcement of the payment order and returned the matter to ORG for further processing .", "CARDINAL . As questions concerning service of documents were of no relevance to the determination of the case , ORG further found that there was no reason to hold an oral hearing and , accordingly , refused the applicant \u2019s request in this respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal against ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) contains provisions on execution titles . LAW provides the following on objections to enforcement :", "\u201c If the defendant shows that he has satisfied an obligation to pay or other obligation to which the application for enforcement relates , enforcement may not take place . This also applies if the defendant as a set - off invokes a claim that has been confirmed by an execution title which may be enforced or which is based on a promissory note or other written evidence of debt , and the general preconditions for set - offs are met .", "Nor may enforcement take place if the defendant claims that another circumstance relating to the dealings between the parties constitutes an impediment to enforcement and the objection can not be ignored .", "If a situation referred to in the first or second paragraph is at hand and a measure of enforcement has already been taken in the case , the measure shall be annulled , if this is possible .", "The decision of ORG by reason of an objection referred to in the first or second paragraph does not prevent the matter from being considered by a court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An objection based on a circumstance relating to the parties\u2019 dealings may only concern the substantive judicial relationship between the parties , for instance that the person seeking enforcement has granted the defendant a respite for the payment , that they have agreed on a service in return for the payment or that the execution title has become statute - barred ( see PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON \u2013 en kommentar ( commentary to LAW ) , CARDINALrd edition ( DATE ) , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a case where the defendant had claimed that a decision constituting an execution title was unlawful or at least incorrect , ORG , which dismissed the objection by a decision of DATE , stressed that the scope for rejecting an execution title in an enforcement case is extremely limited ( ORG DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . In a more recent decision , taken on DATE ( NJA DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , ORG expressed the following :", "\u201c A basic principle in cases of enforcement is that the enforcing authority has no right to examine anew issues that have been determined in the execution title . Upon appeal in enforcement cases , the courts\u2019 powers are no wider than those of ORG .", "Accordingly , in so far as the courts\u2019 determination is concerned , objections against an execution title , which refer to circumstances dating back to time before it was issued , can not be examined in the enforcement case . In respect of decisions taken by an administrative authority , it is likely that there is a somewhat wider scope for such objections , but then they would , as a rule , concern issues that have not been examined in the execution title . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c Where a limitation period is interrupted through the commencement of legal proceedings or otherwise through the pleading of a claim as stated in DATE , subsection CARDINAL , a new limitation period shall run in accordance with the provisions of section CARDINAL from DATE of the publication of a judgment or a final decision or from DATE on which the legal proceedings are concluded in any other way . Where , prior to the expiry of the new limitation period , the case is appealed or the proceedings are resumed for any other reason , the period of limitation is interrupted , and a new period of limitation shall run from DATE of the conclusion of the resumed proceedings .", "However , where the legal proceedings are concluded without the debtor having been served with , or otherwise informed of , the creditor \u2019s statement of claim , the period of limitation shall be calculated as if no interruption had occurred . The claim shall nevertheless not be barred by the expiry of the limitation period DATE after the conclusion of the proceedings .", "The period of limitation may no be extended more than once pursuant to the provisions of the second paragraph , second sentence . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
