Mr PERSON , a NORP citizen , and Mr PERSON , a citizen of GPE , are serving a term of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment in GPE , following their conviction by a court of ORG for an armed robbery committed in GPE la PERSON . Mr PERSON is in prison at ORG , PERSON at PERSON ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE R. , a representative of the jewellery firm of F. in GPE , was staying in a hotel in GPE la Vella . While he was in his room he was attacked by QUANTITY persons who he stated stole from him jewels worth MONEY and MONEY in cash .", "CARDINAL . There are a number of facts which are not in dispute between the respondent ORG and the applicants .", "CARDINAL . Following the criminal complaint brought by NORP against persons unknown for armed robbery , the police arrested PERSON and PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . An investigation was then opened by CARDINAL of the episcopal batlles ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The police arranged a first \" identification test \" at the police station , which was apparently unsuccessful , followed by a second test in the course of which NORP identified the applicants as the persons who had committed the robbery . However , the defence criticised the conditions in which the \" tests \" in question had taken place .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were sent for trial and appeared before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on DATE . The court was composed of the Judge of Appeals , ORG , an honorary judge at ORG , nominated by ORG , and CARDINAL assessors , PERSON , taking the place of the NORP veguer , by whom he had been appointed , an honorary judge at ORG , and ORG , the episcopal veguer , a NORP jurist appointed by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The court gave judgment on DATE , in NORP , at a public hearing . The applicants were served with the NORP text on DATE .", "The court found both defendants guilty , sentenced them to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , and ordered them to be expelled from the territory of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON and Mr Janousek lodged the only appeal which was then open to them , an appeal to the same judges to reconsider their ruling . This was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants chose to serve their sentences in GPE rather than GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and were presumably given by the NORP veguer \u2019s office a NORP translation of the judgment convicting them , this being the usual practice .", "CARDINAL . They did not bring an appeal ( recurs de suplicaci\u00f3 ) to the Tribunal Superior de Corts , a new appeal procedure introduced by the decree of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph DATE below ) and used , successfully on occasion , by other convicted defendants , including another client of their counsel . This decree , the text of which was not communicated to PERSON and PERSON or their counsel , was published in the Butllet\u00ed Oficial del Principat d\u2019Andorra on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The respondent ORG and the applicants submitted differing versions of certain facts .", "CARDINAL . While conceding that they were unable to prove this , as they had obviously not been present , the applicants claimed that the episcopal batlle in charge of the investigation had been present at the deliberations of ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the respondent ORG , that was not the case , nor could it have been .", "CARDINAL . The applicants maintained that the NORP assessor had not had an adequate command of LANGUAGE , still less of NORP , the language in which the hearing was conducted , which deprived him of any real possibility of taking part in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that a knowledge of NORP and at least an understanding of NORP were among the criteria for the appointment of NORP judges called upon to carry out judicial functions in GPE . The Government added that in the present case all CARDINAL members of the court had been of NORP origin , spoke and understood NORP perfectly , and had made oral interventions during the hearing .", "The Spanish Government noted that it was the practice of ORG to put questions and receive answers in LANGUAGE or LANGUAGE , if a defendant understood one of those languages ( in this case both applicants understood LANGUAGE ) and did not ask for the assistance of an interpreter ( it did not appear from the record of the hearing that they had so asked ) . At no time had PERSON and PERSON been questioned in NORP .", "CARDINAL . The applicants maintained that the witnesses had not been \" isolated \" before giving their evidence , and that the alleged victim had heard the statements of the defendants before he gave evidence .", "CARDINAL . The Government considered these claims to be incorrect , having regard to the provisions of LAW of LAW in the version in force at the time .", "CARDINAL . Mr Janousek claimed that he had not had the benefit of the assistance of an interpreter during the investigative stage ; the interpr\u00c9tation provided at the trial had been incomplete , and this had prevented him from taking an active part in the hearing and in particular from commenting on the ORG evidence .", "CARDINAL . According to the information given to the ORG by the ORG , an interpreter appointed by the NORP authorities had been on duty during the entire proceedings , and there were no reasons for considering that the oral translations done by him had been inaccurate .", "Before the ORG , the NORP Government produced documents showing that a NORP - speaking interpreter , and later another interpreter , had acted during the investigation . They conceded , however , that the record of the trial was silent on this point .", "CARDINAL . Finally , Mr Janousek complained that he had not had the assistance of a lawyer during the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The ORG stated that the applicants had been informed when they were charged of their right to nominate a lawyer of their choice to defend their interests , and that they had made use of this right .", "CARDINAL . Andorran public law derives from CARDINAL pareatges or arbitral awards of CARDINAL and DATE . These asserted the principle of equality of rights between the feudal overlords , namely ORG ( whose rights were subsequently transferred to PERSON and later to the President of GPE ) and ORG . On the basis of these pareatges the overlords in the course of time granted privileges to the people of GPE and issued decrees ; these decrees were supplemented by customary law relating inter alia to the apportionment of powers among the institutions of the Principality .", "CARDINAL . In civil cases the LOC courts apply customary law as set out in the PERSON digest of DATE and the Politar of DATE , supplemented by NORP law , NORP law and canon law . In criminal matters the relevant sources of law are various decrees of the veguers and customary law , which were codified in DATE . Finally , the relevant laws in administrative cases are the provisions issued by the parish councils and ORG and those decreed by ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG is ruled by CARDINAL ORG , the President of GPE and ORG ( province of ORG , GPE ) .", "The latter has no public function in GPE , and since the agreement between ORG and GPE of DATE his appointment has been the exclusive responsibility of the Pope . ORG law does not impose any conditions as to nationality , and the bishop is very often a NORP or PERSON citizen . According to the NORP courts ( Audiencia Nacional , judgments of DATE and DATE ) , he enjoys the privileges and immunities which foreign heads of state have under international law .", "The Co - Princes\u2019 rights and prerogatives are attached to their offices and are consequently acquired and lost with them .", "CARDINAL . According to consistent and constant practice , ORG exercise their powers jointly . This general rule is based on custom and demonstrates the equality between ORG ; there are only very limited exceptions to it .", "CARDINAL . ORG also has powers which are his own . These are the appointment of a veguer and ORG , and of the members of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL \" Senates \" of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL below ) ; ORG , however , has the right of nomination of the batlles ( see paragraph DATE below ) and the notaries , which limits the freedom of the episcopal Co - Prince and the NORP veguer . There is also the right to decide on appeals en queixa - survivals from the feudal right of petition - brought against administrative regulations and decisions or laws passed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The veguers are the direct representatives of ORG in GPE ; they reside there and have PERSON nationality during their term of office . They are appointed for an indefinite period , the NORP veguer ( a diplomat ) by ORG and the episcopal veguer ( generally a NORP or PERSON ) by the episcopal Co - Prince .", "CARDINAL . They have powers of a legislative nature which are exercised by means of decrees and cover a number of fields : the organisation of civil and criminal justice and procedure ; immigration ; public safety , public order and the protection of morals . They also carry out tasks of an executive nature : command of the PERSON militia , which includes all men aged DATE , and of the LOC police ; issue or refusal of long - term residence permits to foreigners ; validation of PERSON passports ; examination of requests for acquisition of nationality . Finally , they have judicial functions : they carry out investigations for decisions of ORG on appeals en queixa ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and are entitled to sit on ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG , an institution set up at DATE , are not resident in GPE . ORG is ORG and is assisted in his duties by part of the prefect \u2019s office . The office of episcopal Permanent Delegate is traditionally given to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL Delegates have legislative , judicial and administrative powers , which they exercise jointly on behalf of ORG . In particular , they issue decrees - sometimes very important ones - in the \" constitutional \" field ( for example , the creation of the parish of PERSON in DATE and the establishment of ORG in DATE ) and the \" administrative \" field other than economic ( for example , the Code of Andorran Nationality of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also has a number of institutions whose members are elected by universal suffrage .", "CARDINAL . The territory of GPE is divided into CARDINAL parishes , each of which is administered by a council ( comu ) consisting of CARDINAL people elected for DATE , who choose from among their number a consol major and a consol minor . It manages the parish \u2019s affairs and property , and also has power to make regulations . Appeals to the Government can be brought against its decisions .", "CARDINAL . QUANTITY is a village or hamlet and exists in certain parishes only . Its council consists of CARDINAL member from each household ( casa ) , and the members appoint a representative ( llevador ) . In some cases it has administrative functions .", "CARDINAL . The origin of ORG goes back to the creation of ORG . It was restructured in DATE and again in DATE and is now defined as \" the political assembly most representative of the LOC people \" . It has QUANTITY members ( CARDINAL per parish ) who are elected for DATE by all NORP over DATE . The members elect a syndic general ( President ) and a sub - syndic ( Vice - President ) and work through juntas ( committees ) .", "ORG passes laws , approves the budget of the ORG and exercises oversight over the Government . In practice , ORG do not intervene in areas where it has competence , except when they are called on to decide an appeal en queixa ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "ORG chooses , from among its own members or from outside , ORG , who in turn appoints the other CARDINAL members of ORG . This institution was recently set up by ORG ( decree of DATE \" on the process of institutional reform \" ) . ORG has a variety of duties : implementation of decisions of ORG ; proposing texts for adoption ; preparation and subsequent implementation of the budget ; management and supervision of the administration and public services .", "ORG may adopt , by CARDINAL votes , a motion of no confidence in ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( NORP magna ) may be convened when decisions of exceptional importance are to be taken . It consists of ORG , the consols and CARDINAL other representatives from each parish , who are usually elected at a \" meeting of the people \" .", "CARDINAL . With the exception of ORG , which settles disputes between neighbours and is responsible to ORG , the courts of GPE have their legal basis in the ORG historic \" right of justice \" and are thus directly responsible to ORG .", "The members of the lower courts are always of Andorran nationality , while those of higher courts are often of foreign origin , because of the smallness of the ORG and out of concern for preserving the independence of the judiciary .", "CARDINAL . As a general rule , judges are appointed by ORG .", "The NORP Co - Prince traditionally selects NORP judges , either honorary judges or serving judges seconded by ORG , chosen with regard to personal competence , knowledge of LOC law , knowledge of NORP and understanding of NORP .", "The episcopal Co - Prince bases his choice on the criteria of competence , independence , lack of personal interests in GPE and availability for service , judicial office in GPE being incompatible with the position of judge in GPE , even on a part - time basis and for a fixed term .", "CARDINAL . A decree of the veguers of CARDINAL DATE laid the foundations of a new criminal justice system , providing in particular for the intervention of counsel and the establishment of a public prosecutor \u2019s office .

The NORP veguer - a diplomat appointed by ORG for an indefinite period - has since DATE been substituted by a NORP judge , either honorary or seconded by ORG .

The public prosecutor \u2019s office is composed of a fiscal general and an assistant fiscal general , who are appointed for DATE by whichever of ORG has not appointed the Judge of Appeals .", "CARDINAL . By a decree of CARDINAL DATE , which had been in the course of preparation since DATE , the veguers established a new court , the Tribunal Superior de Corts , which consists of CARDINAL judges appointed for DATE by ORG and decides on appeals ( recursos de suplicaci\u00f3 ) against judgments of ORG .", "On DATE they issued a further decree dealing with procedure , including the following transitional provisions :", "\" CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL of LAW provides for CARDINAL distinct systems of enforcement for sentences of imprisonment passed in GPE : a convicted person serves his sentence in an NORP prison if the sentence is DATE , and in a NORP or NORP prison in other cases .", "CARDINAL . In the latter case it is for the convicted person to choose between GPE and GPE . The choice is definitive and implies the tacit acceptance of the prison regime of the country chosen . This practice originates in customary law as traditionally applied since DATE .", "DATE , transfer to GPE was requested by CARDINAL convicted persons and to GPE by CARDINAL . No prisoners from GPE were admitted to NORP prisons in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . If a convicted person chooses GPE , as in the present case , enforcement of the sentence is governed by the provisions of LAW ( circular of the Minister of Justice of CARDINAL DATE ) .

An individual pardon can only be granted by the CARDINAL ORG acting jointly .", "CARDINAL . Collective pardons do not apply to prisoners sentenced by ORG courts who serve their sentences in GPE , as they were expressly excluded by a decree of the President of GPE of DATE . The presidential decrees of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE did authorise pardons to take effect if this was allowed by international agreements ratified by GPE , but there is no specific arrangement with GPE on this point .", "CARDINAL . Only the LOC authorities have jurisdiction to grant an amnesty . In addition , ORG can vary its own decision by reducing the sentence and granting genuine release on licence , which is referred to as \" provisional release \" .", "CARDINAL .

ORG has entered into a number of bilateral and multilateral relations in this field .", "DATE . Relations between GPE and GPE do not fit into the pattern of relations between sovereign GPE . They have never taken the form of international agreements , as the NORP ORG is the President of GPE and ORG have always refused to recognise the ORG \u2019s statehood . Such relations take a number of forms : unilateral NORP acts , such as the establishment of NORP schools ; administrative arrangements , such as those dealing with social security , telephone networks and customs regimes ; de facto relationships , sometimes deriving from custom ( this is the case with the enforcement of certain sentences outside GPE - see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , sometimes based on administrative or judicial practice ( decisions of the LOC courts have the status of res judicata in GPE and do not require an exequatur for enforcement ) .", "ORG also place a unit of police ( gendarmerie ) at the disposal of GPE .", "Finally , GPE does not have a consulate in the ORG . NORP nationals in GPE are dealt with by the prefecture of the ORG department .", "CARDINAL . Relations between GPE and GPE follow a similar pattern . They feature unilateral NORP acts , such as the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE regulating trade between the ORG and GPE , and bilateral arrangements such as the agreements of an administrative type relating to social security .", "ORG also make certain facilities available to the ORG . Thus a unit of the guardia civil is stationed in GPE : the members of this unit are no longer responsible to their original administrative department and the episcopal veguer can effectively veto their appointment or presence in GPE ; the NORP authorities are responsible for their pay , while the costs of equipment and operational expenditure in respect of administrative and in particular consular functions are borne by the PERSON budget .", "There is no NORP consulate in GPE . The episcopal veguer acts as de facto consul for NORP citizens .", "CARDINAL . ORG does not maintain diplomatic relations with any other ORG .", "On the other hand , it has entered into consular relations with the following CARDINAL countries : GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .

This sentiment is not CARDINAL of nostalgia , or so I presume , for you are at the same time resolutely looking to the future ; it is your firm will to play a full part in the progress of the modern world . The remarkable economic progress of the LOC during DATE bears witness to this , as does the modernisation of your institutions , which was embarked upon DATE and has gained new momentum in DATE .", "Since our last meeting in DATE a decisive step has been taken for the future of the ORG . This relates to the constitution which the elected representatives of ORG have wished the Principality to be endowed with . At the last ceremony of the questia I stated my willingness to encourage developments in the internal and international order , where they responded to the legitimate aspirations of the people of GPE . In this spirit I naturally gave my approval and support to the unanimous request of ORG to draft a constitution with the agreement of ORG and the active support of the LOC representatives , whose high sense of the public interest I wish to salute here . Agreement was reached on the working method , the objectives and the structure of the draft constitution .", "Thus there have already been written into the draft , on which much work has already been done , such fundamental principles as the establishment of a democratic sovereign ORG under the rule of law , recognition of the sovereignty of the people , respect for the territorial organisation of the parishes which has come down from history , the guarantee of rights and freedoms , the institution of a parliamentary system provided with rules to ensure the authority of the ORG and an effective control by ORG .", "You are likewise resolved to simplify and unify the organisation of the legal system , while preserving the greatest respect for its independence , in order better to ensure and guarantee the rights of those subject to the law , taking as your inspiration the principles and rules defined in LAW ; no doubt while awaiting the accession of the Principality to that Convention .", "I fully agree with these principles and I am delighted at the significant results obtained so far . I congratulate you on them .", "I have confidence in your will and your capacity for carrying on the work of drafting the constitution at the speed at which it has progressed until now , thanks to the excellent spirit of co - operation which inspires the joint meetings of your delegation and those of the CARDINAL ORG . I am indeed convinced that we can bring this task to a successful conclusion with a view to swiftly and democratically putting in place the constitution drawn up jointly by ORG . This method of permanent consultation has demonstrated its effectiveness . The tripartite commission has met CARDINAL times since DATE , at the ORG of the Valleys in GPE . Its work , which has invariably been constructive , has made it possible to avoid misunderstandings and overcome all sorts of difficulties .", "We do not conceal the facts , however . You are within sight of the goal , but the path to follow to reach it is still difficult . That is inevitable ; indeed , it is natural . Every innovative work , especially in the political field , is accompanied by hopes and fears , and arouses the necessary democratic debate , as well as legitimate ambitions and fervent personal commitment .", "I do not think that anything will weaken your determination . Mountain - dwellers like you know how to save their breath and measure their step according to the length or difficulty of the ascent . You are experienced men , patient men . You know , and you do not need me to tell you , that once the way to the summit has been decided on by common consent , there is no choice other than to succeed or fail together .", "You have very recently provided proof of your sense of your responsibilities by coming together despite your political differences so as the better to overcome the obstacles and attain the goal you have set yourselves .", "The ambitious and proud people you represent know the value of effort and of perseverance . I can not encourage you too much to continue with your task , certain as I am that you will know how to legislate , govern , administer , give justice and in short assume full responsibility for the ORG , which will soon be completely devolved to you .", "You will doubtless , at least to start with , have to act with boldness , but also with care to preserve the richness of your traditions and the identity of the parishes which originally joined together to form ORG .", "In this task , on which considerable progress has now been made , I am with you so that social justice may prevail , for without that there can be no true economic progress , and so that the elected representatives of ORG may exercise fully the internal sovereignty of GPE , without which there can be no international recognition .", "GPE and no doubt GPE , as your neighbours , will surely be the first to establish relations of friendship and co- operation with the future State of GPE .", "The signing of the association agreement between the ORG and ORG was the first step towards the integration of the ORG into ORG . Other steps will follow . The interest shown by you in particular in the regulation of the banking profession and the control of international flows of money demonstrates your concern not to stay apart from the new forms of solidarity which are coming into being so that law and fairness can prevail in the international order .", "You will henceforth be fully responsible for the ORG . The new institutions will be the cement , freely consented to , holding your nation together . Your freedom , given expression in elections , will strengthen your traditions and allow your country to join the international community while still affirming the power of its special features , its history and culture .", "That , gentlemen , is what I wished to say to you .
