{"ITEMID": "001-108843", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2012, "DOCNAME": "HIKMAT HABIB v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently in GPE .", ", may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant applied for asylum and a residence permit in GPE , claiming that he had arrived in GPE DATE . In written submissions and during interviews with ORG ( Migrationsverket ) , where the applicant \u2019s legal counsel was present , he stated that he was NORP , born in GPE , but that his family had been moved to GPE ( the capital of the NORP Regional Government area , hearafter \u201c the LOC area \u201d ) in DATE and had lived there until DATE when , after the fall of PERSON , they had returned to the family \u2019s house in GPE . He claimed that his father had then worked for ORG as an interpreter and that , in DATE , they had heard from neighbours that terrorists were looking for his father because he had cooperated with the NORP . The applicant further alleged that he and his uncle had owned a catering business which delivered food to the NORP troops in the area of GPE ( NORP ) . Thus , when his father was threatened by the terrorists , the applicant had also felt insecure and under threat due to his own work . He therefore terminated the contract with the NORP and he and his family , including his uncle , moved to the city of their ancestors , LOC ( a town outside GPE ) . The applicant acknowledged that he had never been personally threatened but , during his time in GPE , the family was informed that the terrorists were still looking for them in GPE . Moreover , the applicant claimed that he could not return to GPE since he had no relatives left there and the terrorists could find him there as well . To prove his identity , the applicant submitted a certificate of citizenship issued in GPE in DATE and an identity card issued in GPE in DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the applicant had lived most of his life in GPE and that he was NORP and that , therefore , it would try his asylum claim on the basis that he came from the KRG area of GPE . ORG then observed that he had not shown that he could not benefit from the protection and help of the authorities in the KRG area against the alleged terrorist threat . In its view , nothing in the case indicated that the applicant would not benefit from the authorities\u2019 protection to the same extent as other citizens of the area . As the ORG found that there were no other grounds on which to grant the applicant leave to remain in GPE , it rejected his application . ORG added , for information , that it had a contract with a NORP organisation with the goal of facilitating reintegration for returnees to the KRG area through labour market measures , such as financial support to create a business .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining his claims and adding that , in DATE , his family \u2019s house in ORG had been the target of a grenade attack . His family had then moved to GPE . Thus , it was clear to him that the authorities could not protect him . Moreover , he wanted his application to be tried on the basis that he came from GPE and not the KRG area since he had no personal connection to that area .", "On DATE ORG , after having held an oral hearing , rejected the appeal . It first noted that since ORG had tried the applicant \u2019s claim in relation to the LOC , the court would do so as well . Moreover , since he had lived there most of his life and done all his schooling there , including after reaching maturity , the court found that he had a close connection to GPE . In respect to this , it also noted that his certificate of citizenship had been issued in GPE in DATE for which reason he should have no practical problems returning there . As concerned the threat from terrorists , the court noted that these had primarily been directed against the applicant \u2019s father and that they had emanated from individual persons , not the authorities . Furthermore , the threats had occurred in GPE . As the applicant had not been able to specify any concrete threat against him personally , in particular if he were to return to GPE , the court concluded that he had not shown that he would face a real and personal risk of persecution or ill - treatment in the LOC area . As there was no other ground on which to grant the applicant leave to remain in GPE , the court upheld ORG decision in full .", "On DATE ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused leave to appeal . The deportation order thereby became enforceable .", "In DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG for reconsideration of his case due to new circumstances . He maintained his previous claims but added that he had contacted ORG in GPE to ask some former colleagues about the threats against him . In reply , he had received a letter , via e - mail on DATE , from PERSON , Company Commander in GPE which he insisted proved that he was sought by terrorists and that they wanted to kill him . The e - mail included a \u201c Memorandum for NORP Migration Board \u201d , dated DATE , and signed by PERSON , Company Commander in GPE . In this , the commander stated that , during his first deployment to GPE in DATE , he had been stationed in GPE where the applicant \u2019s father had been his interpreter . In this connection , he had also come to know the applicant who had \u201c played a key role in the establishment of a new ORG in GPE through the coordination and delivery of a food service contract in support of this Company . \u201d ORG had provided security for over CARDINAL NORP citizens but had put the applicant at risk from ORG . Against this background , the commander asked ORG to \u201c give special consideration to [ the applicant ] when deciding his immigration status \u201d since \u201c [ f]orcing him to return to GPE at this time poses great risks to his personal safety . \u201d", "On DATE ORG decided not to reconsider the case since no new circumstances had been presented and it had already considered the applicant \u2019s fear of being targeted by terrorists .", "The applicant appealed to ORG , insisting that the letter clearly showed that he was a target for terrorists and that he was at the top of their \u201c death list \u201d . On DATE the court upheld the ORG \u2019s decision in full . It is unclear whether this judgment was appealed against to ORG .", "The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) which replaced , on DATE , the old LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) . Both the old Aliens Act and the DATE Act define the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "LAW , of the DATE Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies , under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "Under LAW , matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . Hence , upon entry into force on DATE of the DATE Act , ORG ceased to exist .", "The ORG \u2019s \u201c Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of NORP Asylum - Seekers \u201d , dated DATE states , inter alia , that since DATE the CARDINAL NORP Governorates of Dahuk , GPE and GPE have largely escaped the violence and collapse of law and order prevalent in many parts of LOC and remain relatively quiet and stable although the security situation remains tenuous and unpredictable for a number of reasons . Therefore , the ORG maintains its position thus far that claims from asylum - seekers from these CARDINAL LOC should be individually assessed based on the DATE LAW . The ORG further observes that persons originating from this area can enter the Governorate of GPE without any restrictions . Moreover , it notes that , generally , the NORP authorities will be able and willing to provide protection although certain persons , particularly those fleeing \u201c honour killings \u201d or tribal conflict ( blood feud ) , may still be reached by their persecutors if relocated within GPE .", "As concerns the situation of NORP affiliated with ORG ( MNF - I ) in all of GPE , the ORG maintains its previous position that civilians employed or otherwise affiliated with ORG are at risk of being targeted by non - state actors . In areas where security has improved over DATE ) , the risks to persons affiliated with the ORG - I have diminished to some extent , but are still considerable given the continued influence of extremist groups . The risk is particularly high for persons working as interpreters for the ORG - I given their exposure and possible involvement in military activities , for example arrests , raids or interrogation of insurgent or militia members .", "The position of the LAW in the above LAW has been endorsed as still being valid in their \u201c Note of FAC of the DATE ORG of ORG \u201d , dated DATE . This note further observes that GPE remains relatively stable , though assaults on journalists and political opponents have been reported .", "Moreover , ORG \u201c Report DATE on GPE \u201d states , inter alia , that the GPE region remains largely unaffected by the political violence seen in other parts of GPE and that human rights conditions continues generally to improve , although many abuses are reported .", "This view is shared by the \u201c DATE Report on Human Rights in GPE \u201d by ORG / ORG , dated DATE , which notes that the situation is generally improving in the GPE region . In their view , the security situation is stable , with very few security incidents or casualties reported ( CARDINAL reported civilian deaths in the ORG area during DATE ) . They further observe that the improved security situation , matched with the increasing openness of ORG authorities , means greater participation of civil society and NGOs in seeking solutions to the remaining human rights concerns in the region . In this respect , ORG has shown itself to be open to dialogue and to work in a largely cooperative manner with ORG in relation to human rights issues throughout the region ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
