The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is a journalist by profession .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant published in the DATE magazine L\u2019Illustr\u00e9 an article entitled \u201c Tragedy on FAC \u2013 the reckless driver \u2019s version \u2013 Questioning of the mad driver \u201d ( \u201c Drame du Grand - Pont \u00e0 Lausanne \u2013 la version du chauffard DATE l\u2019interrogatoire du conducteur fou \u201d ) . The article in question concerned a set of criminal proceedings against PERSON , a motorist who had been remanded in custody after an incident on DATE in which he had rammed his car into pedestrians , before throwing himself off FAC ( ORG ) . He had killed CARDINAL of them and injured CARDINAL others . The incident had caused much emotion and controversy in GPE because of the extraordinary circumstances of the case . The article began as follows :", "\u201c Surname : B. First name : PERSON on DATE in PERSON ( GPE ) , son of PERSON and GPE , resident in GPE , holder of a category C licence , spouse of ORG : nursing assistant ... It is TIME on DATE , in the austere LOC of the GPE criminal investigation department . TIME after his tragic headlong race along FAC , resulting in CARDINAL deaths and QUANTITY casualties , this reckless driver is alone for the first time , facing CARDINAL investigators . Will he own up ? In fact he does n\u2019t actually seem to realise what is happening , as if oblivious to the events and all the hubbub around him . The man who upset the whole of GPE DATE is not very talkative . This NORP citizen is withdrawn , introverted , inscrutable , indeed completely impenetrable . And yet the questions are flying from all sides . What were the reasons for this \u2018 accident\u2019 , one of the policemen rather clumsily writes , as if he had already formed his opinion . CARDINAL words in reply : \u2018 I do not know\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article continued with a summary of the questions put by the police officers and the investigating judge and PERSON \u2019s replies . It also mentioned that PERSON had been \u201c charged with premeditated murder ( assassinat ) and , in the alternative , with murder ( meurtre ) , grievous bodily harm , endangering life and serious traffic offences \u201d , and that he \u201c show[ed ] no remorse \u201d . The article was accompanied by several photographs of letters which PERSON had sent to the investigating judge . It ended with the following paragraph :", "\u201c From his prison cell , PERSON now spends his time sending letters to the investigating judge ... : on being taken into custody he asked for his watch to be returned and requested a cup for his coffee , some dried fruit and chocolate . On DATE , DATE after the events , he even asked to be temporarily released for \u2018 a few days\u2019 . \u2018 I would like to phone my big brother in Algeria\u2019 , he subsequently begged . He finally announced on DATE that he had come to a \u2018 final GPE : he dismissed his lawyer , PERSON , on grounds of \u2018 lack of ORG . DATE , another letter : could the judge send him \u2018 the directory of ORG of the GPE of Vaud\u2019 to help him find a different defence lawyer ? However , with all the recurrent lies and omissions , the mixture of naivety and arrogance , amnesia and sheer madness characterising all these statements , surely PERSON is doing all in his power to make himself impossible to defend ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article also included a brief summary entitled \u201c He lost his marbles ... \u201d ( \u201c Il a perdu la boule ... \u201d ) , and statements from PERSON \u2019s wife and ORG .", "CARDINAL . M.B. did not lodge any complaint against the applicant . However , criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant on the initiative of the public prosecutor for having published secret documents . It emerged from the investigation that CARDINAL of the parties claiming damages in the proceedings against PERSON had photocopied the case file and lost CARDINAL of the copies in a shopping centre . An unknown person had then brought the copy to the offices of the magazine which had published the impugned article .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE the GPE investigating judge sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment , suspended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following an application by the applicant to have the decision set aside , ORG , by a judgment of DATE , replaced the prison sentence with a fine of MONEY ( CHF ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . His appeal was dismissed on DATE by ORG of the GPE of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG , which on DATE dismissed his public - law appeal and his appeal on grounds of nullity . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE . The relevant passages from the decision are as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In short , the applicant submits that his conviction for a breach of LAW is contrary to federal law . He does not challenge the fact that the information which he published falls within the ambit of LAW . He does , on the other hand , submit , under an interpretation of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW in the light of the principles inferred from LAW by ORG , that having received that information in good faith without any unlawful dealings he had the duty as a professional journalist , under LAW , to publish them owing to what he sees as the obvious interest of the so - called \u2018 GPE case to the general public in LANGUAGE - speaking GPE .", "CARDINAL In accordance with LAW of secret official deliberations ) , anyone who , without being entitled to do so , makes public all or part of the proceedings of an investigation or the deliberations of an authority which are secret by law or by virtue of a decision taken by that authority , acting within its powers , will be punished by a fine ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Complicity in such acts is also punishable ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) . The court may decide not to impose any penalties if the secret thus made public is of minor importance ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "According to case - law , this provision proceeds from a formal conception of secrecy . It is sufficient that the proceedings , deliberations or investigations in question have been declared secret by law or under a decision taken by the authority , or in other words that there has been an intention to keep them from becoming public , regardless of the type of classification selected ( for example , top secret or confidential ) . On the other hand , strict secrecy presupposes that the holder of the specific information wishes to keep it secret , that there is a legitimate interest at stake , and that the information is known or accessible only to a select group of persons ( see ORG [ Judgments of ORG ] CARDINAL IV CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , and CARDINAL / aa , p. CARDINAL ) . This state of affairs was not altered by the entry into force of paragraph CARDINAL of this LAW ( RO CARDINAL CARDINAL ; FF DATE IV CARDINAL ) . That rule concerns not secrets in the substantive sense but rather instances of futile , petty or excessive concealment ( see ORG CARDINAL FAC , point CARDINAL / bb , p. CARDINAL ) . In order to exclude the application of paragraph CARDINAL , the court must therefore first of all examine the reasons for classifying the information as secret . It must , however , do so with restraint , without interfering with the discretionary power wielded by the authority which declared the information secret . It is sufficient that this declaration should nonetheless appear tenable vis - \u00e0 - vis the content of the proceedings , investigations or deliberations in issue . Moreover , the journalists\u2019 viewpoint on the interest in publishing the information is irrelevant ( see ORG CARDINAL PERSON , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . In its PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , ORG confirmed that this formal conception of secrecy was not contrary to LAW inasmuch as it did not prevent ORG from determining whether the interference in issue was compatible with LAW , by assessing , in the context of its examination of LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , the justification for classifying a given piece of information as secret , on the one hand , and weighing up the interests at stake , on the other ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL NORP In the present case the offence with which the appellant is charged concerned the publication of records of interviews and correspondence contained in the case file of a live criminal investigation .", "In pursuance of LAW ( ORG ) , all investigations must remain secret until their final conclusion ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) . The secrecy requirement relates to all the evidence uncovered by the investigation itself as well as all non - public decisions and investigative measures ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) . The law also specifies that the following are bound by secrecy vis - \u00e0 - vis anyone who does not have access to the case file : the judges and judicial staff ( save in cases where disclosure would facilitate the investigation or is justified on public - order , administrative or judicial grounds ; see LAW ) , and also the parties , their friends and relatives , their lawyers , the latter \u2019s associates , consultants and staff , and any experts and witnesses . However , disclosure to friends or relatives by the parties or their lawyer is not punishable ( see LAW CPP / VD ) . Lastly , the law provides for a range of exceptions . As an exception to LAW , the cantonal investigating judge and , with the latter \u2019s agreement , the judge responsible for the preliminary inquiry or senior police officers specially appointed by the cantonal government [ ORG d\u2019Etat ] ( see LAW , paragraph CARDINAL ) may inform the press , radio or television about a pending investigation if so required by the public interest or considerations of fairness , particularly where public cooperation is required to shed light on an offence , in cases which are particularly serious or are already known to the general public , or where erroneous information must be corrected or the general public reassured ( see Article CARDINALb paragraph CARDINAL CPP / VD ) .", "The present case therefore concerns secrecy imposed by the law rather than by an official decision .", "CARDINAL As a general rule , the reason for the confidentiality of judicial investigations , which applies to most sets of cantonal criminal proceedings , is the need to protect the interests of the criminal proceedings by anticipating risks of collusion and the danger of evidence being tampered with or destroyed . Nevertheless , the interests of the accused must not be disregarded either , particularly vis - \u00e0 - vis the presumption of innocence and , more broadly , the accused \u2019s personal relations and interests ( see ORG , PERSON , CARDINALth ed . , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , op . cit . , \u00a7 CARDINAL , no . DATE , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , ORG p\u00e9nale suisse : DATE . , DATE , no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) , as well as the need to protect the opinion - forming process and the decision - making process within a ORG authority , as protected , precisely , by LAW ( see ORG CARDINAL FAC , point CARDINAL / aa , p. CARDINAL ) . ORG has already had occasion to deem such a purpose legitimate in itself . The aim is to guarantee the authority and impartiality of the judiciary in accordance with the wording of LAW , which also mentions the protection of the reputation or rights of others ( see PERSON v. GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , \u00a7 DATE , and PERSON and Others v. GPE , judgment of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Furthermore , in so far as the impugned publication concerned excerpts from records of interviews of the accused and reproduced certain letters sent by the latter to the investigating judge , this evidence can validly be classified secret , by prohibiting public access to it , as provided by the legislation of the GPE of GPE . This is the inescapable conclusion as regards the records of interviews of the accused , as it would be inadmissible to allow such documents to be discussed in the public sphere , before the conclusion of the investigation , before the trial and out of context , in a manner liable to influence the decisions taken by the investigating judge and the trial court . It is also the only possible conclusion as regards the letters sent by the accused to the investigating judge , which letters focused on practical problems and criticisms of his lawyer ( see ORG judgment , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . We might point out here that it appears from the impugned publication DATE which the cantonal authorities did not reproduce in full in their decisions , although they did refer to it and its content is not disputed \u2013 that the aforementioned practical problems concerned requests for temporary release and for access to personal effects ( letters of DATE ) , for a change of cell ( letter of CARDINAL DATE ) and for authorisation to use the telephone ( letter of CARDINAL DATE ) . Regardless of the guarantee of the presumption of innocence and the inferences concerning the detainee \u2019s personality which might be drawn during the criminal proceedings from such correspondence , the detainee , whose liberty is considerably restricted , even in respect of everyday acts relating to his private , or indeed intimate , life , can expect the authority restricting his liberty to protect him from public exposure of the practical details of his life as a remand prisoner and as a person under examination ( see LAW ) .", "It follows that in the instant case the information published by the appellant , in so far as it concerned the content of the records of his interviews and his correspondence with the investigating judge , can not be described as a secret of minor importance for the purposes of Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW . Nonetheless , the impugned publication fulfilled the conditions set out in LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW .", "CARDINAL Moreover , the information in question may be described as being secret in substantive terms because it was only accessible to a restricted number of persons ( the investigating judge and the parties to the proceedings ) . Furthermore , the investigating court was desirous to keep them secret , with not only a legitimate interest in doing so but an obligation under LAW , the justification for which was mentioned above ( see point PERSON above ) .", "CARDINAL NORP Therefore , the only remaining point at issue is the existence of justification .", "CARDINAL . In short , the appellant submits that he had the professional duty ( under former Article CARDINAL of LAW ) as a journalist to publish the information in question because of the public interest for the population of LANGUAGE - speaking GPE of the \u2018 GPE NORP case , which he describes as self - evident . He considers that in the light of NORP case - law , the basic point is that publication is justified in principle unless there is a pressing social need to maintain secrecy . From the standpoint of good faith , Article CARDINAL should apply to journalists who have nothing to do with the indiscretion committed by a third person and who receive information without committing any offence themselves other than the breach of secrecy stemming from the publication . Lastly , he contends that the mode of publication is not a relevant criterion .", "CARDINAL As regards the former point , the cantonal court found that while the accident of CARDINAL DATE , the circumstances of which were undoubtedly unusual , had triggered a great deal of public emotion , it had nevertheless , in legal terms , been simply a road accident with fatal consequences , and did not in itself entail any obvious public interest . It was not a case of collective trauma on the part of the GPE population , which would have justified reassuring the citizens and keeping them informed of the progress of the investigation ( see judgment appealed against , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It is true that the \u2018 FAC attracted extensive media coverage ( see ORG judgment , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , to which the cantonal judgment refers ( judgment appealed against , point B , p. CARDINAL ) ) . However , this circumstance alone , alongside the unusual nature of the accident , is insufficient to substantiate a major public interest in publishing the confidential information in question . Unless it can be justified per se , the public interest triggered by media coverage of events can not constitute a public interest in the disclosure of classified information , because that would mean that it would be sufficient to prompt public interest in a certain event in order subsequently to justify the publication of confidential information to fuel that interest . Furthermore , such a public interest is manifestly lacking as regards the letters published . As we have seen above ( see point QUANTITY above ) , these letters virtually exclusively concerned criticisms levelled by the accused against his lawyer and such practical problems as requests for temporary release , for access to personal effects , to change cells and to use the telephone . This type of information provides no relevant insights into the accident or the circumstances surrounding it . It relates to the private , or indeed intimate , life of the person in custody , and it is difficult to see any interest which its publication could satisfy other than a certain kind of voyeurism . The same applies to the appellant \u2019s requests to the investigating judge in relation to his choice of defence lawyer . Nor is it clear , as regards the records of his interviews , what political question or matter of public interest would have arisen or been worth debating in the public sphere , and the cantonal authorities explicitly ruled out the existence of any collective trauma which might have justified reassuring or informing the population . This finding of fact , which the appellant has not disputed in his public - law appeal , is binding on this court ( see section CARDINAL bis of LAW ) . That being the case , the appellant fails to demonstrate the \u2018 obvious\u2019 interest to the general public of the information published , and the cantonal court can not be criticised for having concluded that at the very most , such an interest involved satisfying an unhealthy curiosity .", "CARDINAL NORP The other CARDINAL factors relied upon by the appellant concern his behaviour ( good faith in access to information and mode of publication ) .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL DATE It should first of all be noted that Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code punishes only the disclosure of information , irrespective of how the perpetrator obtained it . Moreover , even under Article CARDINAL ORG , ORG does not attach decisive importance to this fact when considering whether applicants have fulfilled their duties and responsibilities . The determining fact is rather that they could not claim in good faith to be unaware that disclosure of the information was punishable by law ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and PERSON and PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI ) . This point is well - established in the present case ( see section B above ) .", "CARDINAL On the other hand , the mode of publication can play a more important role in the context of safeguarding freedom of expression . While ORG reiterates that neither it , nor the domestic courts for that matter , should substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists , in weighing up the interests at stake it nevertheless takes account of the content , vocabulary and format of the publication , and of the headings and sub - headings ( whether chosen by the journalist or the editors ) , and the accuracy of the information ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL et seq . , esp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "In the instant case the cantonal court ruled that the tone adopted by the appellant in his article showed that his main concern was not , as he claims , to inform the general public about the ORG \u2019s conduct of the criminal investigation . The headline of the article ( \u2018 Questioning of the mad driver\u2019 , \u2018 the reckless driver \u2019s PERSON ) already lacked objectivity . It suggested that the case had already been tried in the author \u2019s view , in the sense that the fatalities on FAC had been caused not by an ordinary motorist but by a \u2018 mad PERSON , a man \u2018 oblivious to the events and all the hubbub around him\u2019 ; The journalist concluded by wondering whether the driver was not doing his best to \u2018 make himself impossible to defend\u2019 . The manner in which he quoted the excerpts from the records of interviews and reproduced the letters sent by the defendant to the judge pointed to the motives of the author of the impugned article : he confined himself to sensationalism , his modus operandi being exclusively geared to satisfying the relatively unhealthy curiosity which anyone is liable to feel about this type of case . Readers of this highly biased publication would have formed an opinion and subjectively prejudged the future action to be taken by the courts regarding this case , without the least respect for the principle of presumption of innocence ( see judgment appealed against , point CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . The cantonal court concluded that this factor did not indicate that the public interest in receiving information prevailed . That court can not be criticised on that account .", "NORP The appellant also submitted that the records of interviews and the letters would in any case be mentioned in subsequent public hearings . He inferred from this that preserving the confidentiality of this information could therefore not be justified by any \u2018 pressing social ORG .", "However , the mere possibility that the secrecy of criminal investigations might be lifted during a subsequent phase of proceedings , particularly during the trial , which is generally subject to the publicity principle , does not undermine the justification for keeping judicial investigations confidential , because the primary aim is to protect the opinion - forming and decision - making processes on the part not only of the trial court but also of the investigating authority , until the completion of this secret phase of proceedings . Moreover , far from being neutral and comprehensive , the publication in issue included comments and assessments which presented the information in issue in a particular light , without providing the opportunities for adversarial argument which are the very essence of proceedings in trial courts .", "CARDINAL Lastly , the appellant did not explicitly criticise the amount of the fine imposed on him . Nor did he challenge the refusal to grant him a probationary period after which the fine would be struck ( former Article CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , in conjunction with former DATE , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW ) under NORP law . From the angle of weighing up the interest in the interference , we might simply note that the fine imposed , the amount of which took into account a previous conviction dating back to DATE ( imposition of a LAW fine , which could be struck out after a DATE probationary period , for coercion and defamation ) , does not exceed CARDINAL the amount of the appellant \u2019s DATE income at the material time ( see ORG judgment , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , and there is nothing to suggest that his freelance status at the time of the first - instance judgment led to any significant drop in his earnings . It should also be pointed out that at CHF CARDINAL,CARDINAL the amount of the fine is below the statutory maximum set out in former LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW ( as in force until DATE ) , and that this maximum amount , set by the legislature DATE , was not revised before the entry into force of the new general section of LAW , which now sets a figure of CHF MONEY ( see Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW as in force since DATE ) . Furthermore , the sanction for the offence with which the appellant is charged did not prevent him from expressing his views , since it was imposed after the article had been published ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . That being the case , it is unclear , in view of the nature of the offence charged ( the least serious in the classification set out in LAW ) , the amount of the fine and the time of its imposition , how it could be regarded as a form of censorship .", "CARDINAL NORP It follows from the foregoing that the appellant disclosed a secret within the meaning of Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW and that he can not rely on any justifying factor in his favour . The decision appealed against does not violate federal law as interpreted in the light of the provisions of the LAW relied upon by the appellant . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
