The case concerns the national authorities ' failure to implement the domestic courts ' order to shut down CARDINAL thermal power plants which pollute the environment in the province of PERSON , in south - west GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are all lawyers who live and practise in GPE , a city which is QUANTITY from the site of the power plants . Relying on LAW and section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , the applicants argued that it was their constitutional right to live in a healthy and balanced environment , and their duty to ensure the protection of the environment and to prevent environmental pollution .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON , PERSON and ORG thermal power plants have been operated for DATE by ORG and the public utility company ORG ( \u201c TEA\u015e \u201d ) in PERSON , in the LOC region of GPE . In the course of their operation , the poor - quality coal used by the plants to produce energy has caused pollution and harmed the region 's biological diversity .", "CARDINAL . NORP By petitions of DATE , DATE and DATE , the applicants called on ORG , of the Environment and of ORG , TEA\u015e and the PERSON provincial governor to take action to halt the operation of the PERSON , PERSON and PERSON thermal power plants . They claimed that these CARDINAL power plants had failed to obtain the requisite licences and that their operation constituted a danger to public health and to the environment .", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned administrative authorities did not reply to the applicants ' request , which , under section ORG ) of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , amounted to a refusal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicants brought CARDINAL separate actions in ORG concerning the PERSON , PERSON and PERSON power plants respectively , against ORG , of ORG and of the Environment , TEA\u015e and the PERSON provincial governor 's office . They requested that the administrative decision refusing to halt the power plants ' operation be set aside . The applicants further asked the court to order an interim measure to suspend the activities of these power plants on the ground that they were causing irreparable harm to nature and to public health . As to their legal capacity to bring the proceedings in question , the applicants relied on LAW and sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG appointed a panel of experts , composed of CARDINAL university professors who were experts in forestry , the environment and chemistry respectively , with a view to determining the effects of the CARDINAL power plants ' operation on the environment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the experts submitted their reports to the court . They concluded that the plants emitted considerable amounts of nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide and were not equipped with the mandatory chimney filters . They found that the power plants constituted a danger to a zone measuring QUANTITY in diameter . Accordingly , they recommended that the ORG power plant be immediately shut down , that CARDINAL unit in each of the PERSON and PERSON power plants should cease to operate and that desulphurisation units should be installed in them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an interlocutory injunction for suspension of the power plants ' operation . It found that TEA\u015e had been operating the plants since DATE under the guise of \u201c test operations \u201d , without having obtained the requisite permits for construction , gas emissions and the discharge of waste water . On the basis of the experts ' findings , the court noted that the plants had already caused pollution that was harmful to human health and the environment and that their continued operation could cause irreparable harm to the public . Consequently , it ruled that the administrative authorities ' decision refusing to halt the plants ' operation had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE , an appellate body responsible for examining decisions given by a single judge in the administrative courts , dismissed the defendant authorities ' appeal against the injunction of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants alleged before ORG that the continued operation of the ORG power plant would lead to environmental disaster . In particular , it would reduce the number of marine fish species , harm forests and agricultural areas and would have an adverse impact on tourism on account of the risk of hazardous emissions . In this connection , they claimed that the authorities had failed to prepare an environmental impact report and to obtain the necessary operating permits .", "CARDINAL . In its submissions to ORG , ORG disputed the applicants ' legal capacity to bring the action in question , alleging that they did not have a legal interest to bring such an action as required by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It further claimed , inter alia , that there was no requirement to obtain an environmental impact report and that the authorities had already applied for the requisite permits . It also noted that the authorities were taking the necessary steps to install a new flue gas desulphurisation system .", "CARDINAL . NORP In addition to those submissions from ORG , ORG and of the Environment , TEA\u015e and the PERSON provincial governor 's office claimed that the case ought to be dismissed because the necessary equipment would be installed in the plant to prevent pollution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set aside the defendant authorities ' decision to refuse to halt the operation of the ORG power plant . In its decision , the court first dismissed the objection concerning the applicants ' alleged lack of a legal interest to bring an action to halt the plant 's operation . Referring to section CARDINAL of LAW , the court noted that there was no requirement to claim a violation of a personal interest in cases concerning the protection of the environment or the historical and cultural heritage , or which were closely related to issues of public interest ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It further found that the thermal power plant was being operated as a \u201c test operation \u201d and did not have the requisite permits . In this connection , the court found , inter alia :", "\u201c ... Furthermore , in order to determine whether the thermal power plant caused damage to the environment , a survey of the area was conducted by CARDINAL experts , namely Professor PERSON , Professor PERSON and Professor PERSON . The [ aforementioned experts ' ] report , on which this judgment is based , noted that the PERSON ( PERSON ) thermal power plant consisted of CARDINAL units , each capable of generating QUANTITY of electricity . The plant uses poor - quality lignite coal to generate energy . It has no equipment for filtering sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide gases discharged through its chimneys ... Each of the CARDINAL units of the Kemerk\u00f6y thermal power plant uses QUANTITY of coal . It is not possible to decrease air pollution by reducing the capacity of a thermal power plant which uses poor - quality coal . It appears that QUANTITY of coal are stocked on the thermal power plant 's LOC . Given that the DATE amount of coal to be used by the CARDINAL units is QUANTITY , the thermal power plant would need to operate for DATE to use up all the coal . If even CARDINAL unit of the Kemerk\u00f6y power plant were to operate , this would have a detrimental effect on the environment . The gas emitted from the chimneys disperses over an area measuring QUANTITY in diameter ... Should CARDINAL units of the GPE and CARDINAL units of the ORG thermal power plants be operated , the NORP and Bet\u00e7e zones of the PERSON peninsula would be adversely affected by sulphur dioxide . The delivery of coal to the power plant by ship would also cause marine pollution . [ It follows ] that the operation of the Kemerk\u00f6y power plant has a harmful effect not only on the areas in the vicinity but also on distant areas . [ Accordingly ] , in order to remove the sulphur dioxide from the gas discharged through the chimneys , desulphurisation units must be installed . This would remove PERCENT of the sulphur dioxide .", "Our country 's electrical energy needs can never be disregarded . However , the electricity plants in operation , or to be constructed , must meet the requirements of the above - mentioned regulations , so that the public interest is respected . The public interest can not be said to have been respected if irreparable harm is caused to the environment merely in order to generate electricity .", "It appears that the requisite measures were not taken prior to the plant 's construction and the start of operations . Despite the possibility of minimising the adverse environmental effects of the power plants , which represent a long - term ORG investment , it is obvious that the necessary steps were not taken or that little was done from the planning stage to the point of commencing operations .", "The financial cost of installing a flue gas desulphurisation system must not be a deterrent . Discussion of the financial cost of the benefit that would accrue to the population from the measures to be taken by the administration is incompatible with the aim of a social ORG ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Given that the thermal power plant had caused environmental pollution , that no preventive measure had been taken and that the requisite permits for construction , operation , gas emission and the discharge of waste water had not been obtained , the court concluded that the refusal of the applicants ' request to halt the plant 's operation had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The applicants contended before ORG that the operation of the ORG power plant without the requisite permits and installations would lead to environmental disaster . They therefore asked the court to set aside the administrative authorities ' decision to refuse to halt the plant 's operation .", "CARDINAL . ORG claimed that the power plant had received the requisite construction permit and that TEA\u015e was taking the necessary steps to install flue gas desulphurisation equipment . However , it denied that the power plant was polluting the environment and claimed that closure of the plant would give rise to energy shortages in the NORP region .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted that the plaintiffs did not have a legal interest to bring such an action as required by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It contended , inter alia , that the relevant authorities were taking the necessary steps to prevent the plant from polluting the environment .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry of the Environment maintained that it did not have authority to issue an operating permit for power plants but was nonetheless required to submit its opinion on such permits . It noted that it had already sent an opinion to ORG and to TEA\u015e . In its view , no environmental impact report was required in respect of the power plant , since it had been constructed prior to the enactment of LAW .", "CARDINAL . For its part , TEA\u015e asserted that the plaintiffs did not have a legal interest in the action and that the case should therefore be dismissed . It alleged , inter alia , that the power plant had received the requisite permits from the authorities and that it had been equipped with electronic chimney filters . The company further claimed that there was no alternative energy supply , and that the power plant 's closure would result in energy shortages in the region .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment similar to that in the case of the ORG thermal power plant , and set aside the administrative authorities ' decision to refuse to close the ORG thermal power plant . Relying on the experts ' report , the court noted that the ORG plant did not have the necessary operating permits and that it had already polluted the environment . It therefore found that the administrative authorities ' decision had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The applicants argued before ORG that the PERSON power plant had been in operation since DATE and that the damage it caused to the environment had been observed since DATE . They contended that the defendant authorities had failed to obtain the requisite permits for the power plant 's operation . They therefore asked the court to set aside the administrative authorities ' decision to refuse to close the plant .", "CARDINAL . As they had done in the cases of the ORG and PERSON plants , the defendant administrative authorities challenged the applicants ' legal interest to bring an action in ORG for the purpose of shutting down the PERSON plant . They denied that the plant polluted the environment and claimed that the necessary permits would be obtained and that flue gas desulphurisation equipment would be installed . The administrative authorities also pointed out that there would be a significant energy shortage in the region if the plant 's operation were to be halted . They asked the court to dismiss the action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the defendants ' objection concerning the applicants ' alleged lack of legal interest and set aside the administrative decision to continue the plant 's operation without obtaining the requisite permits . Referring to the experts ' report , the court reasoned that the plant was polluting the environment and therefore concluded that the administrative decision to refuse to halt the plant 's operation had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . By decisions of CARDINAL and DATE , ORG upheld the above - mentioned CARDINAL judgments of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the defendant authorities ' requests for rectification .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of LAW of LAW and of LAW , the administrative authorities are obliged to comply with court decisions and to enforce them within DATE following service of the decision ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG , composed of the Prime Minister and other cabinet ministers , decided that the CARDINAL thermal power plants should continue to operate , despite the administrative courts ' judgments . ORG reasoned that closure of the plants would give rise to energy shortages and loss of employment and would thus affect the region 's income from tourism . Taking the view that the necessary measures were being taken by the authorities with a view to preventing the plants from polluting the environment , ORG decided that the plants ' operation should not be halted .", "CARDINAL . In letters of CARDINAL and DATE , the applicants asked the defendant administrative authorities to enforce the judgments of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed criminal complaints with the offices of ORG and of the public prosecutors in the jurisdictions in which the plants were situated . They asked the prosecutors to institute criminal proceedings against the members of ORG and other relevant administrative authorities for failure to execute the court decisions .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG informed the applicants that the operation of the CARDINAL thermal power plants would not be halted . It was noted that the power plants were responsible for PERCENT of the country 's total electricity production and that their contribution to the economy was estimated at MONEY . ORG further argued that CARDINAL people would lose their jobs and the region 's tourist sector would be adversely affected if these plants were to cease to operate . It was further claimed that contracts had already been signed for the installation of new flue gas desulphurisation systems and that the necessary measures were therefore being taken to protect the environment and public health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision not to prosecute the Prime Minister and other ministers , having regard to LAW which stipulated that the prosecution of these authorities would require a parliamentary investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision not to prosecute the director of the PERSON thermal power plant , given that ORG judgment had not been served on him , and that ORG 's directors were not responsible for taking action to comply with the court 's judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Milas Chief Public Prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute the directors of the ORG and ORG thermal power plants . ORG stated that the directors of the power plants were merely implementing ORG decision of DATE and that there were no grounds for considering that they were deliberately refusing to comply with the administrative courts ' judgments .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted a copy of CARDINAL judgments given by ORG in civil matters ( sulh hukuk mahkemesi ) . In these cases , brought against TEA\u015e , the plaintiffs , who were farmers living in the vicinity of the PERSON thermal power plant , alleged that the quality and quantity of their olive and tobacco production had been adversely affected by the poisonous gas and ash emitted by the power plant and that they had therefore suffered pecuniary damage ( Files nos .

Relying on expert reports on the plaintiffs ' land , the court found that the hazardous gas emitted by the power plant had caused considerable damage to cultivation in the region , in that olive trees and tobacco plants suffered from incomplete leaf growth and were unable to produce a sufficient yield .", "CARDINAL .
