SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Branko Lubarda;Dmitry Dedov;Georgios A. Serghides;Helen Keller;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Pere Pastor Vilanova", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and lived in GPE until his expulsion to GPE in DATE . He was represented before the Court by Ms E .- M. Lindhe , a lawyer practising in GPE , and later by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , and then by Ambassador PERSON , both of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for asylum and a residence permit in GPE . He claimed to be of NORP nationality and complained about the conditions there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was detained on remand as he was suspected of committing several crimes : attempted rape , physical assault , making unlawful threats , attempted theft , and sexual molestation . On DATE ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) convicted the applicant of the above - mentioned crimes , sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , ordered his expulsion from GPE and banned him from returning to GPE for life . The applicant \u2019s sentence was mitigated by ORG because of his upcoming expulsion . ORG ( PERSON ) had submitted to the court that there were no impediments to the applicant being expelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) , which , on DATE , reduced the sentence to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment and limited the ban on the applicant \u2019s return to DATE . On DATE ORG ( ORG domstolen ) refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence of the criminal conviction and the expulsion order , ORG struck out the applicant \u2019s application for asylum and a residence permit on CARDINAL DATE . Subsequently , the applicant lodged repeated applications for asylum and a residence permit with ORG , but these were rejected and , upon appeal , the migration courts upheld the decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Polismyndigheten ) decided to detain the applicant with a view to expelling him to GPE . This decision was enforced on DATE , the same date on which the applicant was released on probation . From that date on , in accordance with NORP law , ORG reconsidered the decision of the applicant \u2019s detention DATE .", "CARDINAL . Given that the applicant \u2019s mental health was fluctuating , he was occasionally transferred from the detention centre to psychiatric care facilities and the administrative courts decided , on a few occasions , to commit him for compulsory psychiatric care ( tv\u00e5ngsv\u00e5rd ) for shorter periods . DATE , when placed in a psychiatric care facility , the applicant was temporarily released from detention . However , as soon as he was discharged , ORG detained him again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of assaulting several officials working in the detention centre where he had been detained and inflicting damage on the detention centre \u2019s facilities . He was fined a total of MONEY ( SEK ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) and he was ordered to pay damages to the victims . This judgment was not appealed against and it thus became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again reconsidered its decision to keep the applicant in detention . Initially it noted that the applicant had not cooperated with ORG in order to clarify his identity or facilitate the enforcement of his expulsion order ; indeed , he had obstructed the investigations by providing the authorities with as little information as possible , and he had been acting in a threatening manner against the officials who were handling the matter . ORG considered that all possible measures to enforce the expulsion order had not yet been exhausted . ORG also noted that , according to a note written by the officials working for ORG , the applicant had indicated that if the expulsion order were enforced , he would try to hurt any person getting in his way in order to avoid being expelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , requesting the court to quash the decision and release him immediately or , in the alternative , place him under supervision ( st\u00e4lla honom under uppsikt ) . The applicant referred to LAW and claimed , inter alia , that it was disproportionate to keep him in detention since there was no realistic possibility of enforcing the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , mainly reiterating the reasoning of ORG . However , the court also added , referring to the ORG \u2019s case - law , that ( i ) for the detention of a person for the purpose of the enforcement of an expulsion order to be lawful under LAW , the national authorities had to be actively working on the enforcement of the expulsion order and ( ii ) it did not appear impossible that the enforcement order would be enforced within the foreseeable future . The court stressed that the authorities were still working actively on the enforcement of the expulsion order and it did not appear impossible that the expulsion order would be enforced within the foreseeable future . Thus , the continued detention of the applicant did not constitute a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) for leave to appeal , which , on DATE , granted him leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of molesting and assaulting the officials working in the detention centre where he had been held and of inflicting damage to the detention centre \u2019s facilities and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . This judgment was not appealed against and thus became final .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started to serve the prison sentence immediately and , in accordance with NORP law , the detention order was therefore revoked .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on DATE , ORG struck the case out of its list of cases . However , in its decision the court noted that the question of whether there were exceptional reasons to keep the applicant in detention was a principled and important question that needed to be assessed by the court . The court noted that the applicant had been detained for an extraordinarily long time and even if it could be established that the authorities had been taking measures in order to enforce the expulsion order , it could also be noted that there had been periods of time when the authorities had been inactive . Moreover , contacts with the NORP authorities had not led to any concrete results and it could therefore on reasonable grounds be questioned whether the expulsion order actually could be enforced within the foreseeable future . The court stated that , even though the matter was being dealt with at a high political level , it still appeared unclear if and when the expulsion order could be enforced , and that it was hard to see what measures could be taken in order to enforce the expulsion order . Considering all of these circumstances , the court found , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , that the continued detention of the applicant would not be proportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG once again decided to detain the applicant in order to expel him . Upon the release of the applicant on probation , on DATE , the decision was enforced .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG , requesting that he be released immediately or , in the alternative , that he be placed under supervision . The applicant once again referred to LAW and claimed , inter alia , that it was disproportionate to keep him in detention since there was no realistic possibility of enforcing the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . ORG contested the applicant \u2019s appeal , stating that it had intensified its work and that it had had a meeting with ORG to discuss what measures could be taken , and that the Minister of ORG had also handed over a letter to the NORP Minister of ORG . Moreover , ORG and ORG had been in contact with ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . Firstly , the court noted that there was a real and manifest risk that the applicant , upon release , would commit crimes and that there were legal grounds under NORP law to detain him pending his expulsion . Moreover , the court found that the authorities had recently intensified their work and that the matter had been discussed between the NORP and NORP Ministers for ORG and that , in the light of those discussions , it appeared more probable that the expulsion could be executed within the foreseeable future . Given this , a continued detention could not be considered disproportionate and it was thus legitimate to detain the applicant . The court also noted that the interest in keeping the applicant in custody outweighed the applicant \u2019s right to liberty and that it was not a sufficient measure merely to subject the applicant to supervision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG for leave to appeal against the judgment , maintaining his claims . On DATE ORG refused him leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG once again reconsidered its decision and found that there were still reasons to keep the applicant in detention . ORG stated that there were reasons to believe that the applicant , if released , would commit crimes of violence and that ORG , even though it had been a long time since the applicant had initially been detained , had still actively been taking measures in order to enforce the expulsion order . Moreover , it noted that the applicant had not cooperated at all with the NORP authorities in order to clarify his identity and facilitate the expulsion .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG , requesting that ORG decision be quashed and that he be released immediately or , in the alternative , that he be placed under supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , mainly reiterating the reasoning of ORG . However , the court noted , in particular , that the NORP authorities , after ORG decision of DATE , had on several occasions tried to contact the NORP authorities and other international organs in order to investigate the applicant \u2019s identity ; it also noted that the period of time that had elapsed since the authorities had begun to deal with the matter at the highest political level was not unreasonably long , considering the extraordinary circumstances of the present case . It also noted that , since the authorities had continuously been taking measures to enforce the expulsion order , it could not be considered impossible to enforce the expulsion order within the foreseeable future . Moreover , considering that the applicant had not cooperated with NORP authorities at all ( for example he had not signed documents to facilitate the enforcement ) and that he had been acting violently towards the officials , the court found that the time he had spent in detention could not be considered disproportionate . The court also noted that the applicant had indicated that he would use violence to stop a future expulsion of him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a request for leave to appeal against the judgment with ORG , which , on DATE , refused him leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . As noted above , the applicant was initially detained with a view of expulsion on DATE . Between CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE , numerous measures were taken by the NORP authorities in order to enforce the expulsion order to GPE .", "CARDINAL . By letters dated DATE and CARDINAL DATE the Government informed the ORG about the following developments : On DATE the applicant had submitted new information regarding his identity and country of origin to the NORP police , stating that he was in fact an NORP citizen . This information had made it possible for the NORP and NORP authorities to subsequently confirm his statement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expulsion order was enforced and the applicant was expelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . A letter was sent to the ORG by the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE . The lawyer confirmed that the applicant was of NORP nationality and had been expelled , and stated that he maintained the application ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
