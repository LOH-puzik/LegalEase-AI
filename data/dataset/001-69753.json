BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr Roman Nikolaevich Choban , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in ORG , LOC , GPE . The applicant is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE . ORG are represented by PERSON , coagent , of ORG . ORG , who participate in the proceedings as CARDINAL party ( LAW ) , are represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "At TIME on DATE the applicant , Mr PERSON and PERSON PERSON , NORP nationals on their way from GPE to GPE , crossed the NORP border at ORG , on the GPE river . They were carrying large amounts of cash , because they intended to purchase goods in GPE and resell them in GPE . The applicant submits that they declared the money to the customs authorities as follows : Mr PERSON \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) , the applicant \u2013 USD CARDINAL , and Mr PERSON \u2013 nil . However , it seems that later only one customs declaration was found , in which Mr PERSON had declared ORG CARDINAL . The applicant further submits that after the CARDINAL got out of the customs he gave ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to Mr PERSON as prepayment for the transportation costs of the goods they intended to buy in GPE and ORG CARDINAL to Mr PERSON as prepayment for his help for the purchasing of the goods . After that the CARDINAL hid all the money in the minibus in which they were travelling .", "TIME , at TIME , when the CARDINAL were QUANTITY south of ORG , near PERSON , an armed gang , some of which were dressed as police officers , stopped the minibus , pretending to carry out a routine police check . They hit Mr PERSON several times in the head and , after he tried to run , shot him dead . Mr PERSON was also hit several times in the head . The applicant was shot in the thigh and later hit in the head . The applicant submits that the robbers pulled a bag hanging around his neck and took it away . According to him , his copy of the customs declaration in which he had declared the ORG CARDINAL at ORG was in that bag . The robbers were not able to find the money hidden in the minibus and left the scene . The police arrived TIME and the applicant and Mr PERSON were taken to a hospital . Later they returned to GPE .", "A criminal investigation was opened into the incident . On DATE an investigator searched the minibus in the presence of the applicant , an expert and CARDINAL certifying witnesses , and seized the money which was hidden there as evidence in the pending criminal proceedings against the alleged robbers . The total amount found was USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL . According to the declarations of the applicant and Mr PERSON , it broke down as follows : ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL belonging to the deceased Mr PERSON , ORG CARDINAL belonging to Mr PERSON , and ORG belonging to the applicant . The investigator drew up a record which was signed by himself , the applicant , Mr PERSON and CARDINAL certifying witnesses .", "The applicant submits that when he was released from hospital DATE , he requested the investigator to return the money . However , the investigator refused , stating that applicant had imported the money into GPE without declaring them at the border , because the applicant 's customs declaration was missing .", "On an unspecified date in DATE or DATE the applicant , PERSON PERSON and Mr PERSON 's widow requested from the ORG , which was supervising the investigation , to return the money seized as evidence . In a decree of CARDINAL DATE that ORG refused . Their lawyer appealed to ORG . In a decree of DATE ORG ordered that ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL be handed over to Mr PERSON 's widow , because there was no doubt about their owner and about the fact that they had been duly declared upon Mr PERSON 's entry in GPE . It found that the remaining USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL could not be returned , because the money had been hidden in the minibus and there was no declaration for its importing . On the one hand , this made it impossible to determine who was its owner , and , on the other , whether it had been declared upon entry in GPE , as required by the Regulation on Importing and Exporting of Currency Valuables of DATE , which made it an administrative offence to not declare currency at the border . The prosecution authorities were not competent to rule on this matter and therefore the currency was to be turned over to ORG . A copy of the decree was sent to the lawyer who was representing the applicant and Mr PERSON 's widow in the criminal proceedings against the alleged robbers . From the applicant 's submissions it transpires that he was made aware of that decree .", "Pursuant to that decree , in DATE ORG in PERSON turned the money over to ORG .", "Apparently thereafter the customs authorities opened proceedings against the applicant for having failed to declare the money at the border , as required by section CARDINAL of ORG of DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , and as a result the money was forfeited by a decision of DATE . It is unclear whether the applicant was notified about the proceedings . He did not seek judicial review of the decision of DATE . The file containing all documents relating to these proceedings was destroyed on DATE , because of the expiry of the timelimit for its archiving at ORG .", "DATE after the incident of CARDINAL DATE most of the alleged attackers who had robbed the applicant , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON were identified and arrested . They were charged with having committed numerous armed robberies during the period DATE .", "The investigation was completed in DATE and in DATE an indictment was submitted to ORG against QUANTITY persons .", "The Veliko Tarnovo Regional Court held hearings on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . The applicant did not appear in person , but was represented by a lawyer retained by him and Mr PERSON . Numerous witnesses and expert witnesses were heard and other evidence admitted .", "On an unspecified date during the preliminary investigation or at the first hearing on DATE the applicant made a civil claim against the accused , claiming nonpecuniary damages .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG found all CARDINAL accused guilty of numerous robberies and related offences and sentenced them to various terms of imprisonment . It rejected the applicant 's claim .", "The prosecution appealed to ORG . So did all but one of the accused . On DATE the applicant 's and Mr PERSON 's lawyer also appealed , arguing , inter alia , that the applicant 's claim had been improperly rejected .", "ORG held hearings on DATE , DATE and DATE .", "In DATE the judicial system in GPE was reformed . As a result , on QUANTITY DATE the case was transferred to the newly created ORG , which had henceforth jurisdiction to hear appeals against judgments of the ORG .", "A hearing listed for DATE failed to take place , because the applicant and Mr PERSON had not been duly summoned .", "A hearing took place on DATE . The applicant , who had been duly summoned for it by letter rogatory , did not show up . He notified the court by telex that he did not wish to pursue the appeal . Accordingly , the court discontinued the proceedings relating to the applicant 's civil claim . Its decision was not subject to appeal .", "On DATE the ORG quashed the ORG judgment , noting that CARDINAL of the accused had been represented at the preliminary investigation stage by the same lawyer despite an obvious conflict of interest . In the court 's view , that fact had vitiated the entire procedure and warranted the remitting the case to the preliminary investigation stage .", "The proceedings are still pending . For a more detailed account of their unfolding after DATE see PERSON v. GPE ( ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "The applicant avers that in DATE he wrote letters requesting the returning of the money to ORG , the ORG , the ORG and ORG . He further avers that he received no reply . However , he does not provide any evidence to corroborate these averments .", "The applicant submits that in DATE he travelled CARDINAL times to GPE to give evidence in the criminal proceedings against the alleged robbers . It does not seem that on any of these occasions he inquired about what had become of the money at ORG .", "On DATE and DATE and DATE ORG of GPE , acting pursuant to requests by the applicant , sent letters to ORG of GPE , inquiring why the applicant 's money had not been returned to him .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , which was sent to ORG of GPE and apparently later transmitted to the NORP authorities , ORG stated , inter alia , that the ORG CARDINAL had not been returned to the applicant by the authorities dealing with the criminal case , because it was unclear who its owner was , and because it had not been declared upon the applicant 's entry in GPE and could have been the object of a customs offence . This was apparent from ORG Office 's decree of DATE . A copy of the decree was enclosed .", "The applicant avers that he also contacted various other bodies in GPE . In particular , he addressed ORG , which in turn contacted the NORP embassy in GPE . However , he does not provide any evidence to corroborate this averment .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that a piece of physical evidence seized in the context of criminal proceedings is held by the authorities until the conclusion of the proceedings . LAW that LAW provides that items seized as evidence may be returned to their owners prior to the conclusion of the proceedings only if this would not hamper the elucidation of the facts of the case .", "Section CARDINAL of the ORG , as in force at the material time , provided that the importing and exporting of foreign currency was to be effected in a manner specified by ORG and ORG . Section CARDINAL of the Regulation on the Importing and Exporting of Currency Valuables of DATE , made by ORG and ORG pursuant to section CARDINAL of the ORG , as in force at the relevant time , provided that foreign currency , whose value was above ORG CARDINAL and which was carried by persons crossing the border , had to be declared to the customs authorities . Any failure of abide by the provisions of the Regulation constituted an administrative offence ( section CARDINAL of the Regulation and section CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "ORG of DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) defines administrative offences and penalties and governs the procedure for punishing such offences . The possible penalties are a reprimand , a fine , or occupational disbarment ( section CARDINAL of the AOPA ) . In addition , the things which constitute the object of an offence may be forfeited if they belong to the offender and if the respective statute so provides ( section CARDINAL ) of the ORG ) .", "The authority competent to impose an administrative penalty is the administrative body which is responsible for the enforcement of the statute or the statutory instrument defining the offence , or the administrative body expressly authorised to do so under the respective statute or statutory instrument ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG ) .
