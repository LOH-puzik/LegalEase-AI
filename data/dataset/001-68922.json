The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant started working for FAC in ORG and until DATE she formally occupied the positions of dormitories supervisor and facilities and social activities coordinator . In fact , throughout this period the applicant was working \u2013 under the instructions of her manager \u2013 as a typist at the local section of ORG . This scheme had apparently been devised because the staff tables did not provide for a typist position .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the applicant 's employment agreements and job descriptions did not mention her actual duties , which included mostly typewriting . This arrangement was apparently never called into question by the applicant or her employer .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant worked as an inspector at the human resources department of the Station .", "CARDINAL . In DATE or in DATE the applicant 's employer , acting pursuant to a medical recommendation on the nature of work she was fit to perform , moved her to a different position \u2013 internal mail carrier .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant started experiencing pain in her hands and arms . Initially she was losing the sensitivity in her fingers and could not hold objects . With the passage of time the pain got stronger and her hands started to swell and tremble , especially after long periods of typing .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was examined by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) at ORG . In a decision of DATE the ORG found that the applicant was suffering from vegetative polyneuropathy of the upper limbs , a disease which features on the Table of Occupational Diseases . However , the ORG , relying solely on the applicant 's job descriptions , concluded that the positions she had occupied ( dormitories supervisor , facilities and social activities coordinator ) did not entail increased strain on her upper limbs . Accordingly , it qualified her disease as non - occupational , finding no causal link between the conditions of work and the disease . Apparently the ORG refused to examine evidence ( including affidavits ) submitted by the applicant to prove her actual duties .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , arguing that her de facto duties were different from the ones enumerated in her job descriptions . As no witness testimony was admissible , she again submitted affidavits from her managers to the effect that she had actually worked as a typist . On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal , fully endorsing the reasons of the ORG . Apparently it refused to take into account any other evidence purporting to establish the actual duties of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was admitted for treatment at ORG in GPE . On DATE the ORG at ORG examined the applicant and found that she suffered from osteohondrosis cervicalis . It also reached the conclusion that the disease was not an occupational one , being unrelated to the duties of the applicant as set out in her job descriptions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision to the ORG . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE it upheld the ruling as to the non - occupational character of the applicant 's disease and fully endorsed the ORG 's reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action against her employer under LAW of DATE . She alleged that the disease of her hands had developed as a result of her work . In fact , DATE she had worked as a typist , even though her job descriptions did not reflect that . The rulings of the ORG and the ORG that her disease was not workrelated were based solely on these job descriptions ; the commissions had not inquired into the reality of the situation . She requested the court to summon witnesses to testify about her real duties and to appoint an expert to establish the occupational character of her disease .", "CARDINAL . DATE former managers of the applicant \u2013 testified during the trial . They stated that the applicant had in fact worked as a typist , in accordance with the orders of her employer , and provided details about her workload .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL expert witnesses were appointed by the court to give conclusions about the applicant 's state of health and about the occupational or nonoccupational character of her disease . The first expert concluded that the applicant was suffering from vegetative neuropathy of the hands . The second expert submitted a report in which she stated that the cause for the applicant 's disease could be her conditions of work , as described by her managers . Both experts confirmed their conclusions at a public hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Rouse District Court gave judgment on DATE , dismissing the applicant 's action . It stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... the court considers the action to be ill - founded . The prerequisites for finding the employer liable under LAW ... are a valid employment agreement and a convincingly established occupational disease . The occupational character of the disease is determined by the special medical commissions ... The existence of a finding [ made by the ORG and ascertaining the occupational character of the disease ] is an absolute precondition for holding the employer liable under LAW . The specific character of the [ subjectmatter of the inquiry ] has led the legislature to establish specialised medical bodies to give a conclusion as to the type [ of the disease ] and as to the causal link between the conditions of work and the disease . In the case at hand the [ ORG and the ORG ] have concluded that the [ applicant 's ] disease was not occupational and was not related to her conditions of work ... [ T]he court examining the dispute under LAW may rule as to the occupational character of the disease only if no medical documents have been issued by the [ ORG ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . On DATE that court upheld the lower court 's judgment in the following terms :", "\u201c The [ ORG ] judgment is well - founded . After assessing the collected and relevant evidence , ORG correctly concluded that the occupational character of the [ applicant 's ] disease , ... which is CARDINAL of the prerequisites for holding her employer liable under LAW , has not been convincingly established . The firstinstance court has correctly decided that the occupational character of the disease may be established by the court only if no documents have been issued by the specialised medical bodies ... ORG has taken into account that in the case at hand these bodies have reached the categorical conclusion ... that the disease of the [ applicant ] was not related to her working conditions and was thus not occupational . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged a petition for review with ORG . That court dismissed the petition in a final judgment of DATE . It held :", "\u201c The acts issued by the specialised medical bodies indicate that [ the applicant 's ] disease was not occupational , i.e. no causal link was found between the disease and the working conditions . The expert witnesses ' conclusions do not alter this finding . The [ first expert ] concluded that the disease \u201c vegetative polyneuropathy of the hands \u201d features on the table of occupational diseases . This fact is not at issue , but the [ employer 's ] liability under LAW presupposes not only the existence of the respective disease , but also the establishment of a causal link between the disease and the conditions of work . This causal link has not been established by the [ second ] expert either . In her report she found that activities related to type - writing are a prerequisite for the development of vegetative polyneuropathy . However , the fact that typewriting is in general a prerequisite for this disease does not prove the existence of a causal link between the [ applicant 's ] conditions of work and [ her ] disease .", "... The specialised medical bodies are the administrative organs empowered by law to ascertain the existence of an occupational disease and the causal link between the disease and the [ conditions of ] work . The [ lower ] courts correctly held that the circumstances that [ these organs ] are authorised to examine may be examined by the court having cognisance of the action under LAW only in the absence of findings made by these organs . The [ applicant ] has not established before the specialised medical bodies the existence of a causal link between [ her ] disease and the conditions of work as a typist ... Therefore the conclusions of the [ lower ] courts that her action is unfounded are correct . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The Table listed the diseases , the conditions of work causing them , and the types of work in the performance of which they could occur .

In its interpretative judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE in constitutional case no . CARDINAL ( GPE , issue CARDINAL of DATE ) ORG gave a binding interpretation of LAW .
