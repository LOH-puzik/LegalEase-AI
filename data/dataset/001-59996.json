GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1+6-3-d", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE , the father of S. , born in DATE , laid a criminal information against the applicant , alleging that the applicant , her private music teacher , had sexually abused PERSON during an individual music lesson that TIME . S. and her mother were questioned at the local police office on TIME DATE . S. was heard by a police officer and confirmed her father \u2019s statements . PERSON \u2019s mother stated that PERSON had been very disturbed after her music lesson and that she had later confided in her mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting with a single judge , convicted the applicant of having committed the offence of sexual abuse of a child in concurrence with the offence of sexual abuse of a charge . He was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment on probation .", "In establishing the relevant facts , the court relied on the statements made by the mother concerning her daughter \u2019s account of the relevant events , her behaviour after the music lesson on DATE and her character in general , and also on the evidence given by the police officer who had questioned PERSON shortly after the offence in DATE .", "The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a psychological expert opinion regarding the credibility of S. \u2019s statements on the ground of the court \u2019s own professional experience , acquired as a judge in family matters , in evaluating statements made by children .", "Moreover , the court observed that it had not been reasonable to hear S. herself , as , according to her mother , she had meanwhile repressed her recollection of the event in question and would seriously suffer if reminded thereof . If PERSON were to be examined , this would not contribute to a further clarification of the facts , but seriously impair her personal development .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , requesting his acquittal . In the appeal proceedings , he was assisted by counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against his conviction of sexual abuse of a child , but set aside the conviction of sexual abuse of a charge . The sentence to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment on probation was upheld .", "ORG noted that the applicant had denied having sexually abused PERSON It found that his guilt could be established on the basis of the evidence before it , i.e. the statements made by PERSON mother and the police officer as well as a psychological expert opinion on the question of S. \u2019s credibility , ordered in the context of the appeal proceedings . In her report of DATE , the expert , who had questioned PERSON in DATE , confirmed that S. \u2019s statements were credible .", "ORG considered that the absence of PERSON \u2019s testimony in court constituted a serious shortcoming in the taking of evidence . In this respect , it noted that the parents had refused to bring their daughter to court on account of the risk that her state of health would deteriorate as she suffered from neurodermatitis . According to ORG , the GPE refusal was understandable . In this respect , ORG had regard to a medical certificate confirming the GPE statements and the findings of the psychological expert that S. \u2019s state of health would most likely deteriorate again if she were to be heard anew on the event in question . Taking into account that S. \u2019s statements had been reported by her mother and by the police officer and that an expert opinion on her credibility had been prepared , ORG , considering the rather trivial nature of the charge and the sentence at stake , reached the conclusion that PERSON was to be regarded as a witness out of reach .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , leaving open the question whether the complaint had been lodged in time .", "CARDINAL . The conduct of trial proceedings is governed by sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafprozessordnung ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the taking of evidence , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that the court shall , proprio motu , extend the taking of evidence to all facts and evidence important for the decision in order to determine the truth .", "A request for the taking of evidence may be refused under the statutory conditions of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , an application may , inter alia , be refused if the evidence is unavailable ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
