The second applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . s , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE around TIME a group of persons started blocking the crossing of a federal road with a county road in PERSON in order to protest against the forthcoming transport of \u201c castor \u201d containers to PERSON . A total of CARDINAL tractors and CARDINAL cars blocked the crossing , preventing CARDINAL lorry drivers from continuing their journey .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , deputy mayor of PERSON and member of the LAW county council , as well as the second applicant and her husband were caught in the traffic jam caused by the blockade on the federal road in their cars .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police present at the crossroads allowed the applicants , who had parked and left their cars , to join the persons blocking the crossroads . In the first applicant \u2019s submission , he intended to inform himself on the event and to mediate , if necessary , in his capacity as an elected local politician . The second applicant wished to inform herself of the reasons for the blockade . Subsequently , more police forces arrived at the crossing .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the GPE police contained the CARDINAL persons present on and around the crossroads , including the applicants , in a police cordon . They informed the persons concerned at TIME that they were suspected of having committed an offence in view of the fact that they had been blocking the federal road for a considerable time , thereby preventing other vehicles from continuing their journey . They declared the assembly dissolved and announced that the police would establish the identity of all persons involved at a checkpoint . They further asked persons who did not feel well , children and women to process to the identity check first in order to be able to leave the cordon rapidly . The first applicant subsequently attempted in vain to leave the cordon at a different place by presenting his identity papers only .", "CARDINAL . Following the establishment of their identities , CARDINAL persons had left the cordon by TIME , CARDINAL persons by TIME , another CARDINAL persons by TIME and CARDINAL persons by TIME At TIME the police ordered a toilet van for the remaining QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . Around TIME ( in the second applicant \u2019s submission ) or TIME ( according to the police photo in the file ) the second applicant left the cordon after her identity had been recorded .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the police started pushing the remaining persons , including the first applicant , towards the identity checkpoint . At TIME of the following day ( DATE ) , the QUANTITY persons remaining within the cordon , including the first applicant , were escorted by the police to the checkpoint . The first applicant left the cordon at TIME after his identity had been recorded . All persons had left the cordon by TIME following the establishment of their identities .", "CARDINAL . The identities of the persons cordoned off by the police were established , in principle , in the following manner . They filmed the persons concerned with a video camera when they presented their identity cards . The personal data of those persons were read out by a police officer at the same time . In contrast , the second applicant gave her identity herself and CARDINAL photographs were made of her in addition to the video recording as she had left her identity card in her car .", "CARDINAL . Following their release from the cordon , it took the applicants TIME to reach their cars which were parked on the opposite side of the crossroads because the police kept blocking the crossroads , which was surrounded by a forest difficult to traverse on TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and on DATE CARDINAL the second applicant , both represented by counsel , requested ORG , in an action against the GPE police , to declare , in particular , that their deprivation of liberty and the manner in which personal data had been taken for the police records on DATE had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( civil section ) transferred the cases brought by the applicants to the investigating judge responsible for the review of measures under LAW . It argued that the applicants had not been deprived of their liberty for preventive purposes under LAW and Order . The police had in fact detained them on the basis of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( criminal section ) found that the establishment of the first applicant \u2019s identity under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and the taking of pictures of the first applicant for the police record under Article PERSON , first alternative , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had been lawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( criminal section ) made the same finding in respect of the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . In their decisions , phrased in almost identical terms , ORG found that the police had contained the persons participating in the blockade of the crossroads in a police cordon in order to establish their identities and to take pictures and in order to seize the vehicles involved . They considered that there had been at least sufficient factual elements for concluding that the persons concerned were guilty of joint coercion ( Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . By parking their vehicles on the crossroads and by their presence thereon , the CARDINAL persons involved created , at least by the ensuing traffic jam , a physical barrier preventing cars from continuing their journey for a considerable time , which , having regard to the criminal courts\u2019 case - law , amounted to force within the meaning of LAW . ORG further found that , having regard to the duration of the blockade of TIME and its effects for third persons , in particular CARDINAL lorry drivers who partly had to deliver goods within a deadline , the blockade was also reprehensible for the purposes of LAW and not covered by the right to freedom of assembly or the right to freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that in view of the suspicion that a joint coercion had been committed , the police had been obliged under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to establish the identity of all persons present on the crossroads , including that of the applicants . Having regard to the number of persons involved , this measure naturally took a certain amount of time .", "CARDINAL . Likewise , the taking of video pictures of the persons concerned under Article ORG , first alternative , of LAW was necessary to conduct the investigation proceedings . In order to establish the acts committed by individual perpetrators , their presence and the clothing at the time of the act had to be recorded .", "CARDINAL . In the District Courts\u2019 view , the impugned measures taken by the police were not disproportionate . Even without the police cordon , there would have been inconveniences as a result of the lack of toilets , the weather and the lack of food at the crossroads , the blocking of which was to be upheld for a considerable period of time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and on DATE the second applicant lodged appeals against the District Courts\u2019 decisions . They argued , in particular , that it had been arbitrary to treat them as suspects , given that they had been caught in the traffic jam caused by the blockade themselves and had only wanted to inform themselves of the cause for the traffic jam . ORG had insufficiently established the relevant facts and had failed , in particular , to hear them in person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . As to the lawfulness of the first applicant \u2019s detention by the police , ORG clarified that the deprivation of liberty had been based on LAW , second sentence , of LAW . That provision authorised holding back a person suspected of a criminal offence if that person \u2019s identity could not be established in a different way or if that establishment would be possible only with considerable difficulty . The first applicant had been present within a group of persons having blocked a crossing with the help of tractors causing a considerable traffic jam . Even taking into account the cause for the blockade , namely to demonstrate against the forthcoming transport of castor containers , this blockade , having regard to ORG case - law , could constitute coercion . It had been necessary to contain the CARDINAL suspects in a police cordon in order to take the identity of all of them .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that the first applicant \u2019s deprivation of liberty had been proportionate . The police had enabled persons who did not feel well and minors to leave the cordon speedily . They further speeded up the establishment of the ORG identities by recording the reading out of the personal data on video instead of writing the data down . If the first applicant had lacked food and had been cold , he could have asked for a speedy establishment of his identity . However , it appeared that the first applicant had been part of a group of CARDINAL persons who had refused to go to the checkpoint to have their identities established and he had thus caused delays in the establishment of his identity himself . In so far as it had not been possible for the first applicant to regain his car after his release for a considerable time , this had been caused by the partly ongoing blockade of the crossing and did not entail a deprivation of liberty imputable to the police .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the taking of the first applicant \u2019s identity via video recording had been lawful under Article PERSON , first alternative , of LAW . It had not been arbitrary to consider the first applicant , who was within the group of persons blocking the crossroads , as a suspect of a joint coercion . Filming the persons concerned had also been proportionate . It had been necessary to document the clothing worn by the suspects in order to enable witnesses to recognise the perpetrators of an offence having caused prejudice to a considerable number of drivers at a later stage .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that it had not been required by LAW for ORG to hear the first applicant in person in the present proceedings . ORG had sufficiently established the relevant facts , having regard also to the file on the criminal investigations against the first applicant and the documentation of the video recording made by the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and on DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s complaints about a breach of his right to be heard . It stressed that the first applicant had had full access to the case - files , which included the police reports and pictures of the first applicant drawn from the video recordings . He had therefore been in a position to explain his view comprehensively in writing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons of ORG , equally dismissed the second applicant \u2019s appeal . It stressed that the second applicant \u2019s counsel had had access to the complete case - file . It had not been necessary to hear the second applicant in person as the lawfulness of the impugned measures could be determined irrespective of a personal impression of her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG equally dismissed the second applicant \u2019s objection and complaint about a breach of her right to be heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He complained , in particular , that his detention in the police cordon on DATE , which he had only been able to leave under the condition that he had himself and his personal data recorded on video , had breached his constitutional right to liberty , his personality rights and his right to freedom of assembly . Moreover , the procedure before ORG and ORG had failed to grant him effective redress in relation to these complaints .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the second applicant lodged a constitutional complaint in which she endorsed the complaints made by the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the first applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and on DATE it declined to consider the second applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , without giving reasons . The decisions were served on the applicants\u2019 counsel on DATE ( in respect of the first applicant ) and on DATE ( in respect of the second applicant ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation proceedings for coercion against all persons present at the blockade of the crossroads on DATE . It dispensed with the prosecution of the offence as the PERSON culpability would be of a minor nature and as there was no public interest in the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed ORG finding that the storage of data on the first applicant in the police databases on castor transports and on state security , which had been erased in the meantime , had been unlawful . Only the data concerning the first applicant contained in the LOC police \u2019s electronic record of police measures could be kept .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , on coercion , provides that whoever compels another person unlawfully by force or threat of a considerable harm to commit , acquiesce in or omit an act shall be punished by imprisonment of DATE or a fine . The act shall be unlawful for the purposes of LAW if the use of force or the threat of harm is to be considered reprehensible in order to attain the objective pursued by the act ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The conditions under which the blocking of streets for reasons of political protest is punishable under LAW has been a matter of intense academic discussion for DATE and has been addressed and clarified by ORG in CARDINAL leading decisions ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and others , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Collection of the decisions of ORG ) vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ss . ; file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and others , decision of DATE , BVerfGE vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ss . , and file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and others , decision of DATE , BVerfGE vol . ORG , pp . CARDINAL ss . ) . ORG found , in particular , that only a blockade in which the participants set up a physical barrier , going beyond the mere mental impact on the road users by their physical presence in the blocked street , may be classified as \u201c force \u201d for the purposes of LAW ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and others , ibid . , LAW ) . Moreover , in determining whether an act amounted to a \u201c reprehensible \u201d coercion for the purposes of LAW , the criminal courts had to take into account the purpose of the blockade and , if applicable , the importance of the constitutional protection of the right to freedom of assembly ( ibid . , LAW . ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , ORG and the police officers may take the measures necessary to establish the identity of a person who is suspected of having committed a criminal offence ( LAW , first sentence ) . The suspect may be held back if his or her identity can not be established in an alternative way or if establishment of his or her identity would be possible only with considerable difficulty ( LAW , second sentence ) .", "CARDINAL . Article PERSON of LAW provides that photographs and fingerprints of the accused may be taken even against his will and measurements may be made of him and other similar measures be taken with regard to him in so far as this is necessary for the conduct of the criminal proceedings or for the purposes of the police records ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
