NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , Attorney , Attorney ORG ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant graduated as a medical doctor . On DATE he was granted a licence to perform duty service ( turnustjeneste ) at a hospital and thereafter he and a friend started to serve at ORG .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested and detained on remand for DATE due to his and a friend \u2019s involvement in CARDINAL incidents , which included notably an attempt of burglary , violence against the police and consumption of hashish and ecstasy .", "On DATE ORG notified the applicant that they considered suspending and withdrawing his duty service licence , following which the applicant withdrew from his duty service and was granted special leave with salary , until he went on sick leave in DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( byrett ) convicted the applicant for his involvement in attempts of burglary ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , obstruction of the police in their attempt to arrest his accomplice ( Article CARDINAL ) , violence against the police ( Article CARDINAL ) and consumption of hashish and ecstasy ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ( unconditional ) . On the other hand , ORG rejected the prosecutor \u2019s request to sentence the applicant under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW to a loss of right to practice as a doctor .", "The applicant appealed against the conviction but ORG ( lagmannsrett ) refused him leave to appeal on DATE . As the applicant did not lodge an appeal against that decision within the statutory DATE time - limit ( running from notification ) , the decision became final on DATE or on some date shortly thereafter .", "The applicant served his prison sentence from DATE . Thereafter he was again on sick leave .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant made a request for being re - instated as an intern but , on DATE , ORG ( ORG ) decided to suspend his licence under LAW pending a possible revocation under LAW CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( GPE , hereinafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The decision was taken primarily on the ground of the matters in respect of which he had been convicted and which were deemed \u201c conduct unworthy of a doctor \u201d for the purposes of LAW CARDINAL . Regard was also had to certain irregularities noted with regard to various instances of prescription of medicines and the storage of medical journals , which , it is undisputed , played a secondary part in the decision .", "On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG asking it to quash the suspension of DATE . ORG notes that , pursuant to CARDINAL of LAW , such an action was to be examined under LAW of the Code of Civil Procedure concerning judicial appeals against administrative decisions .", "On DATE ORG repealed the suspension considering that the applicant was no longer deemed unsuited to perform the profession of medical doctor and issued a disciplinary warning . In DATE he ended his sick leave and resumed his duty service .", "In view of this change , the applicant altered his suit before ORG to concern a claim for compensation on account of the suspension ( section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s compensation claim , finding that his suspension had not been unlawful or contrary to LAW .", "On appeal , that judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s further appeal was rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . ORG unanimously found that the suspension did not violate LAW , but was divided ( CARDINAL in favour and CARDINAL against ) as to whether the suspension could be regarded as lawful under LAW notwithstanding the ORG rejection in the trial of the prosecution \u2019s request to deprive the applicant of his right to practice .", "PERSON , who gave the reasons for the majority , held , in so far as the issue of double jeopardy under LAW No . CARDINAL was concerned , that the suspension did not constitute a criminal matter attracting the application of this provision , having regard to the CARDINAL criteria for \u201c criminal charge \u201d in LAW set out in the PERSON and Others v. the GPE judgment of DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) . Therefore , the revocation or the suspension of a licence to practice as a doctor , on the ground that the legal conditions for practicing no longer were fulfilled , did not constitute a criminal punishment for the purposes of LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW , which therefore did not apply . The minority agreed with this conclusion .", "In so far as concerned the issue under LAW reasoning , which the other justices of the majority endorsed in the main , included the following observations :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) It would in my view be useful to start by providing an overview of the NORP system for granting and revoking permits to practise as a doctor . I should note that authorisation is the term used for the most comprehensive permit to practise as a doctor . A licence , including an intern \u2019s licence as applicable in our case , on the other hand , provides more limited rights . Nevertheless , the legal issues raised by the case will be the same .", "( CARDINAL ) According to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE , a precondition for the granting of an authorisation to practise as a doctor was that the candidate was \u2018 of good conduct\u2019 . Under section CARDINAL of the LAW an authorisation could be withdrawn by civil judgment where the doctor was considered unfit to conduct his practice on the grounds of insanity or weakening of the mental faculties or abuse of strong drink or anaesthetising agents . The grounds for loss of authorisation were listed in exhaustive detail and accordingly legal action with respect to revocation could not be brought were the doctor subsequently to be found guilty of breach of the requirement as to good conduct . In the event of conviction of criminal offences , however , deprivation could take the form of a disqualification pursuant to LAW . This general provision , which is now LAW , provides the legal authority to sentence a person found guilty of a criminal offence in the following way if the public interest so requires :", "\u2018 Loss for a specific period not exceeding DATE or in perpetuity of the right to hold office or to carry out any activity or occupation that the defendant has shown himself or herself to be unfit for or might conceivably abuse or for which a high degree of public confidence is required . ... \u2019", "( CARDINAL ) In the DATE Act , which applies in our case , the requirement as to good conduct as a precondition for authorisation and licensing was continued , with the difference that breaches of this condition would now constitute direct grounds for revocation under LAW . LAW CARDINAL ) made it a condition for the grant of authorisation or a licence that the medical practitioner was not in a situation that could lead to the revocation of the authorisation or licence . This was regulated in LAW CARDINAL , the first paragraph of which read as follows :", "\u2018 An authorisation or licence may be revoked if a doctor is not fit to practise medicine on the grounds of serious mental illness , psychological or physical debility , long absence from the profession , the misuse of alcohol , drugs , or other substances with similar effects , grave lack of professional insight , improper medical practice , or conduct unworthy of a ORG", "( CARDINAL ) Section CARDINAL provided the legal authority for the suspension of an authorisation or licence where there were just and sufficient causes to suppose that grounds existed for revocation . Under section CARDINAL , the decision to revoke was no longer taken by the courts but by the Ministry , generally after an opinion had been obtained from ORG . This authority was subsequently delegated to ORG . According to LAW , the decision could not be appealed but it could be brought before a court of law , which could review all aspects of the matter . If a suspension or revocation proved to be invalid or was set aside on other grounds , CARDINAL provided that the doctor could claim damages for losses sustained in accordance with the usual rules .", "( CARDINAL ) This system is continued in the current LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL - which came into force on DATE . ...", "( CARDINAL ) Generally the system exists in parallel with the system of sanctions provided for under criminal law . This relates to the different guilt requirements under the CARDINAL systems and to the fact that the objectives and subjects for assessments are different , see Proposition No . CARDINAL to the PERSON ( DATE ) , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL . It is assumed that as a general rule the public health authorities may consider revocation , even if health personnel have not been disqualified by judgment in a criminal case . It is emphasised that the regulatory authority shall be concerned with protecting patients against unqualified practitioners , not with punishment .", "( CARDINAL ) In light of the inter - relationship between the regulations discussed above , [ the applicant ] \u2019s alternative submission relating to LAW . CARDINAL may also have a bearing on corresponding questions under LAW . Accordingly , in my view it is appropriate to consider this aspect first .", "( CARDINAL ) The question is whether the suspension decision , which was adopted after [ the applicant ] had been convicted of the actions in question , but acquitted of the plea that he be disqualified , must be viewed as a re - prosecution in contravention of LAW No . CARDINAL . That the facts underlying the suspension decision in all essential respects are the same as those underlying the criminal conviction , is not disputed .", "( DATE ) Before I continue I reiterate that the suspension of the licence presupposed the existence of a reasonable basis for assuming that \u2018 grounds existed for revocation\u2019 . Although this case concerns the suspension of a licence , and a revocation , the real issue is nevertheless whether LAW No . CARDINAL serves as an obstacle to the revocation of a licence where a judgment in a criminal case has already been rendered with respect to the same actions and where the plea for disqualification has not been allowed .", "( CARDINAL ) In light of ORG case law as it now stands , the issue that must be considered will be identical to the question of whether this constitutes punishment pursuant to LAW , see most recently the judgment of DATE in case No . CARDINAL HR-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-A paragraph DATE . As noted in paragraph CARDINAL of the said judgment , this question must be decided on the basis of the so - called PERSON criteria , ( see PERSON and Others v. the GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . How is the situation classified under national law , the nature and purpose of the statutory rule that was applied and the content and severity of the sanction in question .", "( CARDINAL ) It will be apparent from my introductory discussion that neither the revocation nor the suspension of a permit to practise as a doctor will constitute punishment under NORP law .", "( CARDINAL ) As regards the second PERSON criterion - the nature and purpose of the provision - it is clear to me that the theme for assessment will be the standard specified in section CARDINAL of the DATE Act by reference to section CARDINAL , which I have reproduced in my introductory overview . The overarching standard is whether the doctor is unfit to practise his profession , in our case on the grounds of \u2018 conduct unworthy of a GPE . Although the conduct to which the standard is directed will frequently involve - and in our case in fact does involve - criminal actions , I am not inclined to agree with [ the applicant ] in his submission that it is the criminal actions that make up the nature of the provision . The theme for assessment is whether the doctor satisfies the requirements for holding a permit to practise the profession and continuing to practise the profession .", "( CARDINAL ) The provisions of the DATE Act are aimed specifically at a professional group that is dependent upon a special degree of confidence in the mind of the public and accordingly requires a public permit in order to practise . The legislative history of the LAW strongly emphasised the need for doctors to observe a high professional and ethical standard and the need for society to control who practises the profession by requiring a public permit to be held and , moreover , that such permits may be revoked if the preconditions are no longer fulfilled ( see inter alia NOU ( NORP Official Report ) CARDINAL pp . CARDINAL and DATE ) . ORG therefore proposed the continuation of the existing scheme , but added that a breach of the precondition as to good conduct could result in revocation . The Ministry concurred ( see ORG . CARDINAL to the PERSON ( DATE ) , p. CARDINAL ) . The ORG emphasised that the grounds for loss of an authorisation or licence would need to encompass more than criminal actions . The ORG stated as follows :", "\u2018 There should also be room for revoking an authorisation or licence in the case of conduct or actions that are not criminal , but this should occur only rarely . On the other hand , not every criminal action should lead to revocation ; here as in other contexts the doctor must be found unfit to practise the profession . The blameworthy circumstances must normally relate to his or her medical practice . Nevertheless , there may be instances in which conduct outside the profession may entail that the doctor does not enjoy the necessary confidence , for instance if he or she commits theft , embezzles in the context of his or her practice , defamation or assault of other persons etc.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) As will be apparent from my introductory discussion of the provisions this object has at all times been of central importance and it is now expressly provided for in the purpose clause of ORG . The object of the provisions is not to punish persons who are in breach of the standard but rather to prevent them from causing their patients harm or violating the relationship of trust that must of necessity exist between the general public and the medical profession . This is expressly emphasised in Proposition No . CARDINAL to the PERSON ( DATE ) , p. CARDINAL , second column . In my assessment this is a long way from the domain of criminal law , a fact that the existence in most NORP countries of equivalent arrangements serves to emphasise .", "( CARDINAL ) [ The applicant ] has submitted that disqualification pursuant to LAW , which is described as punishment , far and away serves the same purpose as the revocation provisions of LAW . This is indisputably correct , but will nevertheless not be of particular significance . I refer here to ORG ( GPE Retstidende- \u201c ORG . \u201d ) DATE p CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , where a parallel of this nature was found not to be decisive with respect to rights vesting in an individual permit issued by the public authorities . Nor does the fact that the sanction is for actions that have already been performed change my assessment that this is primarily a civil law sanction . Finally I should also note that there is no direct link between the sanction in question and the preconditions for punishment , as was found to be the case in GPE . DATE p.CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL . As I have already noted , the overarching and decisive point is whether the doctor in question is unfit to practise the medical profession .", "( DATE ) The third PERSON criterion - the content and severity of the sanction - can not lead to a different conclusion . Clearly , depriving a doctor of the right to practise will have a serious impact on that doctor . However , in decisions of this type , often referred to as disciplinary decisions , the point of departure has been that the sanctions in question must be very serious - in practice prison sentences , see ORG . DATE p. CARDINAL and , at p. CARDINAL , reference to PERSON v. GPE ( application no . CARDINAL ) , see also ORG . DATE p. CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL . A common point of departure has been that the decisions in question have been directed at a limited circle of people .", "( CARDINAL ) No decision by ORG directly addresses the question of the revocation of a public permit to practise a profession . The ORG has referred to a number of dismissal decisions that indicate that this lies outside the domain of criminal law . As regards the revocation of a permit to conduct business , ORG held as follows in its dismissal decision in GPE v. GPE ( application MONEY ) , a case concerning the revocation of a taxi licence on the grounds of tax offences :", "\u2018 ... The ORG considers that the revocation of the licence did not constitute a determination of a criminal charge against the applicant . Although it may be regarded as a severe measure , what was decisive for the revocation was the applicant \u2019s suitability to run a commercial taxi business , and , more specifically , whether he fulfilled the conditions therefore under administrative law provisions . Thus , the revocation can not be characterised as a penal sanction and the nature of the relevant proceedings can not be regarded as criminal ... \u2019", "( CARDINAL ) The decision then refers to ORG v. GPE judgment of DATE , where the revocation of a liquor licence on the grounds of irregularities did not constitute a penal sanction .", "( CARDINAL ) In NORP legal tradition the exercise of certain activities requires a public licence . The issuing of licences of this nature is , typically , an administrative activity . It would be inconsistent if the same did not apply to the revocation - reversal - of a licence of this nature where a recipient no longer fulfils the preconditions for holding the licence .", "( CARDINAL ) Against this background it is clear to me that the revocation and suspension of a licence to practise as a doctor on the grounds that the statutory and necessary preconditions for continuing to practise this activity are no longer present does not constitute a penal sanction in ORG view . The question regarding the concrete application of LAW No . CARDINAL will therefore not arise . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
