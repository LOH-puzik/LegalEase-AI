The court also informed ORG that CARDINAL judgments in default had so far been given in GPE ordering TIME to pay maintenance , and that on the basis of those judgments the first applicant had been able to receive substitute maintenance from the \u201c FAC \u201d ( ORG ) .

ORG further noted that it would perhaps be quicker for the first applicant to send a request for recognition and enforcement under LAW directly to the competent court in GPE . Alternatively , it advised ORG to resubmit its request to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent another request for the recognition and enforcement in GPE of the judgment of the FAC of DATE on the basis of the ORG .

He alleged that the length of the proceedings for the recovery of maintenance instituted in DATE on his behalf by his mother on the basis of ORG had been excessive . He also claimed compensation in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) . The applicant explained that he had not been able to recover any maintenance from his father , despite the fact that several judgments awarding maintenance had been handed down in GPE and despite ORG repeated attempts to intervene with the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint . It recalled that a mere reference to the overall duration of the proceedings did not suffice for a conclusion that their length had been excessive and that the applicant had failed to sufficiently specify the omissions or delays attributable to the lower court . It further observed that , in any event , ORG role as the ORG in the impugned proceedings under the GPE had been limited solely to carrying out technical and organisational tasks , which ORG had duly done .", "CARDINAL .

By a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG asked the applicant to rectify her request , in particular by attaching the required documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as ORG under ORG , transferred the second applicant \u2019s request to ORG , acting as ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested ORG to confirm reception of the application filed by the second applicant . It appears that there was no response to that request . Enquiries with the NORP postal service revealed that the request had been served on ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a certificate for the third applicant attesting that she had not received any maintenance payments due to the second applicant . The certificate was necessary to claim substitute maintenance from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG requested the assistance of ORG in GPE . In reply , on DATE the Polish Embassy informed ORG that ORG had instituted proceedings for the recovery of the maintenance due to the second applicant .

ORG replied to ORG that the judgment of ORG given on DATE in the third applicant \u2019s case did not concern any maintenance payments in respect of the second applicant . Consequently , it requested ORG to proceed with the recovery of the maintenance owed by GPE to the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . In its response of CARDINAL DATE , ORG informed the ORG that the NORP judgment ordering GPE to pay maintenance to the second applicant was a judgment in default given in GPE \u2019s absence . Consequently , ORG requested ORG to provide it with documents proving that GPE \u2019s rights as a defendant in the proceedings before the NORP courts had been respected , as required by LAW . On DATE ORG forwarded the requested documents to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transmitted the case to ORG as a competent authority to institute the proceedings in accordance with ORG . Subsequently , the case was transmitted to ORG of ORG for further action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as ORG , filed a claim with ORG for the enforcement of FAC judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment , dismissing the claim . The court considered that the ORG had no standing to file such a claim because ORG did not apply to the case . It held that LAW was applicable to the case and that accordingly it was the second applicant who had standing to file a claim for enforcement . It is not clear whether ORG lodged an appeal against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the third applicant filed a claim with ORG requesting the recognition and enforcement of FAC judgment of DATE . The court gave judgment on CARDINAL DATE , dismissing the third applicant \u2019s claim . It held that the defendant , GPE , had not been correctly informed about the proceedings in GPE and therefore could not defend his interests in the proceedings . The court found that GPE had been served summons to appear at the hearing scheduled for DATE only on DATE , i.e. after the hearing had taken place . The third applicant appealed .", "DATE . According to a document dated DATE prepared by a judge of the ORG the rights of GPE had been fully respected in the proceedings leading to the FAC ORG judgment of DATE . The judge noted that the second applicant \u2019s claim had been filed on DATE and that the first hearing had been scheduled for DATE . The latter hearing was adjourned since GPE had failed to appear and FAC had had no proof that the claim had been served on the defendant . After the court was notified that the claim had been served on GPE on DATE it scheduled a hearing for DATE . On that date PERSON ORG heard the case and delivered judgment in default .

He was instructed that he could file an objection to the judgment in default within DATE from the date of the service but he did not react .", "CARDINAL . A hearing before ORG was scheduled for CARDINAL DATE . However , that hearing was rescheduled owing to a bomb attack which had occurred in the court in GPE DATE prior to that date . Another hearing in the case , scheduled for DATE , was also rescheduled , on account of the local elections due to take place from QUANTITY to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the third applicant \u2019s appeal . It upheld the lower court finding that the GPE \u2019s rights to participate in the proceedings and to defend his interests had not been respected . Accordingly , the recognition of the judgment in issue would have been contrary to the public order .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the third applicant did not lodge an appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL .

The court observed that the second applicant had filed his application for recovery of maintenance under FAC on DATE . It noted that the initial application had been incomplete and had had to be rectified by the second applicant before being transmitted to ORG . ORG considered that the transmission of documents had been carried out without undue delay . It further considered that , in the proceedings under LAW , ORG had only acted as ORG and , as such , had had no influence on the expeditiousness of the recovery of the maintenance by the NORP authorities . Moreover , ORG found that ORG , although it had not been required to do so by law , had on several occasions attempted to intervene in the proceedings by sending reminder letters to the NORP authorities and by soliciting the assistance of the NORP embassy in GPE . Consequently , ORG considered that the ORG could not be held responsible for the overall length of the impugned proceedings and it dismissed the second applicant \u2019s complaint , refusing to award him any compensation .", "CARDINAL .
