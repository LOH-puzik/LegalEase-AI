GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in LANGUAGE . He is represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . He lodged the application also on behalf of his CARDINAL children PERSON ( J .- M. ) and Peer PERSON ( P. ) .", "The applicant and PERSON ( born in DATE ) married in DATE . Their son PERSON was born on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant further adopted PERSON son PERSON who was born on DATE . Since the spouses\u2019 separation in DATE , both children live with PERSON", "On DATE the Winsen ( Luhe ) ORG held a hearing in which the applicant and his wife reached an agreement on the applicant \u2019s access to his children . According to that agreement , the applicant was entitled to personal contacts with his children , then aged CARDINAL and CARDINAL respectively , every DATE after school until TIME , every second DATE from DATE , during all school holidays CARDINAL of their duration and on DATE , GPE and GPE on the second public holiday .", "On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Luhe ) ORG , after having heard the parties and PERSON , restricted the applicant \u2019s right of access to DATE from DATE and to DATE of all school holidays , with the exception of DATE , in which he was granted access in DATE .", "In DATE , following the exercise of his right of access , the applicant refused to bring the children back to their mother and travelled around with them in GPE without informing her of their whereabouts .", "On DATE the PERSON ( NORP ) ORG granted PERSON sole custody of PERSON and P. and ordered the applicant to render the children to FAC", "In DATE the applicant returned the children to their mother .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a motion with the PERSON ( NORP ) ORG to amend its decision dated CARDINAL DATE and to broaden his right of access to his children . In particular , he applied to be granted access not only every second week - end and during CARDINAL of all school holidays , but also every DATE after ( nursery ) school , during part of the public holidays , further public holidays possibly fixed by law in the future and his children \u2019s birthdays once in DATE .", "On DATE ORG submitted its report after having heard the applicant and PERSON on the question of access . Its representative , a social pedagogue , summarized the spouses\u2019 diverging views on an extension of the applicant \u2019s right of access . She took the view that it was up to ORG to decide on this issue , as mediation by ORG between the spouses had no prospects of success . The representative further stated that she did not hear the spouses\u2019 children ( then aged DATE ) as they were to be questioned in court soon and she wished to spare them another hearing within a short period of time .", "On DATE the PERSON ( NORP ) ORG held a hearing in which it questioned the spouses and their children in person . Both PERSON and PERSON stated that they wished to visit their father also during DATE from time to time . P. said that he also wanted to celebrate his birthday at his father \u2019s place , but that his mother had told him not to express this wish at the hearing .", "On DATE the PERSON ( NORP ) ORG supplemented its decision dated CARDINAL DATE . Relying on section DATE of LAW it ordered that the applicant \u2019s right of access during DATE of DATE began at TIME on DATE and ended at TIME on DATE of access . Apart from that completion , it dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion to amend its decision dated CARDINAL DATE .", "Having regard to ORG written report dated DATE , ORG found that granting the applicant access to his children more often than fixed in its decision of CARDINAL DATE was not in the children \u2019s best interests .", "As to the applicant \u2019s motion to be granted access also on DATE and on DATE ORG observed that PERSON had sole custody of the children who resided with her . They needed to be stabilized in the central place of their life and residence and should not be torn between their parents . For the same reasons , it was not in the children \u2019s best interests to broaden the applicant \u2019s right to personal contacts during DATE . In view of the serious tensions between the spouses it had , however , been necessary to fix exact times for DATE of the applicant \u2019s right of access .", "As to the applicant \u2019s motion to be granted access to his children also on their birthdays , ORG took the view that it was in the children \u2019s best interests to pass their birthdays with the parent having custody , where they could celebrate with friends and possibly relatives in adequate surroundings . Moreover , as it was more likely that the legislator suppressed public holidays instead of creating new ones , it was unnecessary to grant a right of access for DATE possibly fixed in the future .", "ORG took the view that the applicant \u2019s request for further contacts was directed at circumventing Mrs W .- L. \u2019s sole custody of their children . Given that in DATE the applicant had failed to return the children to their mother following the exercise of his right of access and had been travelling around with them for DATE without informing her of their whereabouts , this was unacceptable .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against ORG decision . In his reasoning dated DATE he complained in particular that ORG had failed to take into account the specific circumstances of his case , in particular the fact that his sons wanted to see him more often , had refused to obtain an expert report and had failed to appoint a curator ad litem . Referring to the standards established in the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL July CARDINAL in the case of PERSON v. GPE , he further took the view that his children and a psychological expert should be heard in the appeal proceedings .", "On DATE ORG filed a written report . Without having heard the spouses again and without having heard their children , its representative took the view that the wishes expressed by children of the age of PERSON and P. were not decisive for the extent of access which was in their best interests . Otherwise , parents conscientiously or unconscientiously would tend to influence their children according to their own wishes . There was no danger of alienation between the appellant and his children if the present regulation on access was complied with . It was essential for the children to know where their main place of life and residence was after the appellant had travelled around with them in GPE for DATE , without informing their mother of their whereabouts .", "On DATE ORG , without holding a hearing , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded . In the court \u2019s view , the extent of personal contacts as ordered by ORG in its decision dated CARDINAL DATE were sufficient to cultivate and develop the relationship between the appellant and his children . According to the court \u2019s own experience , it was in the best interests of children aged DATE like PERSON and P. to have CARDINAL main place of residence where they passed their everyday life and met friends . The children lived with their mother . Even though his children enjoyed visiting him , broadening the appellant \u2019s access to them would de facto make them reside at CARDINAL places . In view of the very serious tensions between the parties , this would unsettle them and make them feel not to know where they belong .", "For the same reasons , ORG confirmed that the appellant \u2019s contacts with his children during the holidays and on further public holidays should not be broadened .", "ORG further agreed with ORG that the appellant should not be granted access to his children on their birthdays . It was in the children \u2019s best interests to pass their birthdays at their home in order to be able to celebrate with children living in their neighbourhood . It endorsed the reasons given by ORG in respect of the appellant \u2019s further motions .", "In ORG view , it had not been necessary to appoint the children a curator ad litem in the present proceedings in order to represent them and to protect their interests . In particular , given the children \u2019s age , it was not yet their subjective wish to broaden their contacts with their father , but their objective best interests not to disturb their prosperous development which was decisive .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He complained that the family courts had dismissed his motion to be granted more personal contacts with his children without consulting an expert , without appointing a curator ad litem and without hearing the parents and the children in the appeal proceedings . He argued that thereby , his parental rights and his rights to equality and to be heard as guaranteed by LAW and by Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG had been violated .", "On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . It referred to sections CARDINAL a and b of ORG allowing the panel not to accept complaints for adjudication which are not of fundamental constitutional significance and the acceptance of which is not necessary to enforce a complainant \u2019s rights under LAW . In accordance with section CARDINAL d \u00a7 CARDINAL , third sentence , of the said LAW , the court did not give reasons for its decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
