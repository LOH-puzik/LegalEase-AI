On DATE the GPE ORG registered the applicant branch \u2019s amended articles of association .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new Law on freedom of conscience and religious associations ( \u201c the Religions Act \u201d ) came into force . It required all religious associations which had previously been granted the status of legal entities to bring their articles of association into conformity with the LAW and to re - register by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to ORG an application for re - registration as a local religious organisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the deputy head of ORG notified the applicant that its request for re - registration was being denied . He advanced CARDINAL grounds for this refusal . Firstly , it was claimed that , at the meeting of ORG ( the governing body of the applicant branch ) at which amendments to the founding documents had been adopted , CARDINAL members had been in attendance , whereas LAW required that a religious organisation should have CARDINAL founding members . Secondly , it was alleged that no visas for the applicant branch \u2019s foreign members , or other documents establishing their lawful residence in NORP territory , had been provided . Thirdly , the deputy head referred to the fact that the applicant branch was subordinate to a centralised religious organisation in GPE and inferred therefrom that the applicant branch was \u201c most probably \u201d a representative office of a foreign religious organisation operating on behalf and by order of the latter . Accordingly , its activities were to be governed by Government Regulation no . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the refusal before ORG of GPE . ORG submitted its written comments , in which it advanced a new ground for the refusal of registration .", "\u201c ... LAW provides that members of the Branch shall include supporters , soldiers , local officers and officers headed by the Officer Commanding , who is appointed from GPE . Members of the Branch wear a uniform and perform service , which means that the Branch is a paramilitary organisation .", "Pursuant to Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE \u2018 on measures to secure coordinated actions by ORG authorities in the fight against fascism and other forms of political extremism in GPE , no paramilitary formations may be established in GPE .", "We do not consider the use of the word \u2018 NORP in the name of a religious organisation to be legitimate . ORG defines the meaning of this word as : CARDINAL . The totality of a ORG \u2019s armed forces ... \u201d", "As to the remainder , ORG repeated and elaborated on the grounds for refusal set out in the letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment . It determined that the applicant branch was a representative office of the international religious organisation \u201c The ORG \u201d and therefore was not eligible for registration as an independent religious organisation . In the court \u2019s opinion , this fact also prevented the applicant branch from being granted re - registration . Secondly , it referred to LAW , banning the founding and functioning of public associations which advocated a violent change in the constitutional principles of GPE or destruction of its integrity , undermined the security of the ORG , created paramilitary formations , or caused social , racial , ethnic or religious division or conflict . The court continued as follows :", "\u201c In the course of analysis of the LAW , certain provisions stood out , on the one hand , as being imbued with barrack - room discipline , in which members of the religious organisation show unquestionable subordination to its management and , on the other hand , as relieving the management and the organisation as a whole of any responsibility for its PERSON activities . Thus , according to LAW , \u2018 the members of the Branch shall act in compliance with ORG and with the instructions of the Officer PERSON , ... \u2018 the Branch as a whole shall not be liable for infringements of the legislation of GPE perpetrated by individual members of the Branch\u2019 . This wording of the LAW leads one to conclude that the LAW assumes that the members of the organisation will inevitably break NORP law in the process of executing ORG and the instructions of the Officer Commanding ... The Branch excludes its liability for illegal service activity by its members . \u201d", "Thirdly , the court pointed out that the grounds for judicial liquidation of the applicant branch , as set out in its articles of association , were inconsistent with those laid down in NORP law . Lastly , the court held that the applicant branch had not disclosed its objectives , given that the articles of association failed to describe \u201c all the decisions , regulations and traditions of The ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment on appeal , focusing mainly on the applicant branch \u2019s foreign ties . It pointed out that the organisation \u2019s executive body included CARDINAL foreign nationals who had multiple - entry visas , but not residence permits , whereas section CARDINAL ) of LAW required founders to be of NORP nationality . Noting the location of ORG headquarters abroad and the presence of the word \u201c branch \u201d in its name , ORG concluded that ORG had correctly insisted on registration of the applicant branch as a representative office of a foreign religious organisation . As a subsidiary argument , ORG endorsed ORG finding that the articles of association did not indicate the precise religious affiliation of its members because it was described as \u201c NORP \u201d , certain clauses of the articles of association mentioned the \u201c faith of The ORG \u201d , and its objective was the \u201c advancement of the NORP faith \u201d . On the allegedly paramilitary nature of the applicant \u2019s activities , ORG noted :", "\u201c The argument that [ the applicant ] is not a paramilitary organisation does not undermine the [ first - instance ] court \u2019s findings that the Branch is a representative office of a foreign religious organisation , ORG , and that the documents submitted for re - registration do not conform to the requirements of NORP law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE sent an instruction \u201c on activities of non - traditional religious associations in the territory of the GPE \u201d to NORP regional education departments . The instruction stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... the international religious organisation ORG is expanding its activities in the central part of GPE . Its followers attempt to influence young people and the military . ORG formally represents ORG branch of NORP ; in essence , however , it is a quasi - military religious organisation that has a rigid hierarchy of management . ORG is managed and funded from abroad . \u201d", "The applicant branch submitted that this extract was copied verbatim from an information sheet prepared by ORG of GPE and forwarded to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the time - limit for re - registration of religious organisations expired . Organisations that had failed to obtain re - registration were liable for dissolution through the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG and ORG of GPE , respectively , refused the applicant branch \u2019s request to lodge an application for supervisory review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG brought an action for dissolution of the applicant branch .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE granted the action for dissolution . The court found that the applicant branch had failed to notify ORG on time about the continuation of its activities and had failed to obtain re - registration within the time - limit set by LAW . The court held that the applicant branch had ceased its activities and that it was to be stripped of its status as a legal entity and struck off ORG . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a complaint before the Constitutional Court challenging the constitutionality of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , which provided for dissolution of religious organisations that had failed to re - register before the time - limit . The applicant argued that the contested provision imposed dissolution as a form of penalty which could be imposed on a religious organisation on purely formal grounds , in the absence of any violations or offences on the part of the organisation . It maintained that the possibility of no - fault penalty was incompatible with the rule of law and constituted an encroachment on its constitutional rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled on the complaint . It held that re - registration of a religious organisation could not be made conditional on the fulfilment of requirements that were introduced by LAW and which had not legally existed when the organisation was founded . A court could only decide on the dissolution of an organisation which had failed to bring its documents into compliance with the LAW if it was duly established that the organisation had ceased its activities or had engaged in unlawful activities . The court also emphasised that a judicial decision on dissolution of an organisation that had failed to obtain re - registration was to be reasoned beyond a mere reference to such formal grounds for dissolution as the failure to re - register or the failure to provide information on the continuation of its activities . Finally , the court held that the applicant \u2019s case was to be reheard in the part affected by ORG different interpretation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case for a fresh examination by a differently composed bench .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed the action for dissolution of the applicant branch brought by ORG . The court founded its decision on ORG ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG lodged an appeal . It submitted , firstly , that the judicial decisions upholding its refusal of re - registration remained effective and , secondly , that the entering of information on the applicant branch in ORG did not constitute re - registration for the purposes of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the refusal to re - register it had had an adverse impact on its activities .", "CARDINAL . Following the expiry of the time - limit for re - registration on DATE , the applicant branch \u2019s assets had had to be transferred , in order to avoid seizure , to the community of ORG which had been re - registered at federal level . The transfer process had required considerable time and effort , involving : title to CARDINAL properties ; title to and registration of CARDINAL vehicles ; opening of a new bank account ; replacement of every employee \u2019s contract ; renegotiation of CARDINAL rental contracts , etc . Each of these transfers had necessitated complex bureaucratic steps and a diversion of resources from religious activities .", "CARDINAL . The refusal had also resulted in negative publicity which severely undermined the applicant branch \u2019s efforts at charitable fund - raising and generated distrust among landlords who refused to negotiate leases with the applicant branch .", "CARDINAL .
