On DATE the Chief of ORG , GPE , GPE ( stadsdelsf\u00f6rvaltningen CARDINAL , GPE , GPE ) informed the second applicant as follows :", "\u201c ... I must point out that LAW containing Special Provisions on ORG applies in respect of children taken into public care . As you are aware , its provisions regarding access apply only in respect of the custody holder or in respect of those who have taken care of the child . Accordingly , it is only the mother [ the first applicant ] who is covered by these provisions . Of course , a natural father is important for the child who , having regard to what is in his or her best interests , has a right of access to his or her parent . According to section CARDINAL of [ the DATE Act ] , it is the social authorities , in this case the foster home department at Tynnered District [ familjehemsverksamheten i stadsdels - f\u00f6rvaltningen Tynnered ] , which must decide on [ J. \u2019s ] personal circumstances in the foster home . [ The second applicant ] is welcome to discuss the question of access with [ the secretary responsible for foster home care ] .", "... I should like to recall that it concerns a child who , because of his need of care , has been placed in a foster home by court order . It can not be considered to be in the interest of a child to be removed from his or her home DATE , especially not in a situation such as that of [ J. ] . Not even in divorce cases is it normal that access be granted with such short intervals ; such cases often do not even concern children with any special need for care being provided in their home .", "In effect , what you suggest is that a non - custody holder should be granted access going beyond what the custody holder has been granted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second applicant did not pursue the matter but appears to have contacted the social authorities at Fr\u00f6lunda to enquire about his access to J.

It is however appropriate that a child also meets his or her relatives .", "...", "ORG has decided that [ J. \u2019s ] access to his mother should be limited to CARDINAL visits a year , which may be increased to the extent agreed by [ J. ] . His access to other relatives should be considered in light of this . As regards [ the second applicant \u2019s ] request to meet [ J. ] it could be said that [ the second applicant ] participates in the regular access arranged DATE . Admittedly , [ J. ] has not appeared more than a few times during DATE but the aim is that [ J. ] attend more frequently in the future . This means that [ the second applicant ] will meet [ J. ] on the same conditions as the mother [ the first applicant ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It does not appear that the second applicant has taken any further initiative to establish access to his son J.", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE PERSON had submitted a request by the maternal grandparents to ORG for the children P. and PERSON to stay with them DATE .", "On DATE the ORG informed PERSON that the question regarding the PERSON access to their grandchildren was not regulated in the law . The request could , nevertheless , be examined in the context of the social authorities\u2019 general powers to decide on the personal conditions of the children . Decisions made under these general powers were not subject to any review . The grandparents were advised to contact the social authority responsible for the foster home to discuss the possibilities of access although the access requested did not appear to be consistent with the children \u2019s needs .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE the grandparents insisted on having a formal decision on the subject .
