The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the material time he had been a correspondent with an NORP newspaper in GPE . He had also been working voluntarily for a bookshop specialising in books on NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he appeared in a television documentary broadcast in the framework of the programme Son \u00e7are ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) , hosted by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . During the programme the hostess introduced the documentary by pointing out that it concerned covert activities conducted in GPE by \u201c foreign pedlars of religion \u201d ( yabanc\u0131 din t\u00fcccarlar\u0131 ) .", "The ensuing documentary was along the following lines :", "Over footage of FAC and then NORP religious ceremonies , a voice stated that everyone , whether a member of the NORP majority or a religious minority , had the right to belong to the religion of his or her own choosing and the freedom to practise that religion . According to the voice - over , it was strange that some proselytising activities were being carried out in a covert manner , despite the freedom of conscience and religion .", "Against a background of images of a dhikr ceremony performed by a NORP brotherhood , showing followers in a state of trance , the voiceover asked whether , \u201c in order to combat such instances of bigotry ( yobazl\u0131k ) , an attempt was being made to set up groups of NORP converts , plunging the country into chaos \u201d .", "The voiceover explained that the aim of the programme was not to judge any specific religion but to show that whatever their nationalities or religious beliefs , the pedlars of religion all used the same methods .", "CARDINAL . The voiceover explained that the programme producers had been contacted by a certain ORG , who lived in PERSON . This person had been intrigued by an advertisement asking \u201c would you like to read books free of charge ? \u201d , and had replied . In return , he had received a number of books by mail , all of them concerning NORP . He had written back and had once again received books on the same subject . The second dispatch had been accompanied by a letter thanking him for his interest in the subject .", "CARDINAL . There had subsequently been a telephone exchange between ORG and the sender , who had proved to be the applicant .", "CARDINAL . After that exchange it had been agreed that the applicant would travel to PERSON to meet ORG", "CARDINAL . It was at that point that ORG had decided to inform the programme producers and to invite them to make a documentary on the subject .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had travelled to PERSON to meet ORG and some of his \u201c friends [ purportedly ] interested in NORP \u201d for the first time , in a restaurant . The conversation had been filmed by a hidden camera .", "CARDINAL . According to the voiceover , the applicant had then presented the teachings of the Bible . He had continued by comparing NORP with other religions , emphasising his own beliefs . However , that sequence was not shown , on the grounds that the aim of the documentary was not to discuss the merits of specific beliefs but to expose the methods used .", "CARDINAL . A.N. and the applicant had arranged to meet up again DATE in an apartment , again accompanied by a group of ORG \u2019s friends purportedly desirous of learning about the NORP religion .", "CARDINAL . During that second meeting the applicant had explained that he was not alone but was part of a group working throughout GPE . He had said that LOC could be rented in PERSON for the converts , but that he would have to talk to his \u201c boss \u201d about that . The question of where the money would come from was difficult , but an open , intelligent attitude had to be adopted to such matters because converts could be accused of having changed religions thanks to pecuniary considerations rather than conviction .", "CARDINAL . The documentary then showed the following dialogue between the applicant and CARDINAL of the participants :", "\u201c Participant :", "- Have you read the Koran ?", "Applicant :", "\u2013 Yes .", "Participant :", "DATE What did you think of it ?", "Applicant :", "DATE I liked it . Some of the verses are good , but ...", "Participant :", "\u2013 ... but there is also some nonsense ?", "Applicant :", "\u2013 No , I would n\u2019t say that , but it can not save me , because I know I am a sinner .", "...", "Applicant :", "\u2013 The knowledge which God has sent us is set out in the Bible , the PERSON and the Book of the Psalms of David . [ That knowledge ] is complete in itself . We need no other prophet , because PERSON is divine in essence ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Just as the applicant was apparently preparing , with the help of a bowl of water , to explain to the participants the ritual of baptism , the person hosting the programme , PERSON , burst into the room with a camera and a microphone .", "CARDINAL . She told the applicant that she had heard about the meeting and had come to make his acquaintance . She asked him who he was and where he came from .", "CARDINAL . The applicant replied that he was NORP and held an identity card up to the camera . He added that he was a journalist , and was involved in explaining the NORP faith on a voluntary basis .", "CARDINAL . Asked why the latter activity was covert , he answered that it was not covert , and that he had come to LOC with full trust in the person who had contacted him .", "CARDINAL . The documentary then presented an interview between Ms GPE and an academic from ORG . The latter explained that NORP were duty - bound to respect and believe in the divine nature of the holy books of all the monotheistic religions , pointing out that ORG was a religion of tolerance . However , he voiced his surprise at the covert nature of the activities shown in the documentary .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the programme the applicant was shown walking along carrying a bag . The voiceover described him as \u201c ORG , the pedlar of religion , on his way to the police station to give a statement \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the hostess of the TV programme had been accompanied by police officers when she had burst into the room , and the officers had remanded him in custody after the discussions .", "CARDINAL . He had been released DATE , after having given his statement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office brought criminal proceedings against the applicant for insulting Allah and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant innocent given that no evidence had been provided of a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an action for damages against the programme presenter and producers .", "CARDINAL . GPE Regional Court ( \u201c IRC \u201d ) dismissed that action by judgment of DATE on the grounds of the public interest of dissemination of information .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE the CARDINALth ORG of ORG set aside the latter judgment , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL .", "In its reasoning the ORG noted that the case concerned a conflict of rights between freedom of expression , on the one hand , and personality rights on the other . Having reiterated the fundamental importance of freedom of the press , it pointed out that that freedom nevertheless had its limits . It considered that the claimant had not committed any unlawful act but had merely exercised his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of conscience , which CARDINAL rights were secured under both the LAW and LAW . That being the case , the claimant \u2019s right to respect for his private life had suffered a twofold violation , first of all when he had been filmed by a hidden camera , and secondly when the images had been broadcast , accompanied by such expressions as \u201c pedlar of religion \u201d and \u201c bigotry \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ruling on the case referred back to it , the ORG decided not to follow the reasoning of ORG and instead to maintain its previous judgment .", "CARDINAL . In the face of such resistance from the IRC , the case was referred ex officio to ORG of ORG . By judgment of DATE , that ORG upheld the finding of the first - instance court by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL .", "In their reasoning , the judges of the superior court held that the impugned images had not concerned details of the applicant \u2019s private life , but had been part of a documentary on a topical issue of interest to the general public . They considered that there had been a major public interest in broadcasting the documentary at issue and that the documentary - makers had struck a fair balance between the merits and the formal aspects of the subject .", "CARDINAL . According to the case file that judgment was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the owner of the apartment which he had rented had ended his lease following the transmission of the documentary for security reasons .", "CARDINAL . He added that he had been expelled to GPE .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
