Tinnelly & Sons Ltd ( hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the first applicant , is a contracting firm based in GPE with experience in the demolition and dismantling of industrial plants as well as asbestos stripping . Mr PERSON , the second applicant , is the firm \u2019s managing director and his brother , Mr PERSON , the third applicant , is its company secretary . The second and third applicants are NORP .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , the remaining applicants ( hereinafter \u201c LOC ) , are all self - employed joiners based in GPE . They are all NORP .", "CARDINAL . The applications lodged with the Commission stem from a similar factual background and administrative practice and raise the same issues under the Convention . The facts pertaining to the complaint lodged by PERSON are set out in LAW ; the facts pertaining to the CARDINAL complaints are set out in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Sometime in DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) considered inviting tenders for the demolition of the ORG \u201c A \u201d Power Station and the purchase of the resulting scrap . The PERSON firm expressed interest in working on the contract and following contacts with ORG submitted a tender on DATE . PERSON , which was on a ORG list of approved contractors , submitted the lowest tender . Having regard to their competitive bid as well as to the firm \u2019s track record in demolition work an executive committee of ORG , meeting on DATE , recommended that the firm \u2019s bid be accepted . It would appear that ORG officials were satisfied both with the financial backing which ORG had secured as a condition of being awarded the contract and its capacity to undertake and complete the work . Having regard to the frequency of its contacts with ORG around this time , PERSON proceeded on the understanding that it had been awarded the contract .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE a revised recommendation was drawn up recommending that the contract be given to another firm which had submitted the second lowest offer in response to the invitation to tender , namely the GPE - based firm of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c NORP \u201d ) . The contract was subsequently awarded to PERSON with a starting date of CARDINAL DATE . PERSON received a letter on DATE confirming that it had not been awarded the contract . The firm was not informed of the reasons for this decision .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on CARDINAL DATE , PERSON submitted a detailed quotation to PERSON for the removal of asbestos from the GPE site . PERSON contacted the firm with a view to discussing the terms of a subcontract . A meeting was arranged at ORG \u2019s GPE office for CARDINAL DATE . However , the firm was informed on DATE of the planned meeting that PERSON had decided to cancel it . PERSON learnt subsequently from the managing director of PERSON that PERSON \u2019s employees were not considered acceptable by ORG on security grounds and for that reason the subcontract was withheld from it . In its particulars of complaint submitted to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , PERSON maintained that , according to PERSON , PERSON had been the favourites to obtain the ORG contract but were not awarded it since the trade unions at ORG would not allow employees of PERSON access to the site and \u201c there was no way they were going to have IRA sympathisers working with them \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Tinnelly considered that it had been refused the contracts with ORG and PERSON because of the perceived religious beliefs and/or political opinions of its management and workforce and for that reason had been the victim of unlawful discrimination . It relied on the information gleaned from PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . PERSON lodged complaints on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE with ORG for GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the statutory body charged under LAW ( GPE ) Act DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , with the duty to promote equality of opportunity in the province and to eliminate religious and political discrimination in the employment sector and related areas ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) . Since DATE the ORG has been known as ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG served particulars of the allegations of unlawful discrimination on ORG on CARDINAL DATE . ORG replied on DATE stating that the contract at ORG had been awarded to PERSON on account of that company \u2019s proven experience in the safe dismantling of power stations and of handling asbestos and for that same reason ORG did not want the asbestos - stripping part of the contract sub - contracted to another firm . ORG \u2019s letter also referred to ORG \u2019s failure to take steps to execute the guarantee submitted at the time of tendering for the ORG contract , which explained the frequent contacts between the CARDINAL sides at the material time ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG , acting under the powers given to it under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , agreed to investigate ORG \u2019s complaint that there were suspicions that ORG \u2019s decision had been brought about by sectarian pressure exerted by the trade unions at ORG . ORG took the view that the ORG had no jurisdiction to investigate the complaint on the ground that the protection afforded by section CARDINAL did not extend to corporate bodies such as ORG . ORG sought an order of prohibition to prevent the ORG from investigating the complaint as well as a declaration that no valid complaint had been made and that the ORG had no jurisdiction to investigate it . This argument was dismissed by Mr Justice PERSON in ORG of GPE on DATE . ORG did not appeal against that decision and the ORG proceeded with the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a senior official of ORG made a formal request to the Secretary of ORG for GPE via a civil servant in ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for the issue of a certificate under section CARDINAL of LAW to the effect that the decision not to grant PERSON the contract in question was \u201c an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or of protecting public safety or public order \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The Secretary of ORG issued the certificate on CARDINAL DATE . By virtue of section ORG ) of the CARDINAL Act , the certificate was conclusive evidence that the act was done for the stated purpose ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG commenced judicial review proceedings in ORG of GPE before Mr Justice PERSON seeking an order of certiorari to quash the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision to issue the section CARDINAL certificate and a declaration that that decision was null and void . Lawyers for the ORG contended that the certificate was procured and issued in bad faith , was irrational , unfair and unreasonable and made for an improper collateral purpose , namely to prevent the ORG from investigating a complaint of unlawful discrimination . ORG was made a notice party to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the judicial review proceedings , the ORG sought an order for discovery of a number of documents in the possession , custody or power of the Secretary of ORG . Mr Justice PERSON made the order on DATE and the Secretary of ORG complied by producing a list of documents . However , some documents were sealed or covered up on the ground that their production , except as sealed or covered up , would be injurious to the public interest . These documents were covered by a public - interest immunity certificate issued by the Secretary of ORG on CARDINAL DATE . He stated in that certificate , inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . To enable me to be satisfied that ... genuine reasons did exist in [ signing the section CARDINAL certificate ] , I considered it necessary for me to know the information upon which ORG claimed to have acted . I also considered that I should independently obtain information to enable me to confirm , so far as possible , that national security and/or public order was , in fact , endangered in that case .", "CARDINAL . ORG is responsible for the provision ... of an uninterrupted supply of electricity in GPE . To fulfil this responsibility it must have available to it all relevant information which may reduce or avoid the risk of disruption to the supply ... for any unlawful reason including acts of terrorism , and in case of the [ relevant ] contract , I believe that it did obtain such information . The disclosure of certain information which was obtained by ORG would reveal to those who are engaged in unlawful activities including acts of terrorism , the nature of that information , the extent of the information known about them and possibly the source from which it originated . This could endanger life and would make it more difficult to obtain such information in the future ... [ D]isclosure of the process by which this information is obtained could impair the effectiveness of that process .", "CARDINAL . I am of the view that if the independent information which I obtained in the present case were to be disclosed it could enable terrorist organisations to know the nature and extent of the information known about them and would aid them in their unlawful acts ...", "CARDINAL . I have read CARDINAL documents which are produced to me . Each of the said documents contains in part information of the kind described in paragraph QUANTITY CARDINAL ... I am of the opinion that for the safeguarding of national security and the protection of public safety and public order , it would be contrary to the public interest that any of the said documents should be disclosed in these proceedings except as sealed and covered up to prevent disclosure of the aforesaid information . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG did not dispute the Secretary of ORG \u2019s objection to the production of these documents on public interest grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the FEA \u2013 again in the context of the challenge to the section CARDINAL certificate \u2013 applied for an order for discovery of documents by ORG , a notice party to the judicial review proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . An order to produce a list of documents was made on DATE . Those documents were disclosed by ORG with the exception of CARDINAL documents relating to the decision not to award the contract to ORG . ORG objected to the production of the latter documents on the ground that it would be injurious to the public interest .", "CARDINAL . The ORG challenged this objection and on DATE the Secretary of ORG issued a further public - interest immunity certificate . It repeated the substance of paragraph CARDINAL of the earlier certificate of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . I have read what I am informed are copies of CARDINAL documents held by ORG ... These documents reveal the methods used by ORG to gain information which is required to protect the electricity system , the sources of the information and the information obtained .", "CARDINAL . I have also read what I am informed are copies of a memorandum dated DATE ... TIME of a [ meeting ] dated DATE and a letter of CARDINAL DATE ...", "CARDINAL . For the reasons I have given in the foregoing paragraphs , I am of the opinion that for the safeguarding of national security , the protection of public safety and public order , none of the documents referred to in paragraph CARDINAL or their contents should be admitted in evidence in these proceedings because they fall within the class of communication which I have described and because of the information they contain . I am also of the opinion that for these reasons the document referred to in paragraph CARDINAL should not be admitted in evidence except as sealed and covered up . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON considered an interlocutory application by the ORG challenging the Secretary of ORG \u2019s public - interest immunity certificate of CARDINAL DATE . He prefaced his judgment with comments to the effect that , because he had seen certain documents which had not been seen by all sides , he was of the opinion that it might be better if a different judge determined the substantive judicial review application .", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON noted that the documents already disclosed to the court indicating the grounds on which ORG based their decision not to award the ORG contract to the PERSON firm gave rise to a prima facie case of bad faith on the part of ORG and the advisers to the Secretary of ORG . Mr Justice PERSON expressed the provisional view that the original reasons put forward by ORG for the refusal of the contract did not refer to security grounds , and the same reasons were repeated for a considerable time ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He noted that there were inconsistencies in the alleged ground for refusing the contract : at CARDINAL point the firm had been described as having experience of handling asbestos and having carried out subcontract demolition work on power stations , and later ( after security information had been received ) as having \u201c no experience \u201d in demolishing power stations . He recalled that PERSON had alleged that PERSON , the successful tenderer , had said that the applicants were the favourites to obtain the contract but were not given it \u201c as the unions at GPE would not allow it \u201d and that the unions had said that \u201c there was no way they were going to have IRA sympathisers working with them \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As to the documents whose discovery was sought , Mr Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c If this ORG is of the opinion that a document was not disclosed because it bore on national security and could not be edited so as to eliminate the national security element I would not go on to balance the interests of national security against the interests of justice since this balance is for the Government to exercise \u2026", "If the ORG is of the opinion that a document has no \u2018 national NORP implications , but has other \u2018 public interest\u2019 implications and is very likely to assist and give substantial support to the ORG on the issues involved in this case , it will go on to consider the other \u2018 public interest\u2019 objections to production and will go on to balance the competing interests of protection of the public interest in public safety or public order on the one hand and of the public interest in the administration of justice on the other hand DATE namely , that it is and is seen to be fair and open that a party is not deprived of documents which are likely or very likely to assist or substantially support his case \u2026 \u201d", "He continued :", "\u201c I reject any contention that a ORG Judge in GPE is incompetent to decide whether a document might involve national security or whether a class of documents might involve national security . I do accept , however , that if disclosure of a document might imperil national security , it is not for the ORG to balance national security against other considerations of public interest , but that it is for the relevant Minister of the ORG to do so \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON ordered that the CARDINAL documents for which a \u201c class claim \u201d had been made should be produced for inspection by the court , and that the CARDINAL documents which had been partly sealed or covered up should also be produced for inspection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having read the documents covered by the certificate of CARDINAL DATE ( which were not disclosed to the ORG or the applicants ) , Mr Justice PERSON held that none of the withheld documents assisted the application for judicial review . He accepted the claim for public interest immunity in respect of documents CARDINAL to CARDINAL , which related to confidential record checks carried out by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on PERSON and on persons employed by it . He considered that documents CARDINAL to CARDINAL , internal ORG documents , could be partly disclosed and that document DATE could be disclosed as a whole . He concluded :", "\u201c I am satisfied that the claim for immunity from production for all these documents was made in good faith . But in my opinion no person could reasonably say that for the safeguarding of national security or for the protection of public safety or public order documents CARDINAL should not be produced or , if admissible , should not be admissible in evidence \u2013 so long as my directions are carried out about covering over portions of some of them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON granted the Secretary of ORG leave to appeal on CARDINAL DATE . In so doing , he held :", "\u201c It is implicit in my ruling that I have rejected the \u2018 ORG claim set out in the certificate of the Secretary of ORG , as I take the view that it is too wide and too vague . It could involve , for example , protection of documents internal to ORG which emanated from a private detective agency or organisation within ORG acting as a private police force , independently of and outside the control of the ORG . A court might hold that no reasonable person could claim that national security was endangered by the production of documents emanating from such an agency or organisation . Such an agency or organisation might be a positive danger to national security . Such a \u2018 ORG claim could involve , for example , protection of documents emanating from employees of ORG about contractors and their employees based on gossip or hearsay or malice or sectarianism . Such documents might have existed in the present case , if the affidavit of PERSON is true .", "The CARDINAL documents of which I have ordered production could have been caught by this wide and vague formula ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the substantive hearing on DATE , the judicial review application was dismissed . Mr Justice PERSON found , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c The issue of course before me is not whether the Secretary of ORG was right or wrong in signing the certificate , but whether he had jurisdiction to do so , which is basically accepted by the parties , and whether the events leading up to his decision are such that his decision to certify can or can not stand .", "I must also remember that the process of judicial review is ill - suited to the resolution of disputed issues of fact , and particularly so when the primary issue is not the determination of what occurred , but the motives of those engaged in the relevant acts ...", "Even taking ORG \u2019s case at its highest , [ CARDINAL particular letter ] was misleading because it made no mention of the true reason , according to them , i.e. the withdrawal of the contract from ORG on security considerations ...", "It is a sad fact of life that in spite of the patient endeavours of the ORG there still remain those in GPE who hold deep hostility to the objectives and activities of the Agency .", "I have no doubt whatever that such attitudes existed within ORG in DATE , and possibly still do , and I am afraid that the assurances by [ ORG officials ] did nothing to persuade me to the contrary , when viewed against their overt activities in this case .", "Paradoxically this view gives credence to part of the evidence of [ the ORG official ] on the important issue of the true reason for the withdrawal of the contract from ORG .", "It is virtually inconceivable that a man who had risen to the eminence of Chairman of an important public body like ORG would conceal under a veil of untruths the making of what he saw as a perfectly justified and reasonable decision based on his concern for the safety and continued operation of a vital public utility , and in effect to lay a false trail to mislead those investigating the matter .", "CARDINAL factors persuade me that it is a possibility that he might act thus :", "( CARDINAL ) The attitude of quite unjustified mistrust and hostility towards the ORG which I have referred to , and which might greatly exaggerate his fears of an investigation ; and", "( CARDINAL ) NORP The problems arising from pursuing the uncharted course of obtaining a section CARDINAL certificate ...", "Therefore while ORG for DATE failed to acknowledge the true reason for its decision , according to it , and gave untrue reasons which would in normal circumstances lead to the inevitable conclusion that the true reason was illegal or so shameful as to merit concealment , the factors I have referred to leave me in a state of mind where I can accept the proposition that the security factor may have been the factor uppermost in [ the ORG official \u2019s ] mind when he made his decision .", "It must also be said that information did come to ORG from ORG at DATE and DATE . I do not know its exact nature , and of the apparently CARDINAL applications for clearance , I have only seen CARDINAL replies , of which a number ( I think CARDINAL ) appear not to give security clearance . And exactly when they arrived is difficult to say , but I think they may well have arrived in DATE which was around the time of the apparent change of heart .", "I do not know the exact nature of that security information , although I have a general picture , but I do know enough about it to realise that it may have been significant ...", "... It is impossible not to harbour suspicions since many of the actions taken by ORG give rise to suspicions and will do so in the mind of any reasonable person . Among other suspicious factors is indeed the fact that PERSON was assured that PERSON was still an acceptable contractor during the course of the hearing before him of the privilege claim . That was even more particularly so when coupled with the removal , after his judgment , of their names as prospective tenderers . Moreover , the second application for authorisation to [ recommend ] McW. on the basis of superior experience appears to have been an undoubted attempt to lay a false trail among the documents and records of ORG .", "In spite however of all those matters I have referred to , I am nonetheless not satisfied that the application for the section CARDINAL certificate by ORG was an abuse of the process as it is understood by the parties , nor that it was an act of fraud in the legal sense on the part of ORG .", "I am not satisfied that the security information received by [ the ORG official ] was not the deciding factor in the decision to withdraw the contract from ORG . While ORG \u2019s actions and attitudes can be roundly criticised ... , and are such that they leave considerable doubt in the matter , nevertheless they of themselves do not vitiate the making of the section CARDINAL certificate and do not in the event satisfy me that the application was in legal terms a fraudulent one .", "I believe that it is possible that [ the ORG official ] was unsure of his position when he received the ORG \u2019s response to the application for routine clearance of ORG \u2019s workers , and that rather than face up to the possible problems arising from a withdrawal of the contract on security grounds he decided to follow the course he did , i.e. to choose PERSON on the spurious grounds of their greater experience in the demolition of power stations .", "He no doubt expected that ORG would never discover that they were the lowest tenderers and when they did so and involved the ORG , it would seem that a decision was made to continue and elaborate upon the original false premise for choosing McW.", "CARDINAL of the great problems which is quite beyond my power to resolve is that PERSON insists that it previously had always received security clearance for workers in highly sensitive installations ...", "I have not been permitted to inspect the ORG response to the individual requests for clearance . I do not understand why persons who may have got clearance earlier , may have been refused in this case ... However , having regard to the evidence given and to the unchallenged affidavit of the Secretary of ORG about the effect of the ORG response , and indeed to those parts of the documents which I have been permitted to see , I must accept that , in response to some individuals at least , the response was unfavourable , and this may have been to such a degree as to justify the view that a serious security risk was involved if the contract was granted to PERSON ...", "... [ The ] heart of the matter was whether security information had in fact become available to ORG at the relevant time which would have justified its decision to withdraw the contract .... Had it transpired that no such information existed , then the application for the section CARDINAL certificate would have been exposed as bogus ...", "As I have already indicated , I have not seen that information in detail , but I am bound to accept the judgment of the Secretary of ORG that the information was such as to justify the decision . And I may add that those parts of the documents that I have seen confirm that view . When it was confirmed that such security information was made available , it was in my view reasonable for the ORG to accept that the ORG application was made in good faith ...", "[ The civil servant in ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ] ... could not have been expected to undertake an investigation similar to that which the ORG might have undertaken ... There was no machinery by which he could bring in other parties . There was no machinery by which he could interrogate ORG , or compel it to produce documents to him , except by the use of what one might describe as moral persuasion . Once he accepted that the application was made in good faith for genuine reasons , then he was bound to support it whatever view he might have taken of the follies and inconsistencies which were apparent .", "It is clear from this hearing that he was not going to get any acknowledgement from ORG or any of its officials that anything untoward had occurred , and he had no remit , as I indicated , to consult with any other person who might have alleged to the contrary , and if he had , he had no machinery of procedures to resolve the consequent dispute .", "I find it difficult to imagine how he could have adopted an inquisitorial role and cross - examined [ an ORG official ] about the contradictions and inconsistencies in ORG \u2019s case . All that he could do was to record what seemed to him to be relevant and to try to gather the facts by interview with [ the ORG official ] ...", "It seemed to me that the ORG acted with the utmost propriety in pursuing its own investigations into the central issue of security , and that the application to the Secretary of ORG was only processed further when the ORG were satisfied that there was a genuine security consideration involved in the case ...", "The Secretary of ORG [ in his affidavit to the court ] goes on to say ` having seen [ the ORG report on which [ the civil servant \u2019s ] submission had been based ] I was quite satisfied that there would have been a genuine risk to national security , public safety or public order , if the contract had been awarded to PERSON and that notwithstanding that a different reason had been given by ORG for not awarding the contract to the FAC , he felt satisfied that he could accept the assurance by ORG that the security issue had been the fundamental one from the outset ...", "It would be impossible for any court to hold that this was not a tenable view reached after due consideration of the submissions presented to him , and having regard to the fact that the consideration of what constitutes a risk to national security , public safety or public order , are matters very much within the exclusive competence of the Secretary of ORG to determine ...", "Much of the criticism of the [ Department ] arose from the fact that it did not appear to act in the role of court or tribunal , and to sift the evidence and follow up inconsistencies . As I have indicated , the procedure used was necessarily quite unsuitable for determining the real motives which lay behind the decision taken .", "However , once it is accepted that it was appropriate for ORG to seek a section CARDINAL certificate to justify its withdrawal of the contract from ORG , and that the procedures followed were lawful , and did not fall short of any legal requirement , and add to that the finding that the procedures were followed in good faith and with proper attention and consideration , then clearly it is not open to the court to interfere by way of judicial review .", "It is not the function of judicial review to re - try issues . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge expressed sympathy for the position of the ORG and the civil servants at the ORG , and again criticised the ORG for misleading the other parties to the dispute over DATE . He concluded :", "\u201c However , I am satisfied that there was sufficient evidence , honestly and competently presented to the Secretary of ORG in accordance with reasonable procedures , and carefully considered by the Secretary of ORG to justify the decision taken by him , which decision is therefore unimpeachable in this court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Senior Counsel advised the ORG that an appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE would not succeed . The section ORG ) certificate being valid , the applicant \u2019s complaint to the ORG did not receive further investigation and hence no settlement attempts were effected or county court proceedings taken under LAW ( GPE ) Act DATE .", "CARDINAL . In or about DATE the applicants were informed by a building contractor that he had obtained a contract with ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to build premises at the site of ORG in ORG GPE . The contractor invited the applicants to tender for the joinery subcontract . Their tender was accepted and they were advised by the contractor that they could start the work , subject to security clearance from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants supplied their names , addresses and dates of birth to the contractor , who forwarded them to ORG . DATE they were informed that they had not been granted security clearance and that they could not therefore be awarded the subcontract . The recommendation that security clearance be refused emanated from ORG of ORG and Personnel ( \u201c the DFP \u201d ) , a government department in GPE , which based its recommendation on information supplied by the ORG ( including officers of its Special Branch ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants have no criminal convictions of any kind , except for minor motoring offences . They state that they are not and never have been involved in any criminal or terrorist activity and know of no good reason why they should have been refused security clearance . They believe that they were discriminated against by the ORG on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion . In broad terms they would be perceived as having nationalist views , although they are not members of any political party and are not engaged in any form of political activity . They wrote to the ORG through their solicitors requesting an explanation as to why they had been refused clearance to be employed on this contract , but the ORG , following re - examination by the DFP Security Branch of the information originally supplied by the police , refused to provide an explanation .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought the assistance of ORG for GPE and in DATE they made a ORG complaint to ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) alleging that the contractor and the ORG had discriminated against them contrary to LAW . The applicants had in the past been stopped and mistaken by members of the security forces for different persons of the same name , and they suspected that this was a case of mistaken identity .", "CARDINAL . The contractor resisted the complaint on the grounds that he had been willing to offer employment to the applicants but that the ORG had not been prepared to give them security clearance . By notice of appearance of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG resisted the complaint on the grounds that it had not done anything which would constitute an act of unlawful discrimination under the LAW and , in the alternative , that \u201c any act of the respondent in relation to the applicant was an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security , and thus any such act is not an act to which the [ CARDINAL LAW ] or ORG ( GPE ) Act DATE apply \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the first ground relied upon by the ORG , the ORG applied for an interlocutory hearing on the questions whether it should be dismissed from the proceedings , whether the applicants sought employment from it within the meaning of the LAW and whether in the circumstances it could have discriminated against the applicants contrary to section CARDINAL of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On TIME of the interlocutory hearing , CARDINAL DATE , the ORG withdrew its application . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG ordered the ORG to provide discovery of all relevant documents relating to the matter . It also ordered the ORG to provide further particulars of its case , inter alia , requiring the ORG to specify the national security grounds relied upon in relation to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG for GPE issued a certificate pursuant to section ORG ) of the CARDINAL Act to the effect that the decision to refuse the applicants\u2019 admission to the site of the contract was done for the purpose of safeguarding national security . Counsel advised the applicants that the effect of issuing the certificate was to bar the ORG from determining the complaint in the ORG favour . In view of the fact that an award of costs could have been made against the applicants if they had unreasonably proceeded to a hearing in the face of the certificate , they withdrew their application , which was accordingly dismissed by the ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
