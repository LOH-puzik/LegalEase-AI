THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of P1-1;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The second applicant company is the registered owner of a plot of QUANTITY of agricultural land in GPE . The first applicant company was its predecessor in title . The owners of a property adjacent to the land , Mr. and Mrs. PERSON ( \u201c the PERSON \u201d ) occupied the land under a grazing agreement until DATE . On DATE a chartered surveyor acting for the applicants wrote to the ORG noting that the grazing agreement was about to expire and requiring them to vacate the land . In DATE the applicants refused a request for a further grazing agreement for DATE because they anticipated seeking planning permission for the development of all or part of the land and considered that continued grazing might damage the prospects of obtaining such permission .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding the requirement to vacate the land at the expiry of the DATE agreement , the ORG remained in occupation at all times , continuing to use it for grazing . No request to vacate the land or to pay for the grazing which was taking place was made . If it had been , the evidence was that the PERSON would happily have paid .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE an agreement was reached whereby the applicants agreed to sell to the PERSON the standing crop of grass on the land for \u00a3 MONEY . The cut was completed by DATE . In DATE an inquiry was made of the applicants as to whether the PERSON could take another cut of hay or be granted a further grazing agreement . No reply to this letter or to subsequent letters sent in DATE was received from the applicants and thereafter the PERSON made no further attempt to contact the applicants . From DATE until DATE the PERSON continued to use the whole of the disputed land for farming without the permission of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , Mr PERSON registered cautions at ORG against the applicant ORG title on the ground that he had obtained title by adverse possession .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant companies issued an originating summons in the High Court seeking cancellation of the cautions . On DATE the applicant companies issued further proceedings seeking possession of the disputed land .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON challenged the applicant ORG claims under LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) which provides that a person can not bring an action to recover any land after the expiration of DATE of adverse possession by another . They also relied on LAW , which applied at the relevant time and which provided that , after the expiry of the CARDINAL-year period , the registered proprietor was deemed to hold the land in trust for the squatter .", "CARDINAL . Judgment was given in favour of the PERSON on DATE ( [ CARDINAL]Ch CARDINAL ) . Mr Justice PERSON held that since the PERSON enjoyed factual possession of the land from DATE , and adverse possession took effect from DATE , the applicant ORG title was extinguished pursuant to LAW , and the PERSON were entitled to be registered as proprietors of the land . At the conclusion of his CARDINAL-page judgment , PERSON remarked that the result he had reached did not accord with justice and could not be justified by practical considerations : the justification advanced for the right to acquire title to land by adverse possession \u2013 namely the avoidance of uncertainty \u2013 had in his view little relevance to the use of registered land where the owner was readily identifiable by inspecting the register of the relevant title at ORG . The fact that an owner who had sat on his rights for DATE should be deprived of the land was in his view \u201c illogical and disproportionate \u201d : as he expressed the point , \u201c it does seem draconian to the owner and a windfall for the squatter that , just because the owner has taken no step to evict a squatter for DATE , the owner should lose QUANTITY of land to the squatter with no compensation whatsoever \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant companies appealed and on DATE , ORG reversed the ORG decision on the ground that the PERSON did not have the necessary intention to possess the land , and the applicant companies were therefore not \u201c dispossessed \u201d of it within the meaning of LAW ( [ CARDINAL Civ CARDINAL , [ CARDINAL CARDINAL ) . Although this conclusion was sufficient to dispose of the appeal , CARDINAL members of ORG went on to address the question whether the ORG loss of title to the land could also have given rise to a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL as applied in domestic law by LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice Mummery held that LAW did not impinge on the relevant provisions of LAW , which did not deprive a person of his possessions or interfere with his peaceful enjoyment of them but only deprived a person of his right of access to the courts for the purpose of recovering property if he had delayed the institution of his legal proceedings for DATE or more after being dispossessed by another . The extinction of the applicants\u2019 title was not , in his view , a deprivation of possessions nor a confiscatory measure for which payment of compensation would be appropriate , but simply a logical and pragmatic consequence of the barring of the right to bring an action after the expiration of the limitation period . In the alternative , Mummery L.J found that any deprivation was justified in the public interest , the conditions laid down in the CARDINAL Act being reasonably required to avoid the risk of injustice in the adjudication of stale claims and as ensuring certainty of title : those conditions were not disproportionate , the period of DATE being reasonable and not imposing an excessively difficult burden on the landowner .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON took as his starting point that limitation periods were in principle not incompatible with the PERSON and that the process whereby a person would be barred from enforcing rights by the passage of time was clearly acknowledged by the LAW . This position obtained , in his view , even though limitation periods both limited the right of access to the courts and in some circumstances had the effect of depriving persons of property rights , whether real or personal , or of damages : there was thus nothing inherently incompatible as between LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON appealed to ORG , which , on DATE , allowed their appeal and restored the order of ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL ) . Lord PERSON , with whom Lord PERSON of ORG and Lord PERSON agreed , held that the PERSON did have \u201c possession \u201d of the land in the ordinary sense of the word , and therefore the applicant companies had been \u201c dispossessed \u201d of it within the meaning of LAW . There was no inconsistency between a squatter being willing to pay the paper owner if asked and his being in possession in the meantime . Lord PERSON referred to LAW only to note that there was no ambiguity in LAW which called for resolution .", "CARDINAL . Lord GPE of GPE , agreeing with Lord PERSON , made the following statement in the course of his judgment :", "\u201c [ The PERSON ] sought rights to graze or cut grass on the land after DATE , and were quite prepared to pay . When ORG failed to respond they did what any other farmer in their position would have done : they continued to farm the land . They were not at fault . But the result of ORG \u2019s inaction was that they enjoyed the full use of the land without payment for DATE . As if that were not gain enough , they are then rewarded by obtaining title to this considerable area of valuable land without any obligation to compensate the former owner in any way at all . In the case of unregistered land , and in DATE before registration became the norm , such a result could no doubt be justified as avoiding protracted uncertainty where the title to land lay . But where land is registered it is difficult to see any justification for a legal rule which compels such an apparently unjust result , and even harder to see why the party gaining title should not be required to pay some compensation at least to the party losing it . It is reassuring to learn that LAW CARDINAL has addressed the risk that a registered owner may lose his title through inadvertence . But the main provisions of that Act have not yet been brought into effect , and even if they had it would not assist GPE , whose title had been lost before the passing of the LAW . While I am satisfied that the appeal must be allowed for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend , this is a conclusion which I ( like the judge [ PERSON ] ... ) \u2018 arrive at with no LAW . \u201d [ PERSON ( ORG and another v. PERSON and another [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL , at CARDINAL ]", "CARDINAL . NORP The question whether the result was incompatible with the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW was not pursued before ORG , it being conceded that LAW DATE had no retrospective effect . However , in his judgment Lord Hope of PERSON , who also agreed with Lord PERSON on the reasons for dismissing the appeal , observed that the question under the Convention :", "\u201c .... is not an easy one , as one would have expected the law - in the context of a statutory regime where compensation is not available - to lean in favour of the protection of a registered proprietor against the actions of persons who can not show a competing title on the register . Fortunately ....... a much more rigorous regime has now been enacted in Schedule DATE Act . Its effect will be to make it much harder for a squatter who is in possession of registered land to obtain title against the wishes of the proprietor . The unfairness in the old regime which this case has demonstrated lies not in the absence of compensation , although that is an important factor , but in the lack of safeguards against oversight or inadvertence on the part of the registered proprietor . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , a consolidating LAW , provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) No action shall be brought by any person to recover any land after the expiration of DATE from the date on which the right of action accrued to him or , if it first accrued to some person through whom he claims , to that person ...", "( CARDINAL ) Part I of Schedule CARDINAL to this Act contains provisions for determining the date of accrual of rights of action to recover land in the cases there mentioned . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c Where the person bringing an action to recover land , or some person through whom he claims , has been in possession of the land , and has while entitled to the land been dispossessed or discontinued his possession , the right of action shall be treated as having accrued on DATE of the dispossession or discontinuance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of unregistered land , section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provides that , on the expiration of the limitation period regulating the recovery of land , the title of the paper owner is extinguished . In the case of registered land , section GPE ) of LAW DATE provides that , on the expiry of the limitation period the title is not extinguished but the registered proprietor is deemed to hold the land thereafter in trust for the squatter .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the law on limitation periods in its report of DATE ( Cmnd CARDINAL ) . It commented negatively on the ORG practice of granting an implied licence to the would - be adverse possessor , which had the effect of stopping time running against the owner , and proposed no change to the existing limitation periods , and agreed that the expiration of the limitation period should serve to extinguish the claimant \u2019s title .", "CARDINAL . A Law Commission Consultation Paper on Limitation of Actions in DATE ( Law Com CARDINAL ) gave a number of general policy aims of the law on limitations . The Consultation Paper noted that defendants have a legitimate interest in having cases brought to court reasonably promptly as evidence may not be available indefinitely , and because defendants should be able to rely on their assumed entitlement to enjoy an unchallenged right . The ORG , too , has an interest in ensuring that claims are made and determined within a reasonable time in order to deliver a fair trial , and as guarantor of legal certainty . Finally , limitation periods were seen to have a salutary effect on plaintiffs in encouraging them to bring claims reasonably promptly .", "CARDINAL . A separate Law Commission Consultative Document on land registration in DATE ( prepared with ORG ; PERSON ) noted that although the original intention of the system of land registration was to apply the principles of unregistered land to a registered format , there were certain areas where this was not wholly true . CARDINAL example given was the position of the rights of adverse possessors ( section GPE ) of LAW DATE was referred to ) . The Consultative Document set out and commented on CARDINAL particularly cogent reasons often given for the law on adverse possession : ( i ) Because it is part of the law on limitation of actions . It noted :", "\u201c ... because adverse possession is an aspect of the law of limitation , it is of course customary to account for it , at least in part , in terms of the policy of limitation statutes generally , namely to prevent defendants from stale claims and to encourage defendants not to sleep on their rights . However , adverse possession does not merely bar claims . Its effect is positive : \u2018 a squatter does in the end get title by his possession and the indirect operation of LAW .. \u2019 . This can only be justified by factors over and above those which explain the law on limitation ... this particular justification has much greater force in relation to unregistered land than it does for land with registered title . Unregistered title ultimately depends on possession . It therefore behoves a landowner to be vigilant to protect that possession and not to sleep on his or her rights . ... where title is registered ( ... ) the basis of title is primarily the fact of registration rather than possession . Registration confers title because the registration of a person as proprietor of land of itself vests in him or her the relevant legal estate ... \u201d", "( ii ) Because if land and its ownership are out of kilter , the land may become unmarketable . Where the registered owner has disappeared , and can not be traced , and a squatter takes possession , the doctrine of adverse possession \u201c does at least ensure that in such cases land remains in commerce and is not rendered sterile \u201d . Where there have been dealings \u201c off the register \u201d , such as where a farmer agrees to a land swap with a neighbour under a \u201c gentleman \u2019s agreement \u201d but does not register the change , \u201c adverse possession fulfils a useful function \u201d . ( iii ) Because in case of mistake the innocent but mistaken squatter of land may have incurred expenditure . In such circumstances adverse possession can be justified on grounds of hardship , and there are parallels with the principles of proprietary estoppel . ( iv ) Because it facilitates and cheapens investigation of title to land . ORG accepted this last reason as being very strong for unregistered land , but considered that for registered land , where title depends on the contents of the register rather than possession , it was not applicable .", "CARDINAL . ORG proposed , provisionally , that the system of adverse possession as it applied to registered land should be recast to reflect the principles of title registration , and that it should be limited to very few , exceptional cases .", "CARDINAL . Two Reports , on Limitation of Actions ( Law Com CARDINAL ) and on registered land ( Law Com CARDINAL ) , followed the Consultation Papers , and were published in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG on LAW recommended that the general limitation period for actions in respect of land should be DATE . It added that if the proposals made on registered land in LAW were accepted , the proposal would relate only to interests in unregistered land ( and unregistrable interests in registered land ) .", "CARDINAL . The Report on registered land ( Law Com CARDINAL ) proposed that a squatter should be able to apply to be registered as proprietor after CARDINAL years\u2019 adverse possession , and that the registered proprietor should be notified of that application . If the proprietor objected to the registration , the application by the adverse possessor for registration would be rejected . The registered proprietor would then be required to regularise the position ( for example by evicting the squatter ) within DATE , failing which the squatter would be entitled to be registered as proprietor .", "CARDINAL . LAW CARDINAL , which does not have retroactive effect , implemented the proposals in LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Deputy Judge PERSON in ORG gave judgment in the case of ORG v. ORG , DATE ) . The case concerned a licensee who had remained in possession of registered land for DATE after the expiry of his licence . Applying the judgment of ORG in the present case , the judge found that under LANGUAGE law as it stood up to the entry into force of LAW DATE , the registered owner of the land lost all claim to it . However , on analysing the facts on a Convention basis , he found that there was no real public or general interest in the law on adverse possession in the case of registered land , and that the adverse consequences for the landowner were disproportionate . By re - interpreting the relevant legislation in accordance with LAW , the judge found that the claim by the former licensee to have acquired the disputed land failed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
