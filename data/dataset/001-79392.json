The applicants were born in DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . They were employed by the construction company ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the company \u201d ) DATE and DATE on a time - wage basis .", "CARDINAL . The company , being a member of the ORG , was bound by a collective labour agreement , ORG ( ORG ) , concluded between LOC ( ORG , hereinafter \u201c the Union \u201d ) and the ORG . The relevant local branch of the ORG in the instant case was the GPE branch , ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , CARDINAL employees in the company carried out work covered by the labour agreement . CARDINAL of these workers were members of the Union whereas the CARDINAL applicants were not members of the ORG or of any other trade union .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , subsection f CARDINAL of the collective agreement , as it stood at the relevant time , the local branch had the right to inspect on a continuous basis wage conditions by measuring piecework ( ackordsarbete ) and result work ( resultatarbete ) , as well as monitoring time - based work ( tidl\u00f6nearbete ) . If inspections were carried out in accordance with the collective agreement , the local branch had the right to reimbursement of the costs involved on the basis of a fee of PERCENT of the worker \u2019s wages . The employer was obliged to deduct this amount from the worker \u2019s wages and to supply the local branch with the information necessary for the inspection work .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG concluded an accord pursuant to which a worker organised in a trade union other than the Union could request his or her employer not to deduct the inspection fee , with the result that the ORG would no longer have the right to request either information or the payment of a fee in respect of that worker . In a subsequent dispute between the ORG and the ORG over the interpretation of the accord , an out - of - court settlement was reached on DATE to the effect that it applied to all workers belonging to a trade union other than the Union .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the company and ORG concluded an agreement concerning the inspection work . The agreement gave details of the work and specified , inter alia , that it was the company \u2019s responsibility to provide ORG with the wage information and to deduct fees from the wages of the workers and pay them to ORG CARDINAL times a year . The information was to include the place of work , the names and social security numbers of the workers and TIME and net wages .", "CARDINAL . The applicants requested to be exempt from the deductions , which in their case concerned fees for monitoring the wages for TIME work . The company complied with their requests , stopped paying the fees to ORG and did not provide it with the above - mentioned wage information concerning the applicants . ORG insisted on payment and initiated formal local negotiations . These were held on DATE and DATE . However , no solution was reached , either in the local negotiations or in the subsequent central negotiations between ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG eventually brought the case before ORG ) , seeking a declaratory judgment to the effect that the company was not obliged to levy the monitoring fees in question . It argued that the inspection of wages , in so far as it did not concern the technical measuring of piecework , aimed at securing the observance of the provisions of the collective labour agreement and was therefore part of the general activities of the Union . Moreover , the DATE and DATE reports of ORG allegedly showed that the inspection fees greatly exceeded the costs of the work and that the surplus was used for general union activities . Consequently , the corresponding deductions from the applicants\u2019 wages were tantamount to forced union membership or , at least , involved an unacceptable compulsion to join the ORG or another trade union . The conduct thus violated their negative freedom of association under LAW as well as under domestic law . Furthermore , since the applicants did not share the political values of the Union , the levy on their wages also violated their rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the applicants , Mr Evaldsson and Mr Hodell , were heard by ORG . They submitted that they opposed the deductions because they did not think that the monitoring work was of any use to them and considered the deductions an unnecessary expense . Allegedly , they also submitted that they felt that the deductions were unjust .", "CARDINAL . The Union disagreed with the ORG , arguing that the monitoring fees could not be seen as tantamount to forced membership of the ORG , such membership being secured through the payment of a separate membership fee . The system of monitoring fees did not involve a compulsion to join a trade union . Moreover , the applicants had not expressed any ideological reasons for their unwillingness to contribute to the monitoring work . The ORG claimed that , contrary to the ORG allegation , the DATE and DATE reports of ORG showed that the proceeds of that work had not contributed to general union activities but that , in fact , the monitoring had been run at a loss . Furthermore , the inspection work was strictly separated , economically and otherwise , from the other activities of ORG . Finally , arguing that the positive aspect of the freedom of association under LAW was stronger than its negative counterpart , the ORG claimed that a ban on the levying of monitoring fees on unorganised workers\u2019 wages would violate the positive rights of its members , as this could induce members to leave the ORG in order to avoid paying the fees .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the ORG claims . It referred to several of its previous judgments concerning various types of measurement and monitoring fees . In a case from DATE ( DATE nr CARDINAL ) , the court had found that the monitoring of time - based wages was wholly different from the measuring of piecework , as no special action had to be taken to establish the amount and type of work performed . Instead , the inspection of time - based wages rather aimed at securing the observance of the collective labour agreement and also served as a basis for the statistics used by the Union in wage negotiations with the employers . Consequently , the monitoring benefited the general union activities and the fees contributed financially to those activities . The court had therefore concluded that the levying of fees on the wages of members of ORG for monitoring work carried out by another trade union involved a violation of those worker \u2019s positive freedom of association , as they would have to resign from their own organisation in order to avoid contributing to both organisations .", "ORG stated that there was no reason to come to a different conclusion in the instant case as to the nature of the monitoring work . Thus , from the point of view of association law , there was no reason to distinguish between monitoring work and general union activities . Having reached that conclusion , the court found no reason to determine whether the monitoring fees generated a surplus which contributed to other union activities .", "However , the situation in the instant case was different from the DATE case in that the applicants were not subjected to pressure to leave their organisation . Instead , the question was to what extent they were protected by a right to negative freedom of association . ORG noted that the negative freedom of association under domestic law was exclusively based on the Convention . It referred to ORG case - law and drew the conclusion that only the core of the negative freedom of association was protected under LAW , meaning that a person must have been subjected to a certain measure of force or at least strong pressure to join an organisation in order to give rise to a violation of LAW .", "ORG initially concluded that the monitoring fee deductions did not entail membership of the ORG and that no pressure had been exerted to compel the applicants to join the ORG against their will .", "It further found that the fact that the applicants , through payment of the monitoring fee , indirectly supported the activities of the Union did not in itself amount to forced membership , since being a member of the ORG also entailed certain other duties , such as loyalty to its objectives and payment of a membership fee . The situation would have been different if the applicants would to some extent have been associated with the ORG \u2019s ideology as a result of the monitoring fee deductions . However , the fee in issue was deducted in accordance with their employer \u2019s obligations under the collective labour agreement , and it was , accordingly , difficult to see a link with the ORG \u2019s ideology . In this connection , the court also referred to the evidence given before it by PERSON and PERSON . While it questioned whether the grounds for their position in the case could have a bearing on their negative freedom of association , the court nevertheless found that there was no indication that they opposed the deduction of the fees because they took exception to union activities in general or to the ideology of the Union .", "ORG went on to state that , while the applicants , through the fee deductions , contributed to the general activities of the Union , they were not treated any differently from ORG members as concerns the monitoring . In order to monitor the observance of the collective labour agreement , the work was carried out with respect to all employees affected by the agreement , whether belonging to a trade union or not . Noting that it could appear offensive to an unorganised worker to have to contribute to the work , the court stated that it was not without importance that the unorganised worker in fact obtained something in return for the fee paid .", "ORG further noted that , theoretically , the applicants could be inclined to join a trade union other than the Union in order to avoid the wage deduction for the monitoring fee . It found , however , that it was not very realistic that an employee would regard the wage deduction as a particular incentive to do so .", "ORG concluded that all the above considerations indicated that the deductions did not breach the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW . As to the main issue to be determined \u2013 whether the monitoring fee was intended as a measure to pressure them to join the Union \u2013 the court could not find that it had any such coercive effect . As the fee was not tantamount to forced membership of the Union and had not influenced or forced the applicants to join the Union , the company had been obliged to make a deduction from their wages in accordance with the collective labour agreement .", "CARDINAL . Freedom of association is guaranteed in the NORP constitution . LAW , LAW CARDINAL of ORG ( Regeringsformen ) provides in its relevant parts :", "\u201c In relation to the public administration , every citizen is guaranteed :", "CARDINAL . freedom of expression : the freedom to communicate information and to express ideas , opinions and emotions whether orally , in writing , in pictorial representations or in any other way ; ...", "CARDINAL . freedom of association : the freedom to unite with others for public or private purposes ; ... \u201d", "LAW , LAW protects , inter alia , the negative aspect of freedom of association .

In relation to the public administration , he is furthermore protected against coercion to participate in a meeting for the formation of opinion or in a demonstration or other manifestation of opinion , or to belong to a political association , religious congregation or other association for opinions referred to in the first sentence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act on Co - Determination at Work ( Lag om medbest\u00e4mmande i arbetslivet , SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL , hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) guarantees the right of employers and employees to form , belong to and work for labour market organisations . The right of association is further protected by LAW CARDINAL , which forbids any recourse to action against someone on the opposing side for having exercised this right or in order not to exercise it .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act gives ORG and GPE organisations as well as individual employers a right of negotiation in regard to matters concerning the relationship between employers and employees . It does not provide for any right of negotiation for the individual employees , who are obliged to exercise their powers through the trade unions .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of LAW , a collective labour agreement is binding not only on the employer \u2019s and employee \u2019s organisations but also on their members , i.e. companies and individual workers . Moreover , in practice , the collective agreement is also of significance for employees who are not trade union members in that it has a normative effect . This entails that the individual work contracts are considered to have the same contents as the collective agreement unless the parties to the contract have expressly agreed otherwise .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINAL of LAW , an employer and an employee can not conclude a legally valid agreement which contradicts the collective agreement by which they are bound . This means that an agreement contradicting the collective agreement is automatically null and void . While contracts with less favourable conditions than the collective agreement are normally invalid , the validity of contracts with more favourable conditions depends on an interpretation of the agreement in question . As the instant provision formally only prohibits an employer from concluding contradictory contracts with members of the trade union which is party to the collective agreement , it is possible for the employer to conclude such contracts with employees who are not members of the relevant trade union . However , most collective agreements are based on the presumption that an employer does not have a right to conclude such contracts with non - member workers . Consequently , while the contracts in question remain valid , the employer may be liable to pay damages to the trade union .", "CARDINAL . Monitoring of wages for TIME work is conducted in a manner determined by the employer and the local union branch . It normally involves the examination of documents provided by the employer and personal visits by the union \u2019s representatives to the employer . If a mistake is discovered , clarifications or corrections can be made by telephone or letter . In some cases , formal negotiations are required .", "CARDINAL . Under the terms of ORG , the local union branch is entitled to a fee as compensation for the costs entailed by the monitoring work . The fee PERCENT of the employee \u2019s wages DATE is deducted by the employer from the wages of each individual worker .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , a member of the ORG pays MONEY ( SEK ) per year in monitoring fees in addition to the union membership fee of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The largest competing trade union , the ORG union , does not have a monitoring system . The ORG therefore has a de facto monopoly in this field .", "CARDINAL . The regulation regarding the monitoring of wages was incorporated in the DATE LAW . Previously , workers paid time - based wages had not been subjected to deductions for monitoring fees . According to the applicants , the purpose was that workers paid time - based wages , as an act of solidarity with workers carrying out piecework , should contribute to the whole inspection system . At the material time , the majority of the workers performed piecework , the measurement of which was costly and time - consuming . The fee for monitoring time - based wages was thus not primarily introduced as reimbursement for the service in question , but as a means of supporting the measurement of piecework wages .", "CARDINAL . DATE , PERCENT of workers are paid time - based wages , which is almost the opposite ratio compared to the situation in DATE . In general , the monitoring of wages is now computerised and based on information provided by the employer .", "CARDINAL . According to a statement of CARDINAL DATE by PERSON , former division manager at ORG , a review of the still existing audit material for DATE showed that , as a result of the monitoring work , wages had been adjusted upwards for CARDINAL workers , of which CARDINAL were not Union members .", "CARDINAL . The activities of ORG , the local union branch , are divided into CARDINAL parts : branch activities ( inter alia , wage negotiations , union agitation and political work ) and business activities ( i.e. the inspection work , comprised of the monitoring of time - based wages and the measurement of piecework ) . Branch or non - profit activities are to be paid for by means of union membership fees . Revenue from the business activities , which is subject to value - added tax , should cover the costs of such activities .", "CARDINAL . The parties have submitted various documents to the ORG containing information on the revenue and cost of the activities of ORG and the ORG branch . The following information has been compiled from these documents .", "CARDINAL . According to the DATE report for DATE , ORG had CARDINAL permanent employees ( CARDINAL officials and CARDINAL administrative personnel ) on DATE . Before ORG , ORG stated that the number of persons involved in inspection work ( monitoring and measuring ) during the period relevant to the present case , DATE , was the same as at DATE , and that the DATE report named CARDINAL officials who had been occupied with this activity . However , the DATE report CARDINAL , in addition to the head of the relevant department , CARDINAL officials who were dealing with such work , CARDINAL of whom had been doing so only until DATE . It thus appears that , during the relevant period , CARDINAL officials were involved in inspection work , i.e. PERCENT of the total number of officials . Incidentally , the DATE report for DATE indicates that , at DATE , the total workforce of ORG remained the same .", "CARDINAL . Byggettan \u2019s DATE reports for DATE contain statements of accounts where its business activities , i.e. the inspection work , are separated from its branch activities . According to the statement of accounts for DATE , ORG \u2019s branch activities showed a loss of MONEY , whereas the inspection work recorded a profit of MONEY . The total revenue from the inspection work amounted to MONEY , the operational and administrative costs of this sector of activity were SEK CARDINAL.CARDINAL million and the write - offs of movables came to SEK CARDINAL.CARDINAL million . Whereas it is shown , in a footnote to the statement of accounts , that , of the revenue from the inspection work , SEK CARDINAL.CARDINAL million derived from monitoring fees , there is no such differentiation as regards the costs .", "However , in another footnote , information is provided on ORG \u2019s costs , which are given separately for the branch activities and the inspection work . The total costs for wages and remunerations in DATE amounted to MONEY , of which MONEY ( i.e. PERCENT ) were attributed to the inspection work . The total amount of pension payments was MONEY , of which MONEY ( or PERCENT ) were a burden on the latter activities . The remaining costs , including offices , travels , administration and social contributions , totalled MONEY , of which MONEY ( PERCENT ) were attributed to the inspection work .", "CARDINAL . In submissions by ORG to ORG and by the Government in the present proceedings , it has been claimed that the result of the inspection work has to be corrected to the extent that a reimbursement was received from the pension fund of ORG . In the statement of accounts for DATE , a reimbursement of MONEY was recorded for the inspection work . As this reimbursement in effect reduced the costs , the amount has to be deducted from the recorded profit of MONEY in order to arrive at the real financial result of the inspection work . Thus , in the ORG \u2019s view , the pension payments should be recorded as a cost , whereas the pension fund reimbursement should not be considered as revenue . Consequently , in DATE , that sector of activity was actually run at a loss of MONEY .", "The applicants , however , disagree with the above calculation . They have stated that , throughout DATE , the branches of ORG have made contributions to the pension fund , whose accumulated assets are used to honour the ORG \u2019s pension commitments towards its retired personnel . Thus , when making pension payments , the ORG branches are not the actual payer but are making the payments on behalf of the pension fund , presumably because the fund does not have an administrative division of its own to handle such payments . Accordingly , the applicants claim that , when determining the actual DATE result of the inspection work , the pension transactions should only be taken into account to the extent that the fund reimbursements differ from the pension payments . In DATE , the reimbursement received by ORG exceeded the pension payments by MONEY . The financial result of DATE should thus be reduced by only that amount and the recorded profit of MONEY consequently remains virtually unchanged .", "In the statements of accounts of ORG GPE branch for DATE , pension fund reimbursements have been recorded as revenue and pension payments as costs . Consequently , only the differences between reimbursements and payments have affected the DATE results .", "CARDINAL . The statements of accounts in the DATE reports of ORG for DATE , CARDINAL and DATE contain figures which give a picture similar to DATE . In DATE , the revenue from the inspection work was SEK CARDINAL.CARDINAL million ( of which the monitoring fees came to SEK CARDINAL.CARDINAL million ) and the recorded profit of that sector of activity amounted to FAC . ORG received a pension fund reimbursement of CARDINAL SEK CARDINAL.CARDINAL million . If the result is corrected with this amount , in the manner claimed by the ORG , the profit would turn into a loss of MONEY . However , the reimbursement exceeded the pension payments by QUANTITY . If pension transactions were altogether excluded from the calculation , as effectively suggested by the applicants , the profit would be halved and amount to SEK CARDINAL.CARDINAL million . PERCENT of the wage costs , PERCENT of the pension payments and PERCENT of the other costs of DATE were attributed to the inspection work .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the inspection work revenue was MONEY ( of which the monitoring fees amounted to MONEY ) and the recorded profit was MONEY . A pension fund reimbursement of MONEY was received which , if allowed to correct the result in full , would change the latter into a loss of SEK CARDINAL.CARDINAL million . However , as the reimbursement exceeded the pension payments by MONEY , the profit would remain at MONEY if pension transactions were not taken into account . PERCENT of the wage costs , PERCENT of the pension payments and PERCENT of the other costs were attributed to the inspection work .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the inspection work revenue was MONEY ( of which the monitoring fees came to MONEY ) and the recorded profit was MONEY . A pension fund reimbursement of MONEY was received which , if correcting the result , would reduce the profit to MONEY . However , as the reimbursement exceeded the pension payments by MONEY , the profit would be MONEY if pension transactions were not taken into account . PERCENT of the wage costs , PERCENT of the pension payments and PERCENT of the other costs were attributed to the inspection work .", "CARDINAL . NORP The budgets for DATE and DATE have been made available to the ORG by the parties .", "CARDINAL . In its budget for DATE , ORG estimated that the monitoring work would cost SEK CARDINAL.CARDINAL million and that the direct costs of the inspection unit ( dealing with both monitoring of time - based wages and measuring of piecework ) would amount to FAC . The projected revenue from the inspection work was SEK CARDINAL million . It thus appears that the costs of the monitoring work accounted for CARDINAL of the inspection costs . However , as can be seen from the above - mentioned figures presented in the DATE report for DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the monitoring fees\u2019 share of the inspection revenue came to CARDINAL ( MONEY out of a recorded total of MONEY ) . That share was approximately the same in DATE , CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The budgets for DATE give the estimated total costs of the various units of ORG . In DATE , the total projected costs of all sectors of activity were SEK CARDINAL.CARDINAL million . The monitoring unit had a budget of FAC . million and the wages and contracts unit ( the largest unit of ORG , which , according to the description in the budget , was dealing with , inter alia , the measurement of piecework , wage negotiations and matters concerning workers\u2019 co - determination , the work environment and safety ) had a budget of MONEY . It is not possible to discern , from the material available to the Court , how much of the latter unit \u2019s budgeted costs related to the measuring work . Furthermore , as an unknown portion of ORG \u2019s general administrative costs would presumably have to be attributed to monitoring and measuring , the total budgeted costs for the CARDINAL types of inspection work can not be established .", "However , the costs of the inspection work according to the official results for DATE appear to be considerably higher than the budgeted costs for that activity . Thus , the statement of accounts for DATE attributes SEK CARDINAL in operational and administrative costs and write - offs to the inspection work , which corresponds to PERCENT of the grand total of MONEY . If , as claimed by the Government , an amount corresponding to that DATE \u2019s pension fund reimbursement is to be added as an actual cost , the official costs attributed to the inspection work rise to PERCENT of the total costs .", "CARDINAL . In the budget for DATE , the projected total costs of ORG were MONEY , while those pertaining to the monitoring unit and the wages and contracts unit were MONEY , respectively . DATE budget estimated the total costs at MONEY . Both the monitoring unit and the new wages unit ( responsible , inter alia , for measuring work ) had a budget of MONEY . In DATE , the budgeted total costs were MONEY and those pertaining to the monitoring unit and the wages unit were MONEY and CARDINAL , respectively .", "CARDINAL . A chart compiled by Mr PERSON , Deputy Head of Finance at the Union , and submitted to ORG , contains the results of the monitoring and measuring activities of all CARDINAL branches of the Union . According to the chart , ORG recorded a positive result in CARDINAL out of DATE presented and had an accumulated profit of MONEY during the period . If corrected with the reimbursements received from the pension fund , the accumulated profit would amount to MONEY . However , the chart shows a negative overall result for CARDINAL of the branches . As a consequence , the accumulated DATE result of the inspection work of all the branches of the Union was a loss of MONEY , or DATE if the result is corrected with the contributions made by the branches to the pension fund and the reimbursements received from that fund during DATE a loss of MONEY .", "It should be noted that the chart in question does not provide any information on the actual pension payments made by the ORG branches , nor how the DATE costs had been assigned between the inspection work and the GPE other activities . The statements of accounts of the GPE branch for DATE show , however , that that branch allocated the costs in much the same way as ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a statement of DATE , made in regard to the present case and submitted to ORG , Mr PERSON gave the following information on the monitoring activities of ORG in DATE .
