CARDINAL of DATE , known as the \u201c PERSON \u201d , provides for the pooling of hunting grounds within ACCAs . The creation of an ORG in each municipality is compulsory in CARDINAL of the ninetythree d\u00e9partements of metropolitan GPE excluding ORG , ORG and GPE , including in ORG ; in the remainder of those CARDINAL d\u00e9partements it is optional . Landowners whose property forms part of the hunting grounds of an ORG in this way automatically become members of the association . They lose their exclusive hunting rights over their own land but have the right to hunt throughout the area covered by the ORG .", "However , the owners of land with a surface area above a certain threshold may object to the inclusion of their land in the ORG \u2019s hunting grounds or request its removal from them ( in the d\u00e9partement of ORG , the threshold is QUANTITY , which corresponds to the statutory minimum area ) . Since the entry into force of Law no .

On DATE the Prefect informed him of the procedure to follow in order to have his land removed from the ORG \u2019s hunting grounds on account of his opposition to hunting for reasons of conscience .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again wrote to the ORG , applying to have his land removed from the Louin ORG \u2019s hunting grounds . He stated as follows :", "\u201c ... My application to have the land removed is not based on personal convictions but on the fact that ORG , and subsequently the national administrative courts , have ruled ... that \u2018 while different treatment of persons in a comparable situation may be justified by the general interest resulting in particular from the need to ensure coherent and efficient management of game stocks , there does not appear to be any objective and reasonable justification for obliging landowners , by means of compulsory transfer , to join an approved municipal hunters\u2019 association against their wishes.\u2019 It is clear from these different court rulings that large and small landowners can not be treated differently on the basis of provisions which are contrary to LAW [ No . CARDINAL ] taken in conjunction with LAW of [ LAW .", "As I own QUANTITY , CARDINAL ares and CARDINAL centiares , I would kindly request you to grant me permission , by means of a reasoned administrative decision , to immediately remove from the hunting grounds of the Louin ORG the plots of land entered in section ... of the land register ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of ORG of ORG informed the applicant that his application had been rejected . Noting that the applicant was no longer citing his original reasons relating to personal convictions , but instead relied on LAW , the Director wrote as follows :", "\u201c ... the provisions of the PERSON of DATE and of LAW , and in particular Articles L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL and PERSON thereof , were designed to bring the domestic law into line with the case - law of the Court ... by providing that only landowners who do not hunt and who are opposed to hunting as a matter of personal conviction have a right to raise objections to hunting irrespective of the surface area of their land , while maintaining the requirement for owners of land below a certain threshold ( QUANTITY in ORG ) to transfer the hunting rights over their land to the ORG .", "Our enquiries have revealed that you are the holder of a valid hunting permit for the current hunting DATE .", "As a result ... , pursuant to LAW , I must inform you that I am unable to grant your request and that the land you seek to have removed shall remain within the hunting grounds of the Louin ORG . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to reconsider the decision .", "On DATE , having received no reply , he applied to ORG for judicial review of the implicit refusal constituted by the ORG \u2019s failure to reply , and of the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the application , in a judgment containing the following reasoning :", "\u201c ... while different treatment of persons in a comparable situation may be justified by the general interest resulting in particular from the need to ensure coherent and efficient management of game stocks , there does not appear to be any objective and reasonable justification for obliging landowners , by means of compulsory transfer , to join an approved municipal hunters\u2019 association against their wishes . ... thus , the difference in treatment between large and small landowners is contrary to LAW [ No . CARDINAL ] read in conjunction with LAW of [ LAW . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Louin ORG applied to ORG to have that judgment set aside , arguing that , as a hunter himself , the applicant could not claim to be a victim of a Convention violation .", "ORG rejected the application in a judgment of DATE . It considered that ORG had not been competent to sign the decision of DATE , which was therefore unlawful , as was the implicit refusal . Accordingly , the court concluded that the Louin ORG had no grounds for contesting the settingaside of the decisions in question .", "CARDINAL . On an application by the Louin ORG , the PERSON d\u2019Etat , in a judgment of DATE , quashed the judgment of ORG . It held that the latter had committed an error of law in ruling that ORG had not been competent to sign the decision in question , since he had been properly delegated to sign documents in the sphere concerned .", "Ruling on the merits , the PERSON d\u2019Etat went on to quash the judgment of ORG of DATE and rejected the applicant \u2019s application for judicial review . The ORG d\u2019Etat held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... The evidence in the file shows that PERSON , who owns land with a surface area below that specified in paragraph CARDINAL of Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW , requested the removal of his land not on the grounds that he was opposed to hunting as a matter of personal conviction , as permitted by the fifth paragraph of that Article , but on the grounds that he wished to reserve the hunting rights over his land for his own use without allowing the members of the ORG to benefit from them .", "The system of approved hunters\u2019 associations was devised on general - interest grounds to prevent the unregulated exercise of hunting and promote rational use of game stocks . Landowners who hunt and who transfer the rights over their land are automatically entitled , in accordance with LAW of LAW , to membership of the hunters\u2019 association and , accordingly , to hunt throughout the association \u2019s hunting grounds . Thus , the owners of land with a surface area below that specified in the third paragraph of Article CARDINAL of the Code have a choice between relinquishing their hunting rights on the grounds that they are opposed to hunting as a matter of personal conviction or transferring the hunting rights over their land to the ORG in exchange for the compensatory benefits referred to above . Accordingly , the system does not constitute disproportionate interference with the right to property and is not in breach of LAW No . CARDINAL ] .", "The difference in treatment under the law between small and large landowners was introduced in the interests of hunters who own small plots of land , who can thus band together in order to obtain larger hunting grounds . Thus , this difference in treatment is based on objective and reasonable grounds and , since the owners of small plots remain free to use their land for a purpose in keeping with their conscience , the system in issue is not in breach of LAW No . CARDINAL ] taken in conjunction with LAW of [ LAW . It follows from the above that ORG incorrectly based its ruling on a breach of [ these provisions ] in setting aside the impugned decisions ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In principle , hunting rights over land belong to the landowner . Article PERSON of LAW states that \u201c [ n]o one shall have the right to hunt on land belonging to another without the consent of the owner or any person entitled through or under the owner \u201d .", "However , the legislature deemed it necessary for hunting grounds to be \u201c pooled \u201d in some cases .

The ACCAs pool hunting grounds at municipal level . Under LAW of LAW , in the version applicable at the material time , they are \u201c designed to ensure sound technical organisation of hunting . They shall encourage , on their hunting grounds , an increase in game stocks and wildlife while preserving a genuine balance between agriculture , forestry and hunting , provide instruction to their members in hunting - related matters and ensure the control of vermin and compliance with hunting plans ... Their role is also to ensure that hunters contribute to the conservation of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna \u201d .", "The ACCAs are subject to the ordinary law on associations ( LAW ) and to the specific provisions of FAC and the regulatory instruments implementing it ( Articles PERSON seq . and Articles R. CARDINAL - CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) . The prefect issues approval after checking that the requisite formalities have been completed and that the association \u2019s constitution and internal rules conform to the statutory requirements ( Articles L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL and PERSON of LAW ) . The prefects are responsible for supervising the ACCAs , and any change to their constitutions , internal rules or hunting regulations must be submitted to the prefect for approval ( Articles R.
