The Government contested that and claimed that he was born in DATE . He currently lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s older brother , SH , arrived in GPE and made an application for asylum based on the risk to him as the son of a high - ranking member of ORG of GPE ( \u201c PDPA \u201d ) . That application was refused by the Secretary of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , SH \u2019s asylum appeal was allowed by an Adjudicator of the then ORG ( \u201c IAA \u201d ) . The Adjudicator accepted that ORG \u2019s father had been a prominent , high - ranking member of the PDPA who had been in touch with its highest officials and who had also been a member of the central committee responsible for policy making . He also accepted that ORG \u2019s father was \u201c known \u201d by armed factions ; was without any existing political party or tribal protection in GPE ; was living outside GPE ; and would be at risk upon return . The Adjudicator noted that SH had , in DATE , made some contacts and forwarded documents to others on behalf of his father and that a powerful person with political influence had occupied the family land for a considerable time . He concluded that the evidential basis for an historical and DATE interest in SH had been established . In the circumstances , the Adjudicator found that the applicant \u2019s brother fell \u201c fairly and squarely \u201d within the protection category set out by the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) as a relative of a former ORG member , and that there were substantial grounds for believing that he would face a real risk of ill - treatment contrary to LAW if he were to be returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the applicant \u2019s brother was granted refugee status in GPE by the Secretary of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and was arrested by the police as an illegal immigrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , he claimed asylum and claimed to be DATE , giving his date of birth as DATE . The factual basis of his asylum claim was similar to that of his brother , SH , and he also relied upon his father \u2019s previous position as a high - ranking member of the PDPA . He claimed that his father had been a close friend and the personal doctor of several prominent politicians , including PERSON ( the President of GPE DATE ) and other Government ministers . He claimed that , in DATE when the communist regime had collapsed , his father had been forced to flee GPE for GPE . He claimed that his father had continued to be politically active in opposition to a number of warlords and people involved in the current ORG , including Generals PERSON , PERSON and GPE who he had known personally . The applicant claimed that , after his father had left GPE , his family had been forced to move to GPE in eastern GPE where they had lived for over a decade using different surnames so that they would not be identified . DATE , his family had moved to GPE for DATE . During that time , members of ORG had come to their home on CARDINAL or QUANTITY occasions . On the last occasion , they had arrested his uncle who had subsequently been detained for DATE . They had also tried to arrest the applicant \u2019s brothers . The family had therefore moved to stay with another uncle , but whilst there , CARDINAL of his brothers , ORG , had been shot and killed in DATE . The applicant had travelled to GPE with his mother and a younger brother where he had lived for DATE before travelling alone with an agent to GPE via GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL social workers from ORG assessed the applicant as being significantly over DATE and in the region of DATE . In coming to that conclusion , they stated that they had considered his physical appearance , general demeanour , account of his life in GPE and GPE and his experiences during his travel to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , his application for asylum was refused by the Secretary of ORG , who considered that his account was vague and contradictory , and that it was not plausible that he would not be able to recollect any of the significant details of his life in GPE , his journey to GPE or the activities of his father . In particular , it was not accepted that his father was still politically active because it was implausible that the applicant would not be able to recollect any details of his father \u2019s activities given that he had remained in relatively regular contact with him . It was also not considered to be credible that the NORP authorities or any warlords would be interested in the applicant given , inter alia , the fact that he had not been politically active himself ; the length of time that had passed since his father had left GPE ; and the fact that he had lived in GPE without problems for DATE before leaving . It was also noted that his father had voluntarily returned on CARDINAL trip to GPE , undermining his claim that his father was at risk there due to his high profile . His claim that the death of his brother , FH , was related to his father \u2019s political activity was considered to be entirely speculative . His account of events in GPE was rejected because the details of the same were vague and because they contradicted the account that his brother had given at his appeal hearing in DATE . His credibility was considered to be undermined by his failure to claim asylum in GPE , GPE or GPE . Even taking his claim at its highest , it was considered that he could relocate within GPE to avoid any problems from warlords .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed by an NORP Judge at the then ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . The Immigration Judge acknowledged that the applicant \u2019s brother \u2019s asylum appeal had been successful in DATE because the Adjudicator had accepted that his father had occupied a position of prominence and a high - ranking position within the ORG . Nevertheless , the Immigration Judge referred to the later ORG country guideline determination of SO and SO ( KhaD DATE members and family ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) and found that there were differences between the claims of the CARDINAL brothers , including the fact that the applicant had never been involved in any political activity , whilst his brother had carried out some activities on behalf of their father which might have drawn the authorities\u2019 attention to him . In addition , the Immigration Judge did not accept that their father continued to be politically active or to have a high profile in GPE , because the only evidence of any political activity related to events over DATE previously , prior to DATE , when the applicant had still been a small child , and politics and personnel in GPE had changed since that time . Even if his father had continued to be politically active , the Immigration Judge did not accept that the NORP authorities or warlords would have any adverse interest in the applicant , given his lack of political profile and education ; his age on leaving GPE ; the fact that he had only been a small child when his father had been politically active ; and recent political developments in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Immigration Judge also made a series of adverse credibility findings against the applicant due to his vagueness when giving evidence ; his failure to claim asylum in safe countries en route to GPE , including GPE , GPE and GPE ; and the discrepancies between his account and that of his brother including , inter alia , the level of contact that had taken place between the various family members since their respective departures from GPE and whether or not one brother ORG had been shot . In particular , it was not accepted that SH would not have mentioned during his own asylum application that one of their brothers had been shot had such an event occurred . Even if his brother ORG had died , the Immigration Judge did not accept that he had been killed by the Mujaheddin , given that the applicant himself had stated that he did not know who had killed him but thought it was the Mujaheddin . The Immigration Judge considered that the applicant had used his age as a convenient cover whenever he did not know the answer to a question even though he had been age - assessed by social workers as being DATE . The Immigration Judge considered that it would have been expected that the applicant would have discussed matters with his family and would have had some awareness of his father \u2019s political activities .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the Immigration Judge did not accept that the level of indiscriminate violence in GPE , and in GPE in particular , reached a level such as to constitute a real risk to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , his application for reconsideration was dismissed by a Senior Immigration Judge at the ORG because there had been no error of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , his application for reconsideration was dismissed by ORG because the appeal determination did not disclose any error of law . The findings of fact and the findings in relation to credibility were matters for the Immigration Judge having , as he had done , properly directed himself in relation to the law . The reasons for his findings were clear and carefully expressed .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE ( \u201c the NIA Act CARDINAL \u201d ) , provides a right of appeal against an immigration decision made by the Secretary of ORG for ORG .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , appeals in asylum , immigration and nationality matters were heard by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . From DATE , the then ORG replaced the former system of ORG and ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . Section CARDINAL of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE ( as amended by ORG , etc . ) Act DATE ) provided that a party to an appeal could apply to ORG , on the grounds that the ORG had made an error of law , for an order requiring the ORG to reconsider its decision on the appeal . ORG could make such an order if it thought that the ORG had made an error of law . At the relevant time , all applications for reconsideration went through a \u201c filter procedure \u201d , so that an application for reconsideration was first made to an authorised immigration judge of the ORG . If the immigration judge refused to make an order for reconsideration , the applicant could renew the application to ORG , which would consider the application afresh .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that , in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right , courts and tribunals must take into account any case - law from this ORG so far as , in the opinion of the court or tribunal , it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen . Section CARDINAL ) provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right .", "CARDINAL . Country guideline determinations of both the former ORG and ORG are to be treated as an authoritative finding on the country guidance issue identified in the determination , based upon the evidence before the members of the ORG or the ORG that determined the appeal . Unless expressly superseded or replaced by a later country guideline determination , country guideline determinations are authoritative in any subsequent appeals so far as that appeal relates to the country guidance issue in question and depends upon the same or similar evidence .", "CARDINAL . In the country guideline determination of SO and SO ( KhaD DATE members and family ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT CARDINAL , the ORG held that the issue of risk to persons having a connection with the ORG had to be considered by weighing up a number of factors including some personal to the individual . Furthermore , it could not be said that former membership of ORG ( \u201c KhaD \u201d - the secret service wing of the NORP PDPA regime in GPE until DATE ) or the ORG would generally suffice to establish a risk of persecution or treatment contrary to LAW on return unless an individual had personally crossed or had had \u201c concrete conflicts \u201d with people who were now in power . In that context , the ORG considered that past or present personal conflicts were more important than political conflicts . The ORG further held that in assessing whether family members of a PDPA and/or a NORP member would be at risk , there may be factors reducing or removing risk such as the death of the ORG / KhaD member , and the amount of time that had elapsed since his death .", "CARDINAL . In the country guideline determination of ORG ( LAW ) : Indiscriminate violence ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT CARDINAL , promulgated on DATE , the then ORG held that there was not in GPE such a high level of indiscriminate violence that substantial grounds existed for believing that a civilian would , solely by being present there , face a real risk which threatened the civilian \u2019s life or person , such as to entitle that person to the grant of humanitarian protection , pursuant to ORG ) and ORG .", "CARDINAL . Council Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of DATE ( on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted : \u201c the LAW \u201d ) has the objective , inter alia , of ensuring ORG Member GPE apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection ( recital CARDINAL of the preamble ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition to regulating refugee status , it makes provision for granting subsidiary protection status . Article CARDINAL(e ) defines a person eligible for subsidiary protection status as someone who would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin and who is unable , or , owing to such risk , unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country .", "\u201c Serious harm \u201d is defined in LAW as consisting of :", "\u201c a ) NORP death penalty or execution ; or", "b ) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment of an applicant in the country of origin ; or", "c ) serious and individual threat to a civilian \u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Qualification Directive was transposed into domestic law by LOC .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG issued ORG from GPE ( \u201c the DATE ORG Guidelines \u201d ) and set out the categories of NORP considered to be particularly at risk in GPE in view of the security , political and human rights situation in the country at that time .", "CARDINAL . With regard to persons associated with the former ORG , those PERSON stated the following :", "\u201c ORG of GPE ( PDPA ) was formed in DATE by PERSON on ORG ideology due to domestic discontent and the absence of political freedoms . It believed in a CARDINAL - party , heavily secularized state , and was particularly intolerant of political opposition from its NORP rivals . The ORG eventually split into the Khalq ( People ) and ORG ( ORG ) branches . After the PERSON faction of the ORG deposed the ruling party through a coup carried out by its supporters in the military in DATE ( the Saur Revolution ) , it formed a government that was violently intolerant of political opposition . The NORP - supported PDPA government \u2019s attempts at forcible reform of polity and society resulted in a surge of support for its NORP rivals , who attempted to oust it with NORP support . In DATE , the CARDINAL factions reunited under NORP pressure and its name was changed to ORG . It collapsed in DATE when , following the Peshawar Accords , Mujaheddin troops entered GPE and the last President of a communist government in GPE , PERSON ( previously head of the secret service ORG ) had to seek refuge in a ORG - building in GPE where he stayed until he was killed by NORP troops entering GPE in DATE .", "In DATE , a congress of ORG of GPE ( PDPA ) took place in GPE , which led to the creation of PERSON ( ORG ) , a party registered in DATE then comprising CARDINAL members . Former ORG members have also reportedly founded several other parties . Most recently , a new parliamentary group , ORG , was inaugurated on DATE as a broad coalition of former and current militia leaders , commanders from the anti - NORP resistance , ex - NORP leaders , and various representatives of social and ethnic groups .", "Significant numbers of the former ORG of GPE ( PDPA ) DATE subsequently renamed ORG \u2013 members and former security officials , including ORG ( ORG ) , are working in the Government .", "While many former ORG members and officials of the communist government , particularly those who enjoy the protection of and have strong links to influential factions and individuals in the current Government , are generally not at risk , some high - ranking members of the ORG continue to face a risk of persecution . Such risk depends on the individual \u2019s personal circumstances , including family background , professional profile , political links , and whether he or she has been associated , or perceived to be associated , with the human rights violations of the communist regime in GPE DATE .", "Former PDPA high - ranking members without factional protection from NORP political parties , tribes or persons in a position of influence , who may be exposed to a risk of persecution , include the following :", "\u2022 high - ranking ORG members , irrespective of whether they belonged to the ORG or PERSON faction of the party may be at risk if they are known and had a public profile .

Therefore , NORP asylum - seekers formerly residing in these areas may be in need of international protection under broader international protection criteria , including complementary forms of protection . In addition , given the fluid and volatile nature of the conflict , asylum applications by NORP claiming to flee generalized violence in other parts of GPE should each be assessed carefully , in light of the evidence presented by the applicant and other current and reliable information on the place of former residence . This latter determination will obviously need to include assessing whether a situation of generalized violence exists in the place of former residence at the time of adjudication .", "ORG generally considers internal flight as a reasonable alternative where protection is available from the individual \u2019s own extended family , community or tribe in the area of prospective relocation . Single males and nuclear family units may , in certain circumstances , subsist without family and community support in urban and semi - urban areas with established infrastructure and under effective Government control . Given the breakdown in the traditional social fabric of the country caused by DATE of war , massive refugee flows , and growing internal migration to urban areas , a case - by - case analysis will , nevertheless , be necessary .", "In light of the serious human rights violations and transgressions of international humanitarian law during GPE \u2019s long history of armed conflicts , exclusion considerations under LAW may arise in individual claims by NORP asylum - seekers .
