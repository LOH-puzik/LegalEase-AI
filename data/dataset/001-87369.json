The applicants were crew members on a merchant ship named the Winner , flying the NORP flag .", "CARDINAL . As part of the international effort to combat drug trafficking , the NORP authorities were informed that the ship might be carrying large quantities of drugs .", "CARDINAL . By diplomatic telegram dated DATE , the NORP embassy in GPE informed ORG in GPE that , in response to a request from ORG for ORG ( \u201c OCRTIS \u201d ) for authorisation to intercept the Winner , and at the embassy 's request , the NORP Minister of ORG had personally given his Government 's agreement .", "The Government produced a diplomatic note dated DATE , addressed by ORG to ORG in GPE , stating :", "\u201c ORG and ORG ( ... ) , referring to its note no . CARDINAL dated DATE , has the honour formally to confirm that ORG of GPE authorises the NORP authorities to intercept , inspect and take legal action against the ship Winner , flying the NORP flag ( ... ) belonging ( ... ) to the PERSON islands . ( ... ) ORG", "CARDINAL . The commander of the frigate ORG was instructed by the NORP naval authorities to intercept the Winner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the frigate spotted a merchant ship travelling at slow speed through the waters off LOC . It was not flying a flag , but was identified as the Winner . Its nationality was verified in accordance with international law and , as a security measure , a speedboat was lowered into the water . The merchant ship suddenly changed course , in an attempt to evade the frigate . When attempts were made to contact it on the international radio frequency , it remained silent . At the same time , the crew jettisoned packages over the stern into the sea . The frigate then identified itself and asked the Winner to stop , while signalling the international code TIME ( \u201c stop or I shall open fire \u201d ) ; no answer came and the ship was still not flying a flag , so a warning shot was fired , followed by further shots to stop it . At the same time the speedboat was ordered to recover the parcels that had been jettisoned . It only managed to recover one . Upon subsequent verification it was found to contain QUANTITY of a narcotic substance resembling cocaine .", "CARDINAL . Three more parcels were thrown overboard . As the freighter had still not stopped and was manoeuvring to prevent the speedboat from pulling alongside , GPE 's ORG for the LOC ordered the frigate to fire directly at the Winner 's bow . This caused the Winner to stop , and an armed commando team boarded it and took control of it by armed force . CARDINAL of the crew members , who sustained a bullet wound , was evacuated onto the frigate , where he was treated by the ship 's doctor before being transferred to GPE hospital , where he died DATE . The rest of the crew were confined to DATE on board the Winner under military guard . A tug was sent out from ORG , under orders from ORG and at the request of the public prosecutor in GPE , to tow the Winner into GPE harbour , escorted by the frigate Commandant GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the ORG public prosecutor referred the case to ORG for examination under the flagrante delicto procedure . It emerged that the NORP coastguard had had the Winner under observation in connection with international drug trafficking in which NORP nationals were involved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG prosecutor 's office opened an investigation into charges , against persons unknown , of leading a group with the aim of producing , making , importing , exporting , transporting , holding , supplying , selling , acquiring or illegally using drugs and conspiring to import and export drugs illegally . CARDINAL investigating judges were appointed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the Winner entered GPE harbour under escort . The crew and cargo were handed over to the police , acting under instructions from CARDINAL of the investigating judges , who immediately notified the persons concerned that they were being placed in police custody and informed them of their rights .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the CARDINAL investigating judges went to see each of the detainees after TIME and after TIME to inform them that their police custody was being extended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON , ORG , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON were charged and remanded in custody pending trial . On DATE so were Mr PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and CARDINAL other crew members ( Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The above QUANTITY persons applied to ORG of ORG to have the evidence disallowed ; relying in particular on LAW , they complained that the Winner had been arrested illegally and that their detention on board for DATE had also been illegal . In a judgment of DATE , the court dismissed their appeal and held that there were no grounds for disallowing the evidence .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment ORG pointed out that the international effort to combat drug trafficking was governed by ORG of DATE , ORG on the Law of the Sea , signed at LOC on DATE , and ORG in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances , signed in GPE on DATE , all of which had been ratified by GPE . It considered that although GPE had not signed LAW , LAW of which provided for derogations from the traditional principle of the \u201c law of the flag ORG \u201d , that did not prevent the NORP authorities from \u201c requesting GPE 's cooperation to obtain authorisation to intercept the Winner in order to put a stop to the drug trafficking in which all or part of its crew were suspected of engaging \u201d , based on LAW and \u201c with reference \u201d to LAW . According to ORG , as the provisions of LAW did not apply to GPE , it was for that ORG 's authorities to ask the NORP authorities for the information they needed in order to determine , as they alone were entitled to do , whether the request for assistance was well founded . The court then held that the diplomatic telegram of DATE from ORG established the existence of \u201c an agreement given without restrictions or reservations by ORG for the planned interception and all its consequences , and was authoritative until proven otherwise \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG considered that the agreement in question did not dispense the NORP authorities from abiding by the rules of procedure set forth in LAW and in Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Law of DATE as amended . Nor , it pointed out , had the NORP authorities failed in that obligation in the circumstances . In the light of the reports drawn up by the commander of ORG , ORG found that when the frigate had drawn within sight of the Winner the latter \u201c was flying no flag \u201d and its captain had \u201c not only failed to answer the requests to identify the ship , in breach of the rules of international law , and failed to stop the ship , but [ had ] responded aggressively with a series of dangerous manoeuvres that jeopardised the safety of the NORP frigate and the lives of the sailors on the speedboat \u201d , and the crew of the Winner had thrown parcels containing large quantities of cocaine into the sea . There had therefore been \u201c reasonable grounds \u201d , in ORG view , to suspect the Winner of drug trafficking , so that \u201c in using force to stop the Winner and taking appropriate measures to control and restrain the crew , who were confined to DATE , and to take over and steer the ship \u201d , the commander of the frigate had \u201c strictly observed \u201d the provisions of Article CARDINAL of LAW ( under which he is authorised , when a ship is boarded and searched , \u201c If evidence of involvement in illicit traffic is found , [ to ] take appropriate action with respect to the vessel , persons and cargo on board \u201d ) and the provisions of LAW DATE as amended , regulating the use of coercion measures , including , if necessary , the use of force in the event of refusal by a ship to submit to inspection ( ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) , and providing for the implementation of the inspection and coercion measures provided for in international law in the particular case of drug trafficking ( ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to dismiss the applicants ' argument that LAW DATE as amended provided only for assistance measures of an administrative nature , which excluded any form of coercion in respect of people , as the Article mentioned in general terms that the competent maritime authorities had the power to carry out or have carried out \u201c the inspection and coercion measures provided for in international law \u201d and Article CARDINAL c ) of the Vienna Convention concerning drug trafficking expressly mentioned taking \u201c appropriate action with respect to the vessel , persons and cargo on board \u201d . Although it accepted that the exact nature of that action was not specified , ORG considered that the text concerned provided \u201c at least for the competent naval authorities to limit , if necessary , the freedom of the boarded ship 's crew to come and go ; otherwise the provision would be meaningless and the safety of the men taking over control of the ship would be seriously jeopardised \u201d . In respect of this last point , it considered that \u201c it can not be ruled out in the course of such operations against international drug traffickers on the high seas that the crew might have weapons hidden away and might seek to regain control of the ship by force \u201d . It concluded that \u201c the fact that the Winner 's crew were confined to DATE ( ... ) under military guard so that the ship could be safely taken over and rerouted fell within the appropriate action provided for in Article CARDINAL c ) of the Vienna Convention \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG considered that the Law of DATE \u201c necessarily required some departure from ordinary criminal procedure to allow for the specific needs of the effort to combat drug trafficking by ships on the high seas , in keeping with the rules of international law , and for the fact that it was impossible in practice , bearing in mind the time needed to sail to the new port of destination , to apply the ordinary rules governing detention and the right to be brought promptly before a judge \u201d . Accordingly , the restrictions placed on the movements of a boarded ship 's crew , as authorised in such cases by ORG signed in GPE on DATE , were not at variance with LAW and did not amount to unlawful detention . It also noted that in this particular case , as soon as the Winner had docked , its crew had been handed over to the police , immediately informed of their rights and placed in custody , then brought before the investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . An appeal on points of law lodged by the applicants ( complaining in particular of a violation of LAW ) was dismissed in a judgment of ORG of DATE . According to that court , \u201c in ruling as it did , in so far as GPE , the flag ORG , [ had ] expressly and without restriction authorised the NORP authorities to stop the Winner and , in keeping with LAW , only appropriate action had been taken against the persons on board , who [ had been ] lawfully taken into police custody as soon as they landed on NORP soil , ORG [ had ] justified its decision \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON Vilaine Special Assize Court found Mr Georgios Boreas , PERSON PERSON GPE , PERSON PERSON and PERSON PERSON guilty of conspiracy to illegally attempt to import narcotics and sentenced them respectively to DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE imprisonment ; it acquitted the other applicants of the charges against them .
