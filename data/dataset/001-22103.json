The collision had as a result the death of all the passengers of the car .", "The site of the accident was inspected and it was found that the road surface at the collision point was slippery , due to the rain which had fallen . It was also established that the car \u2019s speed was higher than the maximum permitted speed in that sector . An expert \u2019s report concluded that because the load of the truck , its power and mass , it was impossible for it to maoeuvre and had caused the truck to drag the car backwards with only a small speed .", "A preliminary investigation ( proanakrisi ) was initiated ex officio immediately , pursuant to LAW . On DATE the case file was sent to ORG .", "On DATE the applicant brought criminal charges against the driver and the owner of the truck as well as against some others persons .

It held that the steering system and brakes of the truck were functioning satisfactorily and that the truck driver could not be accused of reckless driving but had been unable to avoid the collision because of the negligent conduct of the applicant \u2019s brother . The latter was imprudent , was driving at an excessive speed and violated the double separation line of the road .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against the above decision of the indictments division . He complained that the decision was not sufficiently reasoned and that ORG had applied the relevant legislation erroneously .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed by ORG of ORG ( PERSON ) of LOC ( decision CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .

In order to be re - examined , the case was referred back to ORG of ORG , sitting with a different composition .", "On DATE ORG of ORG ruled that there was no case for the accused to answer ( decision PERSON ) .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against the second decision of ORG of ORG .

In particular , ORG found that the appealed decision \u2019s reasoning did not elaborate fully and clearly on the evidence bearing on the co - responsibility of the accused for the accident .", "On DATE ORG of ORG decided for the third time not to press charges against the accused . It held that there were not sufficient indications pointing to the guilt of the defendant . For the third time , ORG held that the driver of the car had been driving at an excessive speed under the circumstances , as it transpired from the deposition of the driver of the car moving behind the applicant \u2019s brother . No liability could be established for the defendant , having regard to the conclusions reached after the inspection of the site of the accident , the diagram which was drawn up . It transpired that the defendant was driving at CARDINAL km / h , that is under the speed limit , was overloaded and circulating at the far right of his own traffic lane . The fact that the applicant \u2019s brother \u2019s car was dragged by the truck down the road was attributed to the slippery road and the defendant \u2019s confusion at the time of the collision .", "On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law to ORG .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on the ground that the action had become statute - barred . In particular , ORG held that the DATE period of limitation provided by the law for involuntary homicide had lapsed and thus the punishable character of the act allegedly committed by the defendant had disappeared .", "Under LAW misdemeanours ( plimmelimata ) , such as the offence for which the driver and the representatives of the company would have been tried , are subject to a DATE prescription period , starting from the moment the offence takes place . According to LAW , the investigation and interlocutory proceedings ( e.g. the proceedings before the indictments chambers ) does not interrupt the running of the prescription period ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
