{"ITEMID": "001-22347", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "CHE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "P.W. v. SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE . He is represented before the Court by Mr B. Gelzer , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant worked in GPE as a real property administrator in the C. company . In DATE he was given notice as he had allegedly appropriated payments for repairs which had not been undertaken .", "Criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on account of professional fraud . Upon appeal , ORG ( ORG ) of the GPE of GPE - Stadt on DATE sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . The court was composed of CARDINAL judges and assisted by court registrar PERSON", "Meanwhile , in DATE the applicant brought an action before ORG against the C. company , claiming MONEY ( CHF ) , inter alia , for outstanding salary claims . In DATE the defendant company brought a counter - action against the applicant , claiming CHF CARDINAL . Proceedings were then continued before ORG ( Zivilgericht ) of the GPE of GPE - Stadt which on DATE suspended the proceedings in view of the criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant .", "Proceedings were resumed in DATE . The defendant company brought a further counter - action against the applicant , now claiming CHF MONEY for damages caused by fictitious bills .", "As from DATE , judge NORP , the President of ORG , acted in the applicant \u2019s case as the judge responsible for the preparation of cases for trial ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE the applicant extended his claims to CHF CARDINAL . He also requested free legal aid .", "On DATE judge NORP authorised the amendments of the action and counter - action . In order to examine the applicant \u2019s request for free legal aid , he obtained copies of judgments from the competent courts which had conducted the criminal proceedings and had refused the applicant free legal aid . On DATE judge NORP refused the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid as he had not demonstrated his indigence .", "On DATE judge NORP fixed CARDINAL DATE as the time - limit for filing replies to the action and counter - action . On DATE the defendant company filed further submissions , accompanied by photocopies of certain documents . As the applicant contested their authenticity , judge NORP requested the defendant company to submit the original documents .", "On DATE the applicant amended his action and requested , in addition , CHF MONEY from the defendant company . As a result , judge NORP instructed the applicant to pay advance costs of CHF CARDINAL . The applicant replied that he was unable to pay this sum whereupon judge NORP declared the amendment to the action inadmissible ( aus dem ORG gewiesen ) .", "On DATE both the applicant and the defendant company filed further submissions .", "On DATE judge NORP closed the exchange of statements and ordered the documents of the criminal proceedings to be included in the case - file .", "On DATE judge NORP terminated his functions at ORG and became a judge at ORG of the GPE of ORG . Thereafter , judge PERSON undertook the functions in the applicant \u2019s case before ORG as judge responsible for the preparation of cases for trial .", "On DATE a hearing took place before ORG at which both parties were present . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court ordered the applicant to pay CHF MONEY to the defendant company , while formally taking note that the latter accepted the applicant \u2019s action to the extent of CHF MONEY . It imposed the costs of the court proceedings concerning the action , amounting to CHF CARDINAL , on the applicant , who was furthermore ordered to pay PERCENT of the costs of the counter - action , amounting altogether to CHF MONEY .", "The applicant appealed against the judgment in respect of the imposition of costs , claiming that the defendant company should pay the entire costs of the counter - action , and PERCENT of the costs of his action . On DATE ORG of the GPE of ORG dismissed the appeal . It transpires from the judgment that the bench was composed of CARDINAL judges , among them judge NORP , as well as the court registrar PERSON", "The applicant \u2019s public law appeal ( staatsrechtliche Beschwerde ) was dismissed by ORG on DATE . Insofar as the applicant complained of the lack of impartiality of judge NORP and court registrar PERSON , ORG stated :", "\u201c According to the submissions of ORG ... NORP had acted , in the case at issue , as judge responsible for preparing cases for trial DATE and DATE . During this period of time he examined the applicant \u2019s requests for free legal aid ; imposed advance court costs ; dealt with requests concerning amendments of the action and the counter - action ; fixed time - limits for the exchange of statements ; and decided on requests for the transmittal of files , including those of the criminal proceedings . On DATE , when a new judge took over these functions , the preparation of the case for trial was not yet completed . In particular , the successor had to decide on the taking of evidence requested ; to prepare the trial ; and to participate in the decision . As a result , while NORP , as the first instance judge responsible for the proceedings , took all decisions necessary for the progress of the proceedings and for the preparation of the judgment , at no moment was he obliged to express himself on the admissibility or the merits of the legal requests stated in the action or the counter - action ...", "The participation of NORP also does not raise an issue under ... LAW . It has not been made clear why the procedure in second instance \u2013 despite the participation of DATE could no longer be described as open and undetermined in respect of the legal questions to be resolved , a fortiori as the judgment of the lower court was only contested in respect of the costs . When acting as judge responsible for preparing cases for trial , NORP did not have to deal with the issue of attributing the costs of the proceedings . He therefore appears as an impartial judge in this respect . This conclusion is not altered by the fact that NORP obtained knowledge of certain aspects playing a r\u00f4le in respect of the question whether or not the defendant company had instituted proceedings in good faith . ...", "The complaint of a breach of LAW and the LAW is equally unfounded insofar as court registrar PERSON collaborated in the second instance criminal and civil proceedings . In view of the criteria previously referred to , no partiality can objectively be made out if a court registrar participates in the decision - making in CARDINAL proceedings with different contentious objects . It plays no part here that in both proceedings similar partial questions \u2013 albeit from a completely different vantage point - may have arisen . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
