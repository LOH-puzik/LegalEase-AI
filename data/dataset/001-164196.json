The applicants are the owners of land situated in the cadastral area of GPE on the territory of the municipality of PERSON . They acquired title to this land by way of inheritance from their predecessors .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ORG put the land in question at the disposal of an agricultural cooperative called PERSON . In DATE the cooperative designated part of the land as an \u201c allotment colony \u201d , consisting of individual allotments which were put at the disposal of private third parties ( \u201c the gardeners \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 \u2012 or , at the relevant time , their ORG \u2012 formal title to the land has remained unaffected but in practice , they have not been able to make use of it at all .

In the context of the political changes in the former GPE , LAW ( Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ) was enacted in DATE .

NORP The rent payable for such tenancy was regulated under section CARDINAL ) of LAW until this provision was replaced by LAW , which entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW likewise imposed a compulsory tenancy arrangement in favour of the gardeners , the rent being regulated by its section CARDINAL , which applied by operation of law unless the parties had agreed otherwise . This provision , as applicable at that time , referred to other pieces of legislation which set the annual rent at MONEY of the value of the property \u2012 calculated on the basis of the then applicable price regulations \u2012 the minimum being equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) per square metre and per year .", "CARDINAL . In the applicants\u2019 case , with the exception mentioned below , no such separate agreement had been reached between the parties , and the DATE rent payable by the gardeners to the applicants was thus determined under the statutory rules at the lowest limit of the applicable scale , that is to say at a rate of EUR CARDINAL per square metre . In the case of the applicant PERSON , an agreement was reached that , as from DATE , she would be paid rent equivalent to ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL per square QUANTITY and per year .", "CARDINAL . The applicable statutory regime was amended \u2012 after the ORG \u2019s above - mentioned judgments had become final \u2012 with effect from CARDINAL DATE by PERSON no . CARDINAL Coll . , which adjusted the rent payable to owners in a situation such as the applicants\u2019 to a level commensurate with the market rent .", "By virtue of the statutory amendment , the amount of the rent was to be determined under the Regulation of the Ministry of Justice on Determination of the General Value of Property ( no .

This regulation uses the term \u201c general value \u201d \u2012 which is understood to mean the expert assessment of the most likely price at a given place and time on the market in conditions of free competition and honest sale \u2012 and lays down formulae for the determination thereof in relation to land and the rent payable for that land , the latter being linked to the former .

These amendments left the compulsory tenancy introduced by LAW unaffected . Such a tenancy arrangement remains in place until the completion of what are known as land consolidation proceedings in a given area . Such proceedings are also provided for LAW , their aim being to have the ownership and use of the land in the allotment area consolidated , principally by transferring title to the land to the gardeners and having the former owners compensated by means regulated under LAW , the details of such consolidation being defined in what is known as a \u201c land consolidation project \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

The Government for their part submitted the following documents :", "\u2012 A letter from ORG in GPE dated DATE , in which the ORG pointed out what they considered to be methodological flaws in the calculations of expert PERSON On the basis of their pro forma recalculation of the available data , the value of the DATE general rent would be ORG CARDINAL per square metre .
