He was represented before the ORG by Mr G.O. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "and as they appear from the documents , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE a deep recession undermined profitability across the entire financial sector and led to a banking crisis in DATE . The authorities took exceptional measures , such as takeovers , government assistance and temporary blanket guarantees to banks , to secure the stability of the financial system . In DATE ORG ( valtion vakuusrahasto , statens s\u00e4kerhetsfond ) was established with a view to managing the banking crisis . In the state organisation chart ORG was subordinated to ORG until CARDINAL DATE when it was transferred to ORG .", "The applicant is the former chief general manager of a bank , STS - Pankki Oy ( hereinafter \u201c the bank \u201d ) , which met severe financial difficulties .", "In DATE ORG examined the bank \u2019s situation . Another bank , ORG , bought the majority of the STS - Pankki Oy \u2019s shares . According to the ORG agreement , however , the authority over the bank was entrusted to ORG . The bank changed its name to PERSON and its function was henceforth to administer unsettled loans and troublesome property . In DATE almost all the shares of ORG were sold for a nominal price and its name was subsequently changed to PERSON . The buyer was a property management corporation controlled by ORG .", "Meanwhile , on the strength of the above ORG agreement ORG instructed the bank to institute compensation proceedings against a number of bank managers and directors .", "On DATE the bank instituted CARDINAL separate proceedings against its former management , including the applicant , claiming compensation in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . On DATE he was served with the summons . At the time , he was chairman of ORG , which did not form part of the Government but he resigned shortly afterwards . He founded his own business and started working as a business consultant . In DATE his assets were seized .", "On DATE the ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) , by CARDINAL separate judgments , found partly in favour of the plaintiff bank , ordering the applicant among others to pay jointly ORG CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL ) plus interest from the service of the summons and legal costs .", "On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) upheld the lower court \u2019s judgments .", "On DATE the applicant requested that ORG produce documents from its meetings relating to the plaintiff bank \u2019s law suit against him . On DATE ORG refused the request arguing that the documents were of an internal nature and therefore confidential . On DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) overturned the decision .", "On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) reduced the joint liability to pay compensation to ORG CARDINAL ( some EUR CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE in a debt recovery procedure , the Bailiff found that the applicant did not possess any considerable recoverable property . It also appears that the earlier debt recovery procedures in DATE and DATE had proved more or less unsuccessful .", "In DATE the applicant contacted the plaintiff with a view to reaching a friendly settlement . Negotiations followed and a concrete settlement was being discussed . CARDINAL of ORG , a social NORP , issued an instruction to ORG to the effect that a friendly settlement should be achieved . ORG then presented the plaintiff bank \u2019s ORG with an instruction to the same effect .", "On DATE the applicant and the plaintiff reached a friendly settlement as to the payment of compensation to the effect that the applicant would pay ORG CARDINAL ( some EUR CARDINAL ) . The settlement was signed by him and the plaintiff \u2019s chief executive , the latter having received the company \u2019s ORG authorisation .", "The settlement led to a lively public debate according to which the above amount was far too low and to a request by a group of members of ORG , at DATE , for a police investigation into the applicant \u2019s financial affairs . The relevant social NORP Minister of Finance resigned at about this time .", "On DATE ORG decided not to instruct PERSON to commence judicial proceedings with a view to having the friendly settlement declared null and void .", "Following ORG judgment in the compensation proceedings , the plaintiff bank , on DATE , requested a police investigation into the underlying facts of the case . By a letter of DATE a public prosecutor , GPE , informed the plaintiff that he saw no reason to commence a pre - trial investigation against anyone in the bank \u2019s management on account of the events which had been the object of the compensation proceedings ( toimenpiteist\u00e4 luopuminen , \u00e5tg\u00e4rdseftergift ) .", "Meanwhile and during the course of the above compensation proceedings , the plaintiff bank on the instruction of ORG requested , on DATE , that the police investigate whether the applicant had committed debtor \u2019s dishonesty or fraud . At the beginning of the autumn the police received the applicant \u2019s written submission . On DATE the plaintiff withdrew its request for an investigation . In their decision of CARDINAL DATE the police , finding that there was no appearance of any criminal activities , decided not to refer the case to the public prosecutor .", "As noted above , at DATE a group of MPs requested a police investigation into the applicant \u2019s financial affairs , following the friendly settlement . On DATE a ORG , GPE , instructed the police to institute a pre - trial investigation ( tutkintakehotus , beg\u00e4ran om f\u00f6runders\u00f6kning ) into the applicant \u2019s financial affairs from DATE , inter alia in view of the fact that he had directed his income into current accounts with credit balances which he had kept below CARDINAL thus preventing any successful debt recovery procedure and he had paid the above ORG CARDINAL although on DATE he had not accounted for such assets in a debt recovery procedure .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested and his office , home and DATE cottage were searched and documents were seized . He was released after TIME . He was questioned on DATE . The police also made inquiries with the applicant \u2019s customers with a view to finding out whether he had revealed all relevant information relating to his income during the investigation . The inquiries did not show that the applicant had withheld any such information . The case was subsequently transferred to ORG Prosecutor PERSON", "In his decision of DATE ORG ( eduskunnan oikeusasiamies , riksdagens justitieombudsman ) found no reason to take measures on account of ORG actions before and during the compensation proceedings . The applicant had lodged a complaint as regards , among other things , the fact that a law firm engaged by ORG had , in DATE , hired a private investigator to look into the applicant \u2019s financial affairs . ORG found that the hiring of a private investigator in the present case was not dubious as he had only produced public tax information .", "Meanwhile , in his decision of DATE ORG ( valtionsyytt\u00e4j\u00e4 , stats\u00e5klagaren ) PERSON charged the applicant with embezzlement . He however waived charges of debtor \u2019s dishonesty or debtor \u2019s fraud due to the lack of evidence .

Further , ORG Prosecutor PERSON had decided , on DATE , not to prosecute . No new facts had been established between the decision not to prosecute and ORG Prosecutor PERSON \u2019s subsequent decision to bring charges . On DATE ORG rejected the complaint .", "The applicant denied the charges , arguing that he had never been insolvent . In the hearing ORG received oral testimony from the applicant , CARDINAL witness for the prosecution and CARDINAL witnesses for the defence .

Having received the evidence , ORG noted that it had no reason to doubt the credibility of the oral testimony .

In his observations in reply the applicant , referring to LAW , requested that the charges be ruled inadmissible on the ground that an examination of the charges was in violation of the ne bis in idem principle .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request that ORG give oral testimony regarding his procedural complaint as ill - founded .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG ruling of DATE in so far as the procedural complaint was concerned .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing during which it received oral evidence from the applicant and a number of witnesses .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of aggravated debtor \u2019s dishonesty and sentenced him to a suspended term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .
