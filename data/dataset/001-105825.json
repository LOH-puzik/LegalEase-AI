A. appealed , arguing that ORG had erred in the assessment of the facts and in the application of the law .

ORG found that neither B. nor C. nor F. had seen or directly testified that PERSON had urinated in his trousers , that he had incited civic disturbances and that he had held NORP up while the latter had urinated from the terrace of the restaurant .", "CARDINAL . ORG relied on the principle of \u201c truthfulness of information \u201d , consisting of the following elements .

The law could only protect the journalists if they could establish the truthfulness of the impugned material as well as their bona fides in publishing it and the presence of a public interest in the matter .", "CARDINAL . Under the applicable procedural rules it was not permissible at the appellate stage to take new evidence , at the request of the parties , which had not been adduced at the first - instance level .

It followed that , in the given evidentiary situation , the conclusions of the first - instance court as to the essence of the claim were justified .", "CARDINAL . However , ORG considered the existing evidence insufficient to justify the award of damages made by the first - instance court .

The ordinary courts , however , had completely omitted to carry out an assessment of these essential components of the concept of freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company considered the amount of the damages awarded to be excessive , referring to the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-III ) , where the equivalent of CARDINAL ORG Units worth of damages in a libel case had been considered excessive .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company contended that it had been incompatible with the guarantees of a fair trial and , in particular , the equality of arms principle for ORG to base its ruling on damages solely on the additional evidence provided by the claimant , as this evidence had not been adduced by the parties , it had served CARDINAL of the parties and \u2013 as it had been taken at the appellate level \u2013 the defendant had had no opportunity to contest it .

On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible .

As to the complainant \u2019s specific argument that ORG had taken new evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) without informing the complainant and giving it an opportunity to comment , ORG found that the complainant had failed to exhaust ordinary remedies by raising this argument by way of an appeal on points of law under LAW ( f ) of LAW ( Law no .
