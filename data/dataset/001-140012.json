The relatives of those who had taken part in the attack of CARDINAL DATE contested the legislation governing the interment of terrorists before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered a judgment ( no . CARDINAL ) in which , in essence , it rejected their complaints alleging that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Interment and Burial Act and Decree no . CARDINAL of the Government of GPE of DATE were unconstitutional . The ruling stated , in particular , that the impugned legal provisions were , in the circumstances , necessary and justified . The court reached the following conclusions regarding the legitimate aims and necessity of the legislation in question :", "\u201c ... At the same time , the interest in fighting terrorism , in preventing terrorism in general and specific terms and in providing redress for the effects of terrorist acts , coupled with the risk of mass disorder , clashes between different ethnic groups and aggression by DATE those involved in terrorist activity against the population at large and law - enforcement officials , and lastly the threat to human life and limb , may , in a given historical context , justify the establishment of a particular legal regime , such as that provided for by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , governing the burial of persons who escape prosecution in connection with terrorist activity on account of their death following the interception of a terrorist act ... Those provisions are logically connected to the provisions of paragraph LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG of ORG on combating terrorism through culture , dated DATE , in which it was stressed that extremist interpretations of elements of a particular culture or religion , such as heroic martyrdom , self - sacrifice , apocalypse or holy war , as well as secular ideologies ( nationalist or revolutionary ) could also be used for the justification of terrorist acts .", "CARDINAL . Action to minimise the informational and psychological impact of the terrorist act on the population , including the weakening of its propaganda effect , is one of the means necessary to protect public security and the morals , health , rights and legal interests of citizens . It therefore pursues exactly those aims for which LAW and international legal instruments permit restrictions on the relevant rights and freedoms .", "The burial of those who have taken part in a terrorist act , in close proximity to the graves of the victims of their acts , and the observance of rites of burial and remembrance with the paying of respects , as a symbolic act of worship , serve as a means of propaganda for terrorist ideas and also cause offence to relatives of the victims of the acts in question , creating the preconditions for increasing inter - ethnic and religious tension .", "In the conditions which have arisen in GPE as a result of the commission of a series of terrorist acts which produced numerous human victims , resulted in widespread negative social reaction and had a major impact on the collective consciousness , the return of the body to the relatives ... may create a threat to social order and peace and to the rights and legal interests of other persons and their security , including incitement to hatred and incitement to engage in acts of vandalism , violence , mass disorder and clashes which may produce further victims . Meanwhile , the burial places of participants in terrorist acts may become a shrine for certain extremist individuals and be used by them as a means of propaganda for the ideology of terrorism and involvement in terrorist activity .", "In such circumstances , the federal legislature may introduce special arrangements governing the burial of individuals whose death occurred as a result of the interception of a terrorist act in which they were taking part . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The ruling further noted that the application of the measures prescribed in the legislation could be regarded as justified if proper procedural safeguards , such as effective judicial review , were in place to protect individuals from arbitrariness . The court noted that Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided for such review .", "CARDINAL . In sum , ORG upheld the impugned provisions as being in conformity with the LAW but at the same time interpreted them as requiring that the authorities refrain from burying bodies unless a court had confirmed the competent authority \u2019s decision . It reasoned as follows :", "\u201c ... The constitutional and legal meaning of the existing norms presupposes the possibility of bringing court proceedings to challenge a decision to discontinue , on account of the deaths of the suspects , a criminal case against or prosecution of participants in a terrorist act . Accordingly , they also presuppose an obligation on the court \u2019s part to examine the substance of the complaint , that is , to verify the lawfulness and well - foundedness of the decision and the conclusions therein as regards the participation of the persons concerned in a terrorist act , and to establish the absence of grounds for rehabilitating [ the suspects ] and discontinuing the criminal case . They thus entail an examination of the lawfulness of the application of the aforementioned restrictive measures . Until the entry into force of the court judgment the deceased \u2019s remains can not be buried ; the relevant ORG bodies and officials must take all necessary measures to ensure that the bodies are disposed of in accordance with custom and tradition , in particular through the burial of the remains in the ground ... or by [ cremation ] , individually , if possible , and to ensure compliance prior thereto with the requirements concerning the identification of the deceased ... and of the time , location and cause of death ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON issued a separate opinion in which he agreed that the impugned provisions were in conformity with the LAW but held a different view as to how they should be interpreted . The opinion stated as follows :", "\u201c ... if the relevant law - enforcement agencies find , as a result of a preliminary investigation , that a terrorist act has been committed and that a given person was involved , but the criminal proceedings against that person ... are discontinued on account of his or her death following interception of the terrorist act , and if they then conclude that the decision to return the body to the family for burial is capable of threatening public order and peace and the health , morals , rights , lawful interests and safety of others , they are entitled to take a decision refusing to hand over the body and applying special arrangements for burial .", "At the same time , in the event of a refusal to return the body of an individual whose death occurred as the result of the interception of a terrorist act committed by him , the authorities competent to take a decision concerning the burial must secure compliance with all the requirements concerning the establishment of the deceased \u2019s identity , the time and place of death , the cause of death , the place of burial and the data necessary for the proper identification of the grave ( a given location and number ) . The burial must take place with the participation of the relatives , in accordance with custom and tradition and with humanitarian respect for the dead . The administrative authorities of a ORG governed by the rule of law must respect the cultural values of a multi - ethnic society , transmitted from generation to generation . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON issued a dissenting opinion in which he described the legislation in question as incompatible with the LAW . In particular , he noted :", "\u201c ... The impugned norms banning the return of the deceased \u2019s bodies to their relatives and providing for their anonymous burial are , in our view , absolutely immoral and reflect the most uncivilised , barbaric and base views of previous generations ...", "The right of every person to be buried in a dignified manner in accordance with the traditions and customs of his family hardly requires special justification or even to be secured in written form in law . This right is clearly self - evident and stems from human nature as , perhaps , no other natural right . Equally natural and uncontested is the right of every person to conduct the burial of a person who is related and dear to them , to have an opportunity to perform one \u2019s moral duty and display one \u2019s human qualities , to bid farewell , to grieve , mourn and commemorate the deceased , however he may be regarded by society and the state , to have the right to a grave , which in all civilisations represents a sacred value and the symbol of memory . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . After ORG judgment of DATE the domestic courts apparently changed their approach and agreed to review the formal lawfulness of the decisions of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants brought the following court proceedings in connection with the relevant decisions .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the above - mentioned sets of proceedings the applicants succeeded in having quashed the decisions of DATE and DATE in part . It appears that the domestic courts subsequently changed their position and the relevant judgments were later quashed by way of supervisory review . After these changes , the courts still could not review the need for application of the measures set out in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the Interment and Burial Act and Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE in individual cases .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants who took part in the identification of the bodies , for DATE following the events of CARDINAL and DATE the corpses ( except for the bodies of the relatives of the fourth and sixth applicant , who died at other dates and were identified later ) were kept in the town morgue and other locations in wholly unsatisfactory conditions . In particular , the bodies gave off an intense smell owing to the lack of proper refrigeration and were chaotically piled on top of CARDINAL other .", "CARDINAL . In response to a letter from the applicants requesting an explanation for the appalling storage conditions , ORG stated in a letter of DATE that until a procedural decision in respect of the corpses had been taken they had been kept in specially equipped rooms in refrigerated chambers set to the appropriate temperature . The authorities refused to disclose the locality where the bodies were stored .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the following applicants participated in the identification procedure in person :", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , they had access to the bodies both in the GPE town morgue and in CARDINAL refrigerator wagons parked on a plot of land belonging to ORG . Provision of access to the bodies was random , as not everyone who wanted to take part in the identification process was admitted . In some cases the provision of access was not properly documented . Since the provision of access was limited , the relevant facilities were usually surrounded by crowds of relatives of the deceased .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the corpses in question had been initially held in the GPE town morgue . CARDINAL the applicants examined the corpses and the clothing . Thereafter the bodies were placed in CARDINAL refrigerator wagons . On DATE the wagons were moved to the town of GPE - on - Don for molecular genetic examinations and on DATE all bodies were cremated . CARDINAL and DATE the person in charge of the identification procedure was the head of the investigation group investigator PERSON of CARDINAL October DATE he was replaced by investigator ORG also acknowledged that immediately after the attack no facilities had been available to keep the bodies .", "CARDINAL .
