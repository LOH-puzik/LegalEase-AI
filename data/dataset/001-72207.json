THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant entered the GPE in DATE . From his relationship with the second applicant , who has been lawfully residing in the GPE since DATE and holds a permanent residence permit ( vestigingsvergunning ) , a child , PERSON , was born on DATE . The applicants married on DATE . DATE , the first applicant filed a request for a residence permit for the purposes of forming a family unit ( gezinsvorming ) with his wife and working in the GPE . This permit was granted on DATE . On DATE the first applicant acquired the right to remain in the GPE indefinitely ex jure pursuant to LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was arrested and placed in detention on remand . ORG of GPE convicted the first applicant on DATE of participating in an organisation aimed at committing offences and of being a co - perpetrator ( medepleger ) of intentionally being in the possession of QUANTITY of heroin , committed on or DATE . The first applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In respect of the determination of this sentence , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c ... in the decision to impose a sentence involving a deprivation of liberty and the duration thereof , ORG is in particular taking account of the fact that the accused has for a long time let his house be used as a safe house for quantities , of considerable size and suitable for further distribution , of a substance harmful to public health , so that only a prison sentence of considerable duration is appropriate . \u201d", "The first applicant was released on DATE . He went back to live with his wife and child and found a job .", "CARDINAL . Due to marital problems , the applicants did not live together for some time in DATE . On DATE the first applicant \u2019s name was removed from the municipal register as living at the same address as his spouse . He was registered as once again living in the matrimonial home on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE both applicants went to ORG as they were going to resume cohabitation and wanted to prolong the first applicant \u2019s residence permit . However , an official at that ORG told them it would be better if the first applicant applied for an independent residence permit . For that reason , an application was made for prolongation of the first applicant \u2019s residence permit or for an amendment of the restrictions attached to that permit so that it would enable him to reside in the GPE for the purpose of working in salaried employment without being required to live with his spouse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a second child , PERSON , was born to the applicants . Both children have NORP nationality .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) informed the first applicant on DATE of her intention to impose a DATE exclusion order on him by declaring him an undesirable alien ( ongewenst vreemdeling ) . The first applicant was invited to submit his views on the matter . By letter of DATE the first applicant declared that he would never again do anything wrong and asked to be given a second chance .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister rejected the request for prolongation of the residence permit on DATE . According to the Deputy Minister , the first applicant had lost his indefinite right to remain on DATE when he had ceased to cohabit with his wife . The fact that the spouses had in the meantime resumed cohabitation did not have the effect of reviving this right ex jure . Although GPE policy provided that aliens , following the dissolution or breakdown of their marriage on the basis of which they had acquired an indefinite right to remain , could under certain circumstances , relating to the duration of the marriage , be eligible for an independent residence permit , the prolongation of a residence permit could also be refused on general interest grounds . In view of the first applicant \u2019s criminal conviction of DATE , the Deputy Minister considered that it was justified to deny the first applicant further residence and to impose a DATE exclusion order . The interference with the first applicant \u2019s right to respect for his family life was held to be justified in the interests of public order and for the prevention of crime . Having regard to the seriousness of the offences committed by the first applicant and the duration of the prison sentence imposed on him , the Deputy Minister concluded that the interests of the ORG outweighed those of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision . It was rejected on DATE by the Deputy Minister who adopted the advice issued by ORG ( PERSON voor ORG ) . ORG was of the opinion that the first applicant \u2019s request should be considered as a request for an independent residence permit ( onafhankelijke verblijfsvergunning ) in view of the fact that the right to remain indefinitely , pursuant to LAW DATE , did not constitute a residence permit which was eligible for prolongation or for amendment of the restrictions attached to it . ORG further considered , notwithstanding the fact that the first applicant had moved back to the matrimonial home after a separation of DATE , that the breakdown of the applicants\u2019 marriage had been of a permanent nature given the duration of the separation and the first applicant \u2019s request for an independent residence permit which did not require him to cohabit with his wife . Therefore , the question to be examined was whether , at the time of losing the indefinite right to remain , the first applicant had been eligible for continued residence ( voortgezet verblijf ) .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the first applicant \u2019s criminal conviction , which implied that he had violated public order , ORG considered that the request for a residence permit should be refused and an exclusion order imposed . It saw no merit in the first applicant \u2019s expressions of regret nor in his arguments to the effect that his wife and CARDINAL children resided in the GPE and that he had been working in the GPE since DATE . In this connection the ORG , referring to the duration of and the reasons for the prison sentence as set out in the judgment of ORG of DATE , had regard to the nature and seriousness of the offence of which the first applicant had been convicted . ORG did not consider that the period of time between the conviction and the imposition of the exclusion order was so long that for that reason alone the authorities ought to refrain from taking that measure . In this respect it was borne in mind that the first applicant had held an indefinite right to remain from DATE until DATE which , pursuant to the policy in force , stood in the way of an exclusion order being imposed .", "Finally , as far as the first applicant \u2019s rights under LAW were concerned , ORG considered that the interests of the ORG outweighed those of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE , sitting in GPE . He argued , inter alia , that there had not been any breakdown of his marriage , let alone one of a permanent nature . The spouses had merely not cohabited for DATE because of marital problems ; however , the first applicant had remained in contact with his wife . Moreover , during this time their child PERSON had been conceived . The first applicant was gainfully employed , did not constitute a threat to public order and he had extricated himself from the criminal circles in which he had previously been involved . In the view of the first applicant , it was unreasonable to deny him continued residence and to impose an exclusion order on him DATE after his criminal conviction .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG agreed with the Deputy Minister that the applicants\u2019 actual close family ties ( feitelijke gezinsband ) had been severed as a result of their temporary separation and that as a result the first applicant had lost his indefinite right to remain . It upheld the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision in so far as the denial of continued residence was concerned . Having regard to the nature of the offence of which the first applicant was convicted and the length of the prison sentence imposed , ORG considered that the interference with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for family life was necessary in the interests of the protection of public order . In respect of the exclusion order , which denied the first applicant the right to visit the GPE even for short periods , ORG quashed the impugned decision . It found that insufficient weight had been accorded to the interests of the applicants and their children . Thus , no attention had been given to the consequences which the exclusion order would have for the applicants and their children , both in the case where the other family members would follow the first applicant to GPE and in the case where they would remain in the GPE . In this connection ORG noted that the children , who had close links with the GPE as they had been residing there since their birth , might at this stage of their lives have a great need for regular contacts with their father within their own surroundings ( levenssfeer ) , and not exclusively abroad . The exclusion order rendered such contacts \u2013 including occasional contacts \u2013 impossible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister decided anew on the first applicant \u2019s objection in so far as this concerned the exclusion order . She declared the objection well - founded and lifted the exclusion order .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant has not reoffended and has been in paid employment ever since his release from prison .", "CARDINAL . At the time relevant to the present application , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) . On DATE a new Aliens Act entered into force but this has no bearing on the present case .", "CARDINAL . Aliens married to a GPE national , a recognised refugee or a holder of a permanent residence permit acquired , after DATE of legal residence , ex jure an indefinite right to remain pursuant to LAW DATE . This right expired ex jure when the alien no longer actually formed part of his or her spouse \u2019s family unit . If the married couple ceased , other than temporarily , to live together , this was indicative of a breakdown in family relations even if the marital bond was preserved . The residence permit was not automatically reinstated if the actual close family ties were later restored . The alien could , however , apply for a new one , for the purposes of residence with his or her spouse , or for a residence permit in his or her own right .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the policy laid down in chapters PERSON and PERSON of LAW DATE ( PERSON DATE ) , an alien who has been given a custodial sentence by a NORP or foreign court ( at least part of which sentence was not suspended ) , by a judgment that has become final and conclusive , for intentionally committing a crime punishable by a custodial sentence of DATE or more , could be refused permission for continued residence in the country . Underlying this policy is the principle that the longer an alien has lawfully resided in the GPE , the more serious a crime has to be before it may justify refusing continued residence ; the authorities thus apply a \u201c sliding scale \u201d ( glijdende schaal ) . The seriousness of a crime is determined on the basis of the sentence attached to it . To determine whether an alien may be refused permission for continued residence , the length of the sentence imposed is compared to the length of time that the alien had been living in the GPE when he or she committed the crime .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with this policy , an alien who , at the time of committing the offence , had been residing lawfully in the GPE for DATE like the first applicant in the present case \u2013 would be refused permission for continued residence if he or she was sentenced to an unsuspended prison sentence of DATE .", "CARDINAL . An alien who has been sentenced by a final and conclusive judgment for an offence intentionally committed , punishable by a term of imprisonment of DATE or more , was also liable to an exclusion order ( LAW DATE ) . A person upon whom an exclusion order has been imposed is not allowed , for as long as the order is in force , either to reside in the GPE or to visit it .", "CARDINAL . Continued residence could not be refused to , and an exclusion order not imposed on , aliens with an indefinite right to remain pursuant to LAW DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
