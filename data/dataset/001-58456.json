The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in GPE in DATE and lives at FAC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s mother died on CARDINAL DATE of HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) encephalopathy , having been infected after a blood transfusion . She left CARDINAL children : a son , PERSON , born out of wedlock in DATE and legitimised by his mother \u2019s marriage in DATE , and the applicant , born in DATE , on whose birth certificate only his mother \u2019s name was entered as a parent , she being still married at the time of his birth , but living separately from her husband . They divorced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON brought an action against the applicant in the NORP tribunal de grande instance seeking an order that his mother \u2019s estate be divided by a notary , that the applicant , as an adulterine child , could not lay claim to CARDINAL of it and that there be deposited with the notary a sum of money unlawfully withdrawn by the applicant from his mother \u2019s account and transferred to a personal account while their mother was in a coma .", "CARDINAL . In his pleadings , the applicant agreed to the appointment of a notary to divide the estate , but submitted that LAW , which restricts the inheritance rights of adulterine children , was discriminatory and incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , the provisions of LAW on the Rights of the Child and Article CARDINAL of LAW , which enshrines the principle that children born in wedlock and children born out of wedlock have equal rights . He requested the court to hold that he had the same inheritance rights as a legitimate child . He also submitted that the amount which he had been requested to deposit with a notary had been transferred as a gift which he was not required to bring into account , as evidenced by a letter from the deceased of DATE , a general power of attorney for bank transactions , dated DATE , and witness statements .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the court ordered the estate to be divided . With regard to the applicant \u2019s rights , it referred to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The court conceded that LAW represented a derogation from the principle , enshrined in the first paragraph of LAW , that children should be treated equally regardless of descent , but held that its purpose was not to discriminate between children on the grounds of their birth but to ensure minimum compliance with marital commitments on the part of the married parent who engenders an illegitimate child . It accordingly concluded that LAW was necessary in order to protect the rights of others and that it was a principle of public policy which was not contrary to the Convention .", "In respect of the sum which had been withdrawn by the applicant and transferred to his own account , the court held that the applicant had merely executed his mother \u2019s intention to gift him a sum of money in addition to his share in the estate and that although that gift should notionally be brought into account in calculating the disposable portion of the estate , it was inappropriate as matters stood to order that the amount in question be deposited with the notary dividing the estate .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed , arguing , among other things , that LAW was incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the provisions of the lower court \u2019s judgment ordering the estate to be divided and determining the applicant \u2019s inheritance rights . It considered , however , that the amount transferred to the applicant \u2019s account should be returned to the estate to be divided because he had not proved that his mother had intended it as a gift .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the complaint that the discrimination between legitimate children and adulterine children was incompatible with the provisions of the Convention , ORG held :", "\u201c In the instant case the provisions of LAW , which limit the inheritance rights of adulterine children , are directly linked to the NORP legal principle of public policy according to which marriage should be monogamous and the interests of the spouse and legitimate children of an adulterer protected .", "Article CARDINAL was not enacted in order to disadvantage adulterine children , but to protect the interests of the spouse and legitimate children of an adulterer ; the provision does not therefore intentionally discriminate against adulterine children , but ensures the protection of children born of the marriage who might be disadvantaged on the division of their GPE estate by the presence of an adulterine child who , on account of the predecease of the non - adulterous spouse and the system of matrimonial property elected by the spouses , might otherwise inherit from his or her parent both the assets from that parent \u2019s estate and the assets from the estate of the spouse who is not his or her parent .", "The court was thus properly entitled to hold that it was not the intention of the legislature to discriminate between children on the grounds of their birth , but to ensure minimum compliance with the marital obligations of a married parent with regard to his or her legitimate children ; the court was also properly entitled to hold that LAW was a provision necessary for the protection of the rights of others , that it was a NORP legal principle of public policy and that it was not contrary to LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law to ORG , which delivered its judgment on DATE .", "With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint of unjustified discrimination on grounds of birth between children born in wedlock and children born out of wedlock , contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , ORG held that inheritance rights had nothing to do with respect for private and family life guaranteed by LAW .", "In respect of the complaint that ORG had ordered the sum transferred to the applicant \u2019s account to be returned to the estate to be divided , ORG held that in deciding that the facts of the case had not shown any intention on the part of the deceased to bestow a gift on her son in advance of the division of her estate ORG had determined an issue which it alone had jurisdiction to determine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and Haemophiliacs awarded the applicant , in his personal capacity , compensation of MONEY ( ORG ) and assessed the deceased \u2019s loss at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , to be paid to her heirs . That amount was thus paid to the notary dealing with the estate and the applicant subsequently received CARDINAL of it .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW , introduced by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , provide :", "\u201c Children or their issue shall inherit from their father and mother , grandfathers , grandmothers or other ancestors , irrespective of sex or primogeniture , and even if they are born of different marriages .", "The estate shall devolve upon them in equal portions and per capita if they are all first degree issue and heirs in their own right ; they shall inherit per stirpes if all or some of them inherit through their ascendants . \u201d", "\u201c Children born out of wedlock shall , in general , inherit from their father and mother or other ancestors , as well as from their brothers and sisters or other collateral relatives , on the same terms as legitimate children . \u201d", "\u201c Children born out of wedlock whose father or mother was , at the time of their conception , bound by a marriage of which legitimate children were born are entitled to inherit from that parent in competition with the legitimate children ; however , they shall each receive CARDINAL of the share to which they would have been entitled if all the children of the deceased , including themselves , had been legitimate .", "The children born of the marriage injured by the adultery shall inherit in addition the fraction by which the adulterine child \u2019s share of the estate is thus reduced ; it shall be divided between them in proportion to their share in the estate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW on the Rights of the Child , which came into force on DATE , read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . DATE States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind , irrespective of the child \u2019s or his or her parent \u2019s or legal guardian \u2019s race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , property , disability , birth or other status .", "CARDINAL . DATE States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status , activities , expressed opinions , or beliefs of the child \u2019s parents , legal guardians , or family members . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a report entitled \u201c Status and Protection of Children \u201d , adopted in DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat referred to the issue of equal treatment of children regardless of descent in the following terms :", "\u201c The restriction of adulterine children \u2019s inheritance rights is the subject of much criticism . It appears to be in direct conflict with the principle that children should be treated equally regardless of descent and constitutes an infringement of the principles enshrined in the Civil Code according to which children born out of wedlock have , in general , the same rights as children born in wedlock . Such discrimination , based on descent , also appears to be contrary to LAW and to FAC . It should therefore be abolished . \u201d", "The PERSON d\u2019Etat \u2019s report also sets out socio - demographic data . It emerges from the report that as at DATE CARDINAL in CARDINAL children had been born out of wedlock , this being true of CARDINAL in CARDINAL births in DATE . In addition to that , major shifts in family models appeared during DATE , \u201c with a PERCENT decrease in the annual number of marriages DATE , CARDINAL times more births out of wedlock over DATE , and a rise in the number of cohabiting unmarried couples so sharp that it is now the typical first union for CARDINAL in CARDINAL NORP citizens ... as for divorces , the annual figure had already almost doubled DATE , and it doubled again during DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A government bill , registered on DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) , proposed bringing the inheritance rights of adulterine children into line with that of other children . It was subsequently abandoned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG instructed PERSON , a sociologist , to study shifts in family models . The report , entitled \u201c Couples , Descent and Kinship DATE \u201d was submitted on DATE . It found that there was no sociological fracture according to whether couples were married or not , and criticised the inegalitarian status of adulterine children .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a working group on family law was set up by the Minister of ORG to consider , among other things , \u201c possible changes to the law in the light of factual developments \u201d in order to avoid \u201c a gulf developing between [ ORG ] aspirations and the law \u201d . Chaired by Professor PERSON , the commission submitted its report on DATE . It contained a set of proposals for \u201c renovating family law \u201d . In particular , the commission recommended \u201c giving full effect to the principle that children should be treated equally regardless of descent \u201d as follows :", "\u201c The principle that children should be treated equally regardless of descent was CARDINAL of the CARDINAL guiding principles underlying the CARDINAL January CARDINAL Act . At the time , a compromise had to be made , however , and full equality was not achieved . DATE , it appears essential to complete the exercise and achieve full equal treatment of children regardless of descent . In order to attain that objective , full equality of status needs to be achieved and the right to affiliation made equal so that the possibility of establishing or contesting descent will no longer depend on the GPE legal status .", "SSCARDINAL . Achieving equality of status", "The working group considers , unanimously and unhesitatingly , that the time has come to abolish the legal restrictions on adulterine children \u2019s inheritance rights . The current position is that their rights are halved where they are competing with half- brothers and sisters or with the adulterer \u2019s spouse .", "A number of arguments militate strongly in favour of abolition . The first is quite simply chronological . The solutions adopted by the CARDINAL January CARDINAL Act constituted , according to the most eminent commentators , \u2018 an inglorious trade - off\u2019 , the fruit of a \u2018 PERSON of ORG . That compromise was necessary as a transitional phase during which the principle of equality which the LAW had intended to promote could be progressively inserted into our law . DATE , the transitional phase has come to an end . The second argument stems from the case - law of ORG . It is likely that the ORG will soon find that the NORP rule violates the LAW , and it would be preferable for an amendment of our law not to appear to be imposed from outside . Lastly , and above all , the solution favoured by the group of making the law of descent equal by abolishing divisive classifications makes it more and more difficult to maintain inequalities based on conditions of birth , without inevitably incurring the CARDINAL - fold complaint of injustice and contradiction .", "Is there a danger that the importance of marriage will be lessened by undermining the trust which husbands and wives have placed in each other ? The group does not think so . Adultery is clearly a serious injury inflicted on the spouse who is the victim of it and , over and above the spouses , on the children born of their marriage . In more legal terms , adultery is always an instance of misconduct and can be serious misconduct , for the duty of fidelity is inherent in the marital commitment . If such misconduct must be punished , however , it is only those who have committed it who should be punished and certainly not , we feel , the child born as a result . It is contradictory to declare on the one hand that parents have equal responsibility for their children irrespective of how they choose to lead their life as a couple and , on the other hand , to impose on a child , on the grounds that he or she is adulterine , the consequences of the parent \u2019s infidelity .", "More specifically , to enforce marital duties through inheritance rights appears to be neither fair nor appropriate . For CARDINAL thing , relations between husband and wife will often have been broken off well before the birth of the child , and there is therefore something hypocritical about imposing on that child the ties of a commitment from which those who entered into it have long since freed themselves . For another thing , even if the marital ties have remained intact until the end , is it not vain to hope that a hereditary advantage will succeed in healing a split which by its very nature belongs to a completely different realm ? Moreover , as the law currently stands , it is almost always possible for the child \u2019s parent to \u2018 ORG this reduction in rights by legitimising DATE after divorcing and re - marrying , or , without divorcing , by seeking a court order DATE or even adopting the child . Far from making the rule more easily bearable , that option has the effect of leaving the child \u2019s ultimate destiny to the discretion of the adulterous parent . Thus the current provisions have the effect of multiplying inequalities , without succeeding in strongly affirming the importance of the marital commitment .", "We add that we are not in favour of an intermediate solution whereby the current protection afforded by law to children born in wedlock ( particularly Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) would be abolished , while the protection afforded to the wronged spouse , the direct victim of the adultery , under ORG and CARDINAL , second paragraph , would be maintained . The effect of that solution would be minimum compliance with the international conventions , whose sole concern is to secure equality between children , whereas the protective provisions specific to the spouse apply , by definition , only where the deceased leaves no other issue . Such a hybrid solution would merely be a means of failing to resolve the debate . What is actually at issue is not only material equality between children born of different partnerships in the division of their common parent \u2019s estate , but , in both more abstract and stronger terms , equality of the rights conferred by descent .", "Proposal :", "\u2013 Abolish the restrictions on adulterine children \u2019s inheritance rights . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
