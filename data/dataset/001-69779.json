In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) specialised in pulmonary diseases diagnosed the applicant as suffering from asbestosis and various other diseases and determined that he qualified for second - degree disability . From that point on the applicant was undergoing DATE medical examinations at the ORG , and each time his diagnosis and degree of disability were confirmed .", "CARDINAL . Apparently due to a deterioration of the applicant 's health , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE the competent ORG revised his disability to firstdegree , without the need for another person 's assistance . Later , on CARDINAL DATE , another ORG decided that the applicant qualified for firstdegree disability in need of another person 's assistance .", "CARDINAL . The chief expert at ORG ( \u201c the CLEMC \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) at ORG appealed against the latter decision . On DATE the ORG overturned the ORG 's decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE and the applicant 's disability status was set back to seconddegree .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a threemember panel of the court declared the applicant 's appeal inadmissible . It held that the appealed decision was not subject to judicial review , in accordance with section CARDINAL(c ) of LAW of DATE , section CARDINALa of Regulation no . CARDINAL of ORG , and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to a fivemember panel of ORG , arguing that the refusal of the CARDINAL - member panel to examine the appeal was contrary to LAW . He submitted that the CLEMC 's determination directly affected the amount of disability pension that was allotted to him .", "CARDINAL . The fivemember panel upheld the CARDINAL - member panel 's decision in a final decision of DATE , holding that under section CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE the CLEMC 's decisions were final and not subject to judicial review .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law , as it stood at the relevant time , there existed QUANTITY of disability , differentiated according to the character and the course of the disabling illness , the functional status of the ailing organ and of the organism as a whole , and the requirements of the disabled 's profession ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Regulation no . CARDINAL on the expert assessment of longlasting incapacity to work , issued by ORG in DATE and superseded in DATE by a newer statutory instrument ) . The first degree of disability was reserved for persons who had , due to their state of health , lost all ability for work , or persons with durable , incurable , or worsening ailments set forth in a special list ( section CARDINAL of the Regulation ) ; the second one covered persons who had lost the ability to perform theirs or any other work , but who could be accommodated for work under conditions suitable for their health , or persons with durable , incurable , or worsening ailments set forth in the above list ( section CARDINAL of the Regulation ) ; and the third one covered persons who , as a result of their state of health , had to change their profession with one requiring lower qualifications , or who had to change their conditions of work within the same profession ( section CARDINAL of the Regulation ) . If a person was disabled on account of several illnesses , the decision determining his or her disability status had to set forth his or her degree of disability pursuant to each of the separate illnesses , as well as the overall degree of disability ( section CARDINAL of the Regulation ) .", "CARDINAL . Persons with a firstdegree disability were divided in CARDINAL subcategories : those who needed another person 's assistance , and those who did not . The determination who was in need of such assistance was made on the basis of the findings about that person 's need of everyday care , help or supervision ( section CARDINAL of the Regulation ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , as in force at the material time , provided that the amount of the professional disability pension was to be set pursuant to the degree of disability : those under the first degree were entitled to PERCENT of their average earnings , those under the second degree to PERCENT , and those under the third PERCENT . The amount of the general disability pension was to be likewise set pursuant to the degree of disability : PERCENT , PERCENT and PERCENT respectively ( section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Persons with a firstdegree disability in need of another person 's assistance were entitled , in addition to the pension they received , to a further PERCENT of the amount of the social pension ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The LEMCs and the CLEMC were established pursuant to the abovementioned Regulation no . CARDINAL under the authority of ORG ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Regulation ) . The LEMCs were responsible for , inter alia , determining the degree of a person 's disability ( section CARDINAL of the Regulation ) . The CLEMC heard appeals against decisions of the LEMCs ( section CARDINAL of the Regulation ) .", "CARDINAL . The presidents and the members of the commissions , who were exclusively medical professionals ( section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of the Regulation ) , were remunerated under employment contracts they entered into with the local mayors , the Minister of Health , or the medical directors of the local hospitals ( section ORG ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the Regulation ) .", "CARDINAL . There were no written rules regulating the procedure before the commissions . Regulation no . CARDINAL provided only that they had to proceed on the basis of an examination of the person concerned and of medical documents , making no provision for witness testimony or other evidence . No hearings were held .", "CARDINAL . By LAW , all \u201c administrative acts \u201d are subject to judicial review , unless otherwise provided by statute .

Section CARDINAL(c ) of LAW of DATE provided that the CLEMC 's decisions pursuant to appeals by the disabled or the administration were final . So did section CARDINALa of the abovementioned Regulation no . CARDINAL and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In contrast to the previous practice , in a series of decisions and judgments starting with a reported decision of CARDINAL DATE in which it quashed a decision of ORG declaring an appeal against the decision of a special medical commission inadmissible , ORG started allowing judicial appeals against the decisions of special medical commissions . It reasoned that the general rule under LAW was that administrative acts were subject to judicial review unless otherwise provided by statute . The commissions ' decisions affected the individuals ' rights and were thus administrative acts within the meaning of LAW and section QUANTITY of the ORG . Since the exclusion of judicial review of the commissions ' decisions was set out in statutory instruments , it was invalid and their decisions were appealable before a court . In a number of those judgments and decisions the court also relied on LAW and , in particular , its access - to - a - court requirement ( \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , ORG , ORG ; \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u0433. , PERSON , ORG ; \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , ORG , ORG ; \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433 , ORG , ORG ; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , PERSON , \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 ) .", "CARDINAL .
