She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by PERSON , as Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE an indictment was issued against Mr PERSON ( the founder of a supermarket chain , FAC , from which a multinational company ORG had originated ) , his son PERSON , Chief Executive Officer of ORG , his daughter PERSON and PERSON , a former Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the ORG . It resulted from a criminal investigation instigated following a complaint by a Mr PERSON in GPE , a former colleague of ORG Executive Officer of ORG .", "ORG was a major shareholder in CARDINAL-prentmi\u0111lum ( CARDINAL ORG ) , which was the publisher of , inter alia , GPE , a national newspaper in GPE .", "At the material time there was an ongoing public debate in GPE relating to allegations that undue influence had been exerted by prominent figures on the most extensive criminal investigations ever carried out in GPE .", "On CARDINAL , DATE and DATE PERSON published , without the applicant \u2019s knowledge or consent , a number of e - mail communications which she had sent to and received from other named persons . The disputed material , consisted of direct quotations or paraphrasing of e - mail exchanges , dating back to DATE and DATE , between PERSON , the applicant and PERSON , former editor of another newspaper , ORG , and between the applicant and T.J , then Deputy Chief Executive Officer of ORG . The communications related inter alia to PERSON \u2019s wishes to find a suitable lawyer to assist him in handing over to the police allegedly incriminating material he had in his possession and to represent him in a future court case against the leaders of ORG ; PERSON acting as an intermediary between PERSON and ORG Advocate J\u00f3n PERSON ; the applicant \u2019s recommendation to PERSON that he choose PERSON ; arrangements discussed between the applicant and PERSON on the handing over of material to the tax authorities ; the applicant \u2019s suggestion to him that he interview PERSON . In relation to the recommendation of PERSON , reference was made to PERSON , managing Director of ORG .", "The disputed publication also included information about the applicant \u2019s own financial situation and claims , her suggestion to PERSON that the interview with PERSON should not take place until her own claims had been honoured ; her claims against PERSON of ORG ; her intention conveyed to PERSON to publicise the documents she held in her possession unless ORG honoured her claims ; and PERSON \u2019s suggestion to hand the documents over to the authorities if she thought that ORG had acted unlawfully .", "By the time of the disputed publications , the applicant had become a well - known figure in NORP society ; in DATE she had announced her candidacy for the forthcoming local council elections in GPE , due to be held in DATE .", "The applicant submitted that , without her knowledge or consent , the e - mails had been unlawfully obtained by a third party unknown to her . Before the national courts she submitted that she had previously ran a company Aktiverum ehf . , which had operated a fitness centre under the name ORG . The company had had a computer domain , where the applicant and other employees had been allocated e - mail addresses . She alone knew the password to her e - mail account at the company . In DATE the company had been wound up and its assets sold , including the computer , or server , on which the employees\u2019 e - mail accounts had been located . No information was available as to whether the administrator of the company \u2019s estate had taken measures to delete e - mails from the server before it was sold . Whilst the materials in question had been printed from her e - mail account in DATE or DATE , the computer which she had used in DATE had long since become inoperative .", "According to the applicant , after the first publication on DATE , she demanded PERSON \u2019s editor to discontinue further publications and to hand the e - mails over to her , but the editor refused . According to the editor , the applicant had only asked whether his intention was to continue publishing , to which he had responded in the affirmative . She had not asked to have further publication stopped or to have the material handed over to her .", "On DATE , the applicant requested the Reykjav\u00edk District Commissioner to issue an injunction ( sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the Seizures , Injunctions ( Etc . ) Act , No . DATE ) against CARDINAL ehf , restraining the latter from \u201c publishing [ the applicant \u2019s ] private materials in the DATE newspaper \u2018 Fr\u00e9ttabla\u00f0i\u00f0\u2019 or in other media owned by the respondent , in part or in their entirety , by means of direct or indirect quotation , irrespective of whether the materials involved were e - mails of which the plaintiff was the sender or the recipient , or other such personal private documents of the plaintiff which the respondent had in its keeping . \u201d", "The applicant further requested that the District Commissioner remove from the respondent all the aforementioned private materials which the respondent had in its possession and which had been used , or which were evidently intended for use , in the actions in respect of which the injunction was being requested ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "In addition , the applicant requested that the injunction be imposed without prior notice and served at the respondent \u2019s business LOC ( section CARDINAL and item CARDINAL of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "On DATE the District Commissioner , without prior notice and with immediate effect , imposed the requested injunction against further publication and urged the respondent to hand over all the material as requested by the applicant . PERSON \u2019s news editor , PERSON affirmed that he had the documents in question in his possession and handed them over to the District Commissioner , who took them into his custody . The respondent \u2019s lawyer declared that he accepted the release of the materials and met the applicant \u2019s demands .", "The above injunction was imposed temporarily , pending the outcome of the proceedings described below .", "According to the Government no information originating from e - mails pertaining to the applicant was published either pending the court proceedings or after . This is undisputed by the applicant .", "In DATE the applicant instituted judicial proceedings before ORG against the publisher , CARDINAL ehf . , and ORG editor . She requested ORG to confirm the District Commissioner \u2019s injunction and seizure of the material kept by the publisher but made no further claims in this respect . She did not request that the materials be handed over to her .", "The applicant requested that the editor , PERSON , be convicted and sentenced for having obtained access to her private materials , which had been stored in machine - readable ( computerised ) form , by trickery or another similar unlawful method , and had pried into their contents , in violation of LAW . She also requested that he be convicted and sentenced under LAW , pursuant to which any person who publicly disclosed the private affairs of another person without sufficient justification shall be liable to pay a fine or be sentenced to a term of DATE imprisonment . In addition , she sought an order against both defendants requiring them to pay her compensation for non - pecuniary damage under , inter alia , section CARDINAL of LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s action on every point .", "In her appeal to ORG the applicant dropped her claims under LAW ) and instead relied on LAW ; she omitted to pursue her claims of violations of LAW no . CARDINAL and LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL which had been rejected by ORG ; otherwise she maintained her claims before the latter .", "On DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment , giving the following reasoning :", "\u201c III", "As is stated above , on DATE the appellant had an injunction imposed on the publication by the defendant , CARDINAL ehf . , \u201c of the injunction plaintiff \u2019s private materials in the newspaper ORG or in other media owned by the injunction respondent , in part or in their entirety , through direct or indirect quotation , irrespective of whether the materials involved were e - mails of which the injunction plaintiff is the sender or the recipient , or other such personal private documents of the plaintiff which the defendant had in its keeping .", "Following this , she brought a legal action by a writ of summons issued by the president of ORG on DATE , the case being registered on DATE . In the writ issued by ORG , the plaintiff made the demand that the injunction be confirmed , and also that the court confirmed the decision by the GPE Commissioner to seize materials in the keeping of the defendant , CARDINAL ehf . No demand was made , on the other hand , regarding the rights in respect of which the appellant had sought temporary protection under the injunction , nor that the aforementioned materials be handed over to her . In this respect , the appellant \u2019s demands before ORG , which are similar , are at variance with the rule of the second paragraph of LAW . DATE , which states that a court judgment confirming both an injunction and the rights which it is designed to protect are to be sought in one and the same action . Nevertheless , this flaw in the plaintiff \u2019s claim is not sufficient , in itself , to result in the dismissal of the case . On the other hand , the plaintiff must content herself with the fact that in this case , the ORG \u2019s resolution will extend solely to whether the formal and material conditions for confirming the injunction obtain .", "As has been stated above , the plaintiff applied , in her request for an injunction , to have the defendant , CARDINAL ehf . , prevented from publishing matter from unspecified private materials of hers , in their entirety or in part , and irrespective of whether this were done through direct or indirect quotation . Even though the plaintiff sought to define the content of her demand more precisely by stating that this applied to e - mails which she had either sent or received , and other similar personal private documents , no precise statement was made as to whether her demand covered all matters appearing in these materials , irrespective of whether they were generally known or corroborated by other available sources . No distinction was made in her demand between materials originating from the appellant herself or directed to her by those who sent her messages , and materials which had nothing to do with her but nevertheless had come into her possession . No further explanation was given , in the appellant \u2019s injunction request , of what was meant by the words \u201c other such personal private documents , \u201d and no evidence has been revealed to suggest that such documents came into the possession of the defendant , CARDINAL ehf . No attempt was made to define in further detail what matters these documents were considered to refer to . Under the circumstances , it was not possible to impose an injunction which it would be possible to maintain , in terms of its content , under the rules of section CARDINAL of the Act No . CARDINAL unless , as appropriate , the appellant had specified her demand in further detail at the time when the injunction was imposed and it came to light what materials this defendant had in its possession ( see the second paragraph of LAW ) . The appellant \u2019s request for an injunction was thus both too broad and too indefinite for it to be possible to grant it . In the light of these considerations , the ORG has no alternative but to reject the appellant \u2019s demand that it confirm the injunction .", "According to the established facts of the case , the District Commissioner has held in his cusotdy the materials that were removed from the keeping of the defendant , CARDINAL ehf . , when the injunction was imposed ( see the second paragraph of LAW No . DATE ) . Under LAW of the same LAW , it is not possible to seek a separate judgment confirming such a measure taken when an injunction is imposed : a ruling on the lawfulness of such a measure is to be made in connection with the validation of the measure as a whole . The appellant has not submitted any claim in this case for the ORG to adjudicate on her right to have these materials handed over to her from the keeping of the GPE Commissioner . The question therefore can not be entertained further in this case .", "IV", "Before ORG , the appellant demanded that the defendant , PERSON , be punished for violations of LAW . In the writ of summons it was stated that the defendant had violated this provision by obtaining access to the appellant \u2019s private materials , which had been stored in machine - readable form , by trickery or another similar unlawful method , and pried into their contents . This description in the writ of summons accords with the provision of the first paragraph of LAW , which prescribes punishment for such conduct ; that provision lists letters and other materials containing the private affairs of another person . Before ORG , the appellant has dropped her demand for punishment under the first and third paragraphs of LAW . She demands that the defendant be punished under the second paragraph of LAW , which prescribes punishment for rendering useless , or concealing , the private materials listed in the first paragraph of the same Article . In the writ of summons before ORG , the defendant \u2019s alleged conduct was not described in such a way that this provision could apply to it and the demand for punishment could be based on it ( see item d of the first paragraph of LAW of LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It follows immediately from this reason that the defendant can not be punished under the second paragraph of LAW .", "The appellant also bases her demand that the defendant , PERSON be punished on LAW , under which any person who publicly discloses the private affairs of another person in the absence of sufficient reason to justify the action , is to be subjected to a fine or up to one DATE \u2019s imprisonment . In connection with this demand , the ORG must resolve the question of whether the coverage in PERSON concerned the appellant \u2019s private affairs , which were to be found in the aforementioned computer documents , and if so , whether the newspaper disclosed them publicly in the absence of sufficient reason to justify doing so .", "It has been mentioned above that the coverage in the newspaper was based , to some extent , on correspondence between other persons , which passed to the appellant , and from her to the defendant , CARDINAL ehf . This correspondence contained nothing at all about the appellant , and the coverage in the newspaper that was based on it therefore did not constitute any violation against her . For the most part , the coverage in the newspaper was based on correspondence between the appellant herself and other persons which was no longer stored in her computer , but had come into the possession of other parties in printed form . Mention has been made above of the subject of that coverage , which involved the planning of charges against the managers of ORG ; the newspaper \u2019s coverage also focussed on e - mail correspondence between the appellant and another person concerning her financial claims against CARDINAL of the representatives of the company . Taking this into consideration , the ORG must concur with the appellant that PERSON \u2019s writings about her financial affairs concerned her private affairs in the sense of LAW , as did those parts of these writings which reported on the appellant \u2019s encouragement of , and her other involvement in , plans to bring charges against named individuals .", "Then there arises the argument by the defendants that there was sufficient reason to justify the publication of coverage that drew on the aforementioned e - mail correspondence and contained , amongst other things , the appellant \u2019s private affairs . In adjudicating on this , the ORG must take into consideration the fact that when PERSON \u2019s coverage appeared , matters connected with a charge concerning alleged criminal conduct by the managers of ORG had for a long time featured prominently in public discussion in GPE and been the subject of intense controversy resulting , amongst other things , from a police search of the LOC of the company in DATE and a charge against some of its managers in DATE . The newspaper \u2019s coverage contained material that was of public interest and concerned a case that had been the subject of great controversy in NORP society . Even though the coverage in the newspaper had included disclosures concerning the appellant \u2019s financial affairs , these affairs were , says the defendant , so closely intertwined with the news material as a whole that it was not possible to distinguish between them .", "The ORG concurs with the defendant that no greater encroachment was made on the appellant \u2019s private life than was unavoidable in a public discussion of a matter that was of concern to the public . Taking all this into consideration , the ORG can accept that sufficient reason existed to justify the publication of this coverage by the newspaper . The defendant , PERSON , can not be punished under LAW .", "Finally , the appellant demands that the defendants be ordered , jointly , to pay her compensation for non - pecuniary damage amounting to ORG CARDINAL under LAW of LAW , No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see LAW No . CARDINAL ) . The ORG reached the conclusion above that the limits of permitted expression were not overstepped in the coverage in PERSON . As is described in the summing - up in the ORG judgment , this claim has not been presented in such a way as to give occasion for accepting it on other grounds . The defendants must therefore be acquitted of this demand \u201d .", "On DATE another newspaper , DV , went further than other media in its discussion of the dealings between the applicant and the editor of Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 , in connection with the reporting on their e - mail correspondence .", "The applicant brought separate court proceedings against ORG \u2019s editors seeking their conviction and sentence under LAW , for having , in their newspaper report , disclosed her private affairs without sufficient reason .", "The editors argued that the news report in question was of interest and concern to the public in view of the public discussion about the connection between the persons referred to in the report and the PERSON case . At the same time , they pointed out that the applicant was a candidate in the primary round of selection of candidates for ORG for the elections to ORG , and that PERSON had been an influential figure in ORG and NORP politics in general for DATE . When such persons were connected by particular bonds at the same time as they were working for the advancement of a matter in which they were interested , in order to promote justice , as they saw it , it was important for the normal formation of opinion that the public be allowed to know about the connections that existed between the persons in question .", "ORG rejected these arguments by a judgment of DATE , and convicted both editors of a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW and sentenced them each to a fine of LAW and to pay her ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage . On an appeal by the editors , ORG , by a judgment of DATE , upheld the ORG judgment .", "Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG , No . CARDINAL may be found in its Chapter XXV on \u201c LAW against ORG \u201d . These provisions read :", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c Any person who pries into letters , documents , diaries or other comparable materials containing information about another person \u2019s private affairs , having gained access to the materials by trickery , opened letters , entered a locked container or employed another similar method , shall be liable to a fine or up to DATE imprisonment . The same punishment shall apply to a person who unlawfully obtains access to other ORG data or programs stored in a computerised form .", "The same punishment shall apply to the destruction or concealment of the private materials referred to in the first paragraph of this Article .", "Any person who pries into containers belonging to another person without sufficient reason shall be liable to up to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c Any person who publicly discloses the private affairs of another person in the absence of sufficient reason to justify the action shall be liable to a fine or up to DATE imprisonment . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of LAW , No .

Additionally , he should notify the sender that data were incorrectly received by him . It is obligatory to exercise the utmost confidentiality in such instances \u201d", "According to section CARDINAL violations of the Act were punishable by fines or imprisonment .", "The applicant also pointed to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW on ORG as regards ORG , no .
