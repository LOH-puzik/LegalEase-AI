In a judgment of DATE , the court declared the applicant to be partially incapacitated on the grounds that he had been suffering from simple schizophrenia since DATE , and that his ability to manage his own affairs and interests and to realise the consequences of his own acts had been impaired . The court found that the applicant \u2019s condition was not so serious as to warrant a declaration of total incapacity . It observed , in particular , that during the period from DATE he had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital on several occasions . The court took into account an expert medical report produced in the course of the proceedings and interviewed the applicant . Furthermore , according to certain other people it interviewed , the applicant had sold all his possessions , begged for a living , spent all his money on alcohol and became aggressive whenever he drank .", "CARDINAL .

It appears that the applicant \u2019s entire invalidity pension was transferred to the home to cover that amount . The agreement stipulated that PERCENT of the sum was to be used as payment for the services provided and PERCENT put aside for personal expenses .

He had only a bedside table in which to store his clothes , but he preferred to keep them in his bed at night for fear that they might be stolen and replaced with old clothes . The home \u2019s residents did not have their own items of clothing because clothes were not returned to the same people after being washed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asserted that the food provided at the home was insufficient and of poor quality . He had no say in the choice of meals and was not allowed to help prepare them .", "CARDINAL . Access to the bathroom , which was unhealthy and decrepit , was permitted once DATE . The toilets in the courtyard , which were unhygienic and in a very poor state of repair , consisted of holes in the ground covered by dilapidated shelters .

The ORG provided them all with clothes . The applicant did not dispute these assertions .", "CARDINAL . The home \u2019s management kept hold of the applicant \u2019s identity papers , allowing him to leave the home only with special permission from the Director . He regularly went to the village of ORG . It appears that during the visits he mainly provided domestic help to villagers or carried out tasks at the village restaurant .", "CARDINAL .

The third period of leave was authorised from DATE . After the applicant failed to return on the scheduled date , the Director of the home wrote to the Ruse municipal police on DATE , asking them to search for the applicant and transfer him to GPE , where employees of the home would be able to collect him and take him back to NORP . On DATE the Ruse police informed the Director that the applicant \u2019s whereabouts had been discovered but that the police could not transfer him because he was not the subject of a wanted notice .

The room was not heated in DATE and the residents kept their coats , hats and gloves on when inside . No other social , cultural or sports activities were available .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the staff at the social care home had refused to supply him with envelopes for his correspondence and that , as he did not have access to his own money , he could not buy any either . The staff would ask him to give them any sheets of paper he wished to post so that they could put them in envelopes and send them off for him .", "CARDINAL . It appears from a medical certificate of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that , following his placement in the home in DATE , the applicant was given anti - psychotic medication ( carbamazepine ( CARDINAL mg ) ) under the DATE supervision of a psychiatrist .", "CARDINAL . In addition , at ORG hearing the applicant \u2019s representatives stated that their client had been in stable remission since DATE and had not undergone any psychiatric treatment in DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the Director of the social care home and the home \u2019s social worker drew up evaluation reports on the applicant \u2019s behaviour and social skills . The reports indicated that the applicant was uncommunicative , preferred to stay on his own rather than join in group activities , refused to take his medication and had no close relatives to visit while on leave of absence . He was not on good terms with his CARDINAL - sister and nobody was sure whether he had anywhere to live outside the social care home . The reports concluded that it was impossible for the applicant to reintegrate into society , and set the objective of ensuring that he acquired the necessary skills and knowledge for social resettlement and , in the long term , reintegration into his family . It appears that he was never offered any therapy to that end .", "CARDINAL . The case file indicates that in DATE the applicant \u2019s guardian asked ORG to grant a social allowance to facilitate his reintegration into the community . Further to that request , on DATE the municipal social assistance department carried out a \u201c social assessment \u201d ( \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 ) of the applicant , which concluded that he was incapable of working , even in a sheltered environment , and had no need for training or retraining , and that in those circumstances he was entitled to a social allowance to cover the costs of his transport , subsistence and medication . On DATE the municipal social assistance department granted the applicant a DATE allowance of ORG MONEY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL) . On DATE the allowance was increased to ORG MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition , at his lawyer \u2019s request , the applicant was examined on DATE by Dr V.S. , a different psychiatrist from the one who regularly visited the social care home , and by a psychologist , ORG The report drawn up on that occasion concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia given on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was inaccurate in that the patient did not display all the symptoms of that condition . It stated that , although the applicant had suffered from the condition in the past , he had not shown any signs of aggression at the time of the examination but rather a suspicious attitude and a slight tendency towards \u201c verbal aggression \u201d ; that he had not undergone any treatment for the condition DATE ; and that his health had visibly stabilised . The report noted that no risk of deterioration of his mental health had been observed and stated that , in the opinion of the home \u2019s Director , the applicant was capable of reintegrating into society .", "CARDINAL . According to the report , the applicant \u2019s stay in the NORP social care home was very damaging to his health and it was desirable that he should leave the home , otherwise he was at risk of developing \u201c institutionalisation syndrome \u201d the longer he stayed there . The report added that it would be more beneficial to his mental health and social development to allow him to integrate into community life with as few restrictions as possible , and that the only aspect to monitor was his tendency towards alcohol abuse , which had been apparent prior to DATE . In the view of the experts who had examined the applicant , the behaviour of an alcohol - dependent person could have similar characteristics to that of a person with schizophrenia ; accordingly , vigilance was required in the applicant \u2019s case and care should be taken not to confuse the CARDINAL conditions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through his lawyer , asked the public prosecutor \u2019s office to apply to ORG to have his legal capacity restored . On DATE the public prosecutor requested the NORP social care home to send him a doctor \u2019s opinion and other medical certificates concerning the applicant \u2019s disorders in preparation for a possible application to the courts for restoration of his legal capacity . Further to that request , the applicant was admitted to a psychiatric hospital from DATE to DATE for a medical assessment . In a certificate issued on DATE , the doctors attested that the applicant showed symptoms of schizophrenia . As his health had not deteriorated since he had been placed in the home in DATE , the regime to which he was subject there had remained unchanged . He had been on maintenance medication since DATE under the DATE supervision of a psychiatrist . A psychological examination had revealed that he was agitated , tense and suspicious . His communication skills were poor and he was unaware of his illness . He had said that he wanted to leave the home at all costs . The doctors did not express an opinion either on his capacity for resettlement or on the need to keep him in the NORP social care home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the regional prosecutor refused to bring an action for restoration of the applicant \u2019s legal capacity on the grounds that , in the opinion of the doctors , the Director of the NORP social care home and the home \u2019s social worker , the applicant was unable to cope on his own , and that the home , where he could undergo medical treatment , was the most suitable place for him to live . The applicant \u2019s lawyer challenged the refusal to bring the action , arguing that her client should have the opportunity to assess by himself whether or not , having regard to the living conditions at the home , it was in his interests to remain there . She pointed out that the enforced continuation of his stay in the home , on the pretext of providing him with treatment in his own interests , amounted in practice to a deprivation of liberty , a situation that was unacceptable . A person could not be placed in an institution without his or her consent . In accordance with the legislation in force , anyone under partial guardianship was free to choose his or her place of residence , with the guardian \u2019s agreement . The choice of residence was therefore not a matter within the competence of the prosecution service . Despite those objections , the regional prosecutor \u2019s refusal was upheld on DATE by the appellate prosecutor , and subsequently on DATE by ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through his lawyer , asked the mayor of GPE to bring a court action for his release from partial guardianship . In a letter of DATE , the mayor of PERSON refused his request , stating that there was no basis for such an action in view of the medical certificate of DATE , the opinions of the Director and the social worker , and the conclusions reached by the public prosecutor \u2019s office . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer applied to ORG for judicial review of the mayor \u2019s decision , under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ( see paragraph DATE below ) . In a letter of DATE , ORG stated that since the applicant was partially lacking legal capacity he was required to submit a valid form of authority certifying that his lawyer was representing him , and that it should be specified whether his guardian had intervened in the procedure . On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s lawyer submitted a copy of the form of authority signed by the applicant . She also requested that the guardian join the proceedings as an interested party or that an ad hoc representative be appointed . On DATE the court held a hearing at which the representative of the mayor of GPE objected that the form of authority was invalid as it had not been countersigned by the guardian . The guardian , who was present at the hearing , stated that he was not opposed to the applicant \u2019s application , but that the latter \u2019s old - age pension was insufficient to meet his needs and that , accordingly , the NORP social care home was the best place for him to live .", "CARDINAL . The Dupnitsa District Court gave judgment on DATE . As to the admissibility of the application for judicial review , it held that , although the applicant had instructed his lawyer to represent him , she was not entitled to act on his behalf since the guardian had not signed the form of authority . However , it held that the guardian \u2019s endorsement of the application at the public hearing had validated all the procedural steps taken by the lawyer , and that the application was therefore admissible . As to the merits , the court dismissed the application , finding that the guardian had no legitimate interest in contesting the mayor \u2019s refusal , given that he could apply independently and directly for the applicant to be released from partial guardianship . Since the judgment was not subject to appeal , it became final .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant asserted that he had made several oral requests to his guardian to apply for his release from partial guardianship and to allow him to leave the home . However , his requests had always been refused .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Persons and Family Act of CARDINAL DATE provides that persons who are unable to look after their own interests on account of mental illness or mental deficiency must be entirely deprived of legal capacity and declared legally incapable . Adults with milder forms of such disorders are to be partially incapacitated . Persons who are entirely deprived of legal capacity are placed under full guardianship ( \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) , whereas those who are partially incapacitated are placed under partial guardianship ( \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u2013 literally \u201c trusteeship \u201d ) . In accordance with sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , persons under partial guardianship may not perform legal transactions without their guardian \u2019s consent . They may , however , carry out ordinary acts forming part of everyday life and have access to the resources obtained in consideration for their work . Accordingly , the guardian of a partially incapacitated person can not independently perform legal transactions that are binding on that person . This means that contracts signed only by the guardian , without the consent of the person partially lacking legal capacity , are invalid .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , persons under full guardianship are represented before the courts by their guardian . Persons under partial guardianship , however , are entitled to take part in court proceedings , but require their guardian \u2019s consent . Accordingly , the guardian of a partially incapacitated person does not perform the role of a legal representative . The guardian can not act on behalf of the person under partial guardianship , but may express agreement or disagreement with the person \u2019s individual transactions ( ORG , GPE , GPE \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e , ORG , DATE \u0433. , \u0441\u0442\u0440.

There are CARDINAL stages to the procedure for placing a person under partial guardianship : the declaration of partial incapacity and the appointment of a guardian .", "CARDINAL . The first stage involves a judicial procedure which at the material time was governed by ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the DATE ORG , which have been reproduced unchanged in ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the new DATE ORG . A declaration of partial incapacity may be sought by the person \u2019s spouse or close relatives , by the public prosecutor or by any other interested party .

If the statements thus obtained are insufficient , the court may have recourse to other evidence , such as an expert medical assessment . According to domestic case - law , an assessment must be ordered where the court is unable to conclude from any other information in the file that the request for deprivation of legal capacity is unfounded ( ORG DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. ; ORG \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 ORG \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. ) .", "CARDINAL . The second stage involves an administrative procedure for the appointment of a guardian , which at the material time was governed by LAW ( ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) of the DATE ORG ; these provisions have been reproduced , with only minor amendments , in LAW to CARDINAL of the new DATE ORG . The administrative stage is conducted by an authority referred to as \u201c the guardianship authority \u201d , namely the mayor or any other municipal council officer designated by him or her .", "CARDINAL . The guardian should preferably be appointed from among the relatives of the person concerned who are best able to defend his or her interests .", "CARDINAL . Measures taken by the guardian are subject to review by the guardianship authority . At the authority \u2019s request , the guardian must report on his or her activities .
