The applicant was born in DATE and is currently serving a sentence in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were initiated concerning a burglary . On DATE they were joined to another set of proceedings concerning another burglary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was officially declared a suspect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a request from the police , an investigating judge of ORG issued a warrant for his arrest and detention . The decision reads as follows :", "\u201c The judge , having examined the case material , the arguments of the [ investigative authority ] and the attorney \u2019s opinion , considers that the request is justified and should be granted .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW sets out the grounds for the application of a procedural compulsory measure , namely a person \u2019s resistance to the reaching of the aim of criminal proceedings in specific proceedings or to the performance of a separate procedural action , or non - execution or improper execution of his or her procedural duties .", "In accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW a person may be detained only if specific factual information obtained in the course of criminal proceedings creates a reasonable suspicion that the person in question has committed a criminal offence , for which the law provides for a custodial sentence , and if no other preventive measure can ensure that they will not commit another criminal offence or obstruct or avoid the pre - trial proceedings , trial or execution of the sentence .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that human rights may be restricted only in cases where such restriction is required for public safety reasons and according to the nature and danger of the criminal offence .", "On DATE the [ applicant ] was declared a suspect of a criminal offence proscribed by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . Information obtained in the course of criminal proceedings excludes reasonable doubt about his implication in a serious criminal offence . The only possible sanction for commission of this crime is a custodial sentence .", "It follows from the case material that the [ applicant ] has declared [ to the domestic authorities ] his place of residence as [ address of Daugavgr\u012bva Prison ] in GPE . The case material also contains [ a document from another set of criminal proceedings ] with [ his ] signature , whereby he undertakes an obligation to reside at [ a particular address ] in Daugavpils . On DATE the [ investigating authority ] sent a notice to that address for the [ applicant ] to appear at a police station on CARDINAL DATE . On a copy of that notice the investigator has made a note that the [ applicant ] failed to appear at the allotted time and did not inform [ anyone ] about the reasons for his absence . On DATE a decision was made to forcibly escort the [ applicant ] to the [ investigating authority ] on DATE , but [ this decision ] could not be executed since the [ applicant ] was not living at [ that particular address ] . Police officers verified on several occasions other possible places where the applicant might be , but it was impossible to find him or where he might be ; this is evidenced by the police ORG reports of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE . Information has been obtained in the course of the criminal proceedings that the [ applicant ] is renting an apartment in the [ name of a particular street ] area of NORP , but the specific address is unknown . In the circumstances , there are grounds to consider that the [ applicant ] is hiding and avoiding participation in the investigation , thereby resisting the reaching of the aim of the criminal proceedings and obstructing the normal course of the criminal proceedings and a speedy and fair resolution of issues arising from criminal law .", "Information obtained from ORG shows that the [ applicant ] has been tried on CARDINAL occasions , [ reference to various crimes , including burglary ] . Taking into account the time spent in pre - trial detention , he has served the [ custodial ] sentence imposed and ... is currently [ subject to an ] additional penalty \u2013 police control . In the circumstances , there are reasonable grounds to consider that at liberty , the [ applicant ] could continue to carry out criminal activities and would commit another criminal offence .", "Taking into account the aforementioned , the judge concludes that the [ investigating authority \u2019s ] request is justified and that the security measure [ of ] detention should be imposed on the [ applicant ] , since imposition of another security measure could not prevent him from committing another criminal offence or from avoiding the investigation . Also , given that the [ applicant \u2019s ] actual location is not known , it is necessary to issue a search warrant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG examined an appeal brought by the applicant and upheld the initial detention order . This decision reads as follows :", "\u201c Having assessed the reasons mentioned in the [ applicant \u2019s ] complaint and his request , having heard the explanations given during the hearing , having examined the case material of the procedural compulsory measures and of the [ instant ] case , [ and ] taking into account the opinion of the [ investigative authority ] , I consider that the decision of the investigating judge of ORG , to impose on the [ applicant ] the security measure of detention , should be upheld .", "I exclude from the [ DATE ] decision a note to the effect that the [ applicant ] was avoiding participation in the investigation . According to the available information ... on DATE the [ applicant ] was convicted of [ various crimes , including burglary ] and sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , police control for DATE and confiscation of property . Taking into account the time spent in pre - trial detention , he has served the [ custodial ] sentence imposed . That judgment took effect on DATE ... There is no convincing evidence that [ he ] received the notice to appear [ at the police station ] or [ other ] procedural documents sent [ to him ] ...", "The conclusion made by the investigating judge \u2013 that detention had to be ordered for the [ applicant ] \u2013 is correct , since specific factual information obtained in the course of the criminal proceedings has created a reasonable suspicion that he committed a crime proscribed by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , [ for which ] the law provides for a custodial sentence . Imposing another security measure could not ensure that the [ applicant ] would not commit another criminal offence . These reasons correspond to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . They are confirmed by the information available within the criminal proceedings . The [ applicant ] has been sentenced on several occasions for crimes against property . He has also served sentences in prison but he has not drawn the necessary conclusions and has not reformed . He is suspected of an analogous crime committed while under police control [ in connection with his previous conviction ] . These circumstances are sufficient to conclude that at liberty , the [ applicant ] could commit another criminal offence . The investigating judge has rightly concluded that imposition of another security measure could not prevent him from committing another criminal offence . The [ applicant \u2019s ] detention is justified . The public safety ( sabiedr\u012bbas dro\u0161\u012bba ) is more important than the liberty of an individual who is acting contrary to the interests of society . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge of ORG carried out a DATE review of the applicant \u2019s detention and adopted a decision in that regard . It reads as follows :", "\u201c Having heard the arguments of the [ investigating authority ] , the [ applicant \u2019s ] explanation and the attorney \u2019s position and having examined the case material , the judge concludes that the security measure [ of ] detention imposed on the [ applicant ] should continue to be applied .", "The security measure [ of ] detention was imposed on the [ applicant ] to ensure public safety and to prevent other criminal offences being committed . The grounds for detention have not changed . The [ applicant ] is suspected of CARDINAL burglaries ... a serious crime for which the law only provides for a custodial sentence . Previously , the [ applicant ] was tried on QUANTITY occasions ; his last conviction on DATE concerned [ various crimes , including burglary ] and he was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , police control for DATE and confiscation of property . Taking into account the time spent in pre - trial detention , he has served the [ custodial ] sentence imposed and he is suspected of an analogous , serious crime while under police control [ in connection with his previous conviction ] ; therefore , a possibility continues to exist that at liberty , he could continue to carry out criminal activities and would commit another criminal offence , and the grounds for detention under section CARDINAL ) of LAW have not disappeared . Pre - trial investigation continues within a reasonable time and there is no unjustified delay .", "It is not within the investigating judge \u2019s competence to examine and assess the evidence obtained ; therefore , the [ applicant \u2019s ] submission \u2013 that the detention [ order ] should be lifted as there is no evidence of his guilt \u2013 is not substantiated . Besides , the [ applicant \u2019s ] allegations that the [ investigating authority ] has ignored his requests and has not carried out additional questioning should not be taken into account as they contradict the case material .", "...", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that a person suspected of or charged with a crime may not be held in pre - trial detention for DATE .", "The [ applicant ] has been detained since DATE , that is , for slightly DATE .

In this respect , the court held as follows :", "\u201c During the hearing , the [ applicant ] submitted a request that the security measure [ applied to him ] be changed as there is no evidence for his conviction ; the gathering and verification of the necessary evidence requires DATE , therefore his continued detention is not permitted . The [ applicant ] undertakes to attend all hearings .", "Having heard the [ applicant \u2019s ] explanation [ and the ] opinions of the victim , attorney and prosecutor , the court considers that [ his ] request to change the security measure should be dismissed for the following reasons .", "In accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , if during the application of a procedural compulsory measure the grounds for the application of the measure disappear or change , or the provisions for the application of the measure or behaviour of the person change , or if other circumstances are ascertained that determined the choice of the compulsory measure , an [ investigating authority ] should take a decision to change or lift the measure .", "It follows from the wording of the decision of DATE by the investigating judge of ORG that the [ applicant ] was detained because he was hiding and avoiding participation in the investigation ...

ORG excluded any reference that the [ applicant ] would avoid the investigation . LAW sets out the [ types of evidence ] allowing the suspicion that [ a person has committed a criminal offence ] . However , in the instant case there is no evidence for his conviction . The charges are not justified [ as ] the [ applicant ] has not admitted his guilt , therefore there is no reason to consider that he would continue to commit criminal offences ... Detention can only be ordered with a view to preparing a judgment , but it is clear that judgment can not be prepared for DATE as all movements and escort ( visas kust\u012bbas un konvoj\u0113\u0161anas ) needs DATE , therefore his continued detention is of a punitive nature , which is prohibited by law . The [ applicant ] asks to be released , undertakes to attend all hearings and not to commit any offences .", "Having heard the [ applicant \u2019s ] explanation [ and the ] opinions of the attorney and prosecutor , the court considers that his request to change the security measure should be dismissed for the following reasons .", "In accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , if during the application of a procedural compulsory measure , the grounds for the application of the measure disappear or change , or the provisions for the application of the measure or behaviour of the person change , or if other circumstances are ascertained that determined the choice of the compulsory measure , an [ investigating authority ] shall take a decision to change or lift the measure .", "It follows from the text of the decision of DATE by the investigating judge of ORG that the [ applicant ] was detained because he was avoiding participation in the investigation ...
