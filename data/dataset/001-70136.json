In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , the first applicant wrote to ORG at ORG to inquire about whether he could marry the second applicant . In a letter dated DATE , ORG stated that under the relevant domestic legislation , it would be impossible for the applicants to marry unless A and C were both dead :", "\u201c ...

The applicants subsequently sought legal advice on whether there was any remedy against the decision of ORG but were advised by counsel that no remedy existed since the basis for the decision was primary legislation , namely , LAW as amended by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , as amended by LAW , ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) , provides that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Subject to subsection ( CARDINAL ) of this section , a marriage solemnized between a man and any of the persons mentioned in the first column of Part III of the First Schedule to this LAW or between a woman and any of the persons mentioned in the second column of the said Part III shall be void .", "( CARDINAL ) Any such marriage as is mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL ) of this section shall not be void by reason only of affinity if both parties to the marriage have attained the age of CARDINAL at the time of the marriage and the marriage is solemnized \u2013", "...", "( b ) In the case of a marriage between a man and the former wife of his son , after the death of both his son and the mother of his son ;", "( c ) In the case of a marriage between a woman and the father of a former husband of hers , after the death of both the former husband and the mother of the former husband ;", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Part III of the First Schedule to the DATE Act contains lists of persons between whom marriage is prohibited . The first column referred to in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW includes the former wife of a man 's son and the second column includes the father of a woman 's former husband .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL Act contained an absolute prohibition on marriages between former father - in - law and daughter - in law until section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was introduced by ORG \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( as amended ) , marriages between former step - parents and step - children are not void if both parties have attained DATE and the younger party was never \u201c a child of the family \u201d in relation to the other party . LAW does not stipulate that marriages between an uncle and niece or an aunt and nephew are void in cases where there is no consanguinity between the CARDINAL parties .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the enactment of LAW , a report , entitled \u201c No Just Cause : Affinity : Suggestions for Change \u201d was drawn up in DATE by a group appointed by ORG , including members of ORG , on the question of the prohibition of marriages on the grounds of affinity . This report suggested some of the amendments to the law made in LAW . A report drawn up by the majority concluded that :", "\u201c Most , perhaps , all , members of the ORG started from an intuitive reaction that it was not only unlawful to marry one 's mother - in - law or father - in - law , but also that it was undesirable , and perhaps sinful and perilous . But as we studied and discussed the accumulating material we gradually came to recognise that the prohibition is based simply on tradition and can not now be justified on any logical , rational or practical ground . The experience of other states where there has never been such a prohibition provides a strong and persuasive argument for abolishing these impediments on marriage . In our view , the retention of these legal impediments is not essential to the maintenance of healthy and stable relationships within the extended family .", "...", "The younger person in the above lists will scarcely ever have been a child of the family of the older person before the younger person had attained the age of DATE . Moreover , he or she will also have married ( at least once ) and for that ceremony the law and society will have treated him or her as having had the capacity and maturity to marry . Thus our principal concern of wishing to afford some protection to the younger person in those circumstances would be satisfied if the existing legal impediments preventing a lawful marriage being solemnised between a man and a woman and his or her affine in classes C and D [ parent - in - law and child - in - law ] were removed \u201d", "CARDINAL . The minority report recommended the \u201c retention of the impediment on marriage between parent - in - law and child - in - law \u201d on the basis that it raised the same difficulties as step - parent and step - child , namely it \u201c would condone sexual rivalry between father and son , or mother and daughter , which , within the close confines of the family , would be destructive of the father and son , or mother and daughter , relationships \u201d :", "\u201c ... In addition ... it would deprive the child - in - law of his or her safety of place as a child in the new family into which he or she marries . When for instance a son brings his wife to his father 's home , there is an underlying assumption that the daughter - in - law will assume a role in relation to her father - in - law which is exempt of sexual expectations . To admit the possibility of a future marriage between parent - in - law and child - in - law would be to undermine assumptions which make for the safety and comfort of the adult family . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The bill as put forward for adoption represented the common ground between the majority and minority views \u2013 it excluded change for the impediment for in - laws and removed the impediment for step relations , where both parties were CARDINAL and the younger party had never been treated as a child of the family .", "During the consideration of the bill which became LAW in ORG , Lord PERSON unsuccessfully proposed an amendment which would remove the impediment to a parent - in - law marrying his or her child - in - law . He argued that this was necessary in order to make the law consistent since the bill would remove the impediment to a step - parent marrying his or her step - child and the case of a parent - in - law and child - in - law was , if anything , less problematic . However , this proposed amendment was not adopted .", "CARDINAL . It is possible for a marriage between a former parent - in - law and child - in - law to be permitted in individual cases by a personal Act of ORG . The personal Act effectively exempts the individuals from the application of a statutory prohibition on marriage . Whether such an LAW is passed or not is at the discretion of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Such personal Acts have been passed several times in the past although no Act of this nature has been sought or passed since DATE . For instance , in the Valerie PERSON and PERSON ( Marriage Enabling ) Act DATE , ORG permitted the proposed marriage between PERSON , the mother of PERSON first wife , and Mr Monk . At the time of this personal LAW , LAW had not yet been passed and , therefore , there was an absolute prohibition under LAW on marriage between parents - in - law and children - in - law . In considering the personal bill , several members of ORG noted that the facts of the case were not \u201c exceptional \u201d . The resulting personal Act set out the facts of the case , from which it appeared the couple were living in the same household and wished to bring up the children of the son - in - law ( and grandchildren of the mother - in - law ) in a stable home . It continued :", "\u201c ... ( CARDINAL) PERSON and PERSON regard the legal impediment to their marriage as imposing hardship on them , and as serving no useful purpose of public policy in the particular circumstances of their case :", "( CARDINAL ) They accordingly desire that the impediment should be removed in their case :", "( CARDINAL ) The object of this LAW can not be attained without the authority of ORG :", "Therefore PERSON and PERSON most humbly pray that it may be enacted , and be it enacted , by the Queen 's most Excellent Majesty , by and with the advice and consent of ORG , in this present ORG assembled , and by the authority of the same , as follows:-", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding anything contained in any enactment or any rule of law to the contrary , there shall be no impediment to a marriage between PERSON and PERSON by reason of their relationship of mother - in - law and son - in - law , and no marriage hereafter contracted between them shall be void by reason of that relationship .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . There are no established criteria for the granting of a personal Act of ORG in order to permit a marriage otherwise prohibited by LAW . There is no investigation into the facts as submitted by the individuals in question . The costs of obtaining a personal Act of ORG are ORG CARDINAL at the First and Third Reading of the bill in each ORG of ORG , amounting to ORG , plus the fees of a \u201c Roll A \u201d Parliamentary Agent , who is the only person permitted to promote a personal bill . Legal aid is not available for the costs of obtaining a personal ORG .", "CARDINAL . This procedure of seeking a personal Act of ORG in order to authorise an otherwise prohibited marriage was commented on by PERSON in ORG during the passage of LAW in the following terms :", "\u201c ... ORG has from time to time enacted laws enabling particular couples to marry , notwithstanding that they are related as step - parent to step - child or parent - in - law to child - in - law . I do not think that anyone has suggested that this is a particularly suitable way of deciding whether CARDINAL people so related should be allowed to marry . It has been criticised as cumbersome , expensive and unseemly . In the Second Reading of the Sonia PERSON and PERSON ( Marriage Enabling ) PERSON , my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor said that it offended his sense of justice that the ORG should be asked to decide without evidence whether a couple should be enabled to marry ... \u201d ( PERSON , ORG Hansard DATE , col . CARDINAL )", "Lord PERSON stated during the debate :", "\u201c Personal Bills are costly , embarrassing and time - consuming for this ORG . They add to the anxieties of the couple who should of course be a happy couple . They always receive a sympathetic hearing and the CARDINAL recent Bills involving mature step - relations have passed through this ORG without any great difficulty . But it all tends to suggest that there is CARDINAL law for those who hear of the procedure and who can afford it in its practical consequences . Apart from a personal PERSON or going abroad the other alternatives are for the couple either to live together without marriage , without consequences such as illegitimacy and the lack of any widows ' pension for the lady or for them to part with consequential distress for all concerned . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
