The applicant was born in DATE and currently lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he applied for asylum and a residence permit in GPE . In interviews before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) on CARDINAL DATE and DATE the applicant stated that he was ethnic NORP , NORP and born and raised in a small community consisting of approximately CARDINAL families in the province of LOC . He had never been to school and was illiterate . He claimed that his problems emanated from the fact that his father was of NORP ethnicity and his mother was of NORP ethnicity . As a child of mixed ethnicity , he had not been allowed to play with other children as they had been unkind to him . Since it had not been possible to leave him alone , he had always been with his father at his store in the nearest city . When the ORG had taken power in the province , they had frequently come to the store and taken food without paying , for which reason other people in the city had believed that the family sympathised with the ORG . The fact that his mother was NORP had reinforced this view . Moreover , his father had inherited everything from his grandfather , despite there being an older uncle , as the latter had been disowned due to bad behaviour . The uncle had then become very hostile to the applicant and his family . After the fall of the ORG , the applicant \u2019s situation had worsened as other villagers looked upon the applicant and his parents as traitors . He had been assaulted and severely beaten on several occasions and twice he had lost consciousness . They had also broken his nose and cut him with a knife . During DATE he had been kidnapped twice and ill - treated . The first time he was locked up in a cellar for DATE , and DATE he was held prisoner for DATE . Each time he had been released when his father had paid a large amount of money . His father had been advised by his business partner to move but he had refused as he thought things would get better over time . Moreover , the applicant did not know if his mother had any relatives as she had never mentioned any , but they could not have moved to her home town since she had married a man from another ethnic group .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a group of masked men had come to their house and his father had told him to leave the house , which he had managed to do by escaping through the basement . He had seen the assailants kill his mother before he fled . He had then gone to GPE where he had found out from a taxi driver who had a route to his home town that his father had also been killed . His father \u2019s business partner had helped him to leave the country and he had had contact with no one since he left . The applicant was convinced that he would be killed if returned to GPE and that the authorities neither could nor would help him . As he was of mixed ethnicity he would not be welcome anywhere in the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the application . It found that the general situation in GPE was not such that the applicant could be granted leave to remain in GPE on this sole ground . Turning to the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances , the ORG observed that it had found no evidence that persons of mixed ethnicities faced specific problems in GPE . According to the applicant \u2019s own account , ethnicity was passed down by the father , for which reason the applicant was considered a NORP . Thus , the Board did not believe that the applicant had faced such discrimination as claimed because of his mixed ethnicity . Moreover , it noted that , again according to the applicant , everyone in his village had tried to get along with the ORG and had paid to be well treated by them . Therefore the ORG was not convinced that the applicant and his family had been suspected of being collaborators with the ORG and ill - treated on this ground . ORG further questioned the claim that the applicant had no relatives other than his uncle , having regard to the very strong family ties in NORP culture . In any event , his father \u2019s business partner was still there and had shown a friendly and supportive attitude to the applicant and his family . Consequently , the ORG concluded that the applicant had a social network in GPE which made it possible for him to return . Since there was no other reason to grant the applicant leave to remain in GPE , his application was rejected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , and was therefore heard again . He maintained his claims and added that he was not considered a NORP simply because his father was one . Moreover , the suspicion that they had collaborated with the ORG was also based on the fact that his mother was NORP and that the ORG had not touched their home . The family \u2019s poor reputation had then been used against them by his uncle . His mother had no contact with her family since she had married outside her ethnicity . Moreover , his father \u2019s business partner had become wealthy thanks to the applicant \u2019s father and therefore had owed him a favour . In any event , it was money from their business which had paid for the applicant \u2019s trip .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal as concerned his asylum application . It noted that ORG had established a military base in LOC to stabilise the area . Against this background , and for the reasons set out in ORG decision , ORG found it unsubstantiated that the applicant would risk persecution upon return .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant married a NORP woman , who had been granted a residence permit in GPE due to a previous marriage . In DATE the couple had a daughter and therefore , on DATE ORG exempted the applicant from the regulation on family reunification which set out that an applicant must apply for a residence permit on the basis of family from his country of origin . ORG thus granted the applicant a temporary residence permit for DATE . On DATE the applicant was granted a permanent residence permit in GPE on the same grounds . The couple had a son on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife left him , and , together with the children , went to live at a protected address . The children were at that time CARDINAL and DATE . The estranged wife reported to the police that she had been raped and ill - treated by the applicant for DATE and that he had also hit their daughter . She explained that she had already tried to leave the applicant in DATE after he had threatened her with a knife and the police had to intervene . Criminal proceedings were immediately initiated .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the prosecution authority issued restraining orders against the applicant vis - \u00e0 - vis his estranged wife and their children , under section CARDINAL of LAW ( lagen ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) om bes\u00f6ksf\u00f6rbud ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined by CARDINAL psychiatrists at ORG , who in a medical report of DATE noted that the applicant described having symptoms of PTSD and depression with suicidal thoughts . Should a sentence of imprisonment be considered , an examination of the applicant by a forensic psychiatrist was recommended .", "CARDINAL . The trial took place before ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , and commenced on DATE , when the applicant , his estranged wife , her mother and CARDINAL neighbours were heard and documentary evidence submitted . The applicant was detained on remand on DATE and submitted for examination by a forensic psychiatrist , who concluded that the applicant was not suffering from a serious mental disturbance and that he had not committed the act of which he was accused due to serious mental disturbance .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE convicted the applicant of rape and aggravated violation of a woman \u2019s integrity ( grov kvinnofridskr\u00e4nkning ) committed several times a week over a period of DATE , DATE and DATE . The violation included hitting , pushing , hair pulling and threatening to harm or kill the wife and the children , or to take the children away from the wife by taking them to GPE . ORG noted that the wife had made a very composed and credible impression . She had presented her story , which was supported by witness statements , in a calm and balanced way .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and CARDINAL years\u2019 expulsion from GPE , with a prohibition on returning before DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision to expel the applicant ORG had regard , inter alia , to a report dated DATE from the relevant social welfare board relating to the issue of the children \u2019s need for contact with their father and how they would be affected by his expulsion . It pointed out that the estranged wife was afraid of the applicant and therefore still lived at a secret address . The children had not seen their father since DATE and the mother would only take part in visits if a contact person were present . An expulsion would most likely mean that the children would not have any contact with their father during the expulsion period . Generally , children needed close and good contact with both their parents . However , the courts and the social services also had to take into account the risk of children being subjected to violence , abuse , abduction , etc . Having regard to the crimes at issue , the overall assessment was therefore that the children \u2019s need for contact with their father , if convicted , should be balanced against the risk of their being subjected to , or becoming witness to , violence or other degrading treatment during access .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision to expel the applicant , ORG essentially stated the following . In view of the nature of the crimes and the circumstances of the case , there was reason to fear that the applicant would continue to commit crimes in GPE . Moreover , in view of the illtreatment endured by the estranged wife and caused by the applicant , the crimes were considered to be so serious that the applicant should not be allowed to remain in GPE . He lacked any substantial connection to GPE other than his family , who had to live at a secret address to avoid being persecuted by him . In conclusion , the children \u2019s need for contact with their father could not be considered to be so significant that an expulsion should be avoided . However , having regard to the children , the expulsion period was limited to DATE . Finally , ORG had been heard and had stated that there were no impediments to the expulsion of the applicant to his home country .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) , before which the applicant and the estranged wife were heard , as were the witnesses who had been heard before ORG . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment in full .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested leave to appeal to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) which was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having left the applicant on DATE , on CARDINAL DATE the estranged wife filed for divorce from the applicant and sole custody of the children . She contended that she had been ill - treated by the applicant , that he had also hit the children , and that she had reported the abuse to the police . The applicant agreed to a divorce but requested sole custody of the children . He also demanded access to the children for TIME a month in the presence of a contact person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG temporarily granted the estranged wife sole custody of the couple \u2019s children while the proceedings were pending before it . It further decided temporarily that the applicant should not have physical contact with the children during this time . It noted in that respect that the applicant had been accused of serious crimes , including violence against the daughter . The prosecutor was considering whether to charge the applicant and , while awaiting developments in this regard , ORG found joint custody to be incompatible with the children \u2019s best interest . Nor should access between the applicant and the children be established under those circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As stated above , in the criminal proceedings the applicant was convicted on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the custody and access proceedings , at the request of ORG , the social welfare board submitted a report dated DATE concerning custody and access rights , based on CARDINAL interviews with the estranged wife and CARDINAL interviews with the applicant ( one at home and one at the pre - trial detention centre ) . The social welfare board had also met the children at their home in DATE , and spoken to the children \u2019s nursery school and to a deaconess involved in the case . In addition , they had had access to relevant written material such as the first instance criminal judgment against the applicant and the examination conducted by the forensic psychiatrist . The report stated that in view of the applicant \u2019s abuse of his estranged wife and the fact that he had probably also physically abused his daughter , there was a high risk that the children would be harmed if the applicant were to have custody of them . The children were very young when they last had contact with the applicant and they would have no memories of their father that they could express in words . Their need for a relationship with their father would increase when they became older . Access between them and the applicant would involve an increased risk that their secret address would become known to him . This risk should be balanced against the fact that the applicant had subjected his family to abuse and that he would probably be expelled upon release from prison . Thus , it was advised that he should not have access to the children . In order to meet the children \u2019s need for contact with their origins , it was noted that such could be accommodated through letters . The social welfare board could distribute letters from the applicant to the children via the estranged wife , who in turn could reply within DATE to report on the children \u2019s development .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his estranged wife divorced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence became final .", "CARDINAL . NORP In letters of CARDINAL and DATE , and DATE the applicant submitted his observations on the report from the social welfare board . He found that the report was partial to the benefit of the estranged wife and not in the interests of the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG held a hearing in the case . Represented by legal counsel , the applicant and his ex - wife were heard . CARDINAL witnesses were heard at the applicant \u2019s request . A representative from the social welfare board stated that the aim had been to see both parents an equal number of times during the custody investigation but that this had not been possible because the applicant was detained on remand . In general young children were directly affected by how their mother was treated and it was therefore very likely that the applicant \u2019s daughter would experience bad memories if she had to see the applicant . Moreover , if the children were to have contact with the applicant , they would be exposed to yet another separation from him when the expulsion order was implemented . Thus , for the moment it was not in the children \u2019s best interests to see the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE , ORG granted the ex - wife sole custody of the couple \u2019s CARDINAL children and ordered that the applicant should not have visiting rights to the children . The court noted that the ex - wife and the children lived at a secret location and that the children were well and felt safe with their mother . Moreover , the applicant was in prison , and once his sentence was served he would be expelled to GPE with a prohibition on returning until DATE . Against this background , it was most appropriate that the ex - wife be granted sole custody of the children .", "CARDINAL . As concerned access rights , the court noted that according to several witness statements the applicant had been a good father to his children . However , there was a considerable risk that the children had experienced the violence to which their mother had been subjected and that seeing the applicant could bring back bad memories and disturb the sense of safety that the children now experienced . Moreover , the applicant was now in prison , from where he would only be able to have very restricted access to his children . Furthermore , even if the children were able to create a safe relationship with the applicant during such limited access , the applicant would subsequently be expelled and therefore separated from his children until DATE . ORG therefore found that access was not in the children \u2019s best interest . It did not rule out that access might be established at a later point in time .", "CARDINAL . ORG only took a stand on access as requested by the applicant , namely to have physical contact with his children in the presence of a contact person . It did not take any decision regulating or limiting the applicant sending letters to his children . Practically , however , sending letters was complicated by the fact that the children lived with their mother at a secret address . Nevertheless , it was possible to send letters to the children via ORG . Also , the offer by the social welfare board to pass on letters from the applicant to the children via their mother still stood . The applicant availed himself thereof once at DATE when he send gifts to the children . Moreover , on DATE the ex - wife gave detailed information about the children and their everyday life to the social welfare office , and that information was subsequently communicated to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the ORG judgment of DATE to ORG , stating that he had requested the Government to repeal his expulsion order and that he had lodged a complaint with ORG DATE as he considered that his expulsion to GPE would be in violation of LAW . Consequently , it was not certain that he would be expelled and hence his proposed expulsion was not a reason to deny him access to his children . Moreover , he owned a house and had a job and several friends , for which reason he could offer the children a stable place to visit once he was released from prison . He found it unacceptable that he had no news at all of his children and allegedly was only allowed to send CARDINAL letters per year to them . The ex - wife stated that the applicant could have access to the children when they were older .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused leave to appeal and , on CARDINAL DATE , so did ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant requested the Government to repeal his expulsion order and grant him a residence permit in GPE . He submitted essentially that there were problems in GPE between NORP and NORP , that he had been wrongfully convicted and that he had CARDINAL children in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a submission of DATE , the applicant stated that when the ORG came into power in DATE and took control of the NORP area , his father started talking about schools and freedom with others in the NORP group . The ORG perceived from this that his father was dissociating himself from his religion . They tried to capture him but he went into hiding . The applicant was captured instead and imprisoned . He was illtreated for DATE , which included beating and being stabbed in the back with a knife , to get him to reveal his father \u2019s hiding place , which he refused . His father paid a large ransom for his release after DATE and the applicant was admitted to hospital for DATE . DATE he went with his father to the mosque , where they were captured by the NORP who told the applicant that he was not a NORP since his father was married to a NORP . They wanted him to prove his loyalty to the NORP by walking on burning coals . When he refused , they stabbed him in the shoulder . He walked on the coals and suffered serious burns to his feet . He was left alone and his father came in disguise in the middle of the night to pick him up . His father had to carry him home , where he was treated for his injuries . DATE , he and his father went to the mosque again and there the others decided that his father should kill him and his mother , which his father refused . Then it was decided that the whole family should die and CARDINAL of his father \u2019s friends warned them of this . The applicant was CARDINAL at the time . He and his parents woke up in the middle of the night to find that the house was on fire and that people were trying to get in through the window . His father fetched a weapon and his mother opened a hatch to an escape tunnel under the house . Before jumping down he saw his mother being injured . They threw down money to him and closed the hatch . He had no choice but to crawl out through the tunnel . He stood and watched while the house burned down and then went to the home of CARDINAL of his father \u2019s friends who lived in another city . This man helped him leave GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a submission of DATE , the applicant added that he suffered from post - traumatic stress syndrome ( PTSD ) , that he had tried to commit suicide , and that he had no family other than his children and a new girlfriend in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government rejected the applicant \u2019s request . It found that there was no impediment to the enforcement of the expulsion order and no other special reasons to grant the applicant a residence permit in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant submitted a new application , dated DATE , for revocation of the expulsion order . He added that he had not been in contact with his country of origin since he left but knew that his father \u2019s business partner , who had helped him escape , had been killed . Since his parents had been killed and he himself had been tortured by the ORG , his life was in great danger . He also risked being killed upon return to GPE for having married NORP woman although he was a NORP and for having violated a NORP woman in the acts for which he had been convicted in GPE . Invoking anew his poor mental health , the applicant submitted some medical certificates . CARDINAL certificate was dated DATE and written by a physician at the prison . It stated that the applicant had alleged that he had been imprisoned and tortured on several occasions in GPE and that the physician had seen a large number of scars on his back from cuts . He also had CARDINAL scars from stab wounds to his thigh and his shin . The physician confirmed that the scars might have been caused by torture as alleged by the applicant . A second medical certificate was dated DATE and written by a chief physician and specialist in psychiatry , and by a psychologist at ORG . It stated that the certificate was based on the applicant \u2019s contacts with the ORG from DATE . He had begun psychotherapy at FAC in DATE to talk about his background and traumatic experiences . The physicians had considered that he was clearly traumatised and had several symptoms of PTSD such as nightmares , flashbacks and anxiety . However , the applicant had been found stable in DATE for which reason the sessions had ended . In DATE the applicant had contacted the physicians again because he had been feeling unwell . When he had been arrested on suspicion of raping PERSON , he had been placed in a cell and had experienced strong flashbacks from when he had been kidnapped and tortured for DATE in GPE . He had been so desperate that he had cut his wrists with a table knife and had then spent TIME in the psychiatric emergency department . He had then resumed his sessions with the psychologist and had received medication to help him sleep . However , he had overdosed on the medication in DATE due to the strain caused by the criminal trial against him . His last session had been in DATE , before being imprisoned , and after the judgment he had again tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of pills . According to the CARDINAL physicians , the applicant suffered from GPE , depression , anxiety and had a serious stress reaction to his situation . He was therefore in a very fragile state mentally , with a high risk of suicide if the expulsion order were to be enforced . Thus , they concluded that there were medical - psychiatric impediments to the enforcement of the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the new request as it found that there was no impediment to the enforcement of the expulsion order and no other special reasons to grant the applicant a residence permit in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Finally , in DATE the applicant submitted a third application for revocation of the expulsion order based essentially on the same grounds as the previous ones . That case is still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG , indicating to the Government that it was desirable in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings not to deport the applicant until further notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the ORG \u2019s indication under LAW , the acting Minister of ORG decided to stay the enforcement of the expulsion until further notice .", "CARDINAL . The Minister also decided that the applicant should be taken into custody upon his conditional release from prison . Accordingly , the applicant was taken into custody on CARDINAL DATE . He was released on DATE by decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the ORG requested additional information from ORG about some of the issues raised in the present case . Having made an investigatory visit to GPE in DATE , ORG concluded , inter alia , that the security situation in GPE was not such that an expulsion thereto in general would entail a violation of LAW . The ORG noted , however , that according to various sources , the ORG had increased their operation in Ghazni province where arbitrary killings and civilian deaths among supporters of Government forces had been reported . In GPE the violence had increased mostly in the NORP - dominated south , while the situation was relatively calm in the NORP - dominated northern part of the province . Thus , at the relevant time , there were impediments to enforcing expulsion orders to GPE , notably due to the unstable security situation , which meant , among other things , that humanitarian organizations could not operate in the province and that there were problems for travellers on the road between GPE and the province .", "DATE . On DATE the prosecution authority issued restraining orders against the applicant vis - \u00e0 - vis his ex - wife and their children , under LAW . The prosecution noted that the applicant had previously been convicted of rape and aggravated violation of a woman \u2019s integrity regarding his former wife , and found that there was a risk that the applicant would commit a crime against , persecute or in some other way seriously harass his former wife or the children . The orders were in force for DATE , that is until DATE . Violation of restraining orders is a crime under the aforementioned LAW that can result in a fine or a maximum prison sentence of DATE .

Rules concerning rights of access to children are primarily to be found in LAW of the Children and Parents Code ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; hereinafter the Code ) . The best interests of the child must be the determining factor in all decisions concerning custody , residence and access . In the assessment of what is in the best interests of the child , particular attention shall be paid to the risk of the child or another member of the family being exposed to abuse or of the child being unlawfully abducted , retained or otherwise harmed .

A child shall have the right to access with a parent with whom he or she is not living . Access may take place by the child and the parents seeing each other or by other kinds of contact . The child \u2019s parents have a joint responsibility to ensure that , as far as possible , the child \u2019s need for access to a parent with whom he or she is not living is met . If both parents have custody of the child and the child is to have access to a parent with whom he or she is not living , the other parent shall provide such information about the child as will promote access , unless there are special reasons to the contrary .

Prior to DATE it was not explicitly stated in the LAW that access could take place by means of contact other than direct contact between the child and parent , such as telephone or letters . Normally , the parents should be able to agree on the extent of such indirect contact . The municipalities also assist in reaching agreements on such contact . However , through the introduction of the new provision in LAW , LAW , of the LAW , the courts have been enabled to decide that access is to take place in some other way than by the child meeting with the parent . The aim is to provide , in exceptional cases , a way of bringing about contact between a child and a parent when direct access is not an option . This may be the case for instance when the child and the parent live a considerable distance from each other or when the freedom of movement of the parent is restricted as a result of a prolonged hospital stay or similar circumstance ( see Government PERSON , p.

A child must have an absolute right not to be subjected to violence , abuse or other degrading treatment .

Accordingly , the courts and social authorities shall pay particular attention to the risk of violence and other kinds of abuse directed against a child or other members of the family , and the finding of such a risk shall weigh heavily in the overall assessment of what is in the best interests of the child in a particular case . The result of the assessment may be that it is best for the child not to have any contact at all , to have contact , inter alia , in the presence of a contact person or that access should be established when the child has reached a mature age ( see Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL . p.

In light of the worsening security environment in certain parts of the country and the increasing number of civilian casualties ORG considers that the situation can be characterized as CARDINAL of generalized violence in GPE , GPE , GPE , and parts of GPE and GPE provinces . Therefore , NORP asylum - seekers formerly residing in these areas may be in need of international protection under broader international protection criteria , including complementary forms of protection . In addition , given the fluid and volatile nature of the conflict , asylum applications by NORP claiming to flee generalized violence in other parts of GPE should each be assessed carefully , in light of the evidence presented by the applicant and other current and reliable information on the place of former residence . This latter determination will obviously need to include assessing whether a situation of generalized violence exists in the place of former residence at the time of adjudication .", "ORG generally considers internal flight as a reasonable alternative where protection is available from the individual \u2019s own extended family , community or tribe in the area of prospective relocation .

Careful consideration needs to be given in particular to the following profiles : ( i ) members of the security forces , including ORG agents and high - ranking officials of the communist regimes ; ( ii ) members and commanders of armed groups and militia forces during the communist regimes ; ( iii ) members and commanders of the ORG , PERSON and other armed anti - Government groups ; ( iv ) organized crime groups ; ( v ) members of NORP security forces , including the NDS ; and ( vi ) pro - Government paramilitary groups and militias . \u201d", "\u201c It is widely documented that ethnic - based tension and violence have arisen at various points in the history of GPE . Since DATE of the ORG regime in DATE , however , ethnically - motivated tension and violence have diminished markedly in comparison to earlier periods . Notwithstanding the foregoing and despite constitutional guarantees of \u201c equality among all ethnic groups and tribes \u201d certain concerns remain . These include , inter alia , ethnic discrimination and clashes , particularly in relation to land use / ownership rights .", "GPE is a complex mix of ethnic groups with inter - relationships not easily characterized . For different historical , social , economic and security - related reasons , some members of ethnic groups now reside outside areas where they traditionally represented a majority . This has resulted in complex ethnic mosaic in some parts of the country , notably the northern and central regions , and in the major cities in the west , north and centre of GPE . Consequently , an ethnic group can not be classified as a minority by simply referring to national statistics . A person who belongs to a nationally dominant ethnic group - such as NORP and NORP - may still face certain challenges relating , at least in part , to his or her ethnic association , in areas where other ethnic groups predominate . Conversely , a member of an ethnic group constituting a minority at the national level is not likely to be at risk in areas where the ethnic group represents the local majority . The issue of ethnicity may feature more prominently where tensions over access to natural resources ( such as grazing land and water ) and political / tribal disputes occur , or during periods of armed conflict ...", "As an example , CARDINAL of the groups affected are the NORP , who have been uprooted in large numbers by ethnic violence in the north and the west of the country following the collapse of the ORG regime . NORP throughout northern GPE , where they constitute an ethnic minority , have since been subject to discrimination , arbitrary arrests , violence and reprisal killings by non - NORP militias and groups because of their ( perceived ) association with the former ORG regime , whose leadership consisted mostly of NORP from southern GPE . Political power in the north reportedly still rests with local powerbrokers associated with the ( NORP - dominated ) ORG , who are reluctant to allow the sustainable reintegration of NORP returnees or provide for their protection . As such , formerly displaced NORP may be unable to recover their land and property upon return to their area of origin ...", "Marginalized during the ORG rule , the NORP community continues to face some degree of discrimination , despite significant efforts by the Government to address historical ethnic tensions . Notwithstanding the comparatively stable security situations in provinces and districts where the NORP constitute a majority or a substantial minority , such as GPE , GPE and NORP districts in GPE , the security situation in the remainder of the province , including on access routes to and from these districts , has been worsening ...", "However , the mere fact that a person belongs to an ethnic group constituting a minority in a certain area does not automatically trigger concerns related to risks on the ground of ethnicity alone . Other factors including , inter alia , the relative social , political , economic and military power of the person and/or his and her ethnic group in the area where fear is alleged may be relevant . Consideration should also be given to whether the person exhibits other risk factors outlined in these Guidelines , which may exacerbate the risk of persecution .
