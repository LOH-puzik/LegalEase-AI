SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , presently resides in GPE , GPE . In his application form , he states that he has NORP nationality .", "", "a.", "On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE with his wife and requested asylum . His wife being unhappy with the living conditions in the refugee camp where they were placed , they withdrew the asylum request on DATE and left GPE on DATE . They went to GPE where his wife \u2019s father lived . The wife later left the applicant and went to GPE with her father . The applicant was left in GPE without any income or a place to live . He received no help from the NORP authorities . Before leaving for GPE he had been active in the defence organisation in his hometown PERSON in PERSON . Following disagreements he left the organisation and joined the NORP army in which he served until DATE when NORP forces took over PERSON . He deserted from the army and , on a second attempt , he was able to cross the border to GPE . After his return to GPE from GPE he was allegedly afraid of being arrested and sent back to GPE to be put on trial for desertion . He therefore left for GPE a second time . He arrived on DATE and requested asylum . He claimed that he could not return to GPE as he could not get any protection there . Nor could he return to GPE where he would be drafted for military service or punished for desertion . Further , he would be at risk of being sent back to GPE . Despite the fact that he held a NORP passport , he could not be considered a citizen of that country as he had not applied for NORP citizenship .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG invandrarverk ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request and ordered his deportation to GPE . ORG found that the applicant held both NORP and NORP citizenship . Noting that the prevailing situation in GPE rendered a deportation to that country impossible , the ORG examined the applicant \u2019s situation with respect to GPE . ORG found that he did not risk to be sent from GPE to GPE . Further , he did not risk harassment or persecution in GPE and he would not be forced to take part in any armed conflict .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) . On DATE ORG granted the applicant a temporary residence permit until DATE and quashed the deportation order . In so doing , the ORG referred to a Government decision of CARDINAL DATE according to which the worsened situation in GPE constituted an impediment to the deportation of asylum seekers to that country .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a new application for a residence permit . He referred to his previous statements and added the following . He is wanted for desertion by the NORP army and might be forced to rejoin his military unit and take part in the conflict in GPE . In this respect , he invoked a NORP arrest warrant and a NORP draft order . He claimed further that he feared reprisals for comments he had made to NORP newspapers about people profiting from the war and for having participated in demonstrations and other actions against GPE in GPE . Moreover , having had special assignments within the NORP army , he was in possession of sensitive information and could thus be in great danger if caught by \u201c the wrong people \u201d . He stated also that his mental health was failing due to his experiences from the war and that he regularly saw a psychologist . His medical journals showed that he was in great need of psychiatric help on account of those experiences . According to CARDINAL district nurses whom the applicant had been seeing , the applicant had suicidal thoughts . Moreover , the applicant invoked family ties in GPE : CARDINAL of his brothers lived there and his mother and another brother had applied for asylum in the country . His parents were divorced and his father had returned from GPE to GPE in DATE . The applicant claimed also that he had integrated well into NORP society and that he should be given a residence permit on humanitarian grounds .", "In a decision of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s new application and ordered that he be deported to either GPE or GPE . ORG referred to a guiding decision taken by ORG on DATE according to which the possibility of returning to one \u2019s home district in GPE was dependent on the prevailing ethnic composition of the population in the district . In the ORG \u2019s view , it was possible to return to the home district where one \u2019s own ethnic group was in the majority . ORG noted that the majority of the population in GPE were NORP . Consequently , the applicant could return to PERSON without having to fear any harassment or outrage . As regards the possible deportation of the applicant to GPE , ORG considered that there was no reason to assume that GPE would not afford him protection . In this respect , the ORG referred to information available from ORG and the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) . This view had been confirmed also by ORG . With respect to the applicant \u2019s alleged actions against GPE , the ORG noted that the applicant had not been politically active in his home country and that there was no indication that his activities in GPE had attracted the attention of NORP authorities . ORG further called into question the veracity of the applicant \u2019s statements as to his being in possession of sensitive information since he had not made this allegation until DATE . Moreover , having regard to the amnesty laws enacted in GPE and GPE , it was not likely that the applicant would be punished for desertion . Finally , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s mental problems , his alleged integration into NORP society and his family ties did not constitute sufficient reasons to grant him a residence permit on humanitarian grounds .", "The applicant appealed to ORG . He invoked a statement by psychologist PERSON who claimed that the applicant showed signs of suffering from a posttraumatic stress syndrome and that it had been considered whether to admit the applicant for institutional care due to the risk of suicide attempts .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision .", "By a decision of DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s mother a permanent residence permit in GPE on account of her family ties . ORG recalled that , under NORP law , a residence permit could be given to a foreigner who used to share a home with a relative living in GPE , if it could be shown that the persons in question were in a state of dependence vis - \u00e0 - vis each other . As regards the circumstances of the particular case , the ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s mother had been living with her CARDINAL sons \u2013 including the applicant \u2013 in GPE until the autumn of DATE . Her son B had left for GPE in DATE and had been granted a permanent residence permit on DATE . Another son , S , had arrived in GPE in DATE . On DATE he had been granted a residence permit based on his ties with his NORP wife with whom he had a child . ORG noted further that the applicant had been refused a residence permit . The applicant \u2019s mother had arrived in GPE in DATE and had been living with S until , in DATE , he moved in with his wife . ORG concluded that there was such a state of dependence between the applicant \u2019s mother and her sons living in GPE that she was entitled to a residence permit .", "Following the decision concerning his mother , the applicant submitted another application for a residence permit . He claimed that he had been living with his mother in GPE and that they had continued to live together after her arrival in GPE in DATE . On DATE ORG rejected the application , finding that no new circumstances had been invoked in the case .", "On DATE the applicant submitted yet another application . Again , he referred to his ties with his mother and claimed that these circumstances had not properly been taken into account by ORG . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG suspended the enforcement of the applicant \u2019s deportation order . The examination of the merits of the latest application is still pending before ORG .", "Relevant domestic law", "Under LAW of LAW ( Lagen om psykiatrisk tv\u00e5ngsv\u00e5rd , DATE ) , such care shall be terminated at the request of the competent police authority whenever the person placed in care is ordered to be deported . This presupposes , however , that the chief physician finds that the alien \u2019s condition allows that the deportation takes place . According to LAW , no appeal lies against the chief physician \u2019s decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
