Contrary to the first medical report , which had stated that the interval between the skull injury and Mr PERSON 's death had been DATE , the report of the CARDINAL experts concluded :", "\u201c The haematoma ... which caused the death of ORG , had been present for TIME before the time of death . The basis for this conclusion is the appearance of the haematoma ( blood clot of dark red colour ) , which is clearly visible on the photographs attached to the file . Clots of that kind , without the presence of liquid blood , are formed during a period of TIME from the moment when they were caused . During this period the patients ' condition is usually characterised by the so - called ' lucid interval ' \u2013 the time during which they do not display visible warning signs .

The experts also found , in view of the amount of alcohol found in Mr PERSON 's blood , that the symptoms resulting from the head injury had been masked by the effects of alcohol .", "CARDINAL . The report of the CARDINAL experts also dealt with the other injuries to Mr PERSON 's body :", "\u201c The haematoma on the right side of the chest is the result of a blow by or against a flat object with a broad hitting surface , which could have taken the form of a kick , a fall and a collision against a larger object and other objects . The general appearance of the bruise corresponds to the imprint of the clothes of the deceased , which indicates that the blow was inflicted through the clothes ... The bruises and injuries to the right side of the forehead , the CARDINAL wrist joints and the lower lip are the result of the use of hard , blunt and/or sharp - edged objects with a limited hitting surface .

On DATE ORG confirmed the closure of the investigation and refused the applicant 's requests . Its decision stated , inter alia :", "\u201c [ A]part from the physical force used during the arrest of ORG for attempting to steal from cars , there is no evidence that any violence was used against him by police officers , whether ... inside or outside the ... police station . Furthermore , the firm conclusion of the report of the CARDINAL experts , who are highly qualified in their field , is that the lethal injury was caused TIME prior to death . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

She noted that the investigation in respect of the police had been closed on the basis of the finding that the fatal injury had been inflicted TIME prior to the death of Mr Zabchekov .

On DATE Mr PERSON summoned the applicant ( represented by counsel ) to allow her to consult the file on the investigation .

The applicant again requested the exhumation of the body and the appointment of experts to answer the questions raised in her previous requests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON drew up a report stating that the additional investigation ordered on DATE had not disclosed evidence that Mr Zabchekov had been beaten prior to his arrest .

On an unspecified date the applicant , acting through ORG , a non - governmental organisation based in GPE , solicited the opinion of Professor PERSON , ORG Pathologist , ORG , ORG , GPE , a member of ORG . Professor PERSON gave a written opinion dated DATE . Professor PERSON had at his disposal , inter alia , the description of what had allegedly happened in the case and extracts from the autopsy report and the reports of the forensic experts .", "Professor PERSON stated , inter alia :", "\u201c An epidural haematoma is usually caused by DATE against a hard surface or a strong blow with a blunt object . It is well known that a fall against a hard surface will often leave so - called contre - coup lesions . It is regrettable that the presence or absence of such lesions have not been mentioned . It has been mentioned that the deceased had a thin skull . In my opinion that is not an apologising factor in cases of interpersonal violence , as it is usually not known if a skull is thick or thin and it is inherent in the possible effects of violence that a person may have a thin skull . Together with the epidural haematoma there is usually a fracture ( fissure ) in the temporal bone and a rupture of the middle meningeal artery . The haemorrhage is thus arterial . It is in the beginning limited by the attachment of the dura to the inside of the bone . There is thus often a lucid interval that may last TIME , but often the interval is not longer than TIME . If the traumatic lesion involves the brain with a concussion or contusions there is usually not a lucid interval .", "I agree with the CARDINAL forensic reports that the cause of death was the epidural haematoma and that it was caused by CARDINAL of the types of traumas mentioned . It may well have happened before the victim was arrested , but it can in no way be excluded that he sustained the fatal lesion during his stay in the police centre . I do not agree with the statement that there was a lapse of TIME from the trauma until death . It was based on the appearance of the blood clot . It is known that the blood after death can take various forms and even after death there is enzymatic biochemical activity that may change the blood in an unpredictable way and in various ways in different locations .", "With reference to the other lesions these are not likely to have been sustained from the same trauma as the epidural haematoma . They are the result of blunt violence such as beating , kicking and/or falls , and may have been sustained during the stay in police detention .", "The marks on the wrists are characteristically the results of handcuffing . Handcuffs will usually not leave marks , but may if they are too tight , if the person is struggling , or if he is dragged by the handcuffs .", "In summary , it can not be determined if the epidural haematoma was caused by a fall or other types of blunt violence . It may well have been sustained just before or during the stay in police detention . An epidural haematoma is curable if an operation with evacuation of the haematoma is performed soon enough . If admitted to hospital sooner , PERSON might have been saved . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
