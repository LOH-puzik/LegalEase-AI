The applicant , an NORP national , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Prosecutor of the Rome Tribunal informed ORG and ORG , that criminal proceedings had been instituted against the applicant ( an NORP citizen resident in GPE ) for , inter alia , money laundering . He further informed them that by a decision of DATE ORG had ordered his preventive detention . The prosecutor therefore requested the GPE judicial authorities to extradite the applicant and place him in preventive detention on the basis of LAW between GPE and GPE of DATE ( LAW ) . At the same time he requested ORG to authorise the extradition request .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON ( ORG ) accepted the request and ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest and preventive detention pending his extradition , on the basis of LAW , noting , moreover , that GPE had also ratified LAW of DATE ( the DATE Convention ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was notified of the order and arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pending the official request by ORG according to LAW , the ORG requested ORG ) to authorise the extradition , noting that the relevant requirements were fulfilled . No reply was received .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his lawyer were heard in relation to his extradition . On DATE , the ORG rejected a request by the applicant for house arrest on the basis of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the Secretary of ORG informed the ORG about a note verbal from the NORP embassy of DATE which noted that GPE had become a party to the CARDINAL Convention on DATE and that therefore the NORP request would be submitted within DATE stipulated in the CARDINAL Convention . Moreover , the note verbal requested the extension available under LAW , in the event that it became necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained against the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) in so far as there had been no urgent reasons under LAW , which in his view was applicable to the present extradition , justifying preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal judge dismissed this complaint . The court considered that the preventive measure was to facilitate extradition . It considered the element of urgency to be linked to the risk of absconding and that one had to take account of the geographical situation of GPE . The court held that the basis of the detention was the arrest warrant of CARDINAL DATE which it was thereby confirming , however , modifying the applicable rules in that such orders were to be governed by LAW which had to apply to the present extradition . While it was true that the first steps of the extradition process had been in accordance with LAW and the subsequent ones with LAW ; it was also true that GPE had made a reservation , when ratifying LAW , to the effect that its bilateral agreement would prevail . However , GPE had not made such a reservation or acknowledged LOC one .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , the applicant requested , under LAW , to be released on DATE from his arrest , if the extradition request and relevant documents were not submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE this request was rejected by the ORG , holding that the CARDINAL Convention , which prevailed DATE Convention , stipulated a maximum of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the CR of the extradition request and relevant documents submitted by ORG on DATE . He confirmed that the conditions of the CARDINAL Convention were fulfilled and therefore requested the authorisation of the extradition . On DATE the ORG gave its authorisation on the basis of the CARDINAL Convention and the ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s extradition , which took place DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicant was picked up and TIME later notified of the extradition order which he refused to sign claiming it should be submitted to his lawyer . He was transferred to the NORP police at TIME and at TIME the extradition order was notified to CARDINAL of his lawyers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application ( ex art QUANTITY . ) with the Terza Istanza Penale against the appeal judge \u2019s order of DATE ( confirming the order of CARDINAL DATE concerning preventive detention \u2013 paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the extradition order of DATE . In relation to the former he argued that he was not a dangerous individual , there was no risk of absconding or altering evidence , no need to protect the community , that the charges brought forward by ORG were unfounded and that the extradition request had not been properly submitted . In respect of the extradition , he claimed , inter alia , that it had been vitiated since it had been requested on the basis of LAW and not LAW , which could not apply in view of the reservation by GPE to the effect that its bilateral agreements would prevail . Moreover , the entire procedure had been tainted by illegality , the rights of the defence had been breached in that the applicant had not been heard nor were his lawyers notified or allowed access to the applicant at the time of the extradition . He also referred back to the submissions made on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ( notified on DATE ) the Terza PERSON held that it could not take cognisance of the complaint against the extradition order as this was still pending before the appeal judge at second instance ( see below ) . As to the rest , it reiterated that while it was true that the first steps of the extradition process had been in accordance with LAW and the subsequent ones with LAW ; it was also true that GPE had made a reservation , when ratifying LAW , to the effect that its bilateral agreement would prevail . However , GPE had not made such a reservation or acknowledged LOC one . This , thus , led to a situation where for GPE LAW applied and for GPE LAW applied . This was clearly unworkable . Thus , it was obvious that the reservation could only apply if both GPE had coinciding declarations . As to the decision to keep the applicant in preventive detention the court found that the ORG \u2019s decision had been a legitimate exercise of discretion in which the ORG had considered the seriousness of the offences , the evidence presented and any other conditions relevant to the aim of successfully extraditing the applicant . Therefore , the conditions for the application of such a measure were fulfilled under both LAW . Moreover , it could not be said that the extradition process had caused the applicant prejudice at any time . The process had been in conformity with the NORP request and the relevant LAW at different stages . This constituted a legitimate basis for the entire extradition proceedings including the duration of the detention . Thus , it further confirmed the order of arrest of CARDINAL DATE and the decision of the appeal judge of DATE , which were thereby definitive .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( DATE before DATE first set of proceedings mentioned above ) , the applicant had lodged an application ( ex art QUANTITY . and art CARDINAL of Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL no.CARDINAL ) before the appeal judge against the extradition order of DATE . His application started by reiterating the arguments made in his submissions of CARDINAL DATE ( regarding preventive detention ) . He further argued , inter alia , that he had been extradited without being heard and without being notified of the authorisations relevant to such procedure except for the order of CARDINAL DATE , and pointed to other irregularities which vitiated the request such as the application of QUANTITY Conventions which had different formal requirements . He also reiterated other issues raised in his submissions of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The application was rejected on DATE ( DATE after the above mentioned final judgment of DATE ) . The court noted that the object of the application was the same as that made in another application . The objection to the execution of the applicant \u2019s extradition order of CARDINAL DATE was identical in both proceedings . The objection against the decision of CARDINAL DATE was inadmissible not quite on the basis that it was being contested in another forum , but particularly because the arguments brought forward were the same in both fora .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to the NORP Istanza GPE against this decision . The applicant stated that he was appealing the decision of DATE which had rejected his appeal of \u201c CARDINAL DATE \u201d . He argued , inter alia , that he had been extradited without being heard and without being notified of the authorisations relevant to such procedure except for the order of CARDINAL DATE , and pointed to other irregularities which vitiated the request such as the application of CARDINAL Conventions which had different formal requirements , and the issues raised in his submissions of CARDINAL DATE . In consequence he considered that the extradition had to be considered invalid .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the NORP PERSON considered this application to refer to all the steps of the extradition proceedings , as it reiterated the same grounds aired previously in different phases of the proceedings , including those before the same judge in the Terza Istanza GPE . The court held that , as to the notification , both the applicant and his lawyers had been informed of the arrest order dated CARDINAL DATE on DATE , and the NORP ordinance on which the arrest order was based had been notified the subsequent day . Following that , the applicant \u2019s lawyers had had full access to him while in detention and to all the relevant documents in the proceedings . The applicant had been heard in a hearing and had made use of multiple remedies in respect of every step of the proceedings . The court reiterated that all these proceedings had been governed by the CARDINAL Convention , as the prevailing instrument and that any order based on LAW had not prejudiced the applicant in his right to liberty . On the substance it considered that there had been sufficient logical and juridical justification to accept the NORP request for extradition which had been submitted including all the relevant and necessary elements according to the relevant international legal texts . Lastly , the Terza Istanza PERSON noted that the appeal judge had upheld the prosecutor \u2019s objections that there had been nothing new in this application which was therefore inadmissible . Bearing in mind all the above , it considered the appeal manifestly ill - founded and confirmed the order of DATE for the applicant \u2019s extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP courts released the applicant following the expiration of the time - limits of detention prescribed by law .", "CARDINAL .
