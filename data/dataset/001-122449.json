It also appointed an expert who was entrusted with the task of collecting the necessary information for a final decision on custody . Moreover , the court granted GPE access rights twice a month in a neutral location , noting that the meetings should alternate between GPE and GPE and that the dates and arrangements should be agreed with the expert .", "CARDINAL .

The court also noted that ORG had not responded to its request to submit his arguments .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s request for the return of the child under LAW . Referring to the expert \u2019s opinion and having regard to the very young age of the first applicant , the court found that her return would constitute a grave risk for her within the meaning of Article CARDINAL(b ) of LAW .

The child would live with her mother , the second applicant , should the latter decide to return to GPE with her . In that case the PERSON GPE social services were required to provide accommodation to the applicants . Moreover , a programme for the exercise of ORG \u2019s access rights would have to be established . If the second applicant did not wish to return to GPE , the first applicant was to stay with her father .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that it remained competent to deal with the case , as ORG had wrongly determined its jurisdiction under LAW ) of ORG . It noted that its previous decision of DATE had been designed as a temporary measure in order to re - establish contact between the first applicant and her father through access rights and to obtain a basis for an expert opinion for the decision on custody . However , the second applicant had failed to co - operate with the appointed expert and had refused a programme of access rights for the father prepared by the expert . The latter had stated in her preliminary opinion that she was not in a position to answer all questions relating to the child \u2019s best interests in a satisfactory manner .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s request . It noted that the second applicant was not willing to return to GPE with the first applicant . However , the first applicant \u2019s return to GPE without her mother would constitute a grave risk for the child within the meaning of Article CARDINAL(b ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG quashed that decision and granted ORG request for the enforcement of ORG order to return the child .", "CARDINAL . The Leoben Regional Court noted that under LAW a judgment refusing return under LAW was not relevant where the court which was competent pursuant to ORG had ordered the child \u2019s return in a subsequent judgment . It confirmed that ORG had been competent to issue the judgment of DATE , as the second applicant had unlawfully removed the first applicant from GPE and GPE had immediately requested her return . Moreover , ORG had submitted a certificate of enforceability under LAW of ORG in respect of the judgment at issue . The NORP courts therefore had to recognise the judgment and to enforce it . They did not have to establish anew whether the first applicant \u2019s return would be against her best interests . In any event , there was no indication that the circumstances had changed since ORG had given its judgment . It was for the court of first instance to order appropriate measures of enforcement .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) . She submitted , in particular , that the NORP courts were competent to deal with custody matters concerning the first applicant by virtue of LAW CARDINAL(b ) subparagraph ( iv ) of ORG , as ORG had accepted the child \u2019s residence in GPE in its decision of DATE . Moreover , the return order of ORG of DATE did not fall under LAW ) of that Regulation as it did not contain a decision on custody . Further , that judgment had not taken the child \u2019s best interests into account . The transfer of preliminary sole custody to the second applicant by the decision of LOC of CARDINAL DATE prevented the enforcement of the return order pursuant to Article CARDINAL ) of ORG . Finally , the circumstances had changed after ORG had issued its judgment of DATE in that ORG had refused to exercise his access rights . The first applicant had therefore not seen her father since DATE . The enforcement of the return order would therefore violate the child \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG requested a preliminary ruling by ORG of ORG ( CJEU ) , submitting a number of questions concerning the application of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a preliminary ruling ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG ) confirming the jurisdiction of the NORP courts in the case and the enforceability of ORG judgment of DATE . It found , in particular , that", "( CARDINAL ) a provisional measure [ as the CARDINAL issued by ORG in DATE ] did not constitute a \u2018 judgment on custody that does not entail the return of the child\u2019 within the meaning of Article CARDINAL(b ) subparagraph ( iv ) of ORG and could not be the basis of a transfer of jurisdiction to the courts of the Member ORG to which the child had been unlawfully removed ;", "( CARDINAL ) Article CARDINAL ) of the ORG applied to a judgment of the court with jurisdiction ordering the return of the child , even if it was not preceded by a final judgment of that court relating to rights of custody of the child ;", "( CARDINAL ) Article CARDINAL ) subparagraph ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG had to be interpreted as meaning that a judgment delivered subsequently by a court of the Member ORG of enforcement which awarded provisional rights of custody , could not preclude enforcement of a certified judgment delivered previously by the court which had jurisdiction in the Member ORG of origin and had ordered the return of the child ;", "( CARDINAL ) enforcement of a certified judgment [ ordering the child \u2019s return ] could not be refused by the Member State of enforcement because , as a result of a subsequent change of circumstances , it might be seriously detrimental to the best interests of the child . Such a change had to be pleaded before the court which had jurisdiction in the Member ORG of origin which also had to hear any application to suspend the enforcement of its judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It noted that according to the ORG \u2019s ruling the NORP courts\u2019 only task was to take the necessary steps for the enforcement of the return order , without proceeding to any review of the merits of the decision . If the second applicant asserted that the circumstances had changed since ORG had given its judgment , she had to apply to that court , which would also be competent to grant such an application suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant a request by the second applicant for the enforcement of its judgment of DATE to be stayed . Referring to that decision , PERSON requested ORG to order the first applicant \u2019s return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG requested ORG to submit evidence that appropriate accommodation would be [ made ] available to the applicants [ by the social services of the PERSON GPE community ] , as required by ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG withdrew the second applicant \u2019s custody rights and awarded sole custody of the first applicant to her father , PERSON It further ordered the first applicant \u2019s return to her father in GPE , to reside with him in the PERSON GPE community . The court ordered the PERSON GPE social services \u2013 if need be in co - operation with the neuro - psychiatric service of the local health authority \u2013 to see to maintaining contact between the first and the second applicants and to give the first applicant linguistic and pedagogic support for her integration into her new family and social environment .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred to its decision of DATE , which had aimed at preserving the first applicant \u2019s relationship with her mother while re - establishing contact with her father , noting that such attempts had failed owing to lack of co - operation from the second applicant . It had therefore ordered the first applicant \u2019s return to GPE in its judgment of DATE . It further considered that the second applicant had unlawfully removed the first applicant to GPE and had subsequently deprived her of having any contact with her father without good reason . She had thus acted against the child \u2019s best interests . It therefore found that sole custody was to be awarded to the father . Since so far any attempts to establish contact step by step had failed , the first applicant was to reside with him immediately . The court noted that this would entail a difficult transition for the first applicant but considered that the damage of growing up without her father would weigh even heavier . The court considered that the social services would have to give the first applicant pedagogical and linguistic support to settle in her new family and social environment and to maintain contact with her mother . Finally , the court considered that the first applicant \u2019s return would not entail any grave risk of psychological or physical harm within the meaning of LAW of ORG , which in turn referred to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant did not appeal against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE M.A. notified the NORP ORG of ORG judgment of DATE . He also submitted a certificate of enforceability under LAW of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s request for the order of the first applicant \u2019s return . It considered that he had failed to submit proof that appropriate accommodation would be available for the first and second applicants upon their return .", "CARDINAL . M.A. appealed . He submitted , in particular , that ORG judgment of DATE had granted him sole custody of the child and had ordered her return to GPE , where she would reside with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed ORG \u2019s appeal and ordered the second applicant to hand over the first applicant to her father PERSON within DATE , noting that enforcement measures would be taken in case of failure to comply .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the condition that appropriate accommodation be made available to the applicants was no longer valid : in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG had awarded sole custody of the first applicant to GPE and had ordered that she return to reside with him . PERSON had submitted that judgment , together with a certificate of enforceability under LAW of ORG . The second applicant \u2019s obligation to return the first applicant to her father thus resulted directly from ORG judgment of DATE . Finally , the ORG noted that the custody decision of ORG of DATE could not prevent the enforcement of ORG judgment . The latter had retained its competence to rule on custody , as the second applicant had unlawfully removed the first applicant to GPE and PERSON had made a timely request for her return under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant did not comply with the return order . She lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the second applicant \u2019s extraordinary appeal on points of law as the case did not raise an important legal issue . It noted that the return order had become final and was enforceable . The first - instance court now had no other task than to define the steps to be taken to enforce the return order . The ORG had clarified that where there was a certificate of enforceability under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG , the requested court had to proceed to the enforcement . Any questions relating to the merits of the return decision , in particular the question whether the requirements for ordering a return were met , had to be raised before the courts of the requesting ORG in accordance with the laws of that ORG . Consequently , any change in circumstances affecting the question whether a return would endanger the child \u2019s well - being had to be raised before the competent court of the requesting ORG . The second applicant \u2019s argument that the first applicant \u2019s return would lead to serious harm for the child and entail a violation of LAW was therefore not relevant in the proceedings before the NORP courts but had to be raised before the competent NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Leoben ORG held that it was not competent to conduct the enforcement proceedings and transferred the case to ORG , due to a change of the applicants\u2019 place of residence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Wiener ORG issued a decision on the next steps to be taken in the enforcement proceedings . The judge noted , in particular , that a continuation of the path chosen by both parents , namely the use of the child in the conflict between them , would lead to the child \u2019s traumatisation , especially if the GPE unbending position eventually led to an enforcement of the return order by coercive measures as a last resort . He noted that the best interests of the child required the parents to reach a workable compromise . The judge therefore proposed that a hearing in the presence of both parents be organised in order to seek a constructive solution . Accordingly , he requested both parents to indicate within DATE whether they were ready to participate in the proposed meeting . The judge further noted that if the parents were not willing to participate in the hearing , the enforced return of the child would be arranged . In this context the judge stated that any trauma suffered by the first applicant because of such enforcement would then have to be laid at the door of the parents . Moreover , the child \u2019s father would be required to find a way to deal with the trauma caused to the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON informed GPE that he was not ready to participate in a hearing with the second applicant , but wanted to arrange the return of the child with the least traumatic impact possible . He therefore suggested that he come to GPE with his parents to pick up the child or , alternatively , that the second applicant travel to GPE with the child to hand her over . He therefore requested the second applicant to either fix a pick - up date in GPE or to inform him of a date when she would bring the child to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant informed ORG that she was ready to take part in the proposed hearing . She also informed the court that she had appealed against the decision which had transferred the case from ORG to GPE . Consequently , the decision establishing GPE competence had not become final . She therefore requested the court to await the decision on her appeal before taking any further steps .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the second applicant argued that if enforcement measures had to be taken , they must be taken in accordance with NORP law pursuant to LAW . NORP law , namely section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Non - Contentious Proceedings Act , allowed the court to refrain from an enforcement if the child \u2019s interests were at risk . The second applicant drew attention to the fact that the first applicant , who was DATE , had not seen her father since DATE and did not speak NORP , while PERSON did not speak NORP . A return as envisaged by ORG would traumatise the child , as would the application of any coercive measures . The only way of avoiding this was to build up the relationship between the first applicant and her father step by step . She therefore requested GPE to order PERSON to come to GPE as often as was necessary to establish a relationship with the child and to organise her return to GPE without having recourse to coercive measures .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the Wiener ORG ordered the second applicant to hand over the child to her father by DATE and stated that in case of failure to comply coercive measures would be applied . ORG noted that it was for the second applicant to choose whether she would accompany her daughter to GPE or whether she would fix a date within that time - limit for the father to pick up the child in GPE . Furthermore , ORG referring to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , repeated that it was for the NORP courts to examine any question relating to the child \u2019s well - being . It noted finally , that the deadline for handing over the child had been fixed in such a way as to allow her to finish DATE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Since their arrival in GPE in DATE the first applicant has been living with the second applicant . In DATE the second applicant entered into a relationship with a new partner . She gave birth to a son in DATE . The second applicant , her new partner and the CARDINAL children are living in a common household . It appears that the first applicant does not speak NORP and has not seen her father since DATE .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL sets of criminal proceedings are pending against the second applicant before ORG . In the first set of proceedings ( no . MONEY ) , she is accused of removal of a minor and failure to comply with court orders . The second set of proceedings ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerns charges of abduction of a minor to another country .", "CARDINAL .
