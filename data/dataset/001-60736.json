SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who was born in DATE and had been on early retirement since DATE , applied for disability benefits under LAW ( NORP om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) . He claimed that he had extra costs following an operation on his intestines in DATE due to , inter alia , an increased consumption of fluids .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ; hereinafter \u201c the Office \u201d ) of GPE rejected the application , finding that the applicant \u2019s costs were not such as to make him eligible for benefits .", "CARDINAL . The applicant later made a new application , which was rejected by ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . On DATE the court rejected his appeal . The court did not hold an oral hearing nor did the applicant request CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s further appeal , ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE , refused him leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made yet another application for disability benefits . On DATE the application was rejected by the ORG , which again found that the applicant \u2019s costs did not attain the required level . The ORG had at its disposal CARDINAL medical certificates issued by different physicians . They expressed differing opinions on the applicant \u2019s need of extra consumption of fluids , CARDINAL of them considering that there was no such need and the third one stating that the applicant was recommended , from a surgical point of view , an increased consumption of , for instance , mineral water .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . In a decision of DATE the court noted that the issue in the case was whether the applicant \u2019s extra costs attained the level required for a disability allowance under LAW . Finding that the medical evidence in the case was inconclusive and did not provide the ORG with a sufficient basis for a decision , the court ordered ORG ( Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket ; hereinafter \u201c the Board \u201d ) to submit observations in the case . ORG answered by a letter of CARDINAL DATE , in which it contested the applicant \u2019s claims . The applicant made observations in reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment in the applicant \u2019s favour . Having reiterated that the medical evidence was inconclusive , the court also noted that the calculations of the applicant \u2019s extra costs made by the ORG and the applicant himself were very close on either side of the level required for entitlement to a disability allowance . In these circumstances , it gave the applicant the benefit of the doubt and granted him an allowance . An oral hearing was not requested by the applicant , nor did the court hold one of its own motion .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed against the judgment to ORG and submitted a medical certificate from a further physician , who stated that an increased consumption of fluids was necessary due to the applicant \u2019s handicap but that there was no particular need for mineral water . On DATE the appellate court granted the ORG leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the applicant requested the appellate court to hold an oral hearing in the case . He did not state any reasons for his request . On DATE it was rejected by the court . After having restated section CARDINAL of ORG ( F\u00f6rvaltningsprocess - lagen , ORG ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ; see further paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the court gave the following reasons :", "\u201c Having regard to the subject - matter at issue and the information that has come to hand in the case , [ the court ] finds that an oral hearing is unnecessary and rejects the request to that effect . [ The applicant ] is invited to state the further circumstances he wishes to invoke and submit his final written observations in the case within DATE after having been notified of this decision .", "The case can be determined notwithstanding a failure to submit such written observations . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant reiterated his request for an oral hearing on CARDINAL DATE . He now stated that he wished to be heard in person about his working conditions and the costs of his consumption of fluids . Further , representatives of ORG should be heard about the applicable levels for entitlement to and calculation of disability allowances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s renewed request for an oral hearing and gave judgment in favour of ORG . Thus , it quashed ORG judgment and confirmed the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE . Without giving any further reasons , it considered that the information in the case did not show that the applicant met the conditions for a disability allowance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) . He requested that the case be referred back to ORG for re - examination or , alternatively , that ORG confirm ORG judgment . He complained about the lack of an oral hearing in ORG and also requested ORG to hold an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant that it did not normally hold oral hearings and gave him the opportunity to complete his appeal in writing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW , a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits , provided that , before reaching DATE , he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time - consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses . The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation . It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses . According to the ORG \u2019s guidelines , the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to PERCENT of a basic amount geared to the price index ( basbelopp ) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance . In DATE , when the applicant made his second application to the ORG , this corresponded to MONEY ( SEK ) .", "CARDINAL . A decision by ORG under LAW may be appealed against to ORG and from there on to ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of LAW . Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The proceedings are in writing .", "An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the preparatory documents to LAW , an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in CARDINAL situations in particular : firstly , when it is necessary to hear a witness , an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and , secondly , when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute . In the latter case , the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character . It was stressed , however , that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It was further stated , in respect of the third paragraph of section CARDINAL , that a party \u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration . However , such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter , as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case . Still , other circumstances may be of relevance , for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party \u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case . Nevertheless , if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case , there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing ( p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
