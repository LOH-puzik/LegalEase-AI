It emphasised that in the present case ORG decisions gave no valid reason for refusing to allow the applicant to establish his practice in PERSON . In conclusion , it described the proceedings before ORG as unfair , since the applicant had been refused any opportunity to make his case and because ORG had done no more than speculate about his state of health .", "CARDINAL . ORG invited the applicant to its meetings on DATE and DATE . He was unable to attend , but presented his apologies .", "CARDINAL .
