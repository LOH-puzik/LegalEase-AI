Asked about the times and places of these imprisonments PERSON states that he was imprisoned the first time in GPE in DATE . He was arrested with all the others who were at the GPE office ( a large mining company ) on an occasion soon after the coup . They were taken to a military centre and badly treated . PERSON has not talked about this earlier because he was of the opinion that the police in GPE co - operate with the NORP police . He no longer holds this view .", "Since the above - mentioned event lies far back in time PERSON was encouraged to begin his account by relating the most recent occasion on which he was subjected to persecution . He then stated that in DATE he was stopped when he was walking along a street called PERSON . It was then that CARDINAL men stepped out of a car and pulled him into a car which then drove to some sort of security building . During the journey he was hit in the ribs . He was taken down a long stairway and into some kind of investigation room . He was photographed after he had removed his clothes . He was hit , mainly on the head . He was hung up by his feet and photographed in this position . He was asked the whereabouts of PERSON but was unable to answer . PERSON was chairman of the free humanist thinkers . PERSON did not wish to relate more about the treatment on this occasion . He did however add that they told him that they were going to shoot him later the same day . He was blindfolded and after that he felt that someone was pressing the barrel of a weapon against his body but no shot was fired . Asked why they did this PERSON said that they gave as a reason that he was a NORP , which he has never been . After PERSON had been scared by the incident with the weapon he was released and after that was treated kindly by a man who was also present . The man told PERSON that things would be much better if he co - operated with the police . When asked if they were in a police station PERSON said that they were in a security building . They also mentioned to PERSON the names of the members of his family . At TIME he was driven away and was released after being held in custody for TIME . PERSON has not mentioned this incident earlier . Asked why he had not done so in spite of a number of police interrogations , numerous contacts with counsel and in spite of the fact that many documents with information about him had been submitted to the authorities , he replied that he had been betrayed many times earlier and he could not therefore trust anyone .", "In DATE , he was somewhat uncertain about the exact date , PERSON was walking along a street in GPE after having attended a neighbourhood committee meeting . PERSON was on his way to catch a bus to GPE del Mar. CARDINAL men came in a car , threatened him with a knife against his throat and apprehended him . They were civilians in a civilian vehicle . They travelled in the direction of GPE del Mar. A black blindfold was placed over his eyes and then they took him out of the car and kicked him . PERSON protected himself as well as he could by putting his hands over his head and crotch . They insulted him too . They told him he should give up struggling against the Government . They said they knew of PERSON and that he ought to stop ; otherwise this could be DATE of his life . Even his family was threatened . These events took place in a building PERSON was taken to but he knows nothing about it because he was blindfolded .

He was also near to being knocked down by a bus in connection with his being released from the car . The whole sequence of events took place within DATE TIME . DATE PERSON found his dog , DATE , dead under such circumstances that he suspected that it was the ORG or ORG [ ORG ] that lay behind it . The dog had been impaled on a metal fence that surrounded the house where PERSON lived . The conclusion PERSON drew was that he was subjected to this as a result of his activity in youth groups and friendship committees . PERSON had worked for a democratic development of GPE . Every time PERSON was arrested the \u2018 police\u2019 knew what he had been working for . The interrogation so far has been translated to PERSON who subsequently wished to point out that the committees were neighbourhood committees and not friendship committees and he also wanted to say that the reason why he did not trust anyone was just because the police knew so much about him when they held him in custody .", "Without the presence of the interpreter or counsel , in accordance with ORG wishes , he stated that on the occasion when he was arrested by persons he thought were from the ORG in DATE he was also subjected to something else that he tried to suppress and which he finds very painful to talk about . After he had been tortured among other ways by electrodes in his anus and testicles , he was placed on a bed lying face down and his hands and feet were tied to bedposts . In this position CARDINAL or more men attacked him sexually . PERSON was at that point dazed from the previous treatment and can not therefore say with certainty if there was CARDINAL person . ( This section without the presence of the interpreter or counsel . PERSON can make himself understood in NORP . )", "In addition PERSON has not been able to express the problems he has had as a probable result of the treatment he was subjected to . He has difficulties eating with cutlery made of metal . These problems manifest themselves with pains in his teeth on every occasion that his teeth come in contact with a metal object . This problem has become less intense but has been very intense earlier . It has thus been a question of CARDINAL different types of complaints . Firstly PERSON has experienced general pain in his teeth and secondly he has had problems with metal objects . PERSON first experienced the problem with his teeth after electric shock torture in DATE . He was subjected to this form of torture on a total of CARDINAL or CARDINAL occasions . After the torture in DATE PERSON also had many headaches . He has also noticed that since then he has had lapses of memory .", "Otherwise PERSON has nothing more that he personally wishes to relate other than the above . When asked if he had anything to add on his political involvement he stated that he had already accounted for it but that he could now present new documents which support the previous statements . CARDINAL certificates were handed over . CARDINAL from PERSON , President of ORG in ORG , CARDINAL from PERSON , co - ordinator in the organisation of neighbourhood committees , as well as a certificate from ORG on the Rights of Young People .", "The above was translated to PERSON who thereafter had no wish to refer to further details in the case .

A third certificate dated DATE by ORG on the Rights of Young People ) in ORG contained similar statements .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG referred the question of the enforcement of the expulsion order to ORG . On DATE ORG decided that Mr PERSON should report to the police twice a week because of the danger that he would evade enforcement of the expulsion .

Mr PERSON stated that PERSON had declared that he had been ill - treated in prisons in GPE and that he had shown a deformation of his upper left collar - bone , a scar on his left upper arm and a scar on the left of his chest .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred the case to the Government on DATE , expressing the opinion that there was no impediment to the enforcement of the expulsion order . ORG found that Mr PERSON had the opportunity on several occasions to present his case to ORG and to it . However , on these occasions he had given contradictory information and had now radically changed his story . It concluded that even if it took into account the difficulties that a victim might have to describe what he had been subjected to there was no reason to believe his allegations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON submitted a medical report to the ORG which had been prepared by a doctor of forensic medicine , PERSON .

They lived in the town of GPE in GPE . His father was arrested during the military coup in DATE and was brutally tortured and released after DATE . The patient was then DATE . He was also arrested and hit but , as he himself states , he was not directly tortured . They moved to the town of PERSON . The patient was also a member of ORG which is a party prohibited in GPE . The patient was persecuted during DATE . His own home was subject to a search in DATE . He was hit by the police and taken to a security building where his eyes were bandaged and he was hit by hands and was burnt on his left arm with a red - hot pipe . He participated in a demonstration against ... a coin which the ORG had introduced . He was arrested later and was tortured by electrification . In DATE he was subjected to such torture on his genitals . He was sodomised with an electrified rod which caused him great pain and one can see on the patient \u2019s face when he speaks of this torture that he was clearly in pain , he is near to tears . He was raped and sodomised several times which caused him to faint . He is very pained by telling this and his upper lip shakes and he perspires profusely . He has never told this to his wife and he now says \u2018 I can not take it any more\u2019 . The reaction is very typical of self - experienced humiliating sexual torture . Following a question the patient says that he has for a long time after this event had great problems of impotence . He thinks that it has been better in GPE . He takes vitamin E against these problems .", "In DATE his dog was found dead , hanged on an iron fence which surrounded his house . There was a note stating that this would happen to all communists . It was signed by ORG which was the same as if it had been ORG . In DATE he therefore left GPE . I ask what would happen if he had to return to GPE . The patient is then very upset and says that he can not return and starts to cry ; he is convinced that they will arrest him at the airport and continue persecuting and torturing him . \"", "CARDINAL . A further medical opinion was produced in evidence prepared by PERSON , a specialist in psychiatric diseases at ORG . That opinion , dated DATE , stated that , from the manner in which he presented his story and his reactions while telling it , there were strong indications that he suffered from a post - traumatic stress syndrome . PERSON found him to be considerably shaken and on the borderline of what he could tolerate .", "CARDINAL . The following description of the political activities of Mr PERSON was given by his lawyer in a letter to ORG of DATE :", "\" The appellant has been politically interested and active in different left - wing organisations ever since DATE and by DATE he was involved with ORG ( PERSON Izquierda Revolucionaria ) .

The reason why all these details are not found in the police interrogation is that the interrogation concentrated on events during DATE . However at the end of the interrogation it is mentioned that he had been tortured CARDINAL times .", "When asked to account for his activity with the \u2018 Front\u2019 he stated the following : some time during DATE he made contact by chance with a person who was nicknamed the \u2018 Gorilla\u2019 because of his heavy build and hair growth . PERSON knew the PERSON from DATE when both of them were active in ORG . When they met again they had not seen each other for DATE but they immediately recognised each other . They met at a GPE meeting in a school in ORG which the Gorilla \u2019s daughters attended .", "...", "After a while his acquaintance with the Gorilla led to clear sabotage activities . The Gorilla held a senior post at the town \u2019s ORG . Hector has a knowledge of explosives after having worked in mining . Together they used explosive devices to destroy power lines around the town . They complemented each other well : the Gorilla indicated the targets and planned the operations , PERSON acquired the dynamite by travelling to the town of GPE where he has many childhood friends . He was able to buy dynamite from his friends who work in the mine . The dynamite was smuggled out by the workers . This activity continued until some time in DATE .", "After this PERSON did not participate in any further sabotage operations since he felt he was under too much observation . However he believes that the PERSON continued the activities since they had a fairly large stock of dynamite . He has also read in the newspapers about power lines being sabotaged after he had discontinued the activity himself .", "The Gorilla has tried in different ways to get him to participate in more advanced military projects . They have often discussed the possibility of trying to arm the populace and start a school for military training . They have drawn up detailed plans of how they would obtain weapons . These plans began as a discussion about \u2018 how one could do even more ... \u2019 . Among other things concrete plans were drawn up on how to attack a carabineer barracks . The purpose of the attack would be to get hold of weapons which could later be used in other kinds of attacks . Nothing came of these plans because PERSON was arrested in DATE . During this arrest the police asked a wide range of questions ; inter alia , questions were asked about places which were to be meeting points for the participants in the attack . The attack against the carabineer barracks never took place . PERSON found out instead that another attack had been carried out against another carabineer barracks .", "When asked to describe more details about the plan to attack , PERSON said that he and the Gorilla were to carry the stolen weapons to the churchyard and bury them there . When the time was right , the weapons were to be fetched from the churchyard by other persons .", "The PERSON never mentioned Frente PERSON by name , but PERSON understood that the PERSON had a relatively central position in the organisation . The PERSON himself only mentioned that he was now active in ORG . As an example of the PERSON \u2019s central position PERSON mentioned that a short time before the assassination attempt against PERSON the PERSON asked PERSON if he would consider driving a lorry on a very important occasion . PERSON gave a hesitant reply and the suggestion was dropped . In retrospect PERSON has realised that it could possibly have been the vehicle that would be used on the occasion of the assassination attempt .", "PERSON has not taken part in any direct military operations . On CARDINAL occasion however he was instructed to drive a lorry to a particular spot . He was to park the lorry there and then fetch another lorry .

Thus , in DATE , he returned there .", "When asked about the numerous \u2018 ORG occasions when he met people who can be assumed to belong to the \u2018 Front\u2019 , PERSON replied that he had also wondered about this . With regard to the Gorilla he felt it was pure chance that he met him . PERSON is more hesitant about the second friend . PERSON said that it could have been a chance encounter but that it could also have been a conscious attempt to bind him more firmly to the activities of the ORG . PERSON stated himself that because of his knowledge of explosives and as the owner of a remotely situated house he could be of interest to such an organisation as the \u2018 Front\u2019 .", "When PERSON returned to ORG he felt he was being observed in different ways . He stated that he quite frequently encountered different types of salesmen who got in touch with him .", "...", "During CARDINAL of our conversations PERSON said suddenly \u2018 there is something I have never talked about and something which I shall never PERSON .
