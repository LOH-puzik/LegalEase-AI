The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE GPE , the applicant \u2019s future husband and his parents living in corporate housing ( \u201c flat A \u201d ) owned by \u201c GPE \u201d , a ORG company ( hereinafter \u201c the GPE company \u201d ) , were offered the chance by the latter to exchange this accommodation for larger corporate housing accommodation ( \u201c flat B \u201d ) , which was also owned by ORG . Having accepted this offer , the CARDINAL of them signed a written undertaking to vacate flat A when they moved to flat B.", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant married PERSON and joined him , his parents and brother to live in flat A.", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s and ORG \u2019s son was born . Along with the applicant , he was registered by the local authority as a co - tenant of flat A on the grounds that both of them had become members of the original tenants\u2019 family .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE company transferred ownership of flat A to the municipality .", "CARDINAL . At various subsequent dates the applicant \u2019s husband and parents - in - law moved out into flat B and registered their residence at the new address .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the applicant and her son also moved into flat B at the material time .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , she and her son remained residents in flat A , as her marriage with ORG was falling apart and living together had become intolerable .", "CARDINAL . In DATE V.D. and the applicant divorced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE company decided to reallocate flat A to the family of NORP , its employee , who lived in an accommodation hall ( \u0433\u0443\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043a ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the GPE company lodged a claim in the Kalush ORG , seeking , in particular , to evict the applicant and her son from flat LAW It argued that there was no legal basis for them to remain in the property , which had been reallocated to a new tenant ( NORP ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court dismissed the claim for the eviction of the applicant and her son . It found , in particular , that the applicant had lawfully moved into flat A as a member of the original tenants\u2019 family and so had acquired all the rights of a social tenant , within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of LAW ( DATE ) . She and her son had never promised to relocate and had remained residents of flat A at the material time . They had not been included in the occupancy voucher ( \u00ab \u043e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0440 ORG ) of flat B and had not been provided with any other housing . They could therefore not be evicted without being provided with alternative accommodation . Moreover , in DATE the GPE company had transferred flat A to municipal ownership . It had therefore had no standing in DATE to reallocate the same flat to NORP \u2019s family or to bring the present proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP The GPE company appealed , referring to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE - Frankivsk ORG of Appeal quashed the judgment of DATE and ordered the applicant \u2019s and her son \u2019s eviction \u201c without provision of any other accommodation \u201d . It held that ORG , having properly established the relevant facts , had interpreted the law incorrectly . Notably , according to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , the applicant ( together with her son ) \u2013 having settled in flat A as a member of the original tenants\u2019 family \u2013 was bound by the duty of the original tenants to vacate the flat . There was therefore no legal basis for the applicant \u2019s and her son \u2019s continued residency in flat A , and this fact constituted a sufficient basis for their eviction without the provision of any other housing . Furthermore , ORG had erred in respect of the GPE company \u2019s legal standing . Under LAW of LAW , notwithstanding the transfer of the property to the municipality , the GPE company had retained the right to allocate the flat to CARDINAL of its employees . It had therefore had legitimate standing to seek the vacation of the flat by its previous tenants .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a request for leave to appeal in cassation . She noted that she and her minor son had been lawful and registered residents of the disputed flat for DATE . During this period , she had dutifully engaged in the payment of all expenses relating to her occupancy of the flat . Unlike her former husband and in - laws , she and her son had not given any promises to vacate flat A and had not acquired any rights to live in flat B with them . Accordingly , her and her son \u2019s eviction would effectively render them homeless .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal in cassation , ruling that her submissions did not contain any argument creating an appearance that there could be a problem under applicable law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to postpone her eviction , in particular , because she had no other accommodation and her salary was too small for her to rent private - sector housing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the applicant \u2019s request was pending consideration , the ORG bailiffs arrived at flat A and had the applicant vacate it and surrender the keys .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local registration authority annulled the applicant \u2019s and her son \u2019s registration as residents of flat A.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s request for her and her son \u2019s eviction to be postponed ; it postponed their eviction for DATE , referring to her indigent status and the interests of a minor child .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , after her eviction she had to seek emergency refuge in the home of a colleague and subsequently rented odd accommodations at various places . She submitted testimony given by various acquaintances and copies of some fixed - term lease agreements .", "CARDINAL . The Government contested this account , insisting that the lease agreements were fictitious and the applicant had de facto lived in flat B permanently since DATE without proper registration ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
