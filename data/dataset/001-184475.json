The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter was killed in a traffic accident . Several other people were killed or injured as well . The accident was the fault of ORG , a lorry driver .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings were opened against ORG and in DATE he was indicted and brought to court . At the first court hearing the relatives of the other victims brought civil claims against ORG and his employer . The applicant did not bring such a claim .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) convicted PERSON of negligently causing the deaths of several people , including the applicant \u2019s daughter , and injuring others , and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment . It allowed the civil claims , finding ORG and his employer jointly liable to pay damages to the civil parties .", "CARDINAL . Upon appeal , ORG judgment was quashed on DATE by ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) . Finding serious breaches of the procedural rules , it remitted the case to the prosecuting authorities , so that it could be restarted from the stage of the preliminary investigation .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE or DATE the prosecution prepared a new indictment against ORG and he was once again brought to court .", "CARDINAL . The first court hearing was held on DATE . ORG accepted for examination a civil claim against ORG and his employer brought by the applicant , and recognised her as civil party to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG convicted PERSON of causing the deaths of several people and injuring others , and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment . In addition , it awarded damages to the remaining civil claimants \u2013 damages due jointly from ORG and his employer \u2013 but it did not make any decision in respect of the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG \u2019s conviction , reducing his sentence . That part of the judgment became final on DATE when it was upheld by ORG . However , as concerns the civil claims , ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and remitted the case for fresh examination . It reasoned that ORG had committed serious procedural breaches by , among other things , not taking a decision on the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the case for a third time , only in relation to the part concerning the civil claims , and on DATE gave a judgment . It ordered ORG and his employer to pay damages to the civil parties , including MONEY ( ORG \u2013 the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) ) , plus default interest , to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by ORG and his employer , on DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment in so far as it concerned the award made to the applicant , and discontinued the examination of her claim . It found that that claim was inadmissible , on the grounds that it had been submitted outside the time - limit provided for in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It pointed out that the requirement under that provision that a claim should be brought before the commencement of the examination of a case by a court had to be interpreted as referring to the initial examination by a court of first instance . The applicant had brought her claim during the subsequent examination of the case , after its remittal .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by the applicant , that conclusion was upheld by ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant brought a tort action against ORG and his employer before the civil courts . She claimed BGN CARDINAL in respect of non - pecuniary damage , plus default interest as of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG dismissed the claim . It held that the applicant \u2019s inadmissible civil claim brought in the context of the criminal proceedings could not have interrupted the running of the relevant limitation period , which was DATE . Only a claim brought in accordance with the relevant procedural requirements and subsequently found to be well - founded could have had such an effect . In addition , even if the running of the limitation period could be considered to have been interrupted by the applicant \u2019s bringing her claim in the context of the criminal proceedings , that interruption had been retroactively invalidated by ORG decision of DATE finding that the claim was inadmissible and discontinuing the proceedings . Accordingly , the running of the limitation period DATE which had started in DATE because the perpetrator \u2019s identity had been known immediately after the accident in which the applicant \u2019s daughter had died DATE had never been validly interrupted . The applicant \u2019s claim for damages , brought DATE , was time - barred . The applicant had brought her claim before a tribunal , namely the criminal court , which had been barred from examining it ; this meant that this tribunal had had to transfer the claim to the civil courts with jurisdiction , but this had not been done .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal , which was dismissed by a judgment of ORG of DATE . While it considered the applicant \u2019s claim well - founded in principle , since the tort resulting in the liability of ORG and his employer had been proven , that court agreed that the claim was time - barred . It pointed out that the applicant \u2019s bringing her claim in the context of the criminal proceedings could only have interrupted the running of the relevant time - limit if the claim had been allowed . However , after the proceedings had been discontinued , in the absence of recognition of the applicant \u2019s right to receive damages , the time - limit had to be considered to have never been interrupted . The applicant had to bear the adverse consequences of having brought her claim in the context of the criminal proceedings in breach of the rules , and this was so notwithstanding the fact that the claim had been , erroneously , initially accepted for examination by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to accept the appeal for a cassation review ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
