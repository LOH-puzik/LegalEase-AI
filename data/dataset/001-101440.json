The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently serving a prison sentence in FAC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was a defendant in a criminal case , which is not a subject of the instant application . He was at liberty , however , as no pre - trial detention had been imposed on him in connection with that case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was arrested by the police in connection with a new case , in which he was suspected of having committed numerous offences , among others , aiding and abetting in the concealment and trafficking of stolen cars , fraud and many counts of car hijacking .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) ordered preventive measures , namely police supervision and a security deposit of MONEY ( ORG ) and the applicant was released . On DATE those preventive measures were lifted but the applicant remained at liberty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor introduced additional charges against the applicant concerning membership of an organised criminal gang and additional offences of car hijacking and fraud .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who came voluntarily to the prosecutor 's office in connection with the other criminal case , was once more arrested and the new charges were brought against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to remand the applicant in custody . That decision was justified by the authorities by strong evidence against the applicant , the risk that he would obstruct the proceedings and the possibility of a severe penalty being imposed for the offences charged .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the measure was extended by numerous decisions , inter alia , the decisions of ORG of DATE , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . The first - instance court 's decision of DATE was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The domestic courts relied on the original grounds for the applicant 's pretrial detention . In addition , it was noted that the applicant was presumed to have played an important role in the commission of the offences charged , irrespective of the fact that he had not pleaded guilty . The authorities also argued that a likelihood that a severe sentence would be imposed on the applicant given the serious nature of the offences with which he had been charged , created a presumption that he would obstruct the proceedings by going into hiding if released . Lastly , it was reiterated that the applicant was likely to attempt to induce witnesses to give false evidence because CARDINAL of the charges which he was facing at the trial in question was that he had allegedly instructed CARDINAL co - defendants to lie about the circumstances surrounding the burglary into the house of a certain GPE", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the bill of indictment was lodged with ORG .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the investigation file at this stage of the proceedings comprised CARDINAL volumes , the bill of indictment was CARDINAL-page long and that the CARDINAL defendants faced the total number of CARDINAL counts , out of which the applicant himself was charged with CARDINAL offences .", "CARDINAL . The first trial was scheduled for DATE . Before that , however , on DATE the trial court gathered to decide on the extension of the applicant 's pre - trial detention ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant started serving his prison sentence which had been imposed in the other criminal case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the preventive measure was lifted . However , on DATE the prosecutor made a formal request to the trial court that the applicant be remanded in custody as soon as he had completed his prison sentence in connection with his first criminal case , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As a result , on DATE ORG decided to remand the applicant in custody . The court reiterated the grounds indicated in the decision of DATE . The court also relied on the presumption that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings since a heavy penalty could be imposed for the offences charged . Moreover , the risk that the applicant would attempt to induce the witnesses to give false evidence was considered a valid ground for his detention even at that stage of the proceedings . The latter was justified by the applicant 's obstructive behaviour and his attempts to delay the proceedings . The court also pointed to the complexity of the case and the fact that at that stage of the proceedings CARDINAL co - defendants were on trial . Lastly , it was observed that the proceedings were already at an advanced stage and they were likely to be concluded shortly .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant and his lawyer lodged CARDINAL interlocutory appeals against that decision . ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) entertained the appeal lodged by the applicant 's lawyer on DATE and decided not to entertain the appeal lodged by the applicant himself . On an unspecified date the interlocutory appeal lodged by the applicant 's lawyer was dismissed as no grounds had been found to justify the lifting of the applicant 's pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant 's pre - trial detention was extended by the decisions of ORG of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , and DATE . ORG found that the original grounds for the preventive measure in question were still valid . Moreover , mindful of the fact that the applicant 's pre - trial detention had exceeded the statutory limit of DATE , the court noted that the further extension of the measure was nevertheless justified because the proceedings were about to be concluded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his lawyer lodged interlocutory appeals against all the decisions extending the preventive measure . They also lodged numerous applications for release . All those appeals were rejected by the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation into the applicant 's allegations that a judge competent to decide on the lifting of his pre - trial detention had asked him for a bribe . The investigation was discontinued due to the lack of evidence justifying any suspicion that the offence had been committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of several offences and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings before the first - instance court the applicant and his lawyer lodged numerous requests to challenge both the lay and professional judges . All those requests were rejected as no reasons had been found to consider the judges biased . The applicant submitted that his lawyer and he had lodged CARDINAL different procedural motions in the course of the proceedings before the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . Similarly , on DATE the President of ORG informed the applicant that the CARDINAL judges with the same family name who had been assigned to the bench in the first and second - instance court were , in fact , not related .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment in the part concerning the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG appointed a legal - aid lawyer to lodge a cassation appeal on behalf of the applicant . On an unspecified date the lawyer informed the court and the applicant that she had not found any grounds for lodging a cassation appeal in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same court refused to appoint another lawyer as requested by the applicant . The court noted that the previously appointed lawyer had made a thorough analysis of the case file and found no reasons to contest the lawyer 's decision not to lodge a cassation appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained about the length of the proceedings under LAW of DATE on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ( LOC o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki ) ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) . In particular , he submitted that the proceedings had been lengthy because the trial court had not severed his case from the cases of CARDINAL of other co - defendants and because there had been long delays between hearings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint .", "CARDINAL . The court took note of the fact that DATE had lapsed from the date of the lodging of the bill of indictment against the applicant until the date when the applicant had been convicted by the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . The court also observed that the applicant 's case was complex because of the nature of the charges brought against the defendants and the voluminous evidence .", "The case had initially involved CARDINAL co - defendants and at the time of the firstinstance judgment , CARDINAL . A number of the defendants were foreigners . The investigation files comprised CARDINAL volumes and CARDINAL volumes had been produced in the course of the trial . The prosecutor had requested that CARDINAL witnesses be heard and the testimonies of CARDINAL other witnesses be read out at the trial . Moreover , the trial court had to examine over CARDINAL items of evidence and obtain medical reports on the applicant 's mental health . It was stressed that the defendants , especially the applicant , had made extensive use of their procedural rights to challenge the judges , submit motions for new evidence or to ask for adjournment of the hearings . The trial court had to rule on all those issues and , in addition , at separate sessions , on preventive measures . The court 's first sessions , which concerned the preventive measures of the applicant and CARDINAL other defendants , were held shortly after the bill of indictment had been lodged , namely on DATE and DATE . Moreover , in DATE the trial court held CARDINAL hearings , in DATE thirtytwo , in DATE \u2013 fourteen and in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court also addressed the applicant 's complaint that too many defendants had been tried in CARDINAL trial . To that effect the court noted that the cases of CARDINAL defendants had been severed already in DATE , of CARDINAL others , gradually , prior to DATE and of another defendant , at the later stage of the proceedings . The trial court had considered that the remaining CARDINAL co - defendants had to be tried together because the charges against them were intertwined and the testimonies of witnesses summoned concerned several defendants at a time .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the court observed that some delays had occurred because the applicant had been making use of his procedural rights in an abusive manner or because he had been taken ill .", "The applicant had lodged multiple applications to challenge each judge of the bench . His oral submissions at some hearings had lasted TIME . He had applied for the adjournment of many hearings because of a medical indisposition . Several other hearings had to be interrupted because the applicant had asked for an ambulance to be called to the court . Finally , when the trial had come to an end on DATE the applicant had asked for an adjournment in order to prepare his own closing speech . The trial court had complied with the request and had scheduled a new hearing for DATE . On DATE , however , the applicant had left the court room , refusing to participate in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court pointed out that the first - instance judgment , convicting the applicant and all other defendants , comprised CARDINAL pages and CARDINAL pages of a reasoned opinion . That element proved , in the court 's opinion , that the case in question had been very complex and justified further procedural extensions ( for example , to serve the hard copy of the judgment on the parties ) .", "CARDINAL . It was also taken under consideration that , at the time when the court was giving its ruling under LAW , CARDINAL appeals , which had been lodged by the applicant and his lawyer , were pending for DATE before the court of appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above findings , ORG concluded that the time taken by the trial court to complete the applicant 's case was not excessive . On the contrary , the overall length of the proceedings was justified by the complexity of the charges , the voluminous material and the necessity to secure to all co - defendants the effective enjoyment of their procedural rights .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant has corresponded extensively with the ORG authorities , non - governmental organisations and the ORG . He submitted that his letters had been withheld and censored by the authorities .", "Practically each envelope of the applicant 's numerous letters sent during his incarceration had the stamp of the detention facility in which he was being held at the relevant time . The stamp in question also indicated the date of receipt of the letter and a registration number . For example : \u201c FAC ... received on ... No . ... \u201d ( PERSON w PERSON . ... Nr ... ) , ORG ... received on ... No . ... Signature \u201d ( PERSON w PERSON . ... FAC . The blank spaces were filled in by a printed or handwritten date and a handwritten number . In addition , an illegible signature was visible on several of the envelopes . It appears that the envelopes had not been opened before they were forwarded to the addressee .", "CARDINAL . The envelope containing the applicant 's letter sent to ORG on DATE bears a stamp : \u201c Censored agreeing on delivery ORG on ... [ space for date and signature ] President of ORG \u201d ( Ocenzurowano zezwalam na dor\u0119czenie , dn ... PERSON . PERSON ) . The stamp , however , is crossed out and the space for the date and signature are not filled in . It appears that the envelope had not been opened before it was received by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged several complaints with the prosecution and penitentiary authorities alleging that his correspondence had been withheld or monitored .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to open an investigation into the matter because the applicant had failed to substantiate his allegations . On DATE , however , ORG quashed the above decision and ordered an additional inquiry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the police decision of the same date to discontinue the inquiry into the applicant 's allegations that his letters had been withheld or monitored by the administration of ORG and ORG . The inquiry did not confirm that the alleged facts had taken place . On DATE the ORG quashed that decision and ordered a further inquiry . The applicant did not submit any information as to the subsequent developments in the case .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE a penitentiary judge of ORG informed the applicant that his letters had not been sent by ORG via the court because the applicant had the status of a convicted person . Consequently , the applicant 's correspondence could not have been withheld or monitored .", "CARDINAL .
