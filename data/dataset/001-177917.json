The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The second applicant was born in DATE and was detained in GPE up to the time of his death on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants were detained in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant intervened in a fight that had broken out between the first applicant and a prison officer .", "CARDINAL . The manner in which the impugned events occurred , as submitted by the applicants and as it emerges from their witness statements during the domestic proceedings , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an altercation with the prison officer , the first applicant was summoned to a meeting with the correctional unit commander ( comandante di reparto della polizia penitenziaria ) . Before he reached the commander \u2019s office , he was stopped by a group of prison officers , who took turns beating him . Following the meeting , he was stripped of his clothes and led to a cell in the solitary confinement wing .", "CARDINAL . The only item of furniture in the cell was a bed with no mattress , bed linen or covers . As to sanitary facilities , the cell had a squat toilet without running water and was not equipped with a sink . The cell window had no window panes and the only source of heating was a small , malfunctioning radiator , which provided little protection against the DATE weather . For DATE , although it is unclear for how many exactly , he was left naked .", "CARDINAL . During DATE of his detention in solitary confinement no food was provided and he was given only scant amounts of water . He was subsequently given rationed quantities of food .", "CARDINAL . He was beaten on a DATE basis , several times per day . He was repeatedly punched , kicked and hit in the head by prison officers , who assaulted him in groups of varying sizes .", "CARDINAL . He was also subjected to sleep deprivation , as the beatings often took place at TIME and the prison officers verbally abused him in order to keep him awake .", "CARDINAL . During the detention in solitary confinement the applicant did not receive visits from his lawyer or his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the same altercation with the prison officer , the second applicant was stripped of his clothes and led to a cell in the solitary confinement wing of the correctional facility . The bed in the cell had no mattress , sheets or covers , and the cell had no sink . Initially there were no panes in the windows , which were covered with some plastic sheeting after an unspecified number of DATE . For DATE , although it is unclear for how many exactly , he was left naked . He was subsequently given some light clothing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s food was rationed , and at certain times he was given only bread and water . On DATE he received no food at all .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was beaten by prison officers , often more than once per day . He was subjected to various forms of physical violence , including being repeatedly punched , kicked and slapped , at CARDINAL point with his head being pinned to the ground by CARDINAL of the prison ORG boots . The beatings occurred both during DATE and at TIME . The applicant was beaten by CARDINAL officers at a time . CARDINAL prison officer ripped out a chunk of his hair .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was admitted to the hospital .", "CARDINAL . During the period he spent in solitary confinement he was only allowed outside the cell twice , once to shower and once for some outdoor time .", "CARDINAL . A criminal investigation into the impugned treatment was launched in DATE . It was initiated when it emerged , in the context of covert surveillance in an operation to investigate drug smuggling in the PERSON correctional facility , that a number of the prison officers had discussed the ill - treatment inflicted on the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE prison officers , PERSON , PERSON , GPE , GPE , and PERSON , were committed for trial . They were charged with ill - treatment of the applicants under LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , in conjunction with LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , a provision which considers the commission of an offence by a civil servant abusing his or her position to be an aggravating circumstance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants joined the proceedings as civil parties .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment was delivered on DATE . Its findings may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . As to the establishment of the facts concerning the ill - treatment , the court found that the evidence gathered during the investigation and produced at the trial showed that the events had occurred in the manner described by the victims in their submissions during the trial . The ORG relied on statements to the effect that the applicants had been subjected to physical and verbal abuse , coupled with the deprivation of food , water , sleep , and clothing , and had been detained in cells without adequate access to sanitation , heating , and bedding .", "CARDINAL . The court further found it to be established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicants had been subjected not merely to isolated acts of harassment and abuse , but to repeated ill - treatment which had been put into practice in a systematic manner .", "CARDINAL . More specifically , the court found it established beyond reasonable doubt that the first and second applicants had been subjected to repeated physical violence from DATE and from CARDINAL DATE respectively . The court found that the beatings occurred regularly at all times of DATE , and particularly at TIME .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the second applicant had been admitted to the emergency room of ORG on DATE with traumatic injuries . With regard to the first applicant , the court acknowledged his hospitalisation following the events without citing a date or specific medical documentation to this effect .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the court found it to be established beyond reasonable doubt that in DATE and DATE in ORG there had existed what it defined as a \u201c generalised practice of ill - treatment \u201d that had been systematically inflicted on prisoners considered to be problematic . Measures which the court defines as exceeding the bounds of permitted disciplinary or security measures were routinely taken to punish and intimidate problematic detainees and to deter other disorderly behaviour . As part of this practice , a detainee would generally be taken to a cell in the solitary confinement unit where he would be subjected to repeated harassment and abuse by prison officers . The abuse would primarily take the form of physical violence , as detainees would be beaten by groups of prison officers , often during TIME . In addition , detainees would be routinely subjected to sleep , food and water deprivation , and would also be denied access to sanitary facilities .", "CARDINAL . The court further found ample evidence that the prison officers operated in a climate of impunity . This was due , in the court \u2019s view , to the acquiescence of high - level prison administrators and the complicity that existed among prison officers .", "CARDINAL . It emerges that the court ordered an inspection of the correctional facility , including the solitary confinement wing , during the course of the trial . The court found that several cells in the solitary confinement wing of ORG were unfit for holding detainees . Some did not have bed linen , mattresses , sanitary facilities or heating . Although the windows in some cells had no panes and others had windows covered by metal plates with small perforations , the cells were nonetheless used during DATE . Some cells were equipped with a bed and a squat toilet but no other furniture or sanitary facilities .", "CARDINAL . Following the establishment of the facts , the court went on to assess responsibility for the established conduct . In this regard , PERSON was acquitted as to his involvement in the ill - treatment , and DATE and PERSON were acquitted of the charge of ill - treatment under LAW . The court nonetheless held that the conduct of GPE and PERSON amounted to infliction of bodily harm contrary to LAW . However , it ordered that the proceedings against them be discontinued due to the expiry of the applicable time - limit as laid down in the statute of limitations .", "CARDINAL . With respect to PERSON and GPE , the court held that there existed sufficient evidence to conclude that they had been responsible for most , if not all , of the acts of physical , psychological , and \u201c material \u201d abuse at issue . The court then considered that the acts at issue could be classified as torture pursuant to the definition provided by ORG ( ORG ) Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment . It went on to observe that GPE had failed to incorporate the offence of torture into national legislation , in breach of its international obligations . It was therefore obliged to conclude that , under NORP law , there existed no legal provision that would allow it to classify the impugned conduct as acts of torture .", "CARDINAL . Having taken note of the above - mentioned considerations , the court proceeded to assess which existing offence was more suitable in respect of the legal classification of ORG and GPE \u2019s conduct . When conducting its assessment , the court relied on the conclusion that the primary purpose of the impugned treatment was to punish the applicants , to \u201c maintain order \u201d in the correctional facility , and to convey a clear message to the other detainees .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the conduct of the CARDINAL prison officers thus fell most appropriately within the scope of Article CARDINAL of LAW , which deals with abuse of authority against arrested or detained persons . However , the statutory limitation period for the offence in question had elapsed , as the court had found no procedural action which would have the effect of interrupting it .", "The court stated that ORG and GPE were also responsible for the infliction of bodily harm , but that , as the statute of limitations was applicable to that offence as well , such a finding did not alter the substance of the decision . The court therefore ordered that the proceedings against ORG and CARDINAL be discontinued because the applicable time - limit as laid down in the statute of limitations had expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor lodged an appeal with ORG , arguing that ORG had erred in the legal classification of the offence with respect to PERSON and PERSON The prosecutor contended that the most appropriate offence for the purposes of classification of the conduct in question would have been aggravated illtreatment under LAW \u2012 as initially identified in the bill of indictment \u2012 in conjunction with LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment issued on CARDINAL DATE , and filed with ORG on DATE , ORG declared the public prosecutor \u2019s application inadmissible . The court expressed its agreement with the prosecutor \u2019s contention as a matter of principle but , as the statute of limitations had been likewise applicable to the offence of aggravated illtreatment , a decision in favour of the prosecution would have been devoid of any practical effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON lodged an objection to execution ( incidente d\u2019esecuzione ) with ORG , arguing that its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) could not be considered as final and binding insofar as he was concerned , as the decision had not been properly served on him .", "CARDINAL . In a decision issued on DATE ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s objection on the grounds that ORG must have had cognisance of the decision at the moment the public prosecutor lodged an appeal with ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) or , at the latest , when his representative filed a defence brief at a hearing before ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE PERSON appealed against the decision before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE , and filed with ORG , ORG granted the appeal . It found that the failure to serve the decision on ORG could not be remedied by PERSON \u2019s potential knowledge of the decision at a later stage , as argued by ORG . ORG judgment of DATE could not , accordingly , be considered final and binding insofar as PERSON was concerned .", "CARDINAL . Based on the latter decision , on DATE PERSON lodged an appeal against ORG judgment of DATE with ORG , seeking an acquittal .", "CARDINAL . No further information has been provided by the parties as to the outcome of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In their observations of CARDINAL DATE , the Government indicated that CARDINAL prison officers had undergone disciplinary proceedings in connection with the impugned events and by different decisions issued on DATE the following disciplinary sanctions had been imposed :", "\u2013 C.B. was dismissed from his functions ( destituito dal servizio ) . He was , however , reinstated on DATE , following ORG judgment of DATE which suspended the binding nature of ORG judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ;", "\u2013 PERSON was dismissed from his functions ;", "\u2013 DATE was suspended from duty for a period of DATE ;", "\u2013 PERSON was suspended from duty for a period of DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to a document issued by ORG on DATE , and furnished by the Government , the CARDINAL prison officers were not suspended from duty ( sospensione precauzionale dal servizio ) during the course of the investigation or the trial .", "CARDINAL . At the ORG \u2019s request , the ORG submitted extracts from the prison medical record of the second applicant DATE and DATE and typed copies of his hospitalisation record of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The prison medical record indicates that on DATE the second applicant was examined visually ( whilst still \u201c behind bars \u201d ) . He complained of pain in the thoracic area and right ear . The reporting physician noted the presence of ecchymoses and haematomas around the patient \u2019s ribcage . He recommended a more thorough medical examination and/or transfer to the infirmary .", "CARDINAL . The record further indicates that another visual examination ( also \u201c behind bars \u201d ) took place on DATE . The information in this entry is the same as in the previous entry . Transfer to the infirmary for a medical examination was recommended .", "DATE . On DATE the record shows that the applicant underwent a medical examination in the afternoon . The physician reported ecchymoses on the patient \u2019s ribcage and in the retroauricular region . Palpation of the patient revealed diffuse pain . The reporting physician recommended that Xrays be performed for a suspected fracture . Painkillers were administered .", "CARDINAL . The entry of DATE reports the applicant \u2019s transfer to the emergency room of ORG as a consequence of traumatic injury .", "CARDINAL . According to the medical record of ORG , an X - ray revealed a fractured rib and the medical examination disclosed diffuse bruising in the thoracic and abdominal area and pain on palpation . The record states that the applicant told the doctor his injuries occurred as a consequence of an accidental fall .", "CARDINAL . The prison medical record entry on the applicant \u2019s discharge from the hospital on DATE shows that he was prescribed painkillers .", "CARDINAL .
