SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of P7-4", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . PERSON , a NORP citizen , was born in DATE and currently lives in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while she was driving on a road covered with ice and snow in GPE , her car veered onto the other side of the road hitting CARDINAL car and then colliding with a second driven by PERSON , who sustained serious injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE police magistrate \u2019s office ( GPE ) sent the file to the district attorney \u2019s office ( PERSON ) for further investigation as to whether the applicant had negligently inflicted serious physical injury contrary to LAW ( see paragraph QUANTITY below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE ) sent the file to the district attorney \u2019s office for further investigations as to whether any offences had been committed under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district attorney \u2019s office returned the case file concerning the party injured in the accident to the police magistrate \u2019s office . It contained a medical certificate stating that the injuries were serious . On CARDINAL DATE the police magistrate found that there was no case for the injured party to answer ( ORG ) . On CARDINAL DATE he convicted the applicant of an offence under sections DATE and CARDINAL of ORG of failing to control her vehicle , as she had not adapted her speed to the road conditions ( PERSON infolge PERSON der PERSON an die ORG ) and sentenced her to a fine of MONEY ( CHF ) . He found in particular that on DATE the road had been covered with ice and snow and that the applicant 's car had veered onto the other side of the road hitting CARDINAL car before colliding with a second .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district attorney \u2019s office issued a penal order ( Strafbefehl ) fining PERSON CHF CARDINAL,CARDINAL for negligently causing physical injury contrary to LAW in respect of the injuries sustained by PERSON as a result of the collision between his vehicle and the applicant \u2019s .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant challenged that order in ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) , which on DATE reduced the fine to CHF CARDINAL . It held in particular :", "\u201c The police magistrate who imposed the fine ( NORP ) referred to by the applicant had to examine the situation within the context of proceedings concerning a minor criminal offence ( PERSON ) , so that by virtue of the non bis in idem principle there is no doubt that no further prosecution for a minor criminal offence can be brought on the basis of the same incident . However , the fact that investigations in this type of proceedings are summary and limited in scope means that offenders on whom only a fine has been imposed may , if a more thorough investigation is needed in view of legal or factual considerations , also be prosecuted on the same facts for a serious crime or other major offence . In such cases , the original decision and sentence are quashed . \u201d", "The court went on to quash the LAW fine imposed on CARDINAL DATE and said that any part of that fine that had already been paid was to be deducted from the fine it was imposing , the latter fine thus being reduced to CHF CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Obergericht ) , which on DATE dismissed the appeal holding , inter alia :", "\u201c It is necessary to consider what conclusions are to be drawn from the police magistrate \u2019s error regarding the question in issue . It is clear that in his decision of CARDINAL DATE he made a finding only in respect of the applicant \u2019s failure to control the vehicle , but not in respect of the resulting physical injuries suffered by the victim \u2026 However , in determining whether LAW had been followed , the police magistrate had the power and duty to consider all the facts before him and to rule on them exhaustively under the criminal law ; his failure to remit the case file , even though possibly serious physical injuries had been caused by negligence , does not necessarily mean that the decision of the police magistrate is invalid \u2013 that decision stands . It has not been submitted , and does not appear from the file , that the decision in issue contains serious defects requiring that it be quashed in its entirety in any event . \u201d", "ORG subsequently upheld the decision to deduct CHF CARDINAL from the CHF CARDINAL fine , considering that the applicant ought not to be punished more severely than she would have been if both offences had been dealt with together in a single set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed against that decision on grounds of nullity ( GPE ) to ORG ( Kassationsgericht ) of the GPE of GPE and to ORG . On DATE ORG declined to consider her appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then filed a public - law appeal with ORG against that decision .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed both the applicant 's public - law appeal and her appeal on grounds of nullity . In its latter decision ORG held that it had to be assumed that when on CARDINAL DATE the police magistrate had imposed a fine on PERSON , he had been unaware that PERSON had sustained serious injuries , as otherwise he would have had no jurisdiction to impose a fine and would have had to return the file to the district attorney \u2019s office . ORG concluded that ORG had nevertheless avoided the effects of punishing an offender twice for the same offence by taking into account the CHF CARDINAL fine imposed by the police magistrate when \u201c determining the amount of the new fine \u201d ( bei der Bemessung der neuen Busse ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW Criminal Code provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Anyone who negligently causes damage to the physical integrity or health of another shall , on a complaint , be liable to imprisonment or a fine .", "CARDINAL .
