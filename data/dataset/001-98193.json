GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE . The applicants , who are NORP nationals and brothers , both live in NORP . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG issued an arrest warrant against the applicants . It found that the applicants were suspected of having infiltrated NORP nationals into GPE or other ORG in exchange for money on several occasions . They were likely to abscond if not taken into detention , in particular as they risked being sentenced to a considerable term of imprisonment .", "On DATE the applicants were arrested and taken into pre - trial detention .", "On DATE ORG admitted the indictment dated DATE and ordered the ORG continued detention . The applicants were notably charged with having infiltrated NORP nationals into GPE and GPE on CARDINAL occasions , acting as members of a gang on CARDINAL of these occasions .", "On DATE ORG opened the trial against the applicants , who were represented by CARDINAL officially appointed defence counsel each . It subsequently held hearings on average once per week .", "On DATE ORG issued a new detention order against the first applicant , taking into account that a number of charges against him had been dropped in the course of the main hearing . It confirmed that order on DATE on the first applicant \u2019s appeal . The first applicant was now charged , in particular , with having infiltrated or having attempted to infiltrate foreigners into GPE or other countries of LOC on a commercial basis on QUANTITY occasions , while acting as a member of a gang on CARDINAL of these occasions . ORG found that the first applicant was strongly suspected of having committed these offences on account of the contents of telephone conversations intercepted on judicial order and on account of the testimonies of CARDINAL witnesses heard until then in court . He was still likely to abscond if released , despite the fact that he was married to a NORP national , had CARDINAL young children and had already been in detention pending trial for DATE . He risked being imposed a severe prison sentence if convicted and was suspected of belonging to an organisation which was in a position to smuggle persons abroad . Therefore , milder measures , such as his release on bail , were not suitable to avert the danger of his absconding and his continued detention was still proportionate .", "On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG in its decisions , dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded .", "On DATE ORG , following the first applicant \u2019s remonstrance , refused to amend its decision of DATE . It considered , in particular , that the first applicant \u2019s continued detention was not disproportionate in the light of the case - law of ORG and ORG on the subject - matter . The sentence he risked being imposed if convicted largely exceeded the length of his detention pending trial until then . ORG conceded that the proceedings had already lasted for a considerable time . Disagreeing with the first applicant , it found , however , that the prosecution authorities and ORG had not delayed the proceedings . The proceedings were very complex , notably because the offences had to be proved by examining the results of numerous intercepted telephone conversations made in a foreign language . The defendants being NORP nationals , the participation of interpreters in the proceedings was necessary . Moreover , the defendants\u2019 lawyers had lodged numerous motions in the CARDINAL hearings of the case held until then , which had prolonged the proceedings . It had been sufficient for ORG to hold one hearing per week , which as a rule lasted DATE . The defendants\u2019 lawyers had rejected ORG proposal made in DATE both to prolong the duration of the DATE hearing and to hear the case on DATE , arguing that they were unavailable .", "On DATE the first applicant lodged a complaint with ORG against the decision taken by ORG on DATE and applied for an interim injunction quashing that decision and releasing him from prison . He subsequently extended his constitutional complaint to comprise also the decision of ORG dated DATE . He claimed that his continued detention pending trial was disproportionate and in breach of LAW , construed in the light of LAW . He argued that the proceedings had been unreasonably delayed by ORG and that the criminal courts wrongly upheld the detention order on the unfounded assumption that he would abscond if released .", "On DATE ORG , without giving reasons for its decision , declined to consider the first applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint and declared that his application for interim measures had thereby become devoid of purpose ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG issued a new detention order also against the second applicant , which it upheld on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE following the second applicant \u2019s request for judicial review and appeal respectively . The second applicant was now charged notably with having infiltrated or having attempted to infiltrate NORP nationals into GPE or other countries of LOC on a commercial basis on QUANTITY occasions , acting as a member of a gang on CARDINAL of these occasions . As to the evidence in support of the strong suspicion that the second applicant committed these offences and as to the reasons why he risked absconding if released , despite the fact that he had a close relationship with his son living in GPE , ORG reasoned its order in similar terms as that against the first applicant issued DATE ( see above ) .", "On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given in the decisions of ORG dated CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , dismissed the second applicant \u2019s appeal in which the latter had complained about the excessive length of his detention pending trial and about the delays caused in the proceedings by the fact that hearings were held only once per week .", "On DATE ORG , on the second applicant \u2019s remonstrance , refused to amend its decision dated PERSON DATE . It took the view that its decision was not contrary to the case - law of ORG on the reasonable length of detention pending trial referred to by the second applicant .", "On DATE ORG dismissed as inadmissible the second applicant \u2019s request to give him an opportunity for explanation following its decision and also rejected his further remonstrance .", "On DATE the second applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against the decisions of ORG of DATE and DATE and applied for an interim injunction ordering his release from prison . He argued that his continued detention pending trial was unconstitutional in view of the protracted length of the proceedings against him .", "On DATE ORG , without giving reasons for its decision , declined to consider the second applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint and declared that his application for interim measures had thereby become devoid of purpose ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "DATE and DATE included , ORG held CARDINAL hearings ( that is , on average one hearing per week ) , in the course of which CARDINAL witnesses and experts were heard .", "In the hearing on DATE ORG stated that the judges , the applicants\u2019 defence counsel and ORG had discussed an agreement with a view to terminating the proceedings ( ORG ) . In a decision laid down in TIME of the hearing , the court declared that it would sentence the first applicant to a maximum of DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and the second applicant to a maximum of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment if the applicants made a comprehensive and credible confession concerning certain specified offences they had been charged with . Moreover , the court promised to suspend the sentences imposed and grant probation already when the applicants had served CARDINAL of their sentence under LAW of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) if the information it had obtained to date was correct ( in particular that the applicants did not have any previous convictions ) and if the formal requirements were met . The applicants then confessed to the offences specified in ORG decision .", "On DATE ORG pronounced its judgment . It convicted the first applicant of CARDINAL counts of infiltration or attempted infiltration of foreigners on a commercial basis , acting as a member of a gang on QUANTITY occasions , and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It found the second applicant guilty of CARDINAL counts of infiltration or attempted infiltration of foreigners on a commercial basis , acting as a member of a gang on CARDINAL occasions , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "The court found that the applicants , partly acting together with another brother of theirs living in GPE , had illegally infiltrated NORP nationals into GPE or other ORG , notably GPE , in exchange for money . It based its findings on the ORG confessions , which were confirmed by the transcripts of intercepted telephone conversations and the testimonies of CARDINAL witnesses . It took into consideration , as a mitigating factor , inter alia , that the applicants had been in detention pending trial for DATE and DATE , and had been uncertain about the outcome of the proceedings for DATE of time due to the long duration of the proceedings .", "By a decision taken immediately after the pronouncement of the judgment in the hearing , ORG quashed the detention orders of DATE against both applicants . It then instructed the applicants that they had the right to lodge an appeal on points of law against the judgment and that the agreement with a view to terminating the proceedings reached in the hearing did not bar them from lodging that appeal ( so - called qualified instruction \u2013 qualifizierte GPE ) .", "Following an interruption of the hearing , during which the applicants consulted their defence counsel , the applicants waived their right to lodge an appeal with the consent of their defence counsel . The prosecution then also waived its right to appeal . The judgment thereby having become final , ORG suspended the remainder of the prison sentences imposed on the applicants and granted probation pursuant to LAW , having regard , inter alia , to the very long duration of the ORG detention pending trial .", "The applicants subsequently lodged an appeal on points of law . They argued that the waiver of their right to appeal was invalid because it was based on an agreement with the court and because only that agreement had made possible their immediate release from prison .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal on points of law as inadmissible . It found that the applicants had validly waived their right to lodge an appeal . Prior to the pronouncement of ORG judgment there had been an agreement between that court , the prosecution and the defence aimed at terminating the proceedings . However , the agreement did not comprise a commitment that the defendants waive their right to file an appeal on points of law . According to the TIME , the defendants had been expressly informed by ORG after the pronouncement of the judgment that the agreement reached did not prevent them from lodging an appeal on points of law against the judgment and had thus received the necessary qualified instruction . After a suspension of the hearing , which gave them sufficient time for consideration , they had declared to waive their right to appeal with the consent of their counsel . This waiver was irrevocable . Having regard to the criteria established in its case - law ( it referred to the decision of its ORG of DATE , no . GSSt CARDINAL , ORG ( ORG ) DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) , there were no exceptional grounds rendering the waiver void .", "Under LAW of LAW , the courts may suspend the execution of the remainder of a prison sentence and grant probation already when CARDINAL of the sentence has been served , in particular , if the convicted person is serving his first term of imprisonment and the latter does not exceed DATE or if a comprehensive evaluation of the offence , the personality of the convicted person and his development during the execution of the sentence show that special circumstances exist .", "In its leading decision of DATE , ORG of ORG laid down the principles governing the validity of a waiver of the right to appeal in the context of agreements with a view to terminating criminal proceedings ( no . GSSt CARDINAL , ORG ( ORG ) DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . It considered such agreements , in which the criminal courts made a binding declaration on a maximum penalty to be imposed in exchange for the defendant \u2019s confessing to ( part of ) the offences he was charged with , to be compatible with LAW and LAW if certain conditions were met .", "In particular , all participants in the proceedings ( that is , professional and lay judges , the prosecution , the defence counsel and the defendant ) had to be involved in reaching the agreement , the result of which had to be made public in the hearing and had to be included in the TIME . The veracity of the confession made by the defendant in accordance with the agreement had to be verified . The agreement was not allowed to concern the legal qualification of the acts the defendant had been charged with . The penalty proposed by the court still had to reflect the defendant \u2019s guilt and the penalty which , according to the court , was to be expected without a confession could not be disproportionately severe so as to submit the defendant to undue pressure to confess . The court was only allowed to promise a maximum penalty ( as opposed to a specified penalty ) and could exceed that penalty only if relevant factual or legal aspects had been overlooked and if it had previously averted the defendant in the hearing of its intention to fix a higher penalty . ORG noted that in view of their heavy workload , the courts would be unable to render criminal justice and to avoid delays in the proceedings without being allowed to have recourse to such agreements .", "ORG further observed that in the past , such agreements had in practice often involved the defendant \u2019s promise to waive his right to appeal against the judgment or at least the court \u2019s suggestion to do so . However , the criminal courts were not authorised , in the context of these agreements , to arrange upon a waiver of the right to appeal . An agreement aimed at terminating the proceedings was not to prevent an effective control , by the appeals courts , of the lower courts\u2019 judgments . After the delivery of a judgment which was given following an agreement DATE irrespective of whether a waiver of the right to appeal had been included or discussed \u2013 the court therefore had to instruct the defendant not only about his right to appeal , but in addition on the fact that he was free to lodge an appeal irrespective of the agreement reached ( so - called qualified instruction ) . If such a qualified instruction had not been given , the defendant \u2019s waiver of his right to appeal was void ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
