The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , and CARDINAL of their children were born in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . Their eldest daughter , who was also an applicant , was born in DATE and subsequently died on DATE after the application had been lodged .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are of GPE origin and were born in GPE , where they spent the greater part of their lives . They explained that they decided to leave their country for GPE because of the discrimination and illtreatment they had suffered on account of their origin in every sphere : access to the employment market , medical care , schooling difficulties and so forth .", "CARDINAL . The eldest daughter of the first CARDINAL applicants had been physically and mentally disabled since birth and had suffered from epilepsy .", "CARDINAL . After failing to obtain a more secure situation for themselves in GPE , in DATE the applicants travelled to GPE , where they lodged an application for asylum . Their application was rejected by a final decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants stated that in the meantime they had returned to GPE , and then to GPE , in DATE owing to the precariousness of their situation in GPE and their inability to provide for their essential needs .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , as their situation had not changed , the applicants decided to go to GPE , where they lodged an asylum application on DATE .", "CARDINAL . During their interview with the \u201c GPE \u201d department of ORG on DATE the applicants gave an account of their movements to date and expressed their fears in the event of a return to GPE . The first applicant stated that he had chosen to seek asylum in GPE because he had been told that he could obtain better treatment for his disabled daughter there . He said that he was suffering from psychological problems . The second applicant said that GPE had been the choice of the smuggler . When asked about her health , she replied that she was CARDINAL months\u2019 pregnant . She also mentioned their eldest daughter \u2019s health problems .", "CARDINAL . The applicants maintained that they had explained the reasons why they refused to return to GPE , where they had been living in extremely precarious conditions . They submitted that they had not been asked to provide any evidence of having left the territory of GPE ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) or regarding the family NORP state of health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities sent GPE requests to take the applicants back on the grounds that the latter had been unable to prove that they had left the territory of ORG since their stay in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , relying on LAW ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member ORG responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of GPE by a thirdcountry national ( \u201c the Dublin II Regulation \u201d ) , GPE refused to take charge of the applicants on the grounds that the couple were considered to have disappeared since DATE because they had not collected the notice of final refusal of their asylum application dated DATE and this corroborated their statements to ORG according to which they had left LOC in DATE and re - entered it in DATE , thus leaving for a period of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the NORP authorities asked the NORP authorities to reconsider their position given that there was no conclusive evidence that the family had left the territory of the Member GPE for DATE since their stay in GPE and the applicants were clearly aware of the rejection of their asylum application in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE accepted the request to take the family back pursuant to LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of the Dublin II Regulation .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG issued decisions refusing the applicants leave to remain and ordering them to leave the country for GPE on the grounds that under LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of the Dublin II Regulation Belgium was not responsible for examining the asylum application and that GPE had agreed to take charge of the family . The decisions indicated among other things that the family , who were originally from GPE , \u201c had not furnished evidence of their stay \u201d in GPE after staying in GPE nor any certificates regarding any medical treatment or care in respect of the pregnancy , or concerning the child or the father . Considering that GPE was a country which respected human rights , had democratic institutions , had ratified the LAW and LAW on the Status of Refugees , and was bound to implement the directives of ORG on asylum and that if a return were to raise a problem under LAW , the family could always lodge an application with the ORG for interim measures , ORG considered that the NORP authorities did not have to use the sovereignty clause provided for in Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Dublin II Regulation .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the applicants were ordered to leave the country within DATE and to report to the NORP authorities at the border crossing . On DATE the applicants were issued with laissez - passer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , through their legal representative , contacted ORG for the purposes of providing it with evidence that they had left the territory of ORG for DATE ( gynaecologist \u2019s certificates , the second applicant \u2019s health card and proof of enrolment at school of CARDINAL of their children ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE execution of the orders to leave the country were extended until DATE on account of the fact that the second applicant was soon due to give birth .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an application with ORG for the decisions refusing them residence permits and ordering them to leave the country to be set aside and for a stay of execution . They argued that the decisions , with the reasons given therein , had not provided them with the examination required by LAW taken together with LAW ( ORG v. GPE and GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) of their fears regarding a return to GPE and of their health problems . Firstly , the reasoning was erroneous and incomplete ( error as to their nationality , identifying them as PERSON instead of NORP , failure to mention their return to GPE and their GPE origin ) . Secondly , they could not be blamed for having failed to provide , during their GPE interview , documents certifying their health problems and their movements to date or for not having substantiated their fears regarding a transfer to GPE . Like all GPE asylum - seekers at that time , when they had attended those interviews they had not been assisted by a lawyer or informed of the documents that they should bring and no document had been requested of them . As they had expressed their fears , the NORP authorities should have asked the appropriate questions and requested the relevant documents in order to ensure that their return did not infringe their fundamental rights . The applicants also argued that GPE should not have been determined as the ORG responsible for examining their asylum applications . Under LAW , the obligations regarding the determination of the ORG responsible ceased where the third - country national had left the territory of the Member GPE for DATE . That was precisely the position the applicants had been in on account of their return to GPE from DATE as certified by the documents subsequently sent to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Lastly , they submitted that the NORP authorities should have used the sovereignty clause or the humanitarian clause both on account of their special vulnerability and of the notoriously difficult situation of the GPE minority in GPE and of the conditions for the reception of asylum - seekers in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The hearing before ORG took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants unsuccessfully sought a further extension of the order to leave the country pending the outcome of the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an application with the ORG for interim measures suspending their transfer to GPE pending the outcome of the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused to indicate an interim measure .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ruled on the application to have the decisions refusing residence permits and ordering the applicants to leave the country set aside and for a stay of execution .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the ground of appeal regarding the conditions of reception in GPE and based on the risk alleged by the applicants of being exposed to treatment contrary to LAW . It found as follows :", "\u201c ... the ORG can not but observe that the applicants have failed to show that they encountered difficulties in their dealings with the NORP authorities regarding access to health care for their child or their conditions of reception as asylum - seekers . They have not adduced so much as a shred of evidence regarding the circumstances of the ill - treatment they have allegedly suffered and have merely asserted in their application , without substantiating this with the slightest evidence that could corroborate the facts , \u201c that they found themselves in an extremely precarious situation at the time of lodging their application for asylum and that their only refuge was a night hostel that they had to leave the next morning \u201d . Moreover , although their daughter \u2019s disability had been specified in the \u201c GPE form \u201d , the parties have not made any allegation whatsoever before ORG of encountering particular difficulties in the reception of asylum - seekers as organised by the relevant NORP authorities . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also criticised the applicants for failing to produce in full the NGO reports that they had cited in support of their application , which had prevented it from checking whether the extracts produced did actually concern GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG set the decisions aside , however , on the ground that ORG had not established the legal basis on which it considered that GPE was the ORG responsible for examining the applicants\u2019 asylum application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged an appeal on points of law with the PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tat against ORG judgment . It disputed ORG analysis of the applicable legal basis .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat declared the appeal admissible . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE it rejected it for lack of current interest on the grounds that the operative provisions of ORG judgment were no longer a source of complaint for the applicants because they had returned to GPE and had left the territory of the Member GPE for DATE with the result that GPE was relieved of any obligation in the process of determining which Member ORG was responsible for their asylum application .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicants had lodged an application for leave to remain on medical grounds under section CARDINALter of PERSON Settlement and LAW of DATE ( \u201c the Aliens Act \u201d ) on behalf of their eldest daughter . They referred to the extreme precariousness of their position and the discrimination they had suffered as ORG and GPE . Citing several international reports in support of their submissions , they argued that for that reason they had no guarantee that they would be able to obtain the necessary treatment for their daughter \u2019s health condition . They sought temporary leave to remain pending the outcome of the asylum proceedings they had instituted in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared their application inadmissible on the grounds that the medical certificate of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , produced in support of their application to have their residence status regularised , certified the existence of a medical problem and stipulated the treatment considered necessary but , contrary to the requirements of section CARDINALter \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL of LAW , did not specify the degree of seriousness of the condition .", "CARDINAL . The applicants indicated in their observations in reply that they had learnt of the existence of that decision during the proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Federal agency for the reception of asylum - seekers ( \u201c QUANTITY \u201d ) assigned the applicants a reception facility as their mandatory place of registration , namely , GPE asylum - seekers\u2019 reception centre .", "CARDINAL . NORP The social worker from the centre took down the following account by the applicants of the conditions of their reception in GPE :", "\u201c The family decided to leave GPE because they had no means of subsistence . They were living in a night shelter which they had to leave in DATE . They and the children were out on the streets from TIME They had to use a pushchair as a wheelchair for PERSON , who is disabled . They had no information of any kind apart from the status of asylum - seeker which had been given to them on their arrival . No doctor , no social worker , no lawyer , no interpreter . They had absolutely no means of communication . They had no idea what they should do or what to expect . PERSON was not receiving any medical treatment of any kind . When her health deteriorated and she had to be taken to hospital , it was the mother \u2019s sister who drove her to the emergency ward at the hospital and acted as interpreter . Once at the hospital the little girl had [ epileptic ] fits and her hair fell out . That was what decided the family to return to GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The eldest daughter was examined on DATE by a neuropsychiatrist at ORG and a medical certificate was drawn up on DATE certifying the child \u2019s disabilities .", "CARDINAL . In that certificate , which was sent to ORG on DATE , the doctor noted that the child had \u201c cerebral palsy with epilepsy \u201d , suffered from \u201c severe axial and peripheral hypotonia \u201d , that she could not sit up unassisted and soiled her underwear , that she could not talk and appeared not to understand others . He also noted that the child was taking medicines and that she required physiotherapy and appropriate equipment ( orthopaedic braces , seat - brace ) . Those medical findings were confirmed by a neurological examination carried out on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The eldest daughter was admitted to hospital on CARDINAL and DATE for her epileptic fits and a neurological report drawn up .", "CARDINAL . After the second applicant gave birth on DATE the family were assigned a new reception centre on CARDINAL DATE in an open centre suitable for families , in PERSON in the province of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the order extending execution of the order to leave the country expired , and as they could no longer benefit from material assistance for refugees , the applicants were removed from the Saint - Trond reception centre .", "CARDINAL . The applicants travelled to GPE , where voluntary associations indicated a public square in the municipality of GPE , in the centre of the GPE - Capital administrative district , where other homeless GPE families were also staying . They stayed there from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , through their legal representative , the applicants asked the LANGUAGE - speaking community \u2019s ORG to the Rights of the Child to intervene urgently with the national authorities responsible for the reception of asylum - seekers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a letter to ORG of GPE requesting that accommodation be found urgently .", "CARDINAL . A signed statement by ORG dated DATE indicated that he also contacted the municipality of NORP in an attempt to find urgent accommodation for the family . According to ORG , the municipal authorities stated that they did not have power to make a decision and that it was for the federal authorities to decide , and GPE declared that it did not have power on account of the decision taken by ORG regarding GPE \u2019s responsibility for processing the asylum request ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . PERSON also stated that the application to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was not of suspensive effect , which was why the reception centre had applied the rules terminating the right to material assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the intervention of ORG , the Secretary of ORG \u2019s office for ORG and the Fight against Poverty instructed GPE to designate a reception centre as a matter of urgency .", "CARDINAL . After spending DATE at the transit centre of the WoluweSaintPierre municipality , also in the GPE - Capital administrative district , on DATE the applicants were assigned a new reception centre as a mandatory place of registration : the PERSON reception centre for asylum - seekers in the province of GPE QUANTITY from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Government maintained that the applicants had failed to register at the centre . The applicants , for their part , stated that they had gone there by train and a special bus but had been sent back to GPE to GPE \u2019s ORG on the grounds that their \u201c annex CARDINAL [ order to leave the country ] was invalid . \u201d", "CARDINAL . When they got back to GPE on DATE the applicants got off the train at FAC , where they remained without any means of subsistence and with no accommodation despite the very cold weather for DATE until their return to GPE was organised via a charitable organisation as part of the GPE return programme . The applicants left GPE for GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE , the applicants\u2019 mandatory place of residence had been changed to code CARDINAL \u201c no - show \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and on DATE the ORG names were deleted from the waiting register .", "CARDINAL . After their return to GPE their eldest daughter \u2019s health deteriorated , forcing the applicants to leave the room they had rented on account of the insalubrious conditions . They went to stay with a relative in ORG and then to the suburbs in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 eldest daughter was admitted to hospital on DATE suffering from a lung infection . She died on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to their lawyer of CARDINAL DATE the applicants stated that they had been attacked by NORP on a number of occasions : among other incidents , some men had driven by in a car and broken the windows of their home by throwing stones , and had uttered threats , complaining of their links with the \u201c NORP \u201d and ordering them to leave GPE .
