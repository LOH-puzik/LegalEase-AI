{"ITEMID": "001-69274", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "M.A. v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr M.A. , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Miss J.A. Roberts , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant married PERSON", "On DATE their daughter NORP was born .", "On DATE the applicant and his wife separated .", "On DATE filed for divorce and a residence order in respect of NORP There were problems with contact from the beginning . The mother made allegations that she feared that the applicant would abscond with NORP to GPE and that he was violent towards her .", "On DATE a ORG judge ordered interim residence with PERSON and issued an interim contact order .", "On DATE a ORG judge by consent ordered that the applicant be given contact at a supervised centre each DATE .", "On DATE a ORG judge by consent ordered the mother to allow the applicant to have contact with his child each DATE . A penal notice was attached .", "A report of the child welfare officer dated DATE noted the mother 's implacable opposition to contact taking place .", "On DATE a judge again ordered that the mother allow the applicant to have contact with his child and attached a penal order . The applicant applied for her to be committed for contempt for failure to comply .", "On DATE a judge ordered that she be committed to prison for DATE , the order to be suspended until final hearing .", "On DATE , the date fixed for final hearing , the judge adjourned the applications pending a report from a psychologist concerning the mother 's allegations that the father represented a risk to her and the child . It does not appear that the psychologist received instructions until DATE .", "On DATE the judge consolidated the mother 's application for a non - molestation order . The applicant withdrew another application for committal of the mother due to lack of contact .", "In a report dated DATE , a consultant psychologist , after conducting interviews and assessments , noted that the mother 's accounts of long - standing violence by the applicant were highly inconsistent , with no reference in her medical records to any alleged abuse / violence , that she scored highly on tests indicating stress and difficulty in establishing a parent - child bond , and that she presented many characteristics commensurate with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder , with possible co - morbidity of histrionic personality disorder . She noted that , during a supervised contact session on DATE , the applicant had been responsive , sensitive and creative in his play with NORP , that he had a warm , caring relationship with her and that NORP only grew anxious when she became aware that her mother was in the building . Tests showed that the applicant presented as a balanced , well - integrated man , without any particular problem in relation to anger management . She concluded that the applicant did not represent any threat to the child and that any fear of abduction was ill - founded , that the mother 's fears in this respect were not realistic , and that there was no reason for the applicant 's contact with NORP to be supervised . She recommended that contact be increased to contexts outside a contact centre and that such regular contact with her father be actively promoted and facilitated . It was not , however , in NORP 's interests for residence to be changed in favour of the applicant .", "On DATE ORG judge found the mother in flagrant breach of contact orders and committed her to prison for DATE and ordered a section CARDINAL report to be prepared by the local authority . After being sent to prison for DATE , the mother began to comply with contact orders .", "On DATE ORG judge found as a fact that the applicant , settled in GPE , had no intention of moving NORP unlawfully to GPE . He noted that the mother had constantly disobeyed contact orders from the court , while the section CARDINAL report showed that NORP enjoyed and benefited from contact . While he accepted that the mother was genuinely anxious about NORP , he ordered that contact be increased to DATE TIME stays . He made a final residence order in favour of the mother .", "The mother failed to make NORP available for the first CARDINAL planned sessions , alleging continued concern that the applicant had not handed in his passport . Following another application for committal by the applicant , the mother complied , allowing TIME contact visits at the applicant 's home which took place in DATE . NORP then refused to attend further visits . The independent social worker reported that the mother was saying little to reassure NORP or to encourage her to go , failing , in particular , to counter NORP 's guilt about leaving her alone . An agreement was reached in court that the mother would make NORP available for contact outside GPE police station . An incident appears to have taken place on or around DATE outside the police station , where NORP witnessed her parents ' hostility to each other and her mother crying . Contact visits were again discontinued , apparently as NORP was objecting . The applicant issued a further notice of application for committal proceedings against the mother . On unspecified dates he also made further applications for contact and renewed applications for residence .", "On DATE the judge ordered the case to be transferred to ORG .", "On DATE a ORG judge made directions for the proceedings , ordering indirect contact with the child by DATE cards and letters .", "On DATE the consultant psychologist recommended that the mother receive therapy to cope with her anxiety and parenting attitudes and that a ORG ( Children and ORG ) officer be appointed to mediate and work constructively with the parties on NORP 's behalf .", "On DATE , a ORG judge drew up a schedule of contact and directed that a consultant family therapist be instructed to undertake systemic family therapy with the parties , with emphasis on contact issues . It was later reported that the therapist concerned stated that he was unable to undertake the work required and that there were difficulties in finding any other service that could .", "CARDINAL attempts were made in DATE to facilitate contact between the applicant and NORP , but NORP refused to accompany the independent social worker . No contact visits took place .", "On DATE the ORG appointed a guardian for the child .", "On DATE the independent social worker reported that NORP was settled with her mother and had not suffered any emotional or psychological damage and that residence should not be changed . She noted that NORP was refusing to see the applicant now and considered that attempts at enforcing direct contact would place her in danger of significant emotional harm , since she now viewed the applicant negatively and with fear . Any contact would have to be indirect for the near future .", "On DATE a ORG judge ordered indirect contact and a psychiatric report on the mother . A programme of indirect contact facilitated by the independent social worker commenced on DATE . This involved a session of TIME a fortnight in which the social worker met with NORP and the mother and a letter from the applicant was delivered . CARDINAL out of CARDINAL planned sessions occurred due to the mother 's unavailability . The independent social worker withdrew as she believed the mother was not committed .", "On DATE the psychiatrist reported that the mother was not suffering from any personality disorder or current depression , and that her current stress and anxiety symptoms would benefit from a course of anxiety / stress management , but that these did not pose a problem to her meeting NORP 's needs .", "In a report dated DATE , the consultant psychologist reported that NORP now showed signs of having suffered emotional harm . She had now become aware that she was the centre of her parents ' battle , was increasingly distressed by attempts to encourage contact and was demonstrating anxiety . She also noted that the applicant 's position had become as entrenched as the mother 's and he had shown limited insight into NORP 's feelings . The applicant 's relationship with NORP had been seriously jeopardised by the incident in DATE and NORP 's image of him was negative ( angry , aggressive and potentially threatening and anxiety - provoking ) . Consequently , she was likely to continue to resist direct contact , and indirect contact was the only option , with a view to initiating possible interest in future direct contact .", "On DATE the High Court judge ordered fortnightly indirect contact to be facilitated by the guardian who reported that the parents cooperated with her proposals and suggestions .", "On DATE the guardian reported that NORP was adamant that she did not wish to see the applicant , that her physical needs were well met by her mother but her emotional needs had not been met due to her mother 's failure to promote regular and consistent contact , that NORP 's responses to the attempts to promote contact demonstrated an escalation of her resistance to contact and increasing distress , and that it was apparent that she had internalised the feelings of hostility that the adults had displayed to each other and did not feel secure enough to see her father despite support and encouragement . The guardian did not consider that anything could be done in the short term to alleviate the level of anxiety and distrust displayed by NORP when her father was discussed . She concluded that NORP should remain with her mother , as any change in residence would cause her considerable disruption and further emotional harm .", "On DATE Mr ORG considered the prospects of contact . He noted that the last contact visit had been in DATE and that the applicant had last seen NORP in DATE and that it had to be said , clearly and firmly , that the blame for the present unhappy situation lay primarily , indeed overwhelmingly , at the mother 's door . Reviewing the breakdown of visits in DATE , he found that the mother had sabotaged the sessions which had previously been successful . It was obvious that , even if she was not actively poisoning NORP 's mind , she was wholly unable to conceal her own antipathy and hostility to the idea of contact . As regards the incident on DATE , where the applicant had behaved most foolishly , he considered that it was the mother 's constant sabotage of contact that had goaded him beyond endurance and that she had behaved no better than he had . The mother had also conspicuously failed to cooperate in the indirect contact attempts , professing herself unable to persuade NORP to write even the shortest card to her father : the judge did not think that she had even tried . It was also clear that NORP had regularly been subjected to negative statements about her father by the mother and other members of the mother 's family . He concluded that NORP had suffered emotional harm due to the mother 's failure to allow her to develop a proper relationship with the applicant but , although she had not yet suffered significant harm , she probably would in the future . This harm was caused by the mother . He had no doubt that NORP 's best interests required her to go on living with her mother but at the same time enjoying a proper and rewarding relationship with her father .", "\u201c It is a tragedy for NORP that she can not have such a relationship with her father . If she does not have a proper relationship with her father \u2013 a father who it is obvious has much to offer his daughter and whose company she thoroughly enjoys \u2013 then NORP is likely to grow up as a damaged child , a damaged adolescent and , in time , a damaged adult .", "There are times when a judge ... has to speak plainly , indeed brutally , if his message is to be understood . The tragedy which lies ahead for NORP is that mother may , although of course without any intention of doing so , end up wrecking her daughter 's life . The tragedy which lies ahead for mother is that the time may come when NORP blames mother for denying her a relationship with her father and turns against mother ... \u201d", "He decided to adjourn the applicant 's application for residence so that CARDINAL final attempt could be made to establish contact , both indirect and direct . He warned the mother that , if she still could not facilitate contact , the applicant would inevitably restore his application for residence and she should realise that there was a very real chance that the court would be compelled to remove NORP from her care , as in the applicant 's care NORP would be able to continue to see both her parents . He considered that the mother had shown herself largely impervious to the threat of imprisonment and appeared willing to pay that price ; however , her avowed fear of losing her daughter would become a horrible reality if she did not promote contact in the future . He ordered that the burden be lifted from NORP 's shoulders ; that NORP be informed that contact would take place and that a tightly structured approach to contact leading to direct contact within DATE be adopted . The parties agreed to the detailed order , which provided for review in DATE .", "The case was reviewed by the court on DATE .", "On DATE the guardian reported on the progress of work . The mother , despite initial reluctance , had attended CARDINAL sessions on the subject of contact and had been following advice on reintroducing the subject of contact with NORP , delivering gifts and reading out letters , and maintaining a firm approach when NORP was negative . A first direct contact visit was planned to take place in the presence of the mother and her new partner and other children in a bowling alley . However , on DATE concerned , CARDINAL DATE , when the social worker arrived , NORP remained in her room , screaming and refusing to dress or come down . The contact was cancelled . NORP later refused to see the social worker .", "On DATE the case was reviewed by the court . Mr ORG ordered that the applicant 's application for contact and restored application for residence be listed for final hearing in DATE .", "In her report of DATE , the guardian reported that NORP had refused to talk to her but that it was clear that she was distressed when the issue of contact was raised and that she had stated that she did not wish to have contact . She was unable to make any further suggestions regarding the promoting of contact and was of the view that the mother had , this time , attempted to promote contact to the best of her ability . She did not recommend any change in residence .", "On DATE the case came back before Mr ORG , who reviewed the attempts at renewing contact and approved a consent order . He had no doubt that the guardian and the independent social worker had done everything possible to resume contact , though it was now impossible to say if they could have achieved more if they had been brought in earlier . The situation was now all too clear and the experts were unanimous that there was no alternative to leaving NORP with the mother . As a result , he noted that the applicant \u201c bravely but realistically \u201d withdrew his applications for residence and direct contact . He approved the consent order drawn up by the parties , which contained , inter alia , the mother 's undertaking to promote a positive image of the applicant and provided for indirect contact as specified in the appendix and allowed such direct contact as might be later agreed between the parties or as the child wished . He made remarks urging the applicant to persevere with indirect contact as in time NORP would need him , warning the mother that she had not won a victory but stored up terrible problems for herself in the future . He agreed that the applicant , who had nothing to reproach himself for , was entitled to feel let down by the system and stated that there were lessons to be learned from this : in the public interest he intended to give a judgment dealing with the wider aspects .", "His full judgment on this occasion does not appear to have been delivered until DATE .", "On DATE Mr ORG issued a further judgment dealing with the wider issues of procedure highlighted by the case . In his judgment of CARDINAL pages , he noted that the case could be seen as exemplifying everything that was wrong with the system . He handed down this judgment in public , with names anonymised , to deal with the failings revealed .", "Among other things he emphasised the importance that both parents , residential and non - residential , played in a child 's life and acknowledged that there were cases where mothers deliberately alienated children to prevent contact taking place and where the court process had not proved successful in dealing with them . While mothers and fathers had equal rights before the courts , there were , however , more non - resident fathers than non - resident mothers and when the system failed , as it did , it was disproportionately fathers not mothers who found themselves , as well as the children , victims of that failure . In this case , he criticised : the length of the proceedings ( DATE ) ; the large number of hearings and astonishing number of different judges involved ( namely CARDINAL hearings by CARDINAL different judges ) ; the vast bulk of evidence filed over DATE , CARDINAL pages , a ceaseless proliferation of paper which was the product of delay , as with every adjournment fresh reports were needed in order to keep the case file up to date ; the fact that the final hearing for residence was listed on CARDINAL different occasions in DATE but adjourned , and that CARDINAL dates in DATE and DATE were also adjourned until the final order was made on DATE ; the great delay in the courts making findings in relation to the mother 's wholly groundless allegations which could have been made earlier and some allegations of domestic violence which were never subject to any findings ; the great delay in seeking expert assistance other than the court welfare officer ( the independent social worker had not been involved until DATE , the guardian on DATE ) ; and the characteristic judicial response when difficulties with contact emerged to reduce the amount of contact and replace direct contact with indirect contact . He summarised the problems as being :", "( i ) the appalling delays in the court system , exacerbated by the absence of any judicial continuity , seemingly endless directions hearings , the lack of any overall timetable and the failure of the court to adhere to such timetable as had been set ;", "( ii ) the court 's failure to get to grips with the mother 's ( groundless ) allegations ; and", "( iii ) the court 's failure to get to grips with the mother 's defiance of its orders , and the court 's failure to enforce its own orders .", "After reviewing GPE jurisprudence concerning the obligation on authorities to facilitate or enforce access arrangements , he considered that it could not be assumed that conventional domestic approaches met the standards required by ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , in particular noting that it was almost impossible to see how a DATE timescale as in this case could be compatible with the Convention . He recommended taking steps to divert parents into a non - court process including parent education and contact - focused mediation , concentrating court time and resources on serious cases which required greater judicial input . He also recommended improving court procedures , including a fast - track procedure , the highest practical level of judicial continuity ( not CARDINAL judges at the most ) and case management , the timetabling of cases to final hearing at the earliest practical stage , with not CARDINAL intermediate hearings , to ensure conclusion within DATE rather than DATE and the fixing of a judicial strategy for each case . He also identified the immense value of children 's guardians and the need for skilled social - work intervention , in particular an independent social worker , and recommended that allegations of misconduct be speedily investigated and resolved , not left to fester and cause continuing friction and dispute , and that once findings had been made , the questions were not to be reopened . PERSON , efficient enforcement of court orders was also called for , with direct judicial supervision of contact and the imposition of imprisonment for CARDINAL or DATE could suffice to deter the mother without significantly impairing her ability to look after her children .", "\u201c There are no simple solutions . And it is idle to imagine that even the best system can overcome all problems . The bitter truth is that there will always be some contact cases so intractable that they will defeat even the best and most committed attempts of judges . But that is no reason for not taking steps \u2013 urgent steps \u2013 to improve the system as best we can .", "Whether an improved system would have provided a better outcome for this child and this father is now almost impossible to know . Perhaps it would . Perhaps not . But they were denied the chance of a better outcome and for that they deserve a public , albeit necessarily anonymous , apology . We failed them . The system failed them . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
