Moreover , PERSON had kept his NORP nationality and could thus go to GPE at any time . Lastly , his academic qualifications , his knowledge of languages and his professional experience would have made it easy for him to settle in a foreign country .

He emphasised that the legislation in force made no provision for the appearance of the parties and in particular of the accused or his counsel during the proceedings before investigating judges or indictment divisions ; this was a lacuna and a flaw in the legislation , stemming from the inquisitorial nature of the system and from the principle of confidentiality , which often ran counter not only to the accused 's defence rights but also to the interests of justice . While acknowledging that Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW to that stage of the proceedings - did not contain any provision similar to that in LAW para . CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , he relied on the latter provision by analogy and on the fact that his detention had been prolonged beyond the DATE limit laid down in the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to support his contention that he should be allowed to appear before ORG .", "In a decision of DATE ORG allowed the prosecutor 's application - after hearing him on DATE in the absence of the accused - and confirmed the prolongation of the applicant 's detention on remand .

ORG On DATE the applicant submitted a further application for release to ORG , before which the question of his committal for trial was then pending . He argued that his detention was based on the successive orders of DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , each of which had fixed a new starting - point for calculating the length of detention , and that as a result he had remained in prison , without being committed for trial , for DATE and DATE , whereas the maximum period authorised under Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the LAW was DATE or , in exceptional circumstances , DATE . Such a period , whose length , he argued , was due to the slow progress of the investigation , the splitting up of the alleged offences into separate sets of charges and the making of successive detention orders , was in breach of the Greek Constitution and of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention as interpreted by ORG and ORG . He also complained that ORG had not yet ruled on his complaint of a violation of the LAW , although he had already raised it several times . Lastly , he requested leave to appear with his lawyer in order to put forward his arguments .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG heard the prosecutor , who expanded on the written submissions he had filed DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG dismissed PERSON applications ( decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It held that LAW neither specified what was a reasonable length of time for an accused to be held in pre - trial detention nor laid down a procedure for deciding whether to release him . On the other hand , these matters were specifically dealt with in Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and LAW para . CARDINAL of the LAW .", "It noted that the accused had initially been detained for DATE under order no .

ORG task under LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW was to determine at first and last instance whether the charges were lawful and whether there was a case to answer . It would therefore give a final decision on the questions raised by the applicant only after weighing all the evidence . It would then decide at the same time whether to prolong the detention or order the applicant 's release ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The application for release of CARDINAL DATE , which had the same purpose and was based on the same evidence as the application of DATE , was accordingly premature and should be declared inadmissible .", "Lastly , ORG held PERSON application for leave to appear in person to be ill - founded . On this point it followed the reasoning of the prosecutor , who had argued in his submissions of CARDINAL DATE that such an appearance \" [ could ] be contemplated only where ORG [ was ] about to rule on the merits of the case or in those cases where it [ was ] specifically provided for by law ( ORG , judgment no .

It indicted the applicant , as the chairman and managing director of a publicly owned company , on several counts of aggravated misappropriation and fraud , these being acts which constituted continuous offences . It also indicted him on a charge of making false statements in his capacity as a civil servant . It further held that the circumstances in which these crimes had been committed showed that PERSON was particularly dangerous , and accordingly ordered that his detention should continue .", "With regard to the applications for leave to appear lodged by the applicant and his co - accused , ORG noted that the written submissions accompanying them were so comprehensive that oral clarification was not necessary . In addition , the pleadings lodged on their behalf after the prosecutor 's submissions adduced no new material and did not affect the assessment of the evidence . More particularly , with regard to the applicant , ORG held that , without breaching LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it could refuse to examine his application on the ground that it had been submitted on DATE , and therefore after the hearing of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE PERSON again applied for release and for leave to appear in person . He repeated his argument that the length of his detention on remand was in breach of the LAW and LAW .

The CARDINAL orders remanding the applicant in custody , made on DATE and DATE by the investigating judge of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , had lapsed on DATE and DATE respectively . PERSON 's position was now governed only by the order of CARDINAL DATE made by the special investigating judge of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Consequently , the length of his detention had to be calculated from that date and not from the date on which the applicant was first imprisoned . ORG gave as the reasons for its decision the fact that there had been a number of separate offences each constituted by a separate criminal act , the need for a second investigation , the applicant 's refusal to co - operate and the complexity of the case , whose elucidation had required numerous audits in addition to the judicial investigation .", "In a further decision ( no .
