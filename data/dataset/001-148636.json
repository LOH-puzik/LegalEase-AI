MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 2 of Protocol No. 1 - Control of the use of property)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE , and at the time of lodging the application lived in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . GPE has gone through various legislative regimes in order to regulate its housing situation . The first regime came about in DATE and protected tenants from the termination of their leases . This was followed by the DATE LAW Ordinance which , apart from regulating termination of the lease of dwelling houses , also controlled rents and the initial conditions of contracts . LAW was then enacted in DATE , with the aim of providing a solution to homelessness caused by the Second World War . In DATE ORG ) Ordinance , Chapter CARDINAL of the Laws of Malta ( hereinafter \u201c the HD Ordinance \u201d ) was enacted , which provided incentives to encourage landlords to rent their property , and created a special class of dwelling houses free from rent control .", "CARDINAL . The applicant owns a property in GPE ( a maisonette measuring QUANTITY ) which he inherited from his parents , his mother having passed away in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the property was registered as a \u201c decontrolled dwelling house \u201d in accordance with LAW . At the time , LAW provided that the provisions of the \u201c Rent Ordinances \u201d ( the Reletting of ORG ) Ordinance , LAW of the Laws of Malta and LAW , LAW of LAW ) were not applicable to dwelling houses decontrolled in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s mother leased the LOC to couple C. , who are NORP citizens ( born in DATE and DATE respectively ) , for a rent of CARDINAL NORP PERSON ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) DATE , which was later decreased to the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL DATE . At the time , the law permitted her to increase the rent , to refuse to renew the lease or to change its terms on renewal .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the NORP parliament enacted an amendment to the HD Ordinance , which provided that the rent restrictions set out in GPE would apply where tenants were NORP citizens and occupied houses as ordinary residences . It further provided that landlords could not refuse to renew leases , raise their rent , or impose new conditions on renewal , except as provided for by law ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . The applicant submitted that the contractual freedom of parties was greatly restricted as a result of the new provisions , in that his family could not charge a fair rent or recover possession of their property , despite the fact that his tenants owned substantial immovable property .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of ORG ( RRB ) of DATE , the rent was further reduced to ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL per year . The applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE new laws were enacted in respect of new leases which could again be free from rent control . They did not apply to the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE new concepts and provisions were introduced , aimed at gradually eliminating the restrictive regimes applicable to leases entered into before DATE .", "CARDINAL . Thus , while a rent of ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL per year had been paid to the applicant since DATE , a rent of LAW had been paid from DATE in view of the above - mentioned amendments . However , the applicant refused to accept any rent as from DATE and it was duly deposited in court by the tenants by means of a schedule of deposit .", "CARDINAL . According to a court - appointed architect \u2019s evaluation made in the context of constitutional proceedings instituted in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the property at that time had a rental value of ORG DATE . According to an architect \u2019s report commissioned by the Government , the rental market value in DATE was ORG DATE , and the sale value EUR CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . To date , couple C still reside in the applicant \u2019s property . It does not at present appear that they have any children formally residing with them .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings complaining , inter alia , that the DATE amendments ( in particular LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the HD Ordinance , which prohibited landlords from refusing to renew existing leases or from raising their rent ) had breached his property rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction rejected his complaint . Basing its judgment on domestic case - law relating to the same subject matter , it considered that he remained the owner of the property at issue , which was being used as a dwelling house , that he could still evict the tenants if they failed to fulfil their obligations under the lease , and that although the amount of rent was low , the law provided for an increase in rent DATE , amounting to double the actual rent . The interference with his rights was therefore proportionate given the needs of society . Moreover , his mother had not been forced to lease out the property .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal as being lodged out of time , the statutory time - limit having expired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he lodged an application with the ORG , relying on LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the ORG , sitting as a ORG of CARDINAL judges , declared the applicant \u2019s application inadmissible . It found that he had lodged his appeal with ORG out of time . The domestic remedies had therefore not been exhausted as required by LAW CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings complaining that the DATE amendments , which prohibited landlords from refusing to renew existing leases or from raising their rent when the tenant was a NORP citizen , had breached his property rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . He submitted that the amendments introduced in DATE had not improved his situation , even assuming they ( in particular LAW ) applied to the case in question , a matter which was unclear in the domestic context . With a new rent of ORG CARDINAL per year ( see Relevant domestic law below ) , he remained a victim of the alleged violation , not least because he was also prevented from refusing to renew the lease . He cited the then recent case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , in which ORG had found a violation in analogous circumstances .", "CARDINAL . By a decree of DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction ruled that the defendant in the case should be the Attorney General of GPE , not the State of GPE as purported by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction , upholding the objection raised by the third party who joined in the suit ( kjamat fil - kaw\u017ca ) , rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint on the basis that the matter had already become res judicata by virtue of the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It noted that such a conclusion required CARDINAL elements , namely the same parties ( eaedem personae ) , the same object ( eadem res ) and the same cause of action ( eadem causa petendi ) . Moreover , where the arguments raised were different , it had to be seen whether they could have been raised at the time of the principal judgment . In the present case , it considered that there had been no doubt that the requirement of eaedem personae had been met , despite the fact that the applicant had attempted to bring the present proceedings against the ORG and that the other proceedings had been against the Attorney General , as it was clear that the defendant in both cases was ORG . The element of eadem res had also been satisfied in so far as the present case concerned the same lease of the same property , with the same tenants and the same circumstances that had led the applicant to institute proceedings the first time round . Similarly , the element of eadem causa petendi had also been satisfied , since the applicant \u2019s applications to the court were to a great extent the same , if not identical , despite the fact that he had made further arguments and submitted that his situation had remained unchanged notwithstanding the DATE amendments to LAW . The court considered that the changes to the application had not changed the nature of the action , namely a claim that the restrictions on the rent imposed by the law had been disproportionate . This matter had already been dealt with by the court in the first set of proceedings ( no . CARDINAL ) , where it had decided that a fair balance had been struck by the authorities ; it was not therefore open to the applicant to relitigate the matter . The court further held that even though the applicant had argued that despite the DATE amendments ( if they applied at all ) he had remained a victim of the alleged violation , there was already a judgment in his respect stating that the law in so far as it applied to his case had not breached his rights , and the more recent amendments had not worsened his situation . Thus , ORG ( FAC ) held that there could not have been a breach of his rights even under the new law . Lastly , it concluded that any new arguments put forward by him should have been incorporated into the first set of proceedings . As to the ORG \u2019s recent case - law , it considered that the judgment cited did not entitle the applicant to ask for a fresh examination of his case .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment , considering the appeal to be frivolous and vexatious ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
