That leads us to stress one of the characteristics of this Convention , namely its application to the protection of custody rights which were exercised prior to any decision thereon . This is important , since one can not forget that , in terms of statistics , the number of cases in which a child is removed prior to a decision on its custody are quite frequent . Moreover , the possibility of the dispossessed parent being able to recover the child in such circumstances , except within the Convention \u2019s framework , is practically non - existent , unless he in his turn resorts to force , a course of action which is always harmful to the child . \u201d", "The same ORG , in its paragraph CARDINAL , comments on LAW in the following terms :", "\u201c ... although nothing is said in this article about the possibility of custody rights being exercised singly or jointly , such a possibility is clearly envisaged ... the whole tenor of LAW leaves no room for doubt that the ORG seeks to protect joint custody as well .
