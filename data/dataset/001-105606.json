During this period , ORG consisted of CARDINAL divisions that were under the overall command of GPE generals . CARDINAL were GPE divisions and CARDINAL were multinational . Each division was given responsibility for a particular geographical area of GPE . GPE was given command of ORG ( South - East ) , which comprised the provinces of GPE , ORG , PERSON and PERSON , an area of QUANTITY with a population of MONEY . There were CARDINAL Coalition troops , including CARDINAL GPE troops , stationed in ORG ( LOC ) . The main theatre for operations by GPE forces in ORG ( LOC ) were the GPE and ORG provinces , with a total population of CARDINAL people . CARDINAL NORP troops were deployed there , of whom CARDINAL had operational responsibilities .", "CARDINAL . From CARDINAL DATE onwards NORP forces in GPE carried out CARDINAL main functions . The first was to maintain security in ORG ( South - East ) area , in particular in the GPE and ORG provinces . The principal security task was the effort to re - establish the NORP security forces , including the NORP police . Other tasks included patrols , arrests , anti - terrorist operations , policing of civil demonstrations , protection of essential utilities and infrastructure and protecting police stations . The second main function of the NORP troops was the support of the civil administration in GPE in a variety of ways , from liaison with the CPA and ORG and local government , to assisting with the rebuilding of the infrastructure .", "CARDINAL . In ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , prepared on behalf of the ORG Chief of ORG , the post - conflict situation in GPE was described as follows :", "\u201c The context in which operations have been conducted in GPE has been exceptionally complex . It is not for this report to comment on the jus ad bellum aspects of the operation , nor of the public \u2019s opinions of the invasion . It is , however , important to note that the ORG \u2019s post - invasion plans concentrated more on the relief of a humanitarian disaster ( which did not , in the event , occur on anything like the scale that had been anticipated ) , and less on the criminal activity and subsequent insurgency that actually took place . CARDINAL consequence of that was that we had insufficient troops in theatre to deal effectively with the situation in which we found ourselves . Peace support operations require significantly larger numbers of troops to impose law and order than are required for prosecuting a war : ours were very thinly spread on the ground . In his investigation ( in DATE ) of the LOC incident [ alleged abuse of NORP detained on suspicion of looting humanitarian aid stores ] , Brigadier PERSON described conditions in GPE thus :", "\u2018 ... DATE , DATE or so after NORP forces had started to begin the transition from offensive operations to stabilisation . The situation was fluid . Battlegroups had been given geographic areas of responsibility based generally around their initial tactical objectives . Combat operations had officially ended , and [ the ] rules of engagement had changed to reflect this , but there was a rising trend of shooting incidents . Although these were principally between NORP , seeking to settle old scores or involved in criminal activity , there were early indications that the threat to NORP soldiers was developing ... The structure of the NORP forces was changing . Many of the heavier capabilities that had been required for the invasion were now being sent home . Some force elements were required for operations elsewhere , and there was pressure from the GPE to downsize quickly to more sustainable numbers ... Local attitudes were also changing . Initially ecstatic with happiness , the formerly downtrodden NORP population in and around GPE had become suspicious , and by the middle of DATE people were frustrated . Aspirations and expectations were not being met . There was no NORP administration or governance . Fuel and potable water were in short supply , electricity was intermittent , and the hospitals were full of wounded from the combat operations phase . PERSON and key routes had been destroyed by Coalition bombing . PERSON and order had completely collapsed . The NORP police service had melted away ; the few security guards who remained were old and incapable ; and the NORP armed forces had been captured , disbanded or deserted . Criminals had been turned out onto the streets and the prisons had been stripped . The judiciary were in hiding . Every government facility had been raided and all loose items had been removed . Insecure buildings had been occupied by squatters . Crime was endemic and in parts of GPE a state of virtual anarchy prevailed . Hijackings , child kidnappings , revenge killings , car theft and burglary were rife . In a very short space of time wealth was being comprehensively redistributed.\u2019", "In this environment , the NORP army was the sole agent of law and order within its area of operations . When the Association of Chief Police Officers\u2019 Lead for ORG , Mr PERSON , visited GPE in DATE , he said that he would not recommend the deployment of civilian police officers to the theatre of operations due to the poor security situation . The last time the army had exercised the powers of an army of occupation was in DATE and it had spent DATE preparing for that role ; in DATE , the same soldiers who had just fought a highintensity , conventional war were expected to convert , TIME , into the only people capable of providing the agencies of government and humanitarian relief for the people of southern GPE . Battlegroups ( comprising a Lieutenant Colonel and CARDINAL soldiers ) were allocated areas of responsibilities comprising QUANTITY ; companies ( a Major with CARDINAL men under command ) were given whole towns to run . The NORP invasion plans had wisely limited damaging as much of the physical infrastructure as possible ; but with only military personnel available to run that infrastructure , and very limited local staff support , the task placed huge strains on the army .", "CARDINAL of the effects of this lack of civil infrastructure was the conundrum NORP soldiers faced when dealing with routine crime . Our experience in GPE , and in peace support operations around the world , has inculcated the clear principle of police primacy when dealing with criminals in operational environments . Soldiers accept that they will encounter crime , and that they will occasionally be required to arrest those criminals ; but ( despite some experience of this syndrome in GPE in DATE ) our doctrine and practice had not prepared us for dealing with those criminals when there was no civil police force , no judicial system to deal with offenders , and no prisons to detain them in . Even when a nascent NORP police force was re - established in DATE , troops on the ground had little confidence in its ability to deal fairly or reasonably with any criminals handed over to it . In hindsight , we now know that some soldiers acted outside the law in the way they dealt with local criminals . However diligent they were , commanders were unable to be everywhere , and so were physically unable to supervise their troops to the extent that they should ; as a result , when those instances did occur , they were less likely to be spotted and prevented . \u201d", "CARDINAL . GPE military records show that , as at DATE , there had been CARDINAL demonstrations and CARDINAL violent attacks against ORG in ORG ( LOC ) since DATE . The violent attacks consisted of CARDINAL anti - aircraft attacks , CARDINAL grenade attacks , CARDINAL attacks using improvised explosive devices , CARDINAL attempted attacks using improvised explosive devices , CARDINAL mortar attacks , CARDINAL rocket - propelled grenade attacks , CARDINAL shootings and CARDINAL others . The same records show that , DATE , DATE NORP were known to have been killed in incidents in which NORP troops used force .", "CARDINAL . The use of force by NORP troops during operations is covered by the appropriate rules of engagement . The rules of engagement governing the use of lethal force by NORP troops in GPE during the relevant period were the subject of guidance contained in a card issued to every soldier , known as \u201c LOC \u201d . Card Alpha set out the rules of engagement in the following terms :", "\u201c CARD A \u2013 GUIDANCE FOR OPENING FIRE FOR SERVICE PERSONNEL AUTHORISED TO CARRY ARMS AND AMMUNITION ON DUTY", "GENERAL GUIDANCE", "CARDINAL . NORP This guidance does not affect your inherent right to self - defence . However , in all situations you are to use no more force than absolutely necessary .", "FIREARMS MUST ONLY BE USED AS A LAST RESORT", "CARDINAL . When guarding property , you must not use lethal force other than for the protection of human life .", "PROTECTION OF HUMAN LIFE", "CARDINAL .

On DATE Brigadier PERSON ( Commander of the CARDINAL ORG in GPE from DATE ) issued a formal policy on the investigation of shooting incidents . This policy provided that all shooting incidents were to be reported and the Divisional Provost Marshal was to be informed . Non - commissioned officers from ORG were then to evaluate the incident and decide whether it fell within the rules of engagement . If it was decided that the incident did come within the rules of engagement , statements were to be recorded and a completed bulletin submitted through the chain of command . If the incident appeared to fall outside the rules of engagement and involved death or serious injury , the investigation was to be handed to ORG of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) by the Divisional Provost Marshal at the earliest opportunity .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , Brigadier PERSON decided that from DATE this policy should be revised . The new policy required that all such incidents should be reported immediately by the soldier involved to ORG ( South - East ) by means of a \u201c serious incident report \u201d . There would then be an investigation into the incident by the Company Commander or the soldier \u2019s Commanding Officer . In his evidence to the domestic courts , Brigadier PERSON explained that :", "\u201c The form of an investigation into an incident would vary according to the security situation on the ground and the circumstances of the individual case . Generally , it would involve the Company Commander or Commanding Officer taking statements from the members of the patrol involved , and reviewing radio logs . It might also include taking photographs of the scene . Sometimes there would be further investigation through a meeting with the family / tribe of the person killed . Investigations at unit - level , however , would not include a full forensic examination . Within the Brigade , we had no forensic capability . \u201d", "If the Commanding Officer was satisfied , on the basis of the information available to him , that the soldier had acted lawfully and within the rules of engagement , there was no requirement to initiate an investigation by ORG . The Commanding Officer would record his decision in writing to Brigadier PERSON . If the Commanding Officer was not so satisfied , or if he had insufficient information to arrive at a decision , he was required to initiate a Special Investigation Branch investigation .", "CARDINAL . DATE there was a further reconsideration of this policy , prompted by the fact that the environment had become less hostile and also by the considerable media and parliamentary interest in incidents involving GPE forces in which NORP had died . On DATE a new policy was adopted by the Commander of ORG ( South - East ) , requiring all shooting incidents involving GPE forces which resulted in a civilian being killed or injured to be investigated by ORG . In exceptional cases , ORG Commander could decide that an investigation was not necessary . Any such decision had to be notified to the Commander of ORG ( South - East ) in writing .", "CARDINAL . The Royal Military Police form part of the army and deploy with the army on operations abroad , but have a separate chain of command . Military police officers report to LOC , who reports to ORG . Within ORG , the Special Investigation Branch is responsible for the investigation of serious crimes committed by members of the NORP forces while on service , incidents involving contact between the military and civilians and any special investigations tasked to it , including incidents involving civilian deaths caused by NORP soldiers . To secure their practical independence on operations , ORG deploy as entirely discrete units and are subject to their own chain of command , headed by provost officers who are deployed on operations for this purpose .", "CARDINAL . Investigations into NORP civilian deaths involving NORP soldiers were triggered either by ORG being asked to investigate by the Commanding Officer of the units concerned or by ORG of its own initiative , when it became aware of an incident by other means . However , the latter type of investigation could be terminated if ORG was instructed to stop by ORG or the Commanding Officer of the unit involved .", "CARDINAL . Special Investigation Branch investigations in GPE were hampered by a number of difficulties , such as security problems , lack of interpreters , cultural considerations ( for example , the NORP practice requiring a body to be buried within TIME and left undisturbed for DATE ) , the lack of pathologists and post - mortem facilities , the lack of records , problems with logistics , the climate and general working conditions . ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) summarised the position as follows :", "\u201c It was not only the combat troops who were overstretched in these circumstances . The current military criminal justice system is relevant , independent , and fit for purpose ; but even the most effective criminal justice system will struggle to investigate , advise on and prosecute cases where the civil infrastructure is effectively absent . And so , in the immediate aftermath of the ground war , the Service Police faced particular challenges in gathering evidence of a quality that would meet the very high standards required under LANGUAGE law . National records \u2013 usually an integral reference point for criminal investigations \u2013 were largely absent ; a different understanding of the law between NORP people and NORP police added to an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion ; and the army was facing an increasingly dangerous operational environment \u2013 indeed , on DATE , CARDINAL members of ORG were killed in LOC . Local customs similarly hampered the execution of NORP standards of justice : in the case of PERSON , for instance , the family of the deceased refused to hand over the body for forensic examination \u2013 significantly reducing the quality of evidence surrounding his death . \u201d", "ORG also referred to the problems caused to ORG , when attempting to investigate serious allegations of abuse , by the sense of loyalty to fellow soldiers which could lead to a lack of cooperation from army personnel and to what the judge in the court martial concerning the killing of the sixth applicant \u2019s son had described as a \u201c wall of silence \u201d from some of the military witnesses called to give evidence .", "CARDINAL . On conclusion of a Special Investigation Branch investigation , the Special Investigation Branch officer would report in writing to the Commanding Officer of the unit involved . Such a report would include a covering letter and a summary of the evidence , together with copies of any documentary evidence relevant to the investigation in the form of statements from witnesses and investigators . The report would not contain any decision as to the facts or conclusions as to what had happened . It was then for the Commanding Officer to decide whether or not to refer the case to ORG for possible trial by court martial .", "CARDINAL . ORG , dated DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , commented on the prosecution of armed forces personnel in connection with the death of NORP civilians , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL cases involving NORP deaths as a result of deliberate abuse have been investigated , and subsequently referred to ORG ( ORG ) on the basis there was a prima facie case that the victims had been killed unlawfully by NORP troops . The ORG preferred charges on CARDINAL of these cases on the basis that it considered there was a realistic prospect of conviction , and that trial was in the public and service interest ; and yet not CARDINAL conviction for murder or manslaughter has been recorded .", "The army \u2019s position is straightforward on the issue of prosecution . Legal advice is available for commanding officers and higher authorities to assist with decisions on referring appropriate cases to the ORG . ORG ( ORG ) , who is responsible to ORG for the provision of legal services to the army , is additionally appointed by the Queen as the ORG . In that capacity , he has responsibility for decisions on whether to direct trial for all cases referred by the military chain of command , and for the prosecution of all cases tried before courts martial , ORG and ORG and for appeals before ORG and ORG . ORG delegates these functions to ORG [ ( ORG ) ] officers appointed as prosecutors in the ORG , and Brigadier Prosecutions has day - to - day responsibility for the ORG . The ORG is under the general superintendence of the Attorney General and is , rightly , independent of the army chain of command : the ORG alone decides whether to direct court - martial trial and the appropriate charges , and neither the army chain of command , nor ministers , officials nor anyone else can make those decisions . However complex the situation in which it finds itself , the army must operate within the law at all times ; once the ORG has made its decision ( based on the evidence and the law ) , the army has to accept that the consequences of prosecuting particular individuals or of particular charges may have a negative impact on its reputation .", "The absence of a single conviction for murder or manslaughter as a result of deliberate abuse in GPE may appear worrying , but it is explicable . Evidence has to be gathered ( and , as already mentioned , this was not an easy process ) ; that evidence has to be presented in court ; and defendants are presumed innocent unless the prosecution can prove its case beyond reasonable doubt . That is a stiff test \u2013 no different to the one that applies in our civilian courts . In the broader context , the outcome from prosecutions brought to court martial by the ORG is almost exactly comparable with the equivalent civilian courts : for example , as at DATE , the conviction rates after trial in the court - martial system stood at PERCENT as compared with PERCENT in ORG . It is inevitable that some prosecutions will fail ; but this does not mean that they should not have been brought in the first place . It is the courts , after all , that determine guilt , not the prosecutors . Indeed , the fact that only a small number of all the CARDINAL cases investigated by ORG in GPE resulted in prosecution could be interpreted as both a positive and a negative indicator : positive , in that the evidence and the context did not support the preferring of criminal charges ; but negative , in that we know that ORG were hugely hampered , in some cases , in their ability to collect evidence of a high enough standard for charges to be preferred or for cases to be successfully prosecuted .", "It is important to note that none of this implies any fundamental flaws in the effectiveness of the key elements of the military criminal justice system .

That one of those cases did not subsequently proceed to trial is irrelevant : at the time , an ostensibly unusual event was alleged to have occurred twice in a short space of time . With all their other duties , the commanders on the ground can not reasonably be blamed for failing to identify what may or may not have been a trend ; but a more immediate , effective system for referring that sort of information to others with the capacity to analyse it might have identified such a trend . In fact , the evidence suggests that these were CARDINAL isolated incidents ; but had they been a symptom of a more fundamental failing , they might have been overlooked . By comparison , if there had been CARDINAL reports of a new weapon being used by insurgents to attack NORP armoured vehicles within DATE , it is certain that the lessons learned process would have identified its significance , determined the counter - measures needed to combat it , and quickly disseminated new procedures to mitigate the risk .

When that disciplinary process takes as long as it has taken in most of these cases , then the impact of any subsequent administrative sanctions is significantly reduced \u2013 indeed , such sanctions are likely to be counterproductive .

Although there has been evidence of a rather general nature about the difficulties of conducting investigations in GPE at that time \u2013 about basic security problems involved in going to NORP homes to interview people , about lack of interpreters , cultural differences , logistic problems , lack of records , and so forth \u2013 without any further understanding of the outcome of the [ ORG ] report , it is impossible to understand what , if any , relevance any of this has to a death which occurred not in the highways or byways of GPE , but in a military prison under the control of NORP forces . ...", "CARDINAL . Although Captain PERSON says that identity parades were logistically very difficult , detainees were moved to a different location , and some military witnesses had returned to the GPE , she also says that these problems only delayed the process but did not prevent it taking place \u2018 ORG ... There is nothing else before us to explain the dilatoriness of the investigative process : which might possibly be compared with the progress , and open public scrutiny , which we have noted seems to have been achieved with other investigations arising out of possible offences in prisons under the control of GPE forces . As for the [ ORG ] report itself , on the evidence before us ... that would not contain any decision as to the facts or any conclusions as to what has or might have happened .", "CARDINAL . In these circumstances we can not accept [ counsel for the ORG \u2019s ] submission that the investigation has been adequate in terms of the procedural obligation arising out of LAW . Even if an investigation solely in the hands of the [ Special Investigation Branch ] might be said to be independent , on the grounds that the [ ORG ] are hierarchically and practically independent of the military units under investigation , as to which we have doubts in part because the report of the [ ORG ] is to the unit chain of command itself , it is difficult to say that the investigation which has occurred has been timely , open or effective . \u201d", "In respect of the other CARDINAL deaths , the judge considered that , if he were wrong on the jurisdiction issue and the claims did fall within the scope of the LAW , the investigative duty under LAW had not been met , for the following reasons :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... in all these cases , as in the case of PERSON , GPE authorities were proceeding on the basis that the Convention did not apply . Thus the immediate investigations were in each case conducted , as a matter of policy , by the unit involved : only in case CARDINAL , that concerning PERSON , was there any involvement of the [ Special Investigation Branch ] , and that was stood down , at any rate before being reopened ( at some uncertain time ) upon a review of the file back in the GPE . The investigations were therefore not independent . Nor were they effective , for they essentially consisted only in a comparatively superficial exercise , based on the evidence of the soldiers involved themselves , and even then on a paucity of interviews or witness statements , an exercise which was CARDINAL - sided and omitted the assistance of forensic evidence such as might have become available from ballistic or medical expertise .", "...", "CARDINAL . In connection with these cases , [ counsel for the ORG \u2019s ] main submission was that , in extremely difficult situations , both in operational terms in the field and in terms of post - event investigations , the army and the authorities had done their best . He particularly emphasised the following aspects of the evidence . There was no rule of law in GPE ; at the start of the occupation there was no police force at all , and at best the force was totally inadequate , as well as being under constant attack ; although the NORP courts were functioning , they were subject to intimidation ; there was no local civil inquest system or capability ; the local communications systems were not functioning ; there were no mortuaries , no post - mortem system , no reliable pathologists ; the security situation was the worst ever experienced by seasoned soldiers ; there was DATE fighting between tribal and criminal gangs ; the number of troops available were small ; and cultural differences exacerbated all these difficulties .", "CARDINAL . We would not discount these difficulties , which cumulatively must have amounted to grave impediments for anyone concerned to conduct investigations as they might have liked to have carried them out . However , irrespective of [ counsel for the applicants\u2019 ] submission , in reliance on the NORP cases , that security problems provide no excuse for a failure in the LAW investigative duty , we would conclude that , on the hypothesis stated , the investigations would still not pass muster . They were not independent ; they were CARDINAL - sided ; and the commanders concerned were not trying to do their best according to the dictates of LAW .", "CARDINAL . That is not to say , however , that , in other circumstances , we would ignore the strategic difficulties of the situation . The NORP cases are all concerned with deaths within ORG own territory . In that context , the ORG was entitled to be highly sceptical about the ORG \u2019s own professions of difficulties in an investigative path which it in any event may hardly have chosen to follow . It seems to us that this scepticism can not be so easily transplanted in the extraterritorial setting . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants appealed against ORG finding that their relatives did not fall within GPE jurisdiction . The Secretary of ORG also crossappealed against the finding in relation to the sixth applicant \u2019s son ; although he accepted before ORG that an NORP in the actual custody of NORP soldiers in a military detention centre in GPE was within GPE jurisdiction LAW , he contended that LAW had no extraterritorial effect and that the sixth applicant \u2019s claim was not , therefore , enforceable in the national courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeals and the cross - appeal ( [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) . Having reviewed the ORG \u2019s case - law on jurisdiction under LAW , PERSON LJ , who gave the leading judgment , held that a ORG could exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction when it applied control and authority over a complainant ( which he termed \u201c ORG agent authority \u201d , abbreviated to \u201c SAA \u201d ) and when it held effective control of an area outside its borders ( \u201c effective control of an area \u201d or \u201c ECA \u201d ) , observing as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . I would therefore be more cautious than ORG in my approach to the PERSON [ and Others ] judgment . It seems to me that it left open both the LAW and ORG approaches to extraterritorial jurisdiction , while at the same time emphasising ( in paragraph CARDINAL ) that because an ORG approach might constitute a violation of another ORG \u2019s sovereignty ( for example , when someone is kidnapped by the agents of a ORG on the territory of another ORG without that ORG \u2019s invitation or consent ) , this route to any recognition that extraterritorial jurisdiction has been exercised within the meaning of an international treaty should be approached with caution . \u201d", "He considered , inter alia , the cases of GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-IV ) ; PERSON v. GPE ( ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , ORG and Reports ( DATE , p. CARDINAL ) ; and PERSON v. GPE ( ( dec . ) , no . ORG decision of DATE , GPE CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL ) ; and observed that these cases had nothing to do with the principle of public international law relating to activities within aircraft registered with a ORG flying over the territory of another ORG . Instead , the findings of jurisdiction in these cases were examples of the \u201c ORG agent authority \u201d doctrine applying when someone was within the control and authority of agents of a ORG , even outside the FAC juridique of ORG , and whether or not the host ORG consented to the exercise of control and authority on its soil . Applying the relevant principles to the facts of the case , he concluded that the sixth applicant \u2019s son came within the control and authority of GPE , and therefore its jurisdiction , from the time he was arrested at the hotel . The relatives of the other claimants had not been under the control and authority of NORP troops at the time when they were killed , and were not therefore within GPE jurisdiction . He concluded in this connection that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... It is essential , in my judgment , to set rules which are readily intelligible . If troops deliberately and effectively restrict someone \u2019s liberty he is under their control . This did not happen in any of these CARDINAL cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He then examined whether , on the facts , it could be said that NORP troops were in effective control of GPE during the period in question , such as to fix GPE with jurisdiction under the \u201c effective control of an area \u201d doctrine . On this point , PERSON concluded as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . GPE was in the [ Coalition Provisional Authority ] regional area called \u2018 CPA South\u2019 . During the period of military occupation there was a significant degree of NORP responsibility and authority in CPA LOC , although its staff were drawn from CARDINAL different countries and until DATE the regional coordinator was a ORG . Indeed , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL governorate teams in CPA LOC was headed by a NORP coordinator . However , although the chain of command for the NORP military presence in GPE led ultimately to a GPE general , ORG and ORG provinces were an area of direct NORP military responsibility . As I have already said ... , the Secretary of ORG accepts that the GPE was an ORG within the meaning of LAW ... , at least in those areas of southern GPE , and particularly GPE , where NORP troops exercised sufficient authority for this purpose .", "CARDINAL . But whatever may have been the position under LAW , the question this court has to address is whether NORP troops were in effective control of GPE for ORG purposes . The situation in DATE contrasts starkly with the situations in northern GPE and in the NORP - occupied part of GPE which feature in GPE case - law . In each of those cases part of the territory of a ORG was occupied by another Contracting State which had every intention of exercising its control on a long - term basis . The civilian administration of those territories was under the control of GPE , and it deployed sufficient troops to ensure that its control of the area was effective .", "CARDINAL . [ The statement of Brigadier PERSON , whose command included the NORP forces in the GPE area DATE ] tells a very different story . He was not provided with nearly enough troops and other resources to enable his brigade to exercise effective control of GPE . ... [ PERSON described how the local police would not uphold the law . If NORP troops arrested somebody and gave them to the NORP police , the police would hand them over to the judiciary , who were themselves intimidated by the local tribes , and the suspected criminals were back on the streets within DATE or CARDINAL . This state of affairs gave the NORP no confidence in the local criminal justice system . It also diluted their credibility with local people . Although NORP troops arranged local protection for the judges , this made little difference . The prisons , for their part , were barely functioning .", "CARDINAL . NORP After describing other aspects of the highly volatile situation in which a relatively small number of NORP military personnel were trying to police a large city as best they could , Brig[adier ] PERSON said ... :", "\u2018 The combination of terrorist activity , the volatile situation and the ineffectiveness of NORP security forces meant that the security situation remained on a knife - edge for much of our tour . Despite our high work rate and best efforts , I felt that at DATE we were standing on the edge of an abyss . It was only when subsequent reinforcements arrived ... and we started to receive intelligence from some of the NORP parties that I started to regain the initiative.\u2019", "CARDINAL . Unlike the NORP army in northern GPE , the NORP military forces had no control over the civil administration of GPE . ...", "CARDINAL . In my judgment it is quite impossible to hold that the GPE , although an Occupying Power for the purposes of LAW and [ the ] LAW ] , was in effective control of GPE for the purposes of [ ORG ] jurisprudence at the material time . If it had been , it would have been obliged , pursuant to the PERSON [ and Others ] judgment , to secure to everyone in GPE the rights and freedoms guaranteed by LAW ] . CARDINAL only has to state that proposition to see how utterly unreal it is . The GPE possessed no executive , legislative or judicial authority in GPE , other than the limited authority given to its military forces , and as an Occupying Power it was bound to respect the laws in force in GPE unless absolutely prevented ( see LAW ... ) . It could not be equated with a civil power : it was simply there to maintain security , and to support the civil administration in GPE in a number of different ways ... \u201d", "PERSON observed , in connection with this issue :", "\u201c CARDINAL . On the CARDINAL hand , it sits ill in the mouth of a ORG which has helped to displace and dismantle by force another nation \u2019s civil authority to plead that , as an ORG , it has so little control that it can not be responsible for securing the population \u2019s basic rights . ... [ However , ] the fact is that it can not : the invasion brought in its wake a vacuum of civil authority which NORP forces were and still are unable to fill . On the evidence before the ORG they were , DATE , holding a fragile line against anarchy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal unanimously concluded that , save for the death of the sixth applicant \u2019s son , which fell within the \u201c ORG agent authority \u201d exception , GPE did not have jurisdiction LAW . It decided that the sixth applicant \u2019s claim also fell within the scope of LAW DATE . Since ORG examination of the case , additional information had emerged about the investigation into the death of the sixth applicant \u2019s son , including that courtmartial proceedings were pending against a number of soldiers . ORG therefore remitted the question whether there had been an adequate investigation to ORG for reconsideration following the completion of the court - martial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Despite his conclusion on jurisdiction , PERSON , at the express invitation of the Government , commented on the adequacy of the investigations carried out into the deaths , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . After all , the first CARDINAL ORG of the [ Convention ] merely articulate the contemporary concern of the entire NORP community about the importance that must always be attached to every human life . ... Needless to say , the obligation to comply with these well - established international human rights standards would require , among other things , a far greater investment in the resources available to ORG than was available to them in GPE , and a complete severance of their investigations from the military chain of command .", "CARDINAL . NORP In other words , if international standards are to be observed , the task of investigating incidents in which a human life is taken by NORP forces must be completely taken away from the military chain of command and vested in the [ ORG ] . It contains the requisite independence so long as it is free to decide for itself when to start and when to cease an investigation , and so long as it reports in the first instance to the [ ORG Prosecuting ORG ] and not to the military chain of command . It must then conduct an effective investigation , and it will be helped in this regard by the passages from [ ORG ] case - law I have quoted . Many of the deficiencies highlighted by the evidence in this case will be remedied if the [ ORG ] perform this role , and if they are also properly trained and properly resourced to conduct their investigations with the requisite degree of thoroughness . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants appealed and the Secretary of ORG crossappealed to ORG , which gave judgment on DATE ( [ DATE ] UKHL CARDINAL ) . The majority of ORG ( Lord PERSON of PERSON , ORG of GPE , Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON of ORG - under - Heywood ) held that the general purpose of LAW DATE was to provide a remedial structure in domestic law for the rights guaranteed by the Convention , and that LAW should therefore be interpreted as applying wherever GPE had jurisdiction LAW . Lord PERSON of NORP , dissenting , held that LAW had no extraterritorial application .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the first CARDINAL ORG complaints , the majority of ORG found that GPE did not have jurisdiction over the deaths . Because of his opinion that LAW had no extraterritorial application , Lord PERSON did not consider it useful to express a view as to whether GPE exercised jurisdiction within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , with whom the majority agreed , began by observing that ultimately the decision about how LAW should be interpreted and applied was for ORG , since the duty of the national court was only to keep pace with the ORG \u2019s case - law ; there was a danger in a national court construing the ORG too generously in favour of an applicant , since the respondent ORG had no means of referring such a case to the ORG . Lord PERSON took as his starting - point the decision of FAC in GPE and Others ( cited above ) , which he described as \u201c a watershed authority in the light of which the GPE jurisprudence as a whole has to be re - evaluated \u201d . He considered that the following propositions could be derived from the decision in GPE and Others ( paragraph CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL reflects an \u2018 essentially territorial notion of GPE ( a phrase repeated several times in the ORG \u2019s judgment ) , \u2018 other bases of jurisdiction being exceptional and requiring special justification in the particular circumstances of each ORG ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The ORG operates , subject to LAW , \u2018 in an essentially regional context and notably in the legal space ( espace juridique ) of the Contracting PERSON ( \u00a7 DATE ) ( i.e. within the area of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recognises Article CARDINAL jurisdiction to avoid a \u2018 vacuum in human rights\u2019 protection\u2019 when the territory \u2018 would normally be covered by the Convention\u2019 ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ( i.e. in a ORG country ) where otherwise ( as in northern GPE ) the inhabitants \u2018 would have found themselves excluded from the benefits of the LAW safeguards and system which they had previously ORG ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The rights and freedoms defined in the LAW can not be \u2018 divided and LOC ( \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The circumstances in which the ORG has exceptionally recognised the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction by a ORG include :", "( i ) Where the ORG \u2018 through the effective control of the relevant territory and its inhabitants abroad as a consequence of military occupation or through the consent , invitation or acquiescence of the government of that territory , exercises all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by [ the government of that territory]\u2019 ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ( i.e. when otherwise there would be a vacuum within a ORG country , the government of that country itself being unable \u2018 to fulfil the obligations it had undertaken under the Convention\u2019 ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ( as in northern GPE ) ) .", "( ii ) \u2019[C]ases involving the activities of its diplomatic or consular agents abroad and on board craft and vessels registered in , or flying the flag of , that ORG [ where ] customary international law and treaty provisions have recognised the extraterritorial exercise of GPE ( \u00a7 DATE ) .", "( iii ) Certain other cases where a ORG \u2019s responsibility \u2018 could , in principle , be engaged because of acts ... which produced effects or were performed outside their own DATE ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . PERSON [ and PERSON ] v. GPE [ and GPE ] ( [ DATE [ , Series A no . CARDINAL ] ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL ( at \u00a7 CARDINAL ) is the only authority specifically referred to in GPE [ and Others ] as exemplifying this class of exception to the general rule . PERSON [ and Janousek ] , however , contemplated no more than that , if a NORP judge exercised jurisdiction extraterritorially in GPE in his capacity as a NORP judge , then anyone complaining of a violation of his Convention rights by that judge would be regarded as being within GPE \u2019s jurisdiction .", "( iv ) The PERSON v. [ the ] GPE ( [ DATE [ , Series A no . CARDINAL ] ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL line of cases , the ORG pointed out , involves action by the ORG whilst the person concerned is \u2018 on its territory , clearly within its GPE ( [ Bankovi\u0107 and Others , ] \u00a7 DATE ) and not , therefore , the exercise of the ORG \u2019s jurisdiction abroad . \u201d", "Lord PERSON referred to the \u00d6calan , PERSON and PERSON line of cases ( cited above ) , in each of which the applicant was forcibly removed from a country outside ORG , with the full cooperation of the foreign authorities , to stand trial in the respondent ORG . He observed that this line of cases concerning \u201c irregular extraditions \u201d constituted CARDINAL category of \u201c exceptional \u201d cases expressly contemplated by PERSON and Others ( cited above ) , as having \u201c special justification \u201d for extraterritorial jurisdiction under LAW . He did not consider that the first CARDINAL ORG cases fell into any of the exceptions to the territorial principle so far recognised by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON next considered the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) , on which the applicants relied , and held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If and in so far as PERSON [ and Others ] is said to support the altogether wider notions of LAW contended for by the appellants on this appeal , I can not accept it . In the first place , the statements relied upon must be regarded as obiter dicta . Secondly , as just explained , such wider assertions of jurisdiction are not supported by the authorities cited ( at any rate , those authorities accepted as relevant by ORG in GPE [ and Others ] ) . Thirdly , such wider view of jurisdiction would clearly be inconsistent both with the reasoning in PERSON [ and Others ] and , indeed , with its result . Either it would extend the \u2018 effective control\u2019 principle beyond ORG ( where alone it had previously been applied , as has been seen , to northern GPE , to GPE in GPE and to GPE ) to GPE , an area ( like the FRY [ GPE ] considered in PERSON [ and Others ] ) outside ORG and , indeed , would do so contrary to the inescapable logic of the ORG \u2019s case - law on LAW . Alternatively it would stretch to breaking point the concept of jurisdiction extending extraterritorially to those subject to a ORG \u2019s \u2018 authority and control\u2019 . It is CARDINAL thing to recognise as exceptional the specific narrow categories of cases I have sought to summarise above ; it would be quite another to accept that whenever a ORG acts ( militarily or otherwise ) through its agents abroad , those affected by such activities fall within its LAW . Such a contention would prove altogether too much . It would make a nonsense of much that was said in PERSON [ and Others ] , not least as to the Convention being \u2018 a constitutional instrument of NORP public ORG , operating \u2018 in an essentially regional ORG , \u2018 not designed to be applied throughout the world , even in respect of the conduct of Contracting PERSON ( \u00a7 DATE ) . It would , indeed , make redundant the principle of \u2018 effective control\u2019 of an area : what need for that if jurisdiction arises in any event under a general principle of \u2018 authority and control\u2019 irrespective of whether the area is ( a ) effectively controlled or ( b ) within ORG ?", "CARDINAL . There is CARDINAL other central objection to the creation of the wide basis of jurisdiction here contended for by the appellants under the rubric \u2018 control and authority\u2019 , going beyond that arising in any of the narrowly recognised categories already discussed and yet short of that arising from the effective control of territory within ORG . PERSON [ and Others ] ( and later PERSON [ v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALII ] ) stands , as stated , for the indivisible nature of LAW : it can not be \u2018 divided and NORP . As PERSON [ and Others ] had earlier pointed out ( at \u00a7 DATE ) \u2018 the applicant \u2019s interpretation of jurisdiction would invert and divide the positive obligation on Contracting States to secure the substantive rights in a manner never contemplated by LAW . When , moreover , the Convention applies , it operates as \u2018 a living instrument\u2019 . ORG provides an example of this , a recognition that the interpretation of LAW has been modified consequent on \u2018 the territories encompassed by the member ORG [ having ] become a zone free of capital punishment\u2019 ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . ( Paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of PERSON [ and Others ] , I may note , contrast on the one hand \u2018 the Convention \u2019s substantive provisions\u2019 and \u2018 the competence of the Convention organs\u2019 , to both of which the \u2018 living instrument\u2019 approach applies and , on the other hand , the scope of LAW \u2018 the scope and reach of the entire Convention\u2019 DATE to which it does not . ) Bear in mind too the rigour with which the ORG applies the Convention , well exemplified by the series of cases from the conflict zone of south - eastern GPE in which , the ORG \u2019s difficulties notwithstanding , no dilution has been permitted of the investigative obligations arising under LAW and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP The point is this : except where a ORG really does have effective control of territory , it can not hope to secure Convention rights within that territory and , unless it is within the area of ORG , it is unlikely in any event to find certain of the Convention rights it is bound to secure reconcilable with the customs of the resident population . Indeed it goes further than that . During the period in question here it is common ground that the GPE was an ORG in southern GPE and bound as such by [ the ] LAW ] and by LAW . LAW provides that the occupant \u2018 shall take all the measures in his power to restore , and ensure , as far as possible , public order and safety , while respecting , unless absolutely prevented , the laws in force in the ORG . The appellants argue that occupation within the meaning of LAW necessarily involves the occupant having effective control of the area and so being responsible for securing there all Convention rights and freedoms . So far as this being the case , however , the occupants\u2019 obligation is to respect \u2018 the laws in force\u2019 , not to introduce laws and the means to enforce them ( for example , courts and a justice system ) such as to satisfy the requirements of the Convention . Often ( for example where LAW law is in force ) Convention rights would clearly be incompatible with the laws of the territory occupied . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) , with whom ORG agreed , and Lord PERSON ( paragraph CARDINAL ) expressly held that GPE was not in effective control of GPE and the surrounding area for purposes of jurisdiction under LAW at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG accepted that the facts of the sixth applicant \u2019s case fell within GPE jurisdiction LAW . The parties therefore agreed that if ( as the majority held ) the jurisdictional scope of LAW was the same as that of the Convention , the sixth applicant \u2019s case should be remitted to ORG , as ORG had ordered . In consequence , it was unnecessary for ORG to examine the jurisdictional issue in relation to the death of the sixth applicant \u2019s son .

GPE took the position that \u2018 the LAW and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied LOC ...", "ORG , in its concluding observations after examination of the report , expressed concern at GPE \u2019s attitude and pointed \u2018 to the long - standing presence of GPE in [ the occupied ] territories , GPE \u2019s ambiguous attitude towards their future status , as well as the exercise of effective jurisdiction by NORP security forces therein\u2019 ... In DATE in face of GPE \u2019s consistent position , to the effect that \u2018 the LAW does not apply beyond its own territory , notably in the GPE and GPE ... \u2019 , the ORG reached the following conclusion :", "\u2018 in the current circumstances , the provisions of the LAW apply to the benefit of the population of the occupied territories , for all conduct by ORG authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the LAW and fall within the ambit of ORG responsibility of GPE under the principles of public international law\u2019 ...", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the ORG considers that LAW is applicable in respect of acts done by a ORG in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory . \u201d", "In addition , ORG appeared to assume that , even in respect of extraterritorial acts , it would in principle be possible for a ORG to derogate from its obligations under LAW , LAW of which provides :", "\u201c In time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed , GPE Parties to LAW may take measures derogating from their obligations under LAW to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation , provided that such measures are not inconsistent with their other obligations under international law and do not involve discrimination solely on the ground of race , colour , sex , language , religion or social origin . \u201d", "Thus , in paragraph CARDINAL of its ORG , having considered whether the acts in question were justified under international humanitarian law on grounds of military exigency , ORG held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG would further observe that some human rights conventions , and in particular LAW , contain provisions which GPE Parties may invoke in order to derogate , under various conditions , from certain of their conventional obligations . In this respect , the ORG would however recall that the communication notified by GPE to the Secretary - General of ORG under DATE of LAW concerns only LAW , relating to the right to freedom and security of person ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; GPE is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment ORG on the Territory of the GPE ( Democratic Republic of the GPE ( ORG ) v. GPE ) of DATE , ORG considered whether , during the relevant period , GPE was an \u201c Occupying Power \u201d of any part of the territory of GPE , within the meaning of customary international law , as reflected in LAW ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL of the judgment ) . ORG found that NORP forces were stationed in the province of GPE and exercised authority there , in the sense that they had substituted their own authority for that of the NORP government ( \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . ORG continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG thus concludes that GPE was the Occupying Power in GPE at the relevant time . As such it was under an obligation , according to LAW , to take all the measures in its power to restore , and ensure , as far as possible , public order and safety in the occupied area , while respecting , unless absolutely prevented , the laws in force in the ORG . This obligation comprised the duty to secure respect for the applicable rules of international human rights law and international humanitarian law , to protect the inhabitants of the occupied territory against acts of violence , and not to tolerate such violence by any third party .", "CARDINAL . The ORG , having concluded that GPE was an ORG in GPE at the relevant time , finds that GPE \u2019s responsibility is engaged both for any acts of its military that violated its international obligations and for any lack of vigilance in preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by other actors present in the occupied territory , including rebel groups acting on their own account .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that GPE at all times has responsibility for all actions and omissions of its own military forces in the territory of the ORG in breach of its obligations under the rules of international human rights law and international humanitarian law which are relevant and applicable in the specific situation . \u201d", "ORG established the facts relating to the serious breaches of human rights allegedly attributable to GPE , in the occupied GPE region and elsewhere ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . In order to determine whether the conduct in question constituted a breach of GPE \u2019s international obligations , ORG recalled its finding in the above - cited LAW Wall in LOC that both international humanitarian law and international human rights law would have to be taken into consideration and that international human rights instruments were capable of having an extraterritorial application , \u201c particularly in occupied territories \u201d ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . ORG next determined which were \u201c the applicable rules of international human rights law and international humanitarian law \u201d , by listing the international humanitarian and international human rights treaties to which both GPE and GPE were party , together with the relevant principles of customary international law ( \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

Armed conflict and occupation do not discharge the ORG \u2019s duty to investigate and prosecute human rights abuses . The right to life is non - derogable regardless of circumstance . This prohibits any practice of not investigating alleged violations during armed conflict or occupation . As ORG has held , \u2018 It is inherent in the protection of rights explicitly recognised as non - derogable ... that they must be secured by procedural guarantees ... The provisions of the [ LAW ] relating to procedural safeguards may never be made subject to measures that would circumvent the protection of non - derogable rights\u2019 . It is undeniable that during armed conflicts circumstances will sometimes impede investigation . Such circumstances will never discharge the obligation to investigate \u2013 this would eviscerate the non - derogable character of the right to life \u2013 but they may affect the modalities or particulars of the investigation . In addition to being fully responsible for the conduct of their agents , in relation to the acts of private actors GPE are also held to a standard of due diligence in armed conflicts as well as peace . On a case - by - case basis a ORG might utilise less effective measures of investigation in response to concrete constraints . For example , when hostile forces control the scene of a shooting , conducting an autopsy may prove impossible . Regardless of the circumstances , however , investigations must always be conducted as effectively as possible and never be reduced to mere formality . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment in the Case of the \u201c FAC \u201d v.

In this regard , the ORG recognises the difficult circumstances of GPE , where its population and its institutions strive to attain peace . However , the country \u2019s conditions , no matter how difficult , do not release a ORG to ORG of its obligations set forth in this treaty , which specifically continue in cases such as the instant CARDINAL . ORG has argued that when the ORG conducts or tolerates actions leading to extra - legal executions , not investigating them adequately and not punishing those responsible , as appropriate , it breaches the duties to respect rights set forth in the LAW and to ensure their free and full exercise , both by the alleged victim and by his or her next of kin , it does not allow society to learn what happened , and it reproduces the conditions of impunity for this type of facts to happen once again . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
