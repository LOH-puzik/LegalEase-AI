De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE , he was employed by a private company ( \u201c the employer \u201d ) as an engineer in charge of sales . At his employer \u2019s request , he created a PERSON account for the purpose of responding to clients\u2019 enquiries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the employer informed the applicant that his ORG communications had been monitored from DATE and that the records showed that he had used the Internet for personal purposes , contrary to internal regulations . The applicant replied in writing that he had only used PERSON for professional purposes . When presented with a CARDINAL - page transcript of his communications on PERSON , the applicant notified his employer that , by violating his correspondence , they were accountable under LAW . The fortyfive pages contained transcripts of all the messages that the applicant had exchanged with his fianc\u00e9e and his brother during the period when his communications had been monitored ; they related to personal matters involving the applicant . The transcript also contained CARDINAL short messages that the applicant had exchanged with his fianc\u00e9e on DATE using a personal PERSON account ; these messages did not disclose any intimate information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the employer terminated the applicant \u2019s employment contract for breach of the company \u2019s internal regulations which stated , inter alia :", "\u201c It is strictly forbidden to disturb order and discipline within the company \u2019s LOC and especially ... to use computers , photocopiers , telephones , telex and fax machines for personal purposes . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged his employer \u2019s decision before ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . He complained that this decision had been null and void since , by accessing his communications , his employer had violated his right to correspondence protected by LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed his complaint on the grounds that the employer had complied with the dismissal proceedings provided for by LAW and noted that the applicant had been duly informed of the employer \u2019s regulations that prohibited the use of company resources for personal purposes . ORG judgment reads , in its relevant parts :", "\u201c The court takes the view that the monitoring of the [ applicant ] \u2019s PERSON communications from the company \u2019s computer ... during working DATE regardless of whether the employer \u2019s actions were or were not illegal ( \u00eembrac\u0103 sau nu forma ilicitului penal ) \u2013 can not affect the validity of the disciplinary proceedings in the instant case ...", "However , since the [ applicant ] claimed during the disciplinary proceedings that he had not used PERSON for personal purposes but rather for advising clients on the products offered by his employer , the court finds that checking the content of the [ applicant ] \u2019s communications was the only method for the employer to verify the [ applicant ] \u2019s line of defence .", "The employer \u2019s right to monitor their employees\u2019 use of the company \u2019s computers in the workplace falls within the broad scope of the right to check the manner in which professional tasks are complete .", "As long as the employees\u2019 attention ... had been drawn to the fact that , not long before the applicant had received a disciplinary sanction , another colleague had been dismissed for having used the Internet , the telephone and the photocopiers for personal purposes and they had been warned that their activity was under surveillance ( see notice no CARDINAL of DATE that the applicant had signed ... ) it can not be held against the employer that he had not proven transparency and that he had not been open with regard to his activities in monitoring the use of the computers by its employees .", "The Internet in the workplace must remain a tool at the employee \u2019s disposal . It was granted by the employer for professional use and it is indisputable that the employer , by virtue of the right to monitor the employees\u2019 activities , has the prerogative to keep personal use of the Internet monitored .", "Some of the reasons that make the employer \u2019s checks necessary are the possibilities that through use of the Internet employees could damage the company \u2019s IT systems , or engage in illicit activities in the company \u2019s name , or reveal the company \u2019s commercial secrets . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this judgment . He claimed that emails were also protected by LAW as pertaining to \u201c private life \u201d and \u201c correspondence \u201d . He also complained that ORG had not allowed him to call witnesses to prove that the employer had not suffered as a result of his actions .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a final decision of DATE , ORG ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) dismissed his appeal and upheld the judgment rendered by ORG . Relying on ORG Directive PERSON , ORG ruled that the employer \u2019s conduct had been reasonable and that the monitoring of the applicant \u2019s communications had been the only method of establishing if there had been a disciplinary breach . With regard to his procedural rights , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s arguments , stating that the evidence already before it was sufficient . ORG decision reads , in its relevant parts :", "\u201c In view of the fact that the employer has the right and the obligation to ensure the functioning of the company and , to this end , [ the right ] to check the manner in which its employees complete their professional tasks , and of the fact that [ the employer ] holds the disciplinary power of which it can legitimately dispose and which [ entitled it ] to monitor and to transcribe the communications on PERSON that the employee denied having had for personal purposes , after having been , together with his other colleagues , warned against using the company \u2019s resources for personal purposes , it can not be held that the violation of his correspondence ( violarea secretului coresponden\u0163ei ) was not the only manner to achieve this legitimate aim and that the proper balance between the need to protect his private life and the right of the employer to supervise the functioning of its business was not struck . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
