However , given the fact that PERSON had died on DATE , that the impugned decision had been issued on DATE and that , as confirmed by the neighbours , the applicant had lived in the flat after PERSON 's death and had renovated it , it was evident that on the date of the issuance of the decision he had been a resident of the flat .

He alleged that he had permanently lived in ORG 's flat at J. street , whereas in GPE 's flat he had only been registered as a permanent resident .", "CARDINAL . The findings of law read , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW a person can take over a tenancy if he or she has fulfilled jointly the CARDINAL following conditions : ( CARDINAL ) was in a close relationship with the late tenant by blood relations , adoption or de facto marital cohabitation ; ( CARDINAL ) resided permanently with the tenant until his or her death ; ( CARDINAL ) had not relinquished this right to the landlord and ( CARDINAL ) upon the death of the tenant had no title to another flat .", "The applicant stated that he had lived in de facto marital cohabitation with T.B. This should be assessed in the light of the situation as it obtained upon the latter 's death .", "The major features of a de facto marital relationship ( konkubinat ) are its dissolvability and lack of legal consequences following its dissolution \u2013 as it is a purely de facto union . For a relationship to be considered a de facto marital relationship there must be emotional , physical and also economic bonds between the partners .", "Yet it emerges from the applicant 's testimony that the economic bond between the partners broke DATE before GPE 's death , when they stopped running a common household . In consequence , their relationship no longer fulfilled the conditions for a de facto marital relationship .", "However , even assuming that all the above - mentioned requirements for a de facto marital relationship existed , the applicant 's and T.B. 's cohabitation could not be regarded as such . Indeed , a de facto marital relationship is a not legalised substitute for a marriage . Pursuant to NORP law , LAW , a marriage can be contracted only between a woman and a man . Consequently , [ the law ] recognises only de facto relationships of different - sex persons .", "That being said , the applicant does not belong to the group of entitled persons referred to in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . All of the above - mentioned CARDINAL requirements of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) must be fulfilled jointly ; non - fulfilment of even CARDINAL of them makes it redundant to examine compliance with the remaining ones . It should be added in passing that , given the applicant 's attempts to succeed to the tenancy of [ another ] flat , his permanent residence in the flat [ in question ] upon the death of the statutory tenant is open to doubt .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( S\u0105d ORG ) , seeking to have the impugned judgment quashed and the case remitted or , alternatively , to have the judgment altered and his claim granted in its entirety . He asked ORG to hear supplementary evidence from him , in order to establish the actual duration of his relationship with T.B. Furthermore , relying on LAW ( ORG post\u0119powania cywilnego ) , he asked the court to refer to ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) the following legal question :", "\u201c Does the term \u201c a person who has lived with a tenant in de facto marital cohabitation \u201d used in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act also concern a person who has lived in a homosexual cohabitation with a tenant , or only a person living in a heterosexual cohabitation ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . Alternatively , the applicant asked the court to refer , under section CARDINAL of the law of CARDINAL DATE on ORG ( ustawa o ORG ) ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , to ORG the following legal question :", "\u201c Is the term \u201c a person who has lived with a tenant in de facto marital cohabitation \u201d referred to in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW if interpreted as including only de facto marital cohabitation of a woman and a man \u2013 compatible with Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and LAW ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the principal grounds for the appeal , the applicant argued that ORG had failed to establish the facts of the case properly , in particular because it had concluded that he and PERSON had stopped running their common household DATE before the latter 's death solely on the basis of his incomplete testimony and had refused to admit evidence from the witnesses proposed by him in order to clarify the circumstances of the case . He also alleged a breach of the substantive civil law consisting in an erroneous interpretation of the term \u201c a person who ha[d ] lived with a tenant in de facto marital cohabitation \u201d as relating solely to cohabitation of a man and a woman .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard , and dismissed the appeal . It considered that the lower court had correctly held that the applicant had failed to meet the requirements laid down in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Law . The reasoning , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c In the case under consideration the applicant derived his entitlement to succession of the tenancy from his stable homosexual relationship with the tenant .", "For this reason , the determination of the scope of the term \u201c a person who has lived with a tenant in de facto marital cohabitation \u201d was of crucial importance for the determination of the claim .", "In contrast to what has been argued in the appeal , ORG correctly interpreted the above - mentioned term . This court shares the opinion stated in the reasoning of the impugned judgment that the legal regulation in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act concerns persons remaining in a de facto marital relationship , i.e. an actual relationship of different sex persons with stable physical , emotional and economic ties , imitating a marriage .", "The appellant is not right in saying that the scope of the above - mentioned provision encompasses also homosexual relationships . According to an opinion commonly accepted in our legal writing and case - law ... , de facto marital cohabitation takes place only if a woman and a man cohabit together .", "It must be stressed that a de facto marital relationship differs from a marriage only by lack of its legitimisation . For this reason , the subjects actually remaining in marital cohabitation can only be persons who , under NORP law , are eligible for marriage . Pursuant to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG , the fundamental principle of the family in GPE is the difference in sex of a prospective nuptial couple ( nupturienci ) , which means that contracting a marriage between persons of the same sex is inadmissible . Having regard to the fact that de facto cohabitation constitutes a substitute for a marriage , one must consider that its subjects can exclusively be a woman and a man .", "While the appellant is right in saying that in the NORP legal writing the concept of de facto marital cohabitation also encompasses homosexual relationships ... , according to the general construction rules , legal concepts should be given the meaning that they have in our legal system . NORP law does not recognise relationships of same - sex persons . For this reason , where a legal provision ( in this case section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act ) entails legal consequences on account of remaining in a de facto marital relationship , it does not concern partners having homosexual relations , even if they have stable emotional , physical and economic ties .", "Contrary to what is being argued in the appeal , the above legal solution does not infringe the constitutional principle of equality before the law , which does not have an absolute character and exceptions to which may be justified by the need to protect other rights . Indeed , LAW ... clearly states that \u201c marriage , being a union of a man and a woman , as well as the family ... shall be placed under the protection and care of GPE \u201d .", "The above - mentioned provision creates the constitutional principle of the protection for the family founded on a union of a woman and a man . Provisions of the international treaties ratified by GPE , i.e. LAW ... , which ensure legal protection only in respect of heterosexual relations , correspond to the regulations in the NORP legal system .", "In conclusion , ORG rightly held that the applicant did not belong to the group of persons entitled to succeed to a tenancy referred to in DATE the CARDINAL LAW . In the circumstances , it was unnecessary to take evidence in order to establish whether the applicant had indeed remained in cohabitation with the tenant and whether other conditions for succession to the tenancy had been satisfied . For this reason , the arguments [ concerning the refusal to take evidence from witnesses and the alleged errors of fact ] are unfounded .", "...", "In view of the foregoing , the appeal should be dismissed .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . A cassation appeal to ORG was not available in this case .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act read :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

In that judgment ORG dealt with a legal question submitted by ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) in connection with pending proceedings for succession to a tenancy .

The applicants maintained , among other things , that the impugned section was in breach of the aforementioned provisions because it excluded from succession to a tenancy descendants of the late tenant 's siblings as well as all other heirs who had title to another residential dwelling which , as a result , restricted their succession rights in a discriminatory manner .", "CARDINAL .
