DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Snejana Botoucharova", "TEXT": ["The applicants are a married couple , born in DATE and DATE , respectively , and their daughter , C , born on DATE . They live in GPE . They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant parents suffer from arrested development . Intellectually they have been placed in the category of severely mentally retarded pesons and their disorders have been assessed to be congenital . Since their childhood they have been in close contact with the social and health authorities . The applicant parents have cohabited since DATE .", "On DATE the applicant GPE first child , M , was born . On the social authorities\u2019 initiative , DATE after the birth the applicant parents and M moved into a family observation institution ( ORG ) , with staff consisting of social workers , psychologists and social education workers , which was to support the applicant parents and assess the extent to which they possessed potential in the parenting role . The institution submitted its report on DATE .", "As to the applicant mother , the report stated , inter alia , that her attention could only be maintained for short intervals and with massive support . She was generally preoccupied with talking about her physical ailments to the extent that it took most of her energy . When faced with demands , for example if M started to cry or became restless , the mother became anxious and could seem panicstricken . She was not able to recognise her own problems and need for support and she had great difficulty in establishing contact with M.", "As regards the applicant father , notably during the beginning of his stay at the institution , he often made verbal threats against the staff and the other families at the institution . He had violent nightmares during which he would cry out loudly and pull out his tongue . Moreover , his night sleep was broken by long hot showers for TIME , during which he would talk or shout to himself . Consequently , he would often be exhausted during the day and sleep most of the time . He had no structure to his day and showed no signs of being able to handle DATE routines . He had no understanding or recognition of his need for help and support in the parental role . He had trouble realising the consequences of his actions , and was not capable of protecting their baby M from physical harm ( for example , he left M alone on the changing table although the danger of doing so had been explained to him frequently ) .", "With regard to the GPE care skills , the report stated that both parents had extreme difficulty in establishing contact with M , and they often asked the staff to take over when they became impatient with her . None of the parents handled M particularly gently and their movements sometimes seemed uncoordinated . Mostly , they forgot to hold the baby \u2019s head . They would not let M sleep and were in general not capable of recognising and understanding her needs . The report also stated that due to the GPE inability to concentrate , M \u2019s attempts to make contact with the parents were usually rejected or not answered . Thus , M eventually gave up contact and looked away from the parents when being with them .", "The conclusion read as follows :", "\u201c The parents appear as a very emotional damaged couple who , because of their own disadvantaged upbringing , find it extremely difficult to master the task of parenting . The staff have no doubt that both parents have done their best in a spirit of love for their child , but their personality structure and their non - existing inner picture of the parent role prevent them from developing sufficient parenting functions . Moreover , their lack of mental resources is a further hindrance to the task of their developing parenting potential .", "Despite intervention at various levels , the basic symbiotic mother - child dyad has not developed .", "For the mother \u2019s parental skills , this lack of bonding means that she is unable to see and understand the child \u2019s signals , nor is she able to adapt to the child \u2019s needs , which is crucial for the child \u2019s attachment ability and emotional development .", "We have examined whether the father has the resources to take over this process , but the examination showed that he does not master this either .", "Their lack of timing and the resulting unintended abuse create unpredictability and chaos in the child \u2019s world and will be a risk factor in her development ,", "Moreover , both parents lack the fundamental ability to structure their everyday lives , for the child as well as for themselves . In particular , their serious problems managing their finances permeate their entire everyday lives .", "Their - as we see it - very resource - poor network means that the father , mother and child can not expect adequate support . Mother and father tell us themselves that they have no friends who can give them special support . Our observations have also shown that their ability to create relations is virtually non - existent . \u201d", "On DATE M was taken into public care without the GPE consent . Since DATE she has lived with a foster family . A relief foster family was also provided for her , to take over during holidays etc . The applicant parents were granted regular access , which was to take place under surveillance . Since DATE access has taken place in the presence of the foster family .", "The applicant GPE second child , C , was born on DATE .", "Beforehand , at a meeting held on DATE , the applicant parents were informed by a social worker at the Municipality ( ORG ) that the latter would not recommend that the family be placed in a family institution when the child was born . The decision was based on the report of CARDINAL DATE and reports on the applicant GPE access to NORP In addition , the decision was based on CARDINAL statements of DATE by a neuropsychologist , who in DATE had examined each of the applicant parents at the request of the social and health authorities in connection with the granting of social benefits ( f\u00f8rtidspension ) . With regard to the applicant father the statement concluded :", "\u201c The findings of the neuropsychological examination show a DATE man , whose intelligence is probably far below average and whose current intellectual and memory functions correspond to this level , thus presently placing him in the severely mentally retarded category . On review of the individual neuropsychological functions as well as the intellectual and memory functions , a number of heavy disorders appear , manifested in a more diffuse affection of cortical brain areas , most pronounced in the frontoparietal brain areas of the left hemisphere . The disorders are assessed to be congenital . As regards an assessment of future job possibilities , I believe the chances of his being placed in the labour market under normal conditions to be non - existent , and that he has no real capacity for working in any kind of occupation , not even in sheltered surroundings . \u201d", "With regard to the applicant mother the statement concluded :", "\u201c The findings of the neuropsychological examination show a DATE woman whose intelligence is probably far below average and whose current intellectual and memory functions correspond to this level , thus presently placing her in the severely mentally retarded category . On review of the individual neuropsychological functions as well as the intellectual and memory functions , a number of disorders appear , manifested in a more diffuse affection of cortical brain areas , most pronounced in the frontoparietal brain areas of the right hemisphere . The disorders are assessed to be congenital . \u201d", "On DATE the Municipality received written information from an acquaintance of the applicant parents that the latter planned to run away from the hospital with the baby when it had been born .", "On DATE , a family care consultant also informed the GPE that the applicant father had told her that with the help of others he had planned to run away with the baby within TIME after its birth .", "By decision of CARDINAL DATE the GPE refused the applicant GPE request that they and their newborn pursuant to LAW ) of ORG ( ORG ) be placed at a family institution observation home or that mother and child be placed together with a foster family . At the same time the applicant parents were also informed that the LOC intended to take the newborn into public care . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE C was born and DATE the Chairman of ORG ( B\u00f8rne- og Ungeudvalget ) under the Municipality decided provisionally , pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of GPE , to take C into public care without the consent of the applicant parents . The decision gave the police the authority to prevent the applicant parents from leaving the hospital with C , but the parents had unlimited access to their baby during the stay at the hospital .", "According to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of GPE , the preliminary decision was approved by the entire Children and Young Persons Committee at a meeting on DATE , during which the applicant GPE lawyer was present . The decision was based on the report of DATE , the CARDINAL statements of DATE and the information submitted about the ORG intention to run away with the newborn baby .", "The decision was implemented DATE in connection with the applicant mother \u2019s discharge from the hospital . At the wish of the applicant parents , C was placed with M \u2019s relief foster family , which allowed the children to see each other on a regular basis .", "During a meeting on DATE , at which the applicant parents , represented by their lawyer , were heard together with their CARDINAL advisers ( bisiddere ) , the Children- and ORG made its final care order pursuant to section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of GPE .", "The applicant parents had access to C one hour twice a week in the foster GPE home .", "On appeal , by decision of DATE , ORG upheld ORG decisions of DATE and DATE . Before the ORG , the applicant parents , represented by their lawyer , and an adviser were heard . In addition , various documents were submitted , including the report of DATE , the CARDINAL statements of DATE concerning the neuropsychological examinations of the applicants and the LOC \u2019s case file . ORG found that due to the applicant GPE diminished intellectual functioning and limited personal resources , there was an evident risk that C \u2019s health and development would suffer serious damage if she was to remain with them . For the same reasons , it considered that the problems could not be solved in the applicant GPE home , even if they were granted measures of support . The care order was to be reconsidered by ORG DATE from the ORG \u2019s decision or , if the decision was brought before ORG , DATE from ORG judgment .", "On DATE the applicants appealed against the decision to ORG ) , claiming the GPE \u2019s care order to be revoked as regards C. They also appealed against a decision of DATE in which ORG had continued the taking into public care of M.", "The applicant parents were heard by ORG . In addition to the written material already submitted before ORG , the court also obtained CARDINAL statements of DATE in which the foster families described the positive health and development of M and C respectively . They stated that the applicant GPE access to the children was well implemented .", "By judgment of DATE , ORG found against the applicants . It stated that for the reasons set out by ORG the conditions under section CARDINAL of GPE were fulfilled for taking the applicant GPE children , M and C , into public care .", "The applicants\u2019 request to be granted leave to appeal to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) was refused on DATE .", "In DATE , in connection with the review of the public care order , the GPE decided to make an assessment of the ORG parenting skills by a psychologist . The assessment was submitted on DATE and contained a recommendation to maintain C in public care since the applicants parental skills were found too limited .", "In a statement of DATE the foster family described their view on ORG development and on how access with the parents was working out . The parents had been good at keeping the appointments , and although the father had only little contact with C , the mother was very preoccupied with proving that she could perform the role as a mother . Both applicant parents , however , were unable to interpret the child \u2019s signals and impervious to advise . Consequently , the contact confused the child .", "On DATE having heard the applicant parents and CARDINAL of their advisers , ORG decided to continue the public care for DATE . On appeal , on DATE , ORG confirmed the decision .", "The applicant did not bring this decision before the courts . On the contrary , on DATE the applicant parents gave their consent to the taking of C into public care .", "In the meantime , in DATE , the applicant parent \u2019s access to C was increased and now took place once a week for TIME in the presence of the support person appointed to the parents .
