ROMANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 10", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants published an article in the Telegraf ( \u201c T. \u201d ) newspaper , of which the second applicant was the editor , with the headline \u201c Former Deputy Mayor PERSON [ ORG ] and serving judge PERSON [ R.M. ] responsible for series of offences in GPE scam \u201d . The article questioned the legality of a contract which ORG had awarded a company , ORG , to perform the service of towing away illegally parked vehicles , and expressed the following opinions :", "\u201c In a decision ( no . CARDINAL ) of DATE ORG awarded a commercial company , ORG , a contract for impounding illegally parked vehicles or trailers ... It was the task of the city council \u2019s specialist departments to lay down the practical arrangements for implementing the decision . That did not happen . DATE after adopting decision no . CARDINAL , the city council , knowingly breaching PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , illegally concluded a partnership contract ... with PERSON , a completely different company from the one initially given the contract . It is worth noting , however , that the relevant contract was signed by the deputy mayor , ORG , on behalf of the mayor , ... , and by a certain PERSON on behalf of the legal expert PERSON", "By what miracle did PERSON enter into a partnership with the city council when , in decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , the council had awarded ORG SRL a straightforward contract to provide services ? Significantly , there is no evidence that ORG agreed to abandon the task of towing away illegally parked vehicles ! ... The crook PERSON ( the former deputy mayor , now a lawyer ) authorised PERSON \u2019s irresponsible employees to record any parking offences DATE in other words , to ridicule citizens and their property . What form did the fraud take ? Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL provide that no partnership contract with a commercial company may be signed without a prior decision by the local council , adopted by CARDINAL majority of the total number of councillors . Before a contract is signed , it must be referred to all the local council \u2019s specialist departments for their opinion . ... The contract with PERSON was negotiated and signed illegally , as the signatories based it on the decision [ of DATE ] , which , as has already been shown , referred to a different company without envisaging any other partnership .", "Given that the city council had already signed CARDINAL other contracts before that CARDINAL , the signatories can not claim ignorance of the law , but only an intentional breach of it ! And because any intentional breach of the law pursues an end in itself \u2013 generally that of securing material advantages \u2013 it is clear that in this case the former deputy mayor , a lawyer by profession , received backhanders from the partner company and either bribed his subordinates , including ORG , or forced them to break the law .", "ORG has detected this blatant fraud , which generated huge profits for the briber ( PERSON ) ... The offending company [ ORG ] has never shown that it has adequate facilities for impounding illegally parked vehicles . This has caused large numbers of privately owned vehicles to be damaged and has implicitly given rise to CARDINAL of complaints to that effect .", "Furthermore , the alleged partnership contract was valid for DATE , until DATE . From that date [ GPE ] has no longer had any right to interfere with ORG private property ! It has nevertheless carried on towing vehicles away and illegally collecting money ... It is incomprehensible how the police could have provided it with assistance for DATE .", "Let us briefly consider the conduct of the council \u2019s former legal expert , ORG , who is now a judge . Either she was ignorant of our country \u2019s legislation when she signed the partnership contract , in which case it is hard to understand how she can subsequently have been appointed as a judge ( administering justice on the basis of laws she does not know ) , or she accepted bribes and may continue to do so in future ! It is not surprising that the same judge should be under investigation by ORG for a further unlawful act , again committed while she was at the city council ( as we reported at the relevant time ) . It seems laughable that the court \u2019s president did not take any action against her on the ground that the sum involved was not ... high enough .", "Apparently becoming aware of the danger that the matter might be uncovered , the city council \u2019s coordination department ... notified PERSON in writing of the possibility of the contract being terminated for the following reason : ... \u2018 You have not supplied any documents showing that you have purchased the platform - type equipment necessary for carrying out the activity ORG ( as stipulated in clause CARDINAL of the contract ) . ... In the same letter the city council informed PERSON : \u2018 As you have not proved that you have the appropriate equipment , we would assess your contribution to the partnership at up to the sum of your company \u2019s capital , that is CARDINAL lei . Your share in the partnership \u2019s net income will have to be recalculated in relation to the parties\u2019 contributions.\u2019 Facts are facts , and the documents in our possession \u2018 speak\u2019 for themselves of the illegal ORG scam . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article was accompanied by a photograph of a police car on the scene as an illegally parked vehicle was being towed away , photocopies of extracts from the partnership contract and from ORG decision of DATE , and certain provisions of Law no . CARDINAL , concerning the responsibilities and powers of mayors , prefects and city and county councils .", "CARDINAL . The article was also accompanied by a cartoon showing a man and a woman arm in arm , carrying a bag marked \u201c Vinalex \u201d which was full of banknotes . The CARDINAL characters were depicted as saying to each other :", "\u201c Hey , Revi [ R.M. ] , you \u2019ve done a good job there ! When I was deputy mayor we made quite a bit , enough to go to GPE ... \u201d", "\u201c PERSON [ FAC ] , if you become a lawyer , I \u2019ll become a judge and we \u2019ll have enough to travel round the world ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date after the article had been published , ORG instituted proceedings against the applicants in ORG for insult and defamation , offences under LAW and CARDINAL of the Criminal Code respectively . She complained , in particular , about the cartoon accompanying the article , arguing that it had led readers to believe that she had had intimate relations with ORG She pointed out that both she and the former deputy mayor were married to other people .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on CARDINAL DATE the court adjourned the case as the applicants were not present and , scheduling a further hearing for DATE , directed that that they should be brought before the court on that date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant stated at the public hearing that , as editor , he assumed full responsibility for what had been published in the newspaper . He submitted that cartoons were frequently used in the press as a medium for criticism and that he had not intended to damage the complainant \u2019s reputation . In reply to a question from the court he admitted having learned that , by order of the mayor of GPE , PERSON had been authorised to tow away illegally parked cars . He stated , however , that he had not thought it necessary to publish that information . Lastly , he stressed that he did not intend to reach a settlement with the injured party and that he was prepared to publish an article on her behalf if she could prove that what he had published was untrue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants applied to have the case transferred to a court in another county . They also requested an adjournment of the proceedings , arguing that because the complainant was a judge it was impossible for them to find a member of ORG who would agree to represent them .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date GPE , in reply to a question from the court , attested that the applicants had not met with a refusal on the part of each of its members and that , in any event , the matter had not been referred to its executive .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the court adjourned the case as the applicants were not present .", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory decision of DATE ORG ordered the referral of the case to ORG of First Instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was entered on that court \u2019s list of cases for hearing . Public hearings were held on DATE and on DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicants did not attend the hearings , although they had been duly summoned . The court summoned them to appear at the hearings of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . The applicants did not comply with the summonses .", "CARDINAL . At the hearings on DATE and DATE , representatives of the ORG newspaper applied on behalf of the applicants , who were not present , to have the proceedings adjourned . The court allowed the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a member of ORG , GPE , agreed to represent the applicants .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE in the morning PERSON asked the court to consider the case after TIME The court granted his request . However , when it sat to examine the case at TIME and , subsequently , at TIME it noted that neither the applicants nor their counsel were present in the courtroom . It accordingly adjourned the case until CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on CARDINAL DATE the court reserved judgment , after noting that neither the applicants \u2013 despite their having been duly summoned DATE nor their counsel had appeared . In a judgment delivered that day the court found the applicants guilty of insult and defamation , offences under ORG and CARDINAL respectively of MONEY . It sentenced them to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and prohibited them from working as journalists for DATE after completing their sentences , a security measure provided for in LAW . It also ordered them to pay ORG of CARDINAL lei for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . Attaching decisive weight to ORG \u2019s position as a member of the judiciary , the court considered that the acts of which the applicants were accused posed a danger to society , not because of their practical consequence \u2013 distortion of the truth \u2013 but because of their psycho - social effects , namely misinformation of the public , creation of a false scale of values and the psychological trauma suffered by the injured party . The court considered that in publishing the article in issue , the applicants had not pursued a legitimate aim and had acted in bad faith , since the facts they had reported did not correspond to the truth .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants appealed against that judgment , without stating any grounds for their appeal .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the ORG reserved judgment , having noted that the case was ready for decision and that the applicants , who had been duly summoned , had not appeared in court or given any grounds for their appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicants state that for reasons beyond their control they arrived late on DATE , by which time the hearing had already ended . They submit that on TIME of the hearing the level of the GPE had fallen and that the ferry , the only means of travelling to the town where the court was sitting , had been delayed .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the court , after examining all the aspects of the criminal case against the applicants , as required by LAW CCP ) , upheld the first - instance judgment , finding it to have been correct . That decision , sent to the archives on DATE , was final and binding and no ordinary appeal lay against it .", "CARDINAL . The applicants did not serve their custodial sentence , since immediately after the decision had been delivered , the Procurator - General suspended its execution for DATE , on the basis of LAW ORG , by which he was empowered to order a stay of execution before applying to have a decision quashed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Procurator - General applied to ORG to have the decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE quashed . He submitted the following arguments .", "( a ) The courts\u2019 legal classification of the facts had been incorrect . He pointed out in that connection that in the cartoon the applicants had simply highlighted their allegations of corruption on the part of the city council officials . He accordingly submitted that the facts in issue did not constitute the actus reus of insult as defined in LAW .", "( b ) The amount which the applicants had been ordered to pay in damages had been extremely high and had not been objectively justified .", "( c ) The requirements of LAW , by which the courts could prohibit persons who had committed an offence from practising a particular profession on account of incompetence , lack of training or any other ground making them unfit to practise the profession , were not satisfied in the applicants\u2019 case . He pointed out in that connection that there was no unequivocal proof that the applicants were incompetent or would pose a potential danger by continuing to work as journalists .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the Procurator - General \u2019s application as being manifestly ill - founded . After examining the evidence before it , ORG", "( a ) considered that in publishing the impugned article in ORG , the applicants had made an allegation about the injured party which , if true , would have rendered her criminally liable , and that the offence of defamation as defined in LAW had therefore been made out ;", "( b ) held that the cartoon accompanying the article , in which the injured party was depicted in the company of a man carrying a bag of money , had been such as to disparage the complainant \u2019s honour and reputation and had therefore constituted the actus reus of insult as defined in LAW , and accordingly concluded that the lower courts had been correct in their classification of the acts carried out by the applicants ;", "( c ) considered that the high amount which the applicants had been ordered to pay in damages had been justified by the fact that their article had been published in a mass - circulation newspaper , thereby seriously offending the honour and dignity of the injured party ; and", "( d ) held , lastly , that it was not possible to review the alleged unlawfulness of the temporary prohibition on practising the profession of journalist in the context of an application to have a decision quashed .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Procurator - General at ORG informed the applicants that he had extended the stay of execution of their sentence until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of GPE granted the applicants a pardon in respect of their custodial sentence .", "CARDINAL . In a letter received by ORG on DATE the second applicant informed the ORG that he was still working as editor of ORG , the position he had occupied when lodging his application .", "It appears from the copy submitted to ORG first applicant \u2019s employment record ( cartea de munc\u0103 ) that , following ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE :", "( a ) he continued to work for T. as editor of the \u201c Events \u201d section until DATE , when he was transferred for administrative reasons to the C. company , occupying the same position and receiving the same salary as before ;", "( b ) he left that post on DATE on account of staff cutbacks by his employer , a ground for dismissal provided for in LAW ( a ) of LOC as in force at the material time ; and", "( c ) he was not gainfully employed until DATE , when he was recruited on a permanent contract by the ORG company as deputy editor .", "CARDINAL .
