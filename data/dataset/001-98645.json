NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and now lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant was born in GPE . Soon after his birth , his parents divorced and his father moved to GPE and remarried . His mother remained in GPE . The applicant moved to GPE in DATE , when he was DATE , to join his father , stepmother and CARDINAL brothers . His father died there in DATE .", "CARDINAL . When he was DATE , the applicant began abusing drugs . In DATE , he was convicted of burglary and theft and sentenced to DATE detention in a Young Offender Institution . DATE he was convicted of CARDINAL counts of theft , failing to surrender to custody , another count of theft , a further CARDINAL counts of failing to surrender to custody , failing to surrender to bail and possession of a controlled class A drug . He was given a fine on each occasion . On DATE he was convicted of burglary and theft and failing to surrender to custody and sentenced to a community order of DATE . On DATE , he was convicted of theft and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The trial judge described him as a \u201c persistent thief and burglar \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG gave the applicant notice of intention to make a deportation order . On DATE , after considering representations from the applicant , the Secretary of ORG decided to make a deportation order . In the Secretary of ORG 's opinion the applicant had not provided any details of legitimate employment he had held in GPE . He had spent his youth and DATE in GPE and so it would not be unreasonable to expect him to readjust to life there . The deportation would therefore be compatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to the then ORG . His appeal was dismissed on CARDINAL DATE . The ORG accepted that the applicant had indefinite leave to remain in GPE and that he had lived for a substantial period of time in the country and had family there . However , these factors were outweighed by other factors . The applicant had no employment record . He had a substantial number of convictions and had already been given a number of opportunities to mend his ways . He had stolen to fund a substantial drug habit ( he had been using GBP CARDINAL worth of heroin and crack cocaine per day ) but was now in good health . He had given evidence in NORP and therefore , as a relatively young man , in good health and speaking the language , there was no reason why he could not return to GPE and take up work there . His mother had remained there and it was likely that there were other members of his extended family to whom he could turn for support . The ORG doubted that the applicant , as an adult , could be said enjoy family life in GPE with his stepmother or his brother , with whom he intended to live upon release from prison . It had no doubt that he had established private life in GPE but did not consider that , given that the applicant had been in and out of prison and abusing drugs for DATE , the deportation would have consequences of such gravity as to engage LAW . The ORG concluded that , even if it were wrong in respect of a lack of an interference with the applicant 's private or family life , any interference would be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the prevention of disorder or crime .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought reconsideration of the ORG 's determination . This application was refused by a Senior Immigration Judge on DATE . A further such application was refused by ORG on DATE . In each case , it was found that the application amounted to no more than a disagreement with the ORG 's findings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged an application with this ORG and sought interim measures under LAW to prevent his removal to GPE . The following day , he was informed that this request fell outside the scope of Rule CARDINAL . He was duly deported to GPE on DATE . He has since indicated that he wishes to continue his application from GPE .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of the Immigration Act DATE provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of ORG . Section CARDINAL ) of the same LAW ( as amended by ORG ) provides that a person who is not a NORP citizen shall be liable to deportation from GPE if the Secretary of ORG deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good .", "Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE provide for a right of appeal against a decision to deport , inter alia , on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the LAW and that it was not in accordance with ORG .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that , in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right , courts and tribunals must take into account any case - law from this ORG so far as , in the opinion of the court or tribunal , it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen .", "CARDINAL . The version of paragraph CARDINAL of ORG , which was in force prior to DATE , provided as follows :", "( i ) age ;", "( ii ) length of residence in GPE ;", "( iii ) strength of connections with GPE ;", "( iv ) personal history , including character , conduct and employment record ;", "( v ) domestic circumstances ;", "( vi ) previous criminal record and the nature of any offence of which the person has been convicted ;", "( vii ) compassionate circumstances ;", "( viii ) any representations received on the person 's behalf . \u201d", "The amended version of paragraph CARDINAL , in force since DATE , provides as follows :", "\u201c Subject to paragraph CARDINAL , while each case will be considered on its merits , where a person is liable to deportation the presumption shall be that the public interest requires deportation . The Secretary of ORG will consider all relevant factors in considering whether the presumption is outweighed in any particular case , although it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation will be outweighed in a case where it would not be contrary to LAW and the LAW relating to LAW to deport . The aim is an exercise of the power of deportation which is consistent and fair as between CARDINAL person and another , although CARDINAL case will rarely be identical with another in all material respects ... \u201d", "Paragraph CARDINAL of ORG , referred to in both versions of paragraph CARDINAL , provides as follows :", "\u201c A deportation order will not be made against any person if his removal in pursuance of the order would be contrary to GPE obligations under LAW relating to ORG [ LAW ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Rules relating to the revocation of a deportation order are contained in CARDINAL of ORG CARDINAL ( as amended ) , supplemented by LAW Instructions ( \u201c IDIs \u201d ) . There is no specific period after which revocation will be appropriate although ORG to LAW of the IDIs gives broad guidelines on the length of time deportation orders should remain in force after removal . Cases which will normally be appropriate for revocation DATE after deportation include those of overstayers and persons who failed to observe a condition attached to their leave , persons who obtained leave by deception , and family members deported under LAW ) of LAW DATE . With regard to criminal conviction cases , the normal course of action will be to grant an application for revocation where the decision to deport was founded on a criminal conviction which is now \u201c spent \u201d under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act DATE . Paragraph CARDINAL of the Rules , however , indicates that in the case of an applicant with a serious criminal record continued exclusion for a long term of years will normally be the proper course . This is expanded on in GPE A to LAW of the IDIs , which indicates that revocation would not normally be appropriate until DATE after departure for those convicted of serious offences such as violence against the person , sexual offences , burglary , robbery or theft , and other offences such as forgery and drug trafficking ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
