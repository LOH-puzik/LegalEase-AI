On DATE Mr Nikolayev opened a criminal investigation in respect of the applicant ( criminal case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) concerning allegations of fraud . This case was joined to a criminal investigation ( case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) in respect of NORP , an executive of ORG , which concerned allegations of embezzlement . In both cases the allegations related to the business relations between ORG and ORG and , in particular , ORG inclusion into ORG and an increase in the latter 's authorised capital , which resulted in a redistribution of each shareholder 's ' stake .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was summoned to attend the ORG on DATE at TIME to be questioned as a witness in relation to another criminal case .

The order stated that , on the basis of ORG DATE of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , Mr Nikolayev considered that the crime of fraud , of which the applicant was suspected , constituted a serious public threat punishable by imprisonment alone , and that the applicant might obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case and attempt to elude the investigation and trial .", "CARDINAL . The applicant remained in custody until DATE , during which time he was interrogated twice , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The interrogation on DATE took place in the presence of the applicant 's lawyers . It was explained to the applicant before the interview that he was suspected of committing large - scale fraud within the meaning of LAW ( b ) of LAW .

In addition , the applicant 's lawyers lodged a complaint with ORG in GPE under LAW of the ORG , claiming that the applicant 's detention was unlawful and requesting his immediate release . They argued that the arrest order had been issued in violation of LAW , CARDINAL of the ORG , since there were no exceptional circumstances justifying the applicant 's detention before the charges had been laid or any grounds for imprisonment on the basis of the charges brought . The arrest order appeared to have been politically motivated and imprisonment was unnecessary and constituted an excessive restraint . Furthermore , there were no grounds to suspect that the applicant intended to elude the investigation or any reason to believe that he would obstruct it . Finally , the applicant was subject to an amnesty exempting him from punishment and preliminary imprisonment due to having been awarded the Friendship of the Peoples Order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Nikolayev charged the applicant with fraud under LAW ( b ) of LAW . On DATE the applicant was interrogated in the presence of his lawyers .

While the applicant was in prison , ORG asked him to sign an agreement in return for which the applicant was told that all criminal charges against him would be dropped . The agreement between ORG and the applicant was signed on DATE ( the \u201c DATE agreement \u201d ) . It included a provision in Annex CARDINAL calling , inter alia , for the termination of the applicant 's criminal prosecution in relation to ORG and for an undertaking regarding his security . This provision read as follows :", "\u201c The Parties realise that successful implementation of the Agreement is possible only if the individuals and legal entities concerned acquire and exercise their civil rights of their own free will and in their own interests , without compulsion by any other party to act in any particular way .

The order read as follows :", "\u201c Analysis of the evidence confirms the illegal nature of [ the applicant 's ] doings . However , the actions of the head of ORG Most , PERSON , contain elements belonging to substantive law as well as elements relating to criminal - law provisions . In view of the specific nature of the act committed , it is impossible to attribute it to separate legal spheres .", "In the course of the investigation , Mr Gusinskiy understood the unlawfulness of acquiring the right to another 's property and , in this connection , he has provided reimbursement for the damage he caused by assigning his share in the statutory capital of ORG to the ORG . In addition , he has significantly compensated for the harm caused to the interests of the ORG by voluntarily transferring ORG Most shares to a legal entity controlled by the ORG .", "The steps taken by the accused are extenuating circumstances and attest to his sincere repentance which , in conjunction with other positive characterising details and the absence of a previous criminal record , enables a decision to be taken to exempt Mr Gusinskiy from criminal prosecution . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On appeal , this decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Nikolayev initiated a further criminal investigation in respect of the applicant . The new charge was brought under LAW ( b ) of LAW and concerned the fraudulent obtaining of loans by ORG . The applicant was not provided with a copy of the order initiating the proceedings . However , according to the information gathered by the applicant 's lawyers , the criminal investigation was opened on the basis of an application filed by ORG with the ORG on DATE . ORG asked the ORG to investigate the spending of funds obtained by ORG Most and , in particular , to find out whether the use of the loans were in line with the activities permitted by ORG charter , whether the funds were used for their intended purpose , and whether the management of ORG Most had violated any law in relation to the loans . ORG , a ORG - controlled company , was involved as a guarantor of the loans .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Nikolayev issued a further summons for the applicant to attend the ORG on DATE , to be informed of the charges against him and interrogated .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant did not attend the ORG , Mr ORG amended the order for the applicant 's prosecution .

The charges alleged that the applicant had fraudulently obtained loans .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested in GPE on DATE pursuant to an international arrest warrant and imprisoned in that country on DATE . On DATE the applicant was released from prison on bail of MONEY and placed under house arrest in his villa in LOC .", "CARDINAL . Following an application by the applicant 's lawyers , ORG in GPE ruled on DATE that the initiation of the ORG Most loan investigation had been unlawful because the evidence gathered by the investigating authorities had not disclosed sufficient elements of fraud to institute criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set aside the judgment of DATE on the ground that no appeal lay against investigating authorities ' decisions to institute criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Following proceedings in the NORP courts , on DATE a judgment was given in the applicant 's favour refusing the request by the NORP authorities for the applicant 's extradition from GPE . In refusing the extradition request , the NORP court ( Audiencia Nacional ) stated :", "\u201c [ I]t is possible to observe in the documents furnished by [ the applicant ] ... certain noteworthy and peculiar circumstances which are unusual in the sphere of judicial claims for fraud and which , although they do not in themselves lead to the conclusion that we are dealing with an irregular claim filed for a political purpose , compel the ORG to consider [ the applicant 's ] argument as not completely without foundation as far as the facts and interferences are concerned and as not inconceivable or discountable on the basis of logical criteria and experience .", "CARDINAL . The agreement of DATE ... of sale by [ the applicant ] to ORG of a parcel of shares ... [ Annex DATE a supplementary agreement which is not common in relationships between sellers and purchasers of securities \u2013 concludes with CARDINAL signatures , CARDINAL of which is the habitual signature of the representative of ORG ... which appears in the body of the contract and in other annexes and another signature which at first sight does not coincide with [ the applicant 's ] normal signature \u2013 in the agreement , annexes and stamps in this extradition procedure . [ The applicant ] claims that this is the signature of a member of the NORP government .", "CARDINAL . NORP ...

The judgment of ORG of DATE ...", "These peculiarities of the case must inevitably have legal significance for the judicial ruling on this extradition request since the fact that the ORG has perceived them ... obliges it , for reasons of legal security and effective judicial protection ... to stretch to the extreme the judgment of double incrimination , analysing the grounds for the accusation in view of the need to provide due legal protection ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON , a Deputy President of ORG , lodged an application for supervisory review of the decisions of ORG of DATE and ORG of DATE . The judge maintained that it was the lawfulness of detention rather than detention itself which should have been the subject of the judicial review . He requested the ORG of ORG to remit the case for a fresh examination by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG granted the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Tverskoy District Court examined the substance of the complaint in respect of detention . At the hearing , the representative of the ORG ( the defendant ) argued that at the time of the applicant 's arrest he could have obstructed the course of justice because he had been the head of ORG Most and , accordingly , had unlimited opportunities to influence witnesses and had access to written evidence . Furthermore , as the applicant had dual citizenship and a travel passport , he could have escaped abroad . With regard to the applicant 's allegation that he had been entitled to an amnesty , the prosecutor noted that documentary proof that the applicant had indeed held the award in question had been submitted only on DATE , that is to say , after the arrest , and the applicant had been released on DATE . ORG accepted the ORG 's arguments . It found that , in the light of the explanations provided by the ORG 's representative , the wording of the detention order of CARDINAL DATE could not be regarded as strained and hypothetical . As to the award , the court found that the law on criminal procedure contained no restriction on the application of precautionary measures to a person subject to an amnesty .", "\u201c A criminal prosecution may not be started , or , if already started , shall be stopped if", "...", "( CARDINAL ) an amnesty law has been passed which relieves [ the person concerned ] from punishment ... \u201d", "\u201c If there are sufficient reasons to believe that the accused will elude the investigation or evade justice , obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case or engage in criminal activities ... , CARDINAL of the following precautionary measures may be imposed : an order not to leave the place of residence , a personal undertaking or an undertaking from a non - governmental organisation , taking into custody ... \u201d", "\u201c In exceptional circumstances , a precautionary measure may be imposed on a suspect who has not been charged .
