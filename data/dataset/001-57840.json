Here it was sufficient to rely on the expert opinion produced by the medical centre . The fact that the lung specialist \u2019s report was missing from the file was a defect ( ein gewisser PERSON ) , but the examination carried out by the specialist in internal medicine made it possible to answer the question whether after DATE there had been any change in the state of the applicant \u2019s lungs .
