FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicants are NORP citizens , born in DATE and DATE respectively and resident in PERSON . Before the ORG they are represented by Mr. Christian Holmsten , a lawyer and member of the Bar practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , Director ORG , and Mr PERSON , Director , both of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are married and the parents of PERSON , born in DATE , and PERSON , born in DATE . The applicant mother has a third child , PERSON , born in DATE , who also lived with the applicants at the beginning of the events of relevance to the application .", "On DATE the first applicant was apparently informally told by a social welfare official that public care orders regarding the children were being prepared . On DATE ORG \u2019s father was formally heard in respect of the proposed public care of her . At a meeting on DATE the applicants were formally notified that ORG ( sosiaalijaosto , socialsektionen ) of ORG ( sosiaalilautakunta , socialn\u00e4mnden ) of GPE would , on DATE , consider a proposal that the children should be placed in public care . The applicants opposed the proposal . They allegedly obtained the material which was to form the basis for the proposal only on DATE , CARDINAL DATE . According to ORG , the material was at the applicants\u2019 disposal in ORG from DATE , CARDINAL DATE . The material contained various expert opinions and affidavits and totalled CARDINAL pages .", "In their submissions of CARDINAL DATE the applicants , represented by their current counsel , opposed the proposed public care , invoking , inter alia , an opinion submitted by PERSON , a general practitioner , according to whom the children were normally developed physically . A further opinion of DATE was issued by PERSON , Acting Head of ORG at ORG of GPE , who had been examining PERSON during DATE . PERSON stated in essence that the delay in PERSON 's mental development was being successfully followed up by various support measures . This opinion was submitted to the members of ORG on DATE .", "Having heard the applicants and the leading social welfare official at its meeting on DATE , ORG placed the children in public care , considering that the applicants were incapable of ensuring their basic care and education , that their home was lacking incentives and that the applicants had shown indifference in regard to the children 's overall well - being . The support measures provided by ORG had proved to be insufficient . The children were to be placed in a local children \u2019s home pending their placement in a foster family . According to the care orders , the public care was expected to last until the children had reached the age of majority . The children \u2019s right to maintain regular contact with their parents and with each other would be ensured . They could receive visits in the children \u2019s home during visiting TIME . The Social Section relied on section CARDINAL of LAW ( lastensuojelulaki , barnskyddslag DATE ) . The children were fetched from the applicants ' home on DATE TIME", "On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , requesting an oral hearing for the purpose of hearing PERSON and ORG as experts concerning the children \u2019s health as well as various other persons as witnesses in regard to the conditions in the applicants ' home . The applicants considered it unfair that the care orders had been based on the written reports of various public officials and experts consulted by the social authorities without the applicants\u2019 having been able to question them orally . The applicants conceded that they had had financial problems but contended that they had always provided their children with satisfactory care .", "In DATE ORG responded to the ORG appeals and the applicants submitted a rejoinder alleging that the children had expressed a strong wish to return home . On DATE ORG rejected the appeals , having found an oral hearing unnecessary . ORG reasoning read in extenso as follows :", "( translation from NORP )", "\u201c According to the evidence transpiring from the documentation on file , the shortcomings in the children \u2019s care and the other conditions in their home seriously jeopardise the children \u2019s development . The open - care assistance has proved to be insufficient and substitute care has been deemed to be in the children \u2019s best interests . ORG has therefore been under an obligation to place [ the children ] in the care of [ the ORG ] . \u201d", "ORG relied on LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW and on sections CARDINAL of LAW ( lastensuojeluasetus , barnskyddsf\u00f6rordning DATE ) .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting that the case be referred back to ORG for an oral hearing of experts and witnesses . The applicants again argued that they had only had DATE at their disposal for preparing for the decisive meeting on DATE . In addition , the preparation of their subsequent appeals had been hampered by the impossibility of having the children , then already removed from the applicants\u2019 home , examined by experts of the applicants\u2019 choosing .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicants ' request and appeal as a whole by upholding the lower court \u2019s decision .", "According to the information available to the ORG , PERSON is still staying at a children 's home in GPE . S. and PERSON are staying in foster families at Jalasj\u00e4rvi , QUANTITY from GPE . According to the applicants , they met PERSON in the children \u2019s home once DATE but were allegedly able to meet PERSON and ORG only in DATE", "DATE and DATE . During DATE the applicants and the children met twice .", "The relevant legislation is outlined in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . Those provisions of particular relevance to the present case are described below .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG shall take a child into care and provide substitute care for him or her if ( a ) the child \u2019s health or development is seriously endangered by lack of care or other conditions at home , or if the child seriously endangers his or her health and development by abuse of intoxicants , by committing an illegal act other than a minor offence , or by any other comparable behaviour , ( b ) the measures of assistance in open care are not appropriate or have proved to be inadequate ; and ( c ) foster care is considered to be in the best interests of the child . PERSON care shall be provided without delay where it is needed and is in the best interests of the child ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "If a child is in imminent danger or otherwise in need of an immediate care order and foster care , ORG may take him or her into care without submitting the decision to ORG for prior approval ( section CARDINAL ) . An emergency care order shall expire within DATE of the decision , unless referred for reconsideration under LAW of LAW . An ordinary care order pursuant to section CARDINAL must be issued within DATE , or on special grounds within DATE , of the emergency order . Both ordinary and emergency care orders may be appealed to the administrative courts .", "The child \u2019s custodians , biological parents and de facto carers shall be heard in respect of a proposed public care order and be notified of the decision taken ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , as amended by Act no . GPE ) . The hearing procedure is governed by LAW ( hallintomenettelylaki , lag om f\u00f6rvaltningsf\u00f6rfarande CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Under LAW of the said LAW a party shall be afforded the opportunity to reply to any claims put forward by others as well as to any evidence that may affect a decision to be taken . LAW does not lay down any minimum period of time which a party shall have at his or her disposal for preparing such a reply . A matter may be decided without a preceding hearing of a party inter alia if such a hearing would be manifestly unnecessary , would jeopardise the purpose of the decision or if the decision can not be postponed . LAW requires that the competent authority duly investigate the matter before it and ensure the equality of the parties .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( sosiaalihuoltolaki , socialv\u00e5rdslag PERSON ) , a decision made by ORG is enforceable regardless of an appeal ( a ) if the decision requires immediate implementation ; ( b ) if , for reasons due to the arrangement of social welfare , the enforcement of the decision can not be delayed ; or ( c ) when ORG has ordered the decision to be enforced at once .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , a child who is being cared for outside his or her original home shall be ensured those important , continuous and secure human relations which are important for his or her development . The child is entitled to meet his or her parents and other close persons and to keep in touch with them ( subsection CARDINAL ) . ORG shall support and facilitate the child \u2019s contacts with his or her parents and other close persons ( subsection CARDINAL ) .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG or the director of a children \u2019s home may restrict the right of access of a child in foster care to its parents or other persons close to him or her if ( a ) such access clearly endangers the development or safety of the child ; or if ( b ) such a restriction is necessary for the safety or security of the parents , or the children or staff in the children \u2019s home . The restriction shall be limited in time . It shall mention the persons whose rights are being restricted , the kind of contacts concerned by the restriction and the extent of the restriction .", "The care plan to be drawn up in respect of a child in public care shall mention ( a ) the purpose and objectives of the placement ; ( b ) what kind of special support will be organised for the child , for the persons in charge of the child \u2019s care and upbringing and for the child \u2019s parents ; ( c ) how the child \u2019s right of access to its parents and other persons close to the child will be organised ; and ( d ) how after - care is going to be organised .
