At the material time PERSON was a local newspaper published CARDINAL times a week with a circulation of CARDINAL copies . It published reports and material on political and social matters in GPE and , in particular , LOC .

On DATE PERSON published an anonymous letter , allegedly written by an employee of ORG of GPE , which the second applicant \u2019s colleague , PERSON , had downloaded from a news website .

NORP The letter was followed by these comments , prepared by Ms I. on behalf of the editorial board :", "\u201c When publishing this letter without the knowledge and consent of the editor - inchief , I understand that I may not only face trouble ... but I may also create problems for the newspaper . Because , if this letter is [ misinformation ] , then [ the media ] , in which it appears may be endangered . On the other hand , if this letter is genuine , then its author faces a higher risk . Besides , given that this anonimka [ anonymous letter ] has already been published on the GPE website ORG ( to which we refer , in accordance with their requirement ) , we have the blessing of God [ to publish it ] . We are proceeding on the understanding that , in accordance with LAW over ORG and Law - Enforcement Organs of the ORG , we are carrying out civil control and , under LAW of the LAW , we would like to receive open information concerning the facts described in this letter from the relevant authorities . Moreover , [ it is to be noted ] that the ORG [ of ORG ] in LOC did not react to an analogous publication in the Top Secret [ newspaper ] ... I remind [ you ] that the [ Pravoye Delo ] newspaper ... is wide open for letters in reply and comments from all interested agencies . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON , who lived in GPE at the time and was the President of ORG , brought defamation proceedings in ORG of GPE against the applicants .

He asked the court to order the applicants to publish a retraction and an apology and to pay him compensation for non - pecuniary damage in the amount of CARDINAL NORP hryvnias ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants first argued before the court that they were not responsible for the accuracy of the information contained in the material that they had published , as they had reproduced material published elsewhere without making any modifications . The publication contained a reference to the source of the material and was followed by comments explaining the editors\u2019 position regarding the material and inviting comments from the persons and bodies concerned . The applicants also submitted that if the court were to award PERSON the amount of compensation he had claimed , the newspaper would become insolvent and would have to close .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , at a hearing on DATE , the second applicant stated that the article was not about the claimant and that its wording did not necessarily establish that it was a particular \u201c PERSON who was being referred to .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court ruled against the applicants . It found that the information at issue did concern the claimant , who was a public figure involved in public activities in LOC and had represented GPE at sports events abroad in his capacity as President of ORG . In that context , the court noted that this had not been contested by the applicants in their initial submissions and that the publication was about the activities of ORG in LOC . The court further held that the content was defamatory and that the applicants had failed to prove that it was true . It found no grounds on which to exempt the applicants from civil liability under section CARDINAL of LAW , as the Internet site to which they had referred was not printed media registered pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court ordered the first applicant to publish a retraction of the following content of the publication :", "\u201c ... A member of [ the organised criminal group ] , PERSON , an agent of PERSON , who is in charge of the main areas of activities of the gang [ is ] a coordinator and sponsor of murders , [ he ] meets with [ PERSON and resolves financial issues for the top officials of the ORG [ of ORG ] in LOC ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It noted that its gross DATE income was MONEY and found it reasonable to order the applicants jointly to pay PERSON CARDINAL for nonpecuniary damage . The applicants were also ordered to pay to ORG CARDINAL in court fees .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . They maintained the submissions they had made before the first - instance court and also contended that the editorial board had not been registered as a legal entity pursuant to the relevant regulations on registration of the media and that the second applicant had not been appointed as editor - in - chief in accordance with the law . Thus , in their view , they could not take part in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants further argued that invoking their civil liability was contrary to section CARDINAL of LAW and section QUANTITY , stating that they had not intended to defame PERSON and that , by publishing the material , they had wished to promote public discussion of the issues raised in that material which were of significant public interest . According to them , it was their duty to disseminate the material and the public had a right to receive it .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant also submitted that he had not authorised the publication of the material at issue and that the legislation did not provide for an obligation to apologise as a sanction for defamation .", "CARDINAL .
