ORG concluded that given that C.A. had been interrogated and tortured during his detention on the gendarmerie LOC and up until DATE by the accused and other persons whose functions had not been ascertained , the omissions in the investigation had to be remedied and , in particular , the gendarmes , the members of the ORG and any other persons present at the material time and place should be questioned .", "CARDINAL .

DATE or so witnesses were questioned , some following a request for judicial assistance . Some hearings were postponed as a result of problems in ensuring the appearance of witnesses who for the most part had been co - detainees of the deceased and present on the LOC on which he had been subjected to the torture . All the witnesses stated that they had seen C.A. being tortured and some stated that they had seen the accused at the scene of the crime .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE the applicant stated , inter alia , that her husband had been unrecognisable when she saw him at ORG .

During these proceedings , around QUANTITY hearings were held . As they had done previously , the accused denied any responsibility in the death of GPE , stating that they had never taken part in his interrogation . PERSON stated that on DATE in question he had been involved in operations in the PERSON and GPE , and PERSON stated that he had been on leave . The same witnesses ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were examined again , some following a request for judicial assistance , and repeated the statements made at the start of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment , referring in particular to the testimony of the co - detainees who had been present at Artvin police station at the same time as FAC of these witnesses stated that they had seen C.A. naked , attached to the radiator , wet and trembling , with injuries to his hands and wrists . CARDINAL of them stated that officer PERSON had threatened them , pointing at C.A. and saying \u201c Look at what has happened to him ; if you do n\u2019t sign , the same thing will happen to you . \u201d A detainee who had been in the neighbouring cell stated that he had heard C.A. moaning constantly , that in the evenings they would take him away for questioning naked , and that officers PERSON and GPE and CARDINAL men in civilian clothing would beat him in the middle of the room as a lesson to the others . Another witness stated that he had seen PERSON and others beat C.A. with truncheons while he was lying on the ground in a pool of water , all the while continuing to spray him with water . He stated that he had heard the sound of a magneto ( a magneto - electric machine ) and the delirious voice of C.A. uttering the names of his children , unable to walk , his body covered in wounds . These eyewitnesses stated that they had generally had their eyes covered but that sometimes the blindfold had come off , or they had recognized the ORG voices . CARDINAL other detainee witnesses stated that they had seen that the applicant had been tortured , but did not know who had done it . The court considered that the testimony of the co - detainees was only partially credible given their status as detainees and the fact that they would normally have had their eyes covered . In the reasons for the judgment , the court observed that the leave records relating to GPE kept by the gendarmerie command had been falsified and declared that his statements were not credible . As for GPE , the court pointed out an inconsistency between his statement of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and his subsequent statements . According to the court , the accused were indirectly responsible for the death of C.A. It added that \u201c a team of CARDINAL civilians \u201d had also taken part in the interrogations , but gave no details of the identity , function or action of these QUANTITY individuals . It concluded that it had not been definitively established that the accused had themselves tortured the deceased but that they had acted as accomplices to the illegal act by issuing orders ( talimat vermek ) , by procuring the LOC ( yer tedarik etmek ) and by failing to intervene [ to prevent the illegal act ] ( g\u00f6z yummak ) . It found that the accused , together with civilians , had participated in the interrogation of GPE and that the latter had died as a result of his pre - existing condition ( \u00f6nceki hastal\u0131\u011f\u0131 ) and as a result of the torture inflicted by one or more of these civilians whose identity could not be established . The court sentenced PERSON and GPE to DATE and DATE imprisonment under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . The court accepted CARDINAL mitigating circumstances to reduce the sentences : the personality of the accused as evidenced by the case file ( dosyadaki ki\u015filikleri ) and the fact that they were mere accomplices ( fer\u2019\u00ee fail ) rather than the main perpetrators of the crime .", "CARDINAL .

The result of this application , accepted by ORG for consideration on the basis of various written testimonies submitted by civilians and military personnel and a letter from ORG command , was that execution of the sentences was suspended .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the accused , ORG gave a decision on DATE referring a matter concerning the discriminatory nature of a provision governing the content of an amnesty law to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG declared that the provision in question was by no means unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , after having heard new defence witnesses , notably CARDINAL officers , ORG dismissed the application lodged by the CARDINAL officers on the ground that the new evidence was not such as to create a favourable situation for the convicted officers . It lifted the stay of execution of their sentences .", "CARDINAL . The officers finally referred their case to the Minister of ORG for the latter to lodge an appeal with ORG ( GPE emir ile bozma ) against their conviction . Having accepted their application , on DATE the Minister of ORG ordered ORG at ORG to lodge an appeal in the interests of the law on the ground that the evidence had not been properly assessed by ORG .", "CARDINAL .
