He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Director in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE convicted the applicant of an aggravated narcotics offence and sentenced him to imprisonment .", "On DATE ORG ( ulkomaalaisvirasto , utl\u00e4nningsverket ) ordered the applicant to be deported to GPE .", "The applicant started to serve his prison sentence on DATE in GPE .", "On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) of GPE upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and fixed his sentence at DATE and DATE . This judgment was final .", "In a report dated DATE the Deputy Governor of ORG took a position on the applicant \u2019s placement , noting that he was due to be released on DATE .", "On DATE ORG decided that the applicant should be transferred to GPE with a view to serving the rest of his sentence there . ORG relied on section CARDINAL , subsection LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on ORG operation in the Enforcement of Certain Criminal Sanctions , as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as well as on LAW to the Convention on ORG ( NORP Treaty Series no . CARDINAL ; Finnish Treaty Series no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The applicant \u2019s transfer was subject to the consent of ORG .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) of GPE , arguing that enforcing the transfer order would violate Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Firstly , he risked being placed in the same prison as other members of the gang in whose activities he had been involved , CARDINAL of whom he had denounced during the criminal proceedings . Secondly , the general prison conditions in GPE were worse . Thirdly , the applicant argued that in GPE he would , as a first - time offender being of good behaviour in prison , be entitled to release on parole after having served CARDINAL of his sentence . In GPE release on parole would arise only when he had served CARDINAL of his sentence and even then on a more discretionary basis . By ordering that he should serve the rest of his sentence in GPE ORG effectively prolonged his sentence beyond that which he would have served , had he been allowed to remain in GPE . This was said to be in violation of LAW .", "In its opinion to ORG stated the following ( as transcribed by the court ) :", "\u201c ... ORG has been sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , of which he will , as a first - time offender , be serving DATE and DATE . According to ORG of the NORP ORG as well as its international unit , it would be possible for ORG to obtain a conditional release in GPE on having served CARDINAL of his sentence , that is to say DATE , DATE . [ His ] possibility of being released conditionally in GPE is therefore not significantly smaller than in GPE and the NORP legislation does not in this respect differ significantly from our own . According to the NORP authorities , the possibility for ORG to obtain a conditional release depends inter alia on factors which [ he ] himself may influence by his own deeds and behaviour . ... The conditions in which the sentence [ would be ] served in GPE [ would not ] differ significantly from those prevailing in GPE . The prohibition of retroactive criminal law does not apply to the case . ... \u201d", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding that , even though he was likely to serve a significantly longer prison sentence in GPE , this in itself did not constitute a violation of LAW . Nor were the general prison conditions in the receiving country such as to subject him to a risk of treatment proscribed by LAW . The risk that he might face on account of having denounced members of the drug gang had not been substantiated . In any event , there was no reason to believe that the NORP prison authorities would be unable to curb , to the extent possible , any such violence . Nor did ORG find that LAW would be violated as a result of any transfer to GPE as the sentence he would actually be serving there would not exceed the sentence imposed by the NORP courts .", "On DATE the NORP ORG requested its NORP counterpart to consent to the applicant \u2019s transfer . On DATE the Minister of Justice of GPE gave consent for the transfer to GPE . The applicant disputed the consent of the Minister of ORG in ORG and requested the annulment of the consent . On DATE ORG suspended the proceedings of the administrative case until the application at hand was examined .", "On DATE the Governor of the GPE prison decided to release the applicant conditionally on DATE .

CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c [ The proposals now made ] would not change the existing legislation as regards the possibility of obtaining a conditional release on having served CARDINAL of a sentence .
