De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was ( to her knowledge ) born in DATE and at the time of the introduction of the application was detained in PERSON , ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant entered GPE in an irregular manner by boat on CARDINAL DATE . Upon arrival , she was registered by the immigration police , given an identification number ( DATE ) , and presented with CARDINAL documents in LANGUAGE , one containing a Return Decision and the other a Removal Order .", "CARDINAL . The Return Decision stated that she was a prohibited immigrant by virtue of LAW ) because she was in GPE \u201c without means of subsistence and liable to become a charge on public funds \u201d . ORG also informed the applicant that her stay was being terminated and that she had the possibility to apply for a period of voluntary departure . LAW was based on the consideration that the applicant \u2019s request for a period of voluntary departure had been rejected . It informed the applicant that she would remain in custody until removal was effected , and that an entry ban would be issued against her . The CARDINAL documents further informed the applicant of her right to appeal against ORG before ORG ( \u201c the IAB \u201d ) within DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the contents of the decision in LANGUAGE were not explained to her , although she could not understand the language . According to the Government , in practice the immigration police inform the migrants verbally in LANGUAGE about their right to appeal , and the migrants translate for each other .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was further provided with an information leaflet entitled \u201c Your entitlements , responsibilities and obligations while in detention \u201d in LANGUAGE , a language she did not understand . According to the Government the applicant did not request a booklet in another language .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with LAW ( see Relevant domestic law ) , the applicant was detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . During the registration process upon her arrival , in the absence of an interpreter , the applicant \u2019s age was recorded as CARDINAL ( born DATE ) . She claims to have told the authorities that she was DATE . According to the Government , it emerged from the authorities\u2019 records ( not submitted to ORG ) that the applicant declared that she was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed against ORG . By DATE of the introduction of the application ( DATE ) , no date had been set for her appeal hearing by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . DATE following her arrival the applicant was called for an information session provided by the staff of ORG . She was assisted in submitting FAC ( ORG ) , thereby registering her wish to apply for asylum under LAW , LAW of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) . She stated on the form that she was DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date DATE after her arrival in GPE , the applicant was called for an interview with a member of ORG ( AWAS ) staff , who informed her that as she had claimed to be DATE she would be interviewed by CARDINAL members of ORG staff with a view to assessing the veracity of her claim that she was a minor .", "CARDINAL . DATE , CARDINAL people from AWAS interviewed her . During the interview a male detainee provided interpretation services . After the interview they informed her that as they could not confirm her minor age through the interview they would send her for a further age verification ( ORG ) test - an X - ray of the bones of the wrist . The applicant was taken for the ORG test DATE after her interview , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , as the applicant had not received any decision from the ORG , she asked a woman from ORG ( who was visiting the detention centre to conduct interviews with other detainees who had health problems ) whether she knew anything about her case . The woman told her that her X - ray was being assessed and if she was found to be a minor she would be released soon . DATE , on DATE , some other people from AWAS went to the centre and told her that according to the test she was not a minor but an adult . During the latter meeting a fellow ( female ) detainee provided translation .", "CARDINAL . By DATE of the lodging of the application the applicant had not received a written decision informing her of the outcome of the age assessment procedure . According to the Government a decision on the applicant \u2019s age was taken on DATE ; no date was submitted regarding notification . The Government submitted that since no care order was issued the applicant was obviously not a minor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained in ORG in PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , in conditions which she considered prison - like and basic . The Government contested this allegation .", "CARDINAL . She explained that the Block is divided into CARDINAL self - contained zones ( CARDINAL on the ground floor , CARDINAL on the first floor and CARDINAL on the second floor ) and CARDINAL of the zones ( B , C , D , E ) were virtually identical . For DATE of her detention she had been held in Zone E which at the time accommodated families ( i.e. couples with or without children ) , and then she was moved to GPE and D with other single women .", "CARDINAL . These zones contained a number of dormitories ( containing bunk beds but no lockers or cupboards for personal belongings ) , CARDINAL showers and toilets , a small kitchen with CARDINAL or CARDINAL hot plates and a fridge ( no further storage for food , which was stored in open boxes accessible to insects , was available ) , and a common room with CARDINAL basic metal tables and benches screwed to the ground , together with a television . Blankets hanging from bunk beds were the only means of privacy .", "CARDINAL . Access to the zones was through metal gates which were kept locked DATE , and detainees could leave the zone for DATE , which they could spend in a small dusty yard . Windows were barred and most of them glazed with opaque Perspex ( which was removed in DATE for air , though they then let air through in DATE ) . On the one hand , in DATE the facility was often crowded and the heat would become oppressive despite the presence of ceiling fans . On the other hand , in DATE it was unbearably cold as the facility was not heated and , moreover , was exposed to the elements as there were no adjoining buildings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant considered that the facility was shared by too many people \u2013 in DATE the applicant \u2019s dormitory ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL in the zone ) was shared by QUANTITY women \u2013 and agreement amongst so many different persons having cultural and linguistic differences was difficult . However , at the time of the introduction of the application , the applicant was in less crowded conditions , sharing an entire zone with CARDINAL other women , most of whom were NORP and NORP .", "CARDINAL . The applicant noted that since her arrival she had only been provided with CARDINAL bed sheets , a small towel , a blanket , a T - shirt , CARDINAL pillow and a pillow case , a few items of underwear and a pair of flip - flops , as well as a plastic plate , cup , and set of cutlery . Other items of clothing were distributed sporadically . She stated that she was never provided with a quilt , a bra or running shoes . While toilet paper was distributed on a DATE basis , certain basic items such as sanitary pads were missing . In DATE detainees were not systematically provided with warm clothes and closed shoes , which were distributed according to what was received by way of donation and which was not sufficient to supply the needs of all detainees . Although blankets were distributed to everyone , the building was not heated and DATE were unbearably cold .", "CARDINAL . Detainees had little to do DATE , and only limited access to open air . In particular , the applicant noted that she was let out into the small dirty yard for the first time only after DATE of detention . While in the yard , other male detainees called out names and picked on the women from the windows of their rooms overlooking the yard . The applicant referred to the report \u201c Not here to stay : Report of ORG on its visit to GPE on DATE \u201d , DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . She also noted that although telephone cards were distributed ( each of LAW ( EUR ) ) , the credit they contained was often insufficient to make long distance calls and no cheaper ways of keeping contact with the family or outside world were available as they had no internet access . By the time she lodged her application she had received LAW in credit . The applicant also considered inappropriate that detainees were given the same soap to use for their bodies , hair , clothes and floor . The applicant further made reference to an incident with a detention officer who had pushed her down the stairs and tried to forcefully resuscitate her by slapping her and grabbing different parts of her face leaving her in pain \u2013 she , however , admitted that she could not recognise the officer in question and that she had feared reprisal had she reported the matter .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , as could be seen from the results of ORG ( JRS ) LOC study on detention of vulnerable asylum seekers , the physical conditions of detention and their impact on the physical and mental well - being of detainees were exacerbated by other factors . These factors included : length of detention , lack of constructive activities to occupy detainees , overcrowding , limited access to open air , difficulties in communication with staff and with other detainees , and lack of information about one \u2019s situation . Moreover , there was a lack of any real possibility of obtaining effective redress and inmates knew that detention was not serving any useful purpose and was in no way proportionate to the aim to be achieved .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that all of those objective factors had had a particular impact on her because of her personal circumstances , particularly her young age , her inability to communicate in anything but NORP and the fact that as a young woman she was detained in a facility administered almost exclusively by men .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was called for an interview with the Refugee Commissioner . By means of a decision of the Refugee Commissioner of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was granted subsidiary protection in GPE . She was notified of this decision and released on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
