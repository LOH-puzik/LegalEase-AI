CARDINAL of the offences involved setting fire to the front door of a flat thereby killing CARDINAL of the CARDINAL members of CARDINAL family asleep there at the time . A recommendation was made by the trial judge that he should serve not less that twenty years\u2019 imprisonment in view , inter alia , of the appalling nature of the crimes and his previous criminal record which indicated that he was \" a ruthless man of violence \" .", "Mr PERSON was initially classified as a Category B prisoner , the minimum classification for any prisoner either sentenced to CARDINAL or more GPE imprisonment or convicted of a crime involving serious violence . Following an incident at FAC he was charged with a number of offences and was re - classified as a Category A prisoner , the classification pertaining to the group of inmates requiring the highest degree of security . These charges were later abandoned by the ORG but he remained a Category A prisoner from DATE until DATE .

In a further letter dated DATE to the Governor of ORG his solicitor claimed that the letter of DATE had not been answered in its entirety as he had been given no assurance by the Deputy Governor that letters to PERSON would not be subject to interference . On DATE the Deputy Governor replied that incoming mail from solicitors concerning an application to the Commission , suitably identified by placing ( a ) the name of the solicitor \u2019s firm and ( b ) the initials ORG in a prominent position on the envelope , would be opened in the presence of the prisoner and handed to him unread ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

The applicant \u2019s solicitor applied for legal aid to bring civil proceedings in respect of the interference with the applicant \u2019s correspondence .

The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was refused on DATE by ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL .

Secretary of ORG for GPE ( judgment of ORG of ORG of DATE ) which concerned the reading of a prisoner \u2019s correspondence with a legal adviser relating to potential legal proceedings . The ORG considered inter alia that LAW ( CARDINAL ) could not be described as irrational since \" it can not be supposed that there are no sound grounds for requiring control over correspondence involving a prisoner even when it takes place between him and his legal adviser \" .", "CARDINAL . In the case of remand prisoners , Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides that they shall be allowed to write to their legal advisers . Under Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) any confidential written communications prepared by such a prisoner as instructions for his legal adviser may be delivered to the legal adviser without being examined by any officer of the prison unless the Governor has reason to suppose that it contains matters not relating to such instructions . Under Rule CARDINAL this facility is also available to convicted prisoners who are the subject of further charges . Similar provisions apply under Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) to an appellant in connection with his appeal .", "CARDINAL . These rules are supplemented by Standing Order M , which deals in detail with communications between prisoners and others . Copies of this Standing Order are available to prisoners and the public .

Such correspondence may not be stopped on the grounds that it contains material prohibited by Standing Order MaCARDINAL ( j ) unless it is clear that the inmate is not seeking legal advice but is writing for some other purpose . \"", "The procedure to be followed in respect of such correspondence was described in a ORG issued to ORG on DATE . The solicitor is required to send such mail within a sealed envelope bearing the words \" Legal Proceedings \" and his signature . This envelope is placed within another envelope addressed to the Prison Governor . The inner envelope is passed unopened to the prisoner .", "When a prisoner is not yet a party to legal proceedings , but is contemplating bringing them , all mail is liable to be opened and read .
