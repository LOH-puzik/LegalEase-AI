NORP However , the court held that the applicant could not inherit her natural father \u2019s estate as she had been born out of wedlock .

PERSON had been a NORP citizen who had lived in GPE . PERSON had been part of GPE until DATE and the law in force in that province had been the NORP Civil Code of DATE ( NORP b\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch \u2013 \u201c the ABGB \u201d ) .

The court further maintained that according to LAW the law applicable to the proceedings was the law in force at the time of a person \u2019s death . In that regard it was first necessary to establish on which country \u2019s territory the applicant \u2019s father had been at the time of his death on DATE . The court held that DATE PERSON had been part of GPE and the capital of GPE ( wojew\u00f3dztwo lwowskie ) . On DATE the NORP uprising had begun , lasting until DATE .

The applicant lodged a cassation appeal , relying in general on the case - law and provisions of LAW", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal . It held that it was not justified to raise the issue of a significant legal question only by making a general reference to Convention case - law . A mere statement that the intertemporal rule DATE which meant that the law in force at the time of opening the succession was the relevant law \u2013 was incompatible with unspecified Convention provisions was not enough to qualify as a legal issue . The legal issue raised by the applicant had concerned in principle the interpretation of intertemporal provisions , however , she had not specified why Article PERSON of the Introductory Provisions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) should not have been interpreted literally in her case . The court stated further that there were no grounds to rely on the provisions and values of the Convention as Poland had not been bound by it at the time of the opening of the succession .", "CARDINAL .
