{"ITEMID": "001-5962", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "GREEN v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a GPE national , born in DATE and living in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , after a marriage of DATE , the applicant \u2019s husband , PERSON , petitioned for divorce . A decree nisi was granted on DATE . The applicant meanwhile had been seeking legal advice from solicitors concerning inter alia whether to contest the divorce and ancillary matters .", "Legal aid was granted to the applicant on a limited basis on DATE concerning ancillary relief . On DATE the decree absolute of divorce was granted .", "On DATE , PERSON swore an affidavit as to his financial circumstances . On DATE , the applicant swore an affidavit in support of her application for ancillary relief and in reply to PERSON affidavit .", "Directions for the conduct of the dispute on ancillary matters were given by ORG on DATE . Lists of documents were provided in DATE . There was correspondence between the applicant \u2019s solicitors and PERSON about a possible settlement . Her solicitors stated that they were willing to settle for a capital sum and QUANTITY ( GBP ) per month as maintenance . PERSON counter offer was GBP CARDINAL out of the sale of the matrimonial home and GBP CARDINAL per month . The applicant rejected the counter offer .", "The hearing date was set for CARDINAL DATE . The applicant was requested by the solicitor to attend to meet counsel before the hearing began . Her solicitor took attendance notes of this meeting which took place shortly before the hearing was due to begin . According to this note , a decision was reached that it be more advantageous for the applicant to effect a clean break and obtain an enhanced interest in the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home than pursue future periodic payments . After negotiation with PERSON , a figure of GBP DATE was agreed upon ( PERCENT of the valuation of the property ) and that Mr G would pay the costs . A consent order was made by the court reflecting these terms under section CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE .", "Shortly afterwards , the applicant expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of the settlement . She sought legal advice concerning the possibility of appealing the consent order and was advised by counsel that there were no grounds of appeal . The applicant wrote letters of complaint to ORG about the order and was informed that she had agreed to ORG . She made complaint to ORG in or DATE . On DATE , after inviting her solicitors comments , the ORG concluded that the applicant had been \u201c properly represented \u201d and had reached her decision with the benefit of full legal advice . On DATE , the applicant complained to ORG , who in DATE concluded that no further action was justified .", "In or DATE , the applicant instructed new solicitors IM , with a view to commencing proceedings against her former solicitors for negligence in advising her to accept the settlement , which had caused her significant loss , inter alia , of pension and inheritance entitlements which had not been taken properly into account . Legal aid was granted in or DATE . Counsel advised at this stage that she had good prospects of success in establishing negligence and would probably recover some GBP CARDINAL damages .", "A writ was issued against the former solicitors in ORG on DATE . In their defence , served in DATE , the former solicitors claimed inter alia that they had relied on and been entitled to rely upon advice of competent and properly instructed counsel , PERSON", "In DATE , the former solicitors made a payment into court of GBP CARDINAL . The applicant was informed that if the court later awarded a smaller sum , she would liable in costs for DATE . Counsel advised that her prospects of securing more in court were good and the payment into court was not accepted . A further offer of settlement of ORG plus costs was also rejected . Counsel advised the applicant at that stage that she should not settle for less than GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "On DATE , the former solicitors increased the payment into court to GBP CARDINAL .", "On DATE , ORG decided , in the case of PERSON v. ORG , that , for public policy reasons , a barrister was immune from suit for negligence in the conduct of a case where a settlement had been reached and a consent order made under LAW , which by law required the approval of the court .", "On DATE , the former solicitors sent a copy of the decision to the applicant \u2019s solicitors IM . On DATE , counsel advised the applicant to accept the payment into court of GBP CARDINAL . He noted that ORG judgment \u201c has , to put it mildly , flaws in its reasoning \u201d . However despite his strong doubts that it had been correctly decided , it had to be accepted that on CARDINAL view of ORG judgment , and if it was not overturned on appeal to ORG , the applicant would not be entitled to any compensation at all . Having regard to the new element of uncertainty introduced by PERSON v. PERSON , he considered that it was in her best interests to accept the payment into court .", "On DATE , IM solicitors sent the applicant a copy of the advice and informed her that a refusal to accept the advice was likely to lead to a discharge of the legal aid certificate .", "Reluctantly , the applicant accepted the payment - in and the claim against her former solicitors was struck off .", "For DATE , barristers enjoyed an immunity from actions in negligence . In the case of Rondel v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL ) ORG unanimously upheld the immunity for alleged negligent conduct of a case in court on considerations of public policy on the basis inter alia that \u201c it would be a retrograde development if an advocate were under pressure unwarrantably to subordinate his duty to the court to his duty to his client \u201d and also due to the undesirability of relitigating issues already decided . Though their Lordships were not unanimous about the exact scope of the immunity , they agreed that it should in general terms be confined to acts concerned with the conduct of litigation and should not apply to non - contentious work .", "The immunity was again considered by ORG in the case of PERSON v. PERSON Mitchell & Co. ( [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) , where the majority , applying the test from the PERSON v. PERSON case in GPE , found that the immunity only applied to work so intimately connected with the conduct of the case in court so as to amount to a decision as to how it would be conducted at the hearing . A failure by a barrister to advise parties about the expiry of a limitation period therefore was found to fall outside the immunity . Doubts were further expressed as to the various rationales given for the immunity .", "Another line of authority applied the doctrine of abuse of process to avoid relitigating between different parties issues already decided by a court of competent jurisdiction or , as sometimes described , to avoid a collateral challenge to an earlier judgment or order of the court ( see e.g. PERSON v. Chief Constable of the West Midlands [ DATE ] A.C.CARDINAL ) . This had been applied in a number of cases brought against lawyers , for example , in GPE v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) , where the plaintiff \u2019s claim against solicitors for wrongly pressurising him to plead guilty in a criminal case was an abuse of process as the action necessarily involved an attack on the conviction and sentence imposed on him by the trial judge and upheld by ORG .", "In the case of PERSON v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] QB CARDINAL , judgment given on DATE ) , on DATE of a hearing of a matrimonial ancillary application , the plaintiff \u2019s barrister had advised her to reach a settlement agreement and this was embodied in a consent order by the court . The plaintiff brought proceedings in negligence against the barrister for negotiating and advising her to accept a settlement which left her unable to finance the mortgage repayments on the matrimonial home after it had been transferred into her name . ORG upheld the decisions striking out the action on the basis of forensic immunity of advocates . Though Judge PERSON considered that the settlement of litigation was not normally encompassed within the principles on which the immunity of the advocate was based , and that there were no public policy considerations justifying a blanket immunity from suit for negligent advice which results in the settlement of a claim , he considered that , where the court had given approval of the settlement and assumed responsibility for the merits of the consent order , the advocate could claim immunity from suit for his role . PERSON and ORG appeared to consider , though with different reasoning , that a consent order made and approved under LAW of DATE had such an intimate connection with the conduct of the case in court that it came within the PERSON v. PERSON test .", "The PERSON v. ORG judgment was distinguished shortly afterwards in the case of PERSON v. PERSON and PERSON ( QBD , CARDINAL DATE ) where the plaintiff was suing her solicitors for their advice to settle her ancillary application against her husband at the court door . Toulson J had held that public policy did not require protection of solicitors for negligence in relation to their conduct before a case reached court . Although the court had approved the consent order , the wife had alleged that , due to the solicitors\u2019 negligence , the court had given its approval without all the relevant facts . If through the negligence of a party \u2019s legal adviser a judge was not properly informed , and therefore exercised his discretion on a flawed basis , it was not contrary to public policy to allow the wife to sue the legal adviser for negligence .", "Both the ORG immunity and issues concerning abusive challenge of previous court decisions and orders were considered in the case of ORG v. PERSON and Others . This concerned CARDINAL cases in which clients raised claims in negligence against firms of solicitors in respect of settlements of claims resulting in consent orders by the court and where the solicitors relied on the immunity of advocates from suit .", "On DATE , ORG found that the immunity did not apply in these cases . It held that there was no general rule that counsel was , or was not , immune from liability in settling a case or in advising a client to settle . The existence of the immunity depended on the facts of the particular case and whether public policy required it in those circumstances . It found that the PERSON v. PERSON case was a very difficult case to follow and apply , or to derive any clear principle from . On DATE , by a majority , ORG held that the solicitors were not entitled to rely on an immunity in these civil actions and that there were no longer any public policy considerations requiring that such an immunity be retained . Several of their Lordships commented that they would be in favour of some form of the immunity remaining for advocates in criminal cases ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
