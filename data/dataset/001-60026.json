The first CARDINAL applicants are the parents of the third and fourth applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants say that on several occasions DATE they were violently assaulted by skinheads in GPE . Indeed , in DATE Mr ORG had been so seriously injured in an assault that he had had to be hospitalised . The police had been called but had refused to intervene . DATE Mr and PERSON had been subjected to renewed insults and threats by skinheads , but the police had again refused to intervene .", "As a result of those constant threats , the applicants had decided to flee GPE and travel to GPE , where they had arrived at DATE : Mr \u010conka and the CARDINAL minor children on DATE and PERSON DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested political asylum in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE their applications for asylum were declared inadmissible by the Minister of the ORG through ORG on the ground that they had not produced sufficient evidence to show that their lives were at risk in GPE for the purposes of LAW relating to LAW . The decisions refusing permission to remain in GPE were accompanied by a decision refusing permission to enter the territory itself , endorsed with an order to leave the territory within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal under the urgent - applications procedure with the Commissioner - General for Refugees and Stateless Persons ( \u201c the Commissioner - General \u201d ) against the decisions refusing them permission to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr \u010conka was invited to attend the Commissioner - General 's Office to set out his grounds for seeking asylum . He failed to keep the appointment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , assisted by an interpreter , was heard by representatives of ORG , where she was in custody pending trial . On CARDINAL DATE she was sentenced to DATE imprisonment for theft by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Commissioner - ORG upheld the decision of ORG refusing the applicants permission to remain . Its decision in Mr ORG 's case was based on his failure to attend his appointment without showing due cause . As regards PERSON , in CARDINAL pages of reasons the Commissioner - General pointed out major discrepancies in her deposition and expressed serious doubts about her credibility .", "For example , PERSON had declared among other things that on DATE her husband , Mr ORG , had been assaulted by skinheads so violently that he had had to be taken to hospital . The police had been called but had not come out . That incident had been the direct cause of their decision to flee GPE . However , the Commissioner - General considered that statement to be refuted by the fact that the travel tickets had been issued before the above incident of DATE : PERSON plane ticket on DATE and her husband 's and their children 's bus tickets for the journey to GPE on DATE . Furthermore , PERSON account of the incident did not match her stepdaughter 's , in particular on the important issue of whether the police had attended the scene .", "The Commissioner - General stipulated in his decisions that the applicants could be deported to the country from which they had fled ( GPE ) , and that for the purposes of calculating the DATE period for leaving the territory , which had been suspended by the application under the urgent procedure , time began to run again from the date of service of the decisions on the applicants .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicants lodged applications with the ORG d'Etat for judicial review of the decision of DATE and for a stay of execution under the ordinary procedure . They also applied for legal aid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG d'Etat dismissed the applications for legal aid on the grounds that they had not been accompanied by the means certificate required by LAW , a photocopy , rather than the original , of the certificate having been enclosed with PERSON application . Consequently , the applicants were invited by the orders refusing legal aid to pay the court fees within DATE after service . As they failed to respond to that invitation , their applications for judicial review and for a stay of execution were struck out of the list on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE the GPE police sent a notice to a number of NORP GPE families , including the applicants , requiring them to attend the police station on DATE . The notice was drafted in NORP and NORP and stated that their attendance was required to enable the files concerning their applications for asylum to be completed .", "CARDINAL . At the police station , where a NORP - speaking interpreter was also present , the applicants were served with a fresh order to leave the territory dated DATE , accompanied by a decision for their removal to GPE and their detention for that purpose . The documents served , which were all in identical terms , informed the recipients that they could apply to the PERSON d'Etat for judicial review of the deportation order and for a stay of execution \u2013 provided that they did so within DATE of service of the decision DATE and to the committals division ( chambre du conseil ) of the criminal court against the order for their detention . According to the Government , some of the aliens concerned were nevertheless allowed to leave the police station of their own free will on humanitarian grounds or for administrative reasons .", "CARDINAL . TIME the applicants and other GPE families , accompanied by an interpreter , were taken to a closed transit centre , known as \u201c LOC CARDINAL bis \u201d , at ORG near FAC .

While at the centre , the NORP families received visits from a delegation of NORP members of ORG , the NORP Consul , delegates of various non - governmental organisations and doctors . At TIME on DATE the applicants ' counsel , PERSON , was informed by the President of ORG that his clients were in custody . Taking the view that he was still instructed by them , PERSON sent a fax on DATE to ORG informing it that the applicants were in LOC CARDINAL bis awaiting repatriation to GPE . He requested that no action be taken to deport them , as they had to take care of a member of their family who was in hospital . However , PERSON did not appeal against the deportation or detention orders made on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the families concerned were taken to FAC , where the seat numbers allocated to them in the aircraft were marked on their hands with a ballpoint pen .

Reports I have received from the mayor of GPE and ORG indicate that the operation was properly prepared , even if the unfortunate wording of the letter sent by the GPE police to some of the NORP may have been misleading . Both ORG and ORG were surprised by the large number of NORP who responded to the notice sent to them .

In a judgment of DATE ORG reversed a decision of ORG of ORG ordering an alien 's release . ORG had held that , contrary to LAW , the authorities had deprived the alien of an effective remedy in law by interpreting the fact that appeals to the ORG d'Etat had no suspensive effect as meaning that it was lawful for illegal immigrants to be forcibly expelled . ORG held that , on the contrary , the issue whether an alien who had applied for refugee status had an effective remedy for the purposes of LAW had to be examined in the light of the procedure as a whole . After observing that appeals to the Commissioner - General for Refugees and Stateless Persons under the urgent procedure were of suspensive effect and that aliens were entitled , when lodging applications with the ORG d'Etat for judicial review , to apply at the same time for a stay of execution under the ordinary or extremely urgent procedure , it concluded that those remedies taken as a whole satisfied the requirements of LAW .", "CARDINAL .
