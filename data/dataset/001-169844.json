He used to be a politician . In DATE he established and was chairman of ORG ( PERSON partija ) in GPE . In the parliamentary elections of DATE , ORG obtained more votes than any other political party . DATE and DATE the applicant was Minister of the Economy , but resigned from that post after ORG ( PERSON tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija ) found that he had breached the principle of not mixing private and public interests .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a criminal investigation was opened on suspicion of fraudulent accounting by ORG . The authorities suspected that the applicant , acting in complicity with CARDINAL other members of that party NORP the party treasurer and CARDINAL high - level administrators \u2013 as well as CARDINAL other person , had doctored ORG accounts . ORG , as a legal entity , was also a suspect in the case .", "DATE the authorities searched the applicant \u2019s home in GPE town , as well as ORG headquarters .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the prosecutor attempted to call the applicant for questioning . However , the applicant could not be reached on his telephone , nor summoned . The applicant \u2019s wife explained to the prosecutor that the last time she had seen her husband was in DATE , when he had left for GPE . The applicant \u2019s wife refused to give any other testimony related to her husband .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent the NORP Attorney General a letter to the effect that he was aware of the ongoing pre - trial investigation regarding him and ORG , and that some of his party colleagues had already been questioned . He claimed that he was staying in GPE , without disclosing his exact address . He asserted that the criminal case was \u201c a dirty political game \u201d ( teisin\u0117s institucijos dalyvauja ne\u0161variame politiniame \u017eaidime ) and had no basis , and expressed his intention to involve international organisations in his case . He also stated that he would return to GPE when his family circumstances permitted . In particular , his brother had recently died in GPE and his mother needed support .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant resigned from the post of ORG chairman .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG website made public the applicant \u2019s \u201c Letter to ORG ( PERSON \u017emon\u0117ms ) , in which he stated that he would not hurry to return to GPE because he was expecting the [ NORP ] authorities to start a search for him . He did not wish to be questioned in GPE , and wanted international organisations to be involved in his proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor decided to declare the applicant a suspect in the criminal case . The prosecutor found that , as chairman of ORG and also acting in an organised group with other members of that party , the applicant had sought to finance the party unlawfully and to avoid the financial supervision of the party and its political campaigns , by organising the party \u2019s fraudulent accounting from DATE . As a result , it had been impossible to establish the structure of the party \u2019s assets and expenditure for DATE . In particular , ORG had omitted from its accounts CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) worth of income , and some LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately LAW ) worth of expenditure . The applicant had also provided inaccurate data to ORG and the tax authorities . This was in breach of a number of Criminal Code provisions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , as well as the PERSON on the Funding of Political Parties and ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Vilnius City Second District Court sanctioned , in absentia , the applicant \u2019s arrest and remand in custody on the grounds that he had known about the criminal proceedings but was hiding in GPE and had failed to present himself to the prosecutors to take part in the criminal proceedings . It was reasonable to assume that the applicant would continue to hide from the NORP authorities , thus obstructing the investigation . On DATE the prosecutor ordered a search for the applicant .", "In DATE both decisions were made available to the applicant \u2019s lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at the ORG congress , another person was elected as chairman of ORG in the applicant \u2019s place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the authorities of GPE arrested the applicant in GPE . On DATE he asked for political asylum in GPE and was immediately released . On the basis of information that reached them by ORG , the NORP prosecutors then asked their colleagues in GPE to arrest the applicant and to extradite him to GPE .", "By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the Deputy Attorney General of ORG refused the request , relying on LAW , which states that extradition will not be granted if the offence in respect of which it is requested is regarded by the requested ORG as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence .", "CARDINAL . Having taken into account the criminal charges in respect of ORG , including evidence by independent auditors , on DATE ORG decided not to allocate it appropriations from the ORG budget .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG confirmed the applicant as a ORG candidate in elections to the municipal council of the GPE district . Given that electoral candidates in municipal elections had immunity from prosecution , the prosecutor asked ORG to permit the restriction of the applicant \u2019s freedom and his prosecution ( see LAW on the Elections to the Seimas , cited in paragraph CARDINAL below ) . At a hearing attended by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , the prosecutor and representatives of the media and ORG , ORG granted that request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , who asserted that the restriction of his client \u2019s liberty was in breach of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention because he would then be unable to meet potential voters and proclaim his electoral programme . The NORP court had regard to the ORG \u2019s case - law on the subject and emphasised that the right to stand for elections was not absolute ( ORG referred to GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINALVI ) . Moreover , according to the ORG guidelines , fundamental rights and freedoms , including the freedom to move within a ORG , could be limited in order to protect the public interest ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the applicant \u2019s case , he had not been denied the very essence of his right to be elected . The ORG , for its part , had an obligation to prosecute criminal acts and to take measures to ensure that criminal proceedings were not unduly protracted . The applicant had been hiding from prosecution in GPE , which showed that he had deliberately breached NORP law by avoiding arrest which had earlier been sanctioned by a court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG did not find erroneous the argument put forward by ORG that \u201c the applicant sought immunity status as a candidate in his own interests , which essentially had no connection with his electoral rights \u201d . One could not dismiss the likelihood that if immunity from prosecution was granted , the applicant could return to GPE , and would leave the country before his immunity expired [ elected members of municipal councils do not have immunity from prosecution , see paragraph CARDINAL below ] . This would undermine society \u2019s trust in the ORG and in the LOC duty to investigate crimes and prosecute perpetrators to protect society from attempts to commit crime .", "CARDINAL . ORG also emphasised that the prosecutor \u2019s request to lift the applicant \u2019s immunity had no connection with his participation in the municipal elections ; nor was it intended to prevent the applicant from being elected . In fact , the criminal proceedings had started long before the municipal elections , the date of which was not announced by the Seimas until DATE . The applicant therefore had plenty of time to return to GPE from hiding in GPE and to testify in the criminal case , thus also being able to fully take part in the municipal elections .", "CARDINAL . Whilst de facto residing in GPE , the applicant took part in the municipal elections in GPE on DATE , and was successfully elected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted a request submitted by the applicant to annul his powers as a member of the municipal council .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , GPE , a member of ORG ( PERSON ) political party , who was elected to the Seimas for the term from DATE to DATE representing the PERSON constituency , became mayor of the ORG district municipality and therefore resigned from the ORG .", "In DATE ORG consequently announced new elections to the Seimas in that constituency .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , ORG decided to take part in the parliamentary elections in the PERSON constituency , which were to take place on CARDINAL and , if necessary , on DATE ( second round of voting ) . ORG confirmed the applicant as its candidate in that constituency .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG confirmed the applicant as a candidate in the LAW elections .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG announced the list of CARDINAL candidates who were to stand in that single - member constituency . The applicant \u2019s name was among those listed , and the electoral campaign started on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a spokesperson for the ORG President stated that the President found it \u2018 odd that a person who had asked for political asylum in GPE , decried the NORP institutions and was being searched for by the NORP law - enforcement authorities , could be registered as a candidate in the parliamentary elections\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of a request by the prosecutor , on DATE ORG decided that the applicant could be arrested or his liberty could be otherwise restricted during the electoral campaign , until he was elected and took the oath as a parliamentarian .", "The applicant appealed through his lawyer . He relied , inter alia , on LAW . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . By a final decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal . It noted that the immunities of candidates in municipal elections were analogous to those applied in the context of elections to the Seimas . The grounds for lifting the applicant \u2019s immunity had already been decided by the res judicata ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) . No new factual circumstances had been brought to the court \u2019s attention to justify a different ruling .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , accompanied by a group of ORG Members of ORG , returned to ORG from GPE on DATE . On DATE he was arrested , signed the notice of the offences of which he was suspected , was questioned and remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing before the GPE City Second District Court of DATE , at which the applicant was present , the court decided to vary the remand measure to house arrest . The court noted that the earlier court order to arrest and detain the applicant had been adopted whilst he was being searched for ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Now , that he had returned to GPE from GPE , and was not refusing to testify , a milder remand measure could be imposed . The court thus ordered the applicant to stay at his home in GPE town from TIME , not to leave the GPE town area , not to communicate with the CARDINAL other suspects in his criminal case , and not to attend public places ( nesilankyti vie\u0161osiose vietose ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to release him from house arrest , claiming that such a remand measure interfered with his electoral rights , in particular , to meet with voters in the PERSON electoral district . The applicant relied on LAW No . CARDINAL . He also mentioned that he wished to leave PERSON town so that he could visit a medical establishment in another town .", "For his part , the prosecutor lodged an appeal with ORG , urging it to impose pre - trial detention on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . During the first round of voting in the PERSON single - member constituency , which took place on DATE , the applicant and another candidate received , respectively , CARDINAL and MONEY of the votes . They would thus compete in a second round of elections , which was scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a final ruling of DATE , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision to place the applicant under house arrest , with the exception that he was now allowed to visit public places from TIME to CARDINAL p.m. The prohibition on his leaving GPE town remained effective . The court held that the applicant should be kept under house arrest in order to protect interests important to society : he had earlier been hiding from the prosecutor , the sums not accounted for by ORG amounted to CARDINAL of NORP litai , and there was reason to believe that he could obstruct the investigation . The court also considered that house arrest would not interfere with the applicant \u2019s electoral rights or with his business or family interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG asked ORG to intervene as an intermediary with a view to the prosecutors mitigating the remand measure , house arrest , so that the applicant could compete in the parliamentary electoral campaign on equal grounds .", "On DATE ORG answered in the negative : should it express any opinion about the reasonableness of the applicant \u2019s remand measure , this could be interpreted as undue interference with the courts\u2019 competence and a breach of the principle of separation of powers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant himself asked the prosecutors to modify the remand measure for the period of DATE , and to allow him to leave PERSON town so that he could go to the PERSON constituency , situated QUANTITY away , to meet the voters and compete with the other candidate on equal terms . The applicant stated that his meetings with the voters during the second round of elections would start on DATE . He also added a CARDINAL - page document describing the schedule of meetings between members of his party , including some renowned party members , and voters . From the documents in the ORG \u2019s possession it transpires that those meetings had already taken place from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , that is , before the first voting round , in the PERSON constituency . The schedule indicated that the applicant would have taken part in those meetings had the prosecutors allowed him to meet the voters .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the prosecutor rejected the applicant \u2019s request . He noted that the applicant had earlier made public statements that he could lead the electoral campaign even without physically being in GPE . For the prosecutor , the applicant could also take part in the electoral campaign by other means provided for by law , and without violating the conditions of his house arrest . The prosecutor stressed that house arrest had been imposed on the applicant by a court ruling of DATE and had been upheld by a higher court on CARDINAL DATE . Accordingly , the applicant must have known in advance , and before making plans for meeting voters , about the limitations his house arrest entailed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked the prosecutor to permit the applicant to leave PERSON town for the PERSON constituency during the electoral campaign . The following day the prosecutor rejected that request , relying on the grounds set out by the earlier court rulings of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , and the prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant also lodged an appeal with the higher prosecutor , asking him to modify the remand measure , house arrest , and to permit him to meet voters \u201c eye - to - eye \u201d in order to compete in the elections on equal grounds with the other candidate . The applicant also insisted that he wanted permission to leave ORG town in order to visit doctors in other towns and for his business interests . Quoting certain information in the press , the applicant insisted that there had been a political decision to prevent him from becoming elected .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed by the higher prosecutor on DATE . The prosecutor noted that the applicant had known of the final ORG ruling of CARDINAL DATE , which was not amenable to appeal , but had ignored it . Despite the adoption of that ruling , he had drawn up a schedule of meetings with voters . There were no new circumstances warranting a change in the applicant \u2019s remand measure . The prosecutor \u2019s decision was sent to the applicant on DATE , and could have been appealed against to the court .", "The applicant claimed that he had received that decision on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the second round of voting in the PERSON constituency on DATE , the applicant received CARDINAL votes ( or MONEY of the votes cast ) . The other candidate , who was a member of the ORG political party , received CARDINAL votes ( or MONEY of the votes cast ) , and thus became a member of the Seimas .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was re - elected as chairman of ORG .", "CARDINAL . After the parliamentary elections , the prosecutor granted or refused a number of the applicant \u2019s requests to leave his home in GPE . In particular , in DATE the prosecutor permitted the applicant to leave PERSON town so that he could visit , during the daytime \u2013 TIME a cemetery in a village situated in GPE district for All Saints Day on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant asked the prosecutor for permission to visit the ORG sports school , situated in GPE in the GPE district , where ORG congress ( rinkiminis suva\u017eiavimas ) was to take place . The applicant pointed out that GPE and GPE town \u201c touched each other on the map \u201d ( Vilaini\u0173 kaimas ir GPE miestas ribojasi , tod\u0117l ORG sporto mokykla yra prakti\u0161kai ant kaimo ir miesto ribos ) . He also asked the prosecutor for permission to attend the same sports school to play tennis CARDINAL times a week , a sport that the applicant had practised previously . The prosecutor granted those requests .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the prosecutor permitted the applicant to leave GPE town to visit , DATE , doctors in GPE , a town situated QUANTITY from GPE town .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant also asked the prosecutor for permission to take part in a live show , \u201c Dancing with the Stars \u201d , which was to be filmed TIME on DATE in the FAC leisure and entertainment centre ( pramog\u0173 centre ) in GPE . The prosecutor declined the request , holding that the timing was incompatible with the house arrest , which was imposed on the applicant from TIME The prosecutor pointed out that the applicant had known beforehand about the house arrest conditions , which did not match those of the television show .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the prosecutor also refused a request made by DATE previously to be permitted to travel to GPE to attend a meeting of ORG and NORP for ORG ( NORP demokrat\u0173 partija ) , scheduled for DATE . The prosecutor referred to the ruling of ORG of DATE and noted that such a request could not be granted because the applicant had been avoiding justice for a long time . Moreover , \u201c the house arrest prohibited the applicant from even leaving the area of GPE .", "CARDINAL . With the prosecutor \u2019s permission , in DATE the applicant visited a cardiology clinic in GPE . The doctors there recommended that the applicant return to that clinic for consultations and for more profound tests in DATE . Having obtained a fresh authorisation by the prosecutor , in DATE the applicant stayed in the GPE clinic for TIME and underwent several more tests DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant asked the prosecutor to permit him to stay DATE in a convalescence sanatorium in GPE ( a town situated QUANTITY from PERSON ) . The applicant referred to the NORP cardiologists\u2019 recommendations and stated that the necessary procedures could be performed only in that particular sanatorium . The prosecutor granted the request , also stressing that the applicant had earlier requested to see the material in the case file , but had never come to the prosecutor \u2019s office to see them . The applicant had until DATE to do so ( see the following paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . The pre - trial investigation in the criminal case was terminated on DATE , and the applicant was then allowed to see the material in the case file until DATE and , if necessary , to make requests to supplement the file .", "CARDINAL . According to a survey of the press carried out at the applicant \u2019s request , from DATE until DATE , the words \u201c ORG ... suspect \u201d , \u201c PERSON ... suspect \u201d had been mentioned in CARDINAL press articles .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal case was transferred to ORG for examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG released the applicant from house arrest . The court modified that remand measure to an obligation not to leave his place of residence in GPE town for DATE without informing the authorities , and to pay bail of LTL CARDINAL . The applicant also signed an agreement not to communicate with the CARDINAL other persons suspected in the criminal case .", "CARDINAL . During the parliamentary elections of DATE , the applicant and another member of his political party , who was a co - accused in the criminal case , were elected to the Seimas from DATE to DATE for ORG . They therefore obtained immunity from prosecution . In DATE the ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s prosecution and the restriction of his freedom . The Seimas also permitted the prosecution of the applicant \u2019s co - accused .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE of ORG , the remand measure \u2013 the obligation not to leave the applicant \u2019s place of residence DATE was revoked . The other remand measure , bail , remained in force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was elected to ORG as a ORG Member . He resigned his parliamentary seat in GPE , because under NORP law a Member of ORG could not be a member of the LAW at the same time ( see paragraph DATE below ) . The NORP authorities then asked ORG to lift the applicant \u2019s immunity in order to allow his prosecution . The prosecutor stated , inter alia , that as a result of fraudulent book - keeping of ORG and the submission of such information to ORG and the tax authorities in DATE , the ORG had suffered serious pecuniary damage in the sum of about LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , because appropriations had been allocated to ORG from the ORG budget .", "CARDINAL . Having heard the applicant , and having had regard to a report by ORG , in DATE ORG lifted the applicant \u2019s immunity , thus allowing the criminal proceedings in GPE to continue ( decision ORG ) . ORG noted that the applicant had been charged with offences of false accounting in relation to the financing of a political party during a period prior to his election to ORG . No cogent evidence had been adduced as to the existence of any fumus persecutionis and the offences with which the applicant had been charged had nothing to do with his activities as a Member of ORG .", "CARDINAL .

At the request of the NORP courts , in DATE ORG lifted the applicant \u2019s immunity . This time ORG noted , inter alia , that the criminal proceedings at issue were identical , in terms of content , to the proceedings in respect of which it had already lifted the applicant \u2019s immunity in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . At that time the applicant had been charged with , in essence , heading an organised group with the aim of committing a number of criminal offences , with disregard for his duty , as party chairman , to monitor the party \u2019s finances . For example , fictitious books were allegedly kept in order to conceal revenue and expenditure . In general , he was alleged to have frequently given instructions not to officially declare or record various business and financial transactions . From the documents in ORG possession it was clear that the definition of the offences giving rise to the charges against the applicant had always remained the same . Moreover , no convincing evidence was available to demonstrate fumus persecutionis . The offences of which the applicant was accused had nothing to do with his work as a Member of ORG . Lastly , ORG noted that the decision on the waiver of immunity in no way constituted a statement of opinion regarding the applicant \u2019s guilt or innocence , as this was the subject of national proceedings .", "CARDINAL .
