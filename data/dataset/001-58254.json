SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 8", "JUDGES": "R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr ORG was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . Since DATE he has worked as a bus driver .", "CARDINAL . The applicant met PERSON in DATE . They were friends but did not have a steady relationship . On DATE PERSON gave birth to a daughter , PERSON , of whom the applicant was the father . The applicant visited PERSON and the child at the maternity ward on CARDINAL occasion . In DATE he met PERSON twice at K.W. \u2019s home . He also attended PERSON \u2019s christening . During DATE , he once looked after PERSON for TIME . No further contacts took place between the applicant and his daughter that year .", "As appears from a report by ORG ( socialn\u00e4mnden ) of PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , PERSON claimed that the applicant had a problem with alcohol and considered it inappropriate that he met the daughter unless he was sober . The applicant maintained that he gave up his attempts to see PERSON , in part because he felt obstructed by PERSON , in part because his continued commitment to the daughter had been undermined by difficulties in his job . He had also had problems with alcohol .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , these problems ceased when he met PERSON in DATE . She had a DATE son . They started cohabiting in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON met PERSON They began to live together in DATE . PERSON and PERSON married in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant met his daughter once in DATE . He wished to see her more often but PERSON allegedly opposed further contacts . However , the applicant saw the daughter from time to time DATE when he and PERSON took her son to his childminder , who lived close to PERSON \u2019s childminder . The applicant met PERSON again in DATE when she attended PERSON \u2019s son \u2019s birthday party .", "CARDINAL . Since PERSON allegedly refused the applicant access to PERSON , he contacted the social authorities in GPE in DATE and asked for help in arranging for access to M. In DATE the applicant and PERSON met once at the social welfare office to discuss the matter . PERSON expressed the wish that the applicant should not have access to his daughter yet . The PERSON responsible social worker had some further contacts with the applicant and PERSON separately in DATE , but no meetings took place between the applicant and PERSON As appears from the relevant diary entries , he contacted the authority concerned once DATE , at the most .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , PERSON applied to ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON for permission to adopt PERSON In DATE the applicant , who objected , requested ORG to grant him access . The court decided to obtain an opinion from ORG , section DATE ) and to adjourn its examination of the question of access pending the outcome of the adoption proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The Council carried out an investigation during which it heard the applicant ( Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , of LAW ) , PERSON and PERSON In an opinion of DATE , the ORG concluded that adoption of PERSON by ORG would not be in the child \u2019s best interests and , accordingly , recommended ORG to reject PERSON \u2019s application . In reaching this conclusion , the ORG had regard to the following considerations .", "In the first place , it was observed that PERSON and PERSON had been living together for DATE and had been married since DATE . It appeared that their marriage was stable and harmonious . PERSON had become PERSON \u2019s psychological father and had feelings for her as though she was his own child . PERSON considered it appropriate to confirm this by adopting her and thereby secure her position within the family .", "The report further noted that the applicant seemed to have a stable relationship with ORG and her son . He had affirmed that he had always had an interest in his daughter but that , for DATE , he had not had the energy to have contact with her because of his difficult situation . He was opposed to adoption and considered that his daughter had a right to know her natural father . The applicant was aware of the fact that the contact had to be developed cautiously over a certain period .", "In addition , the report observed :", "\u201c The investigators are of the opinion that [ M. ] , like all other children , has a right to know her descent . It is also important that she be informed as early as possible . Thus , we disagree with [ K.W. \u2019s ] and [ ORG \u2019s ] opinion that it is better for [ M. ] to wait . On the contrary , we believe that , in all probability , it will be a traumatic experience for [ M. ] to be told , in her teens or as an adult , that [ M.W. ] is not her natural father . We also consider that [ M. ] has a right to get to know her father and his family . We do not share [ K.W. \u2019s ] and [ PERSON \u2019s ] fears that [ M. ] would become distant from [ PERSON ] , although it would be natural for her to react in CARDINAL way or another . However , we are of the opinion that it could be beneficial for [ M. ] to get to know her father and his family . Her feeling of belonging to [ M.W. ] does not , for that reason , have to be changed and [ M.W. ] will probably always be [ M. \u2019s ] psychological father .", "", "The investigators do not consider that there is question of making an assessment of who is the \u2018 best\u2019 father but rather a matter related to the right to know , and to enjoy access to one \u2019s descent . Therefore we do not find it appropriate to support ORG \u2019s request to adopt M. \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE during which it heard the applicant ( Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , of LAW ) and PERSON By decision of CARDINAL DATE , the court granted PERSON permission to adopt PERSON under LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW . The court gave the following reasons :", "\u201c The investigation in the case shows that [ M. ] since birth has lived with [ K.W. ] and that [ M.W. ] has taken part in the care of [ M. ] since she was DATE . According to the information received , [ M. ] sees [ PERSON ] as her father . [ The applicant ] appears to have met [ M. ] occasionally in the beginning , but access has thereafter practically ceased . In these circumstances , PERSON can not be considered to have such a need of contact with [ the applicant ] as to constitute an impediment to adoption .", "For these reasons , and since adoption must otherwise be considered to be in her interest , the application shall be granted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) upheld ORG decision . On DATE ORG ( ORG domstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . General provisions on custody and access are to be found in LAW of LAW . Section CARDINAL provides that , from birth , the custody of a child rests with the child \u2019s parents , if they are married , or its mother , if the parents are not married . According to section CARDINAL , unmarried parents may obtain joint custody on application .", "Under LAW , section CARDINAL , the child \u2019s custodian shall see to it that the child \u2019s need of access to , inter alia , a parent who does not have custody is satisfied to the largest possible extent . If the custodian objects to the access requested by a parent who does not have custody , the courts shall , on an action brought by the latter parent , determine the question of access in keeping with the child \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL of the Parental Code contains provisions on adoption . Section CARDINAL provides that a spouse may , with the consent of the other spouse , adopt the other spouse \u2019s child . According to section MONEY ) , a child who has not attained the age of DATE may not be adopted without the consent of its parents . Such consent is however not required from a parent who does not have custody of the child .", "Under LAW , section CARDINAL , the competent court is to examine whether adoption is appropriate and may grant permission only if it is to the CARDINAL advantage of the child and if the prospective adopter has brought up the child or intends to do so or if there are special reasons for the adoption in view of the special relationship between the adopter and the child .", "According to LAW , section CARDINAL , an adopted child is for legal purposes regarded as the adopter \u2019s child and not that of the natural parent , except where the natural parent is the adopter \u2019s spouse . Where this exception does not apply , the rights of access enjoyed by the natural parents to the child cease by virtue of the adoption ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
