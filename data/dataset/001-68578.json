The alleged offence ( principally forced oral sex ) had taken place repeatedly in the family home over a period of DATE beginning on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The pre - trial investigation of the alleged offence began when the complainant , i.e. the applicant \u2019s stepdaughter , reported it to the police on DATE .

ORG heard the testimony of the complainant and of the aforesaid confidantes , as well as that of the defendant \u2019s wife and of others more distantly connected with certain details pertaining to the matter . The defence disputed that the complainant and the applicant had ever been alone together in the place where the offence was alleged to have occurred . The evidence of the applicant \u2019s wife did not support his claims in this respect .", "ORG also had before it a medical certificate issued by the physician who attended to the complainant because of an illness she had . This medical certificate charted the progress of her illness over the period from DATE until DATE . Although the physician was unable to draw from his observations any inference concerning the alleged offence , ORG , according to the applicant , found that the medical certificate supported the complainant \u2019s view in the matter .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant learned about his ex - wife \u2019s submission of CARDINAL DATE and of her changed position from ORG aforementioned judgment , in which it was stated as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant \u2019s ex - wife ] has , in her statement submitted to ORG , announced that she wants to retract her earlier written statement which was annexed to [ the applicant \u2019s ] letter of appeal and which she had , in her view , signed under heavy pressure . Therefore , there is no reason to doubt that her statement given at ORG was not accurate . It is manifestly unnecessary to request [ the applicant \u2019s ] comments on the statement . ... Thus , the request to hold an oral hearing is rejected as unfounded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) for leave to appeal raising , inter alia , questions concerning the overall evaluation of the evidence and maintaining that ORG should not have accepted the withdrawal of the affidavit of CARDINAL DATE without giving him an opportunity to comment on the matter .

ORG issued a precedent on DATE concerning ORG obligation to communicate to the parties a statement invited on ORG own motion ( ORG ) . Paragraph CARDINAL of the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c [ CARDINAL appropriate proceedings in court require that the court decision is based on only such files which have been available to the parties of the legal proceedings and which they have also had the opportunity to examine . The parties accordingly have the right to be informed of the contents of a document submitted to the court , even if it according to section CARDINAL of LAW should be kept secret , because only in this way can they be safeguarded a sufficient possibility to participate in the proceedings . The precondition to disclosure of this otherwise secret case - file to the parties is not that the court decision is based on such a file .

Also in this respect , the parties as well as the court shall have the possibility to consider the significance of the case - file submitted to the court in the case . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
