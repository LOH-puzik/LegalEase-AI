AZERBAIJAN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mrs L. Madatova , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant 's father , before his death , owned a part of a non - residential building used as a garage . At the material time , according to the applicant , the garage was used by T.B. under a lease agreement .", "In DATE , the applicant 's father died and the applicant formally registered his ownership rights to the part of the garage he inherited from his father . According to the applicant , the remaining parts of the property were open for inheritance by his relatives , but none of them formalized their rights .", "In DATE PERSON filed a lawsuit before ORG , claiming ownership rights to the garage based on a de facto sale and purchase agreement allegedly concluded in DATE with some of the applicant 's relatives , who had then been the owners of the garage .", "The applicant counterclaimed , asking the court to order PERSON 's eviction from the garage . He denied PERSON 's allegations that the garage had been de facto sold in DATE , arguing that there were no proper documents verifying that such a sale had ever taken place . He claimed that the garage had remained in the ownership of his family until his father 's death and that , thereafter , he had rightfully inherited his father 's share of the property and properly formalized his ownership rights .", "On DATE ORG upheld PERSON 's claim in full and rejected the applicant 's counterclaim .", "The applicant appealed , alleging that the district court had wrongfully assessed the facts . On DATE ORG set aside the district court 's judgment and ruled in the applicant 's favour .", "Following T.B. 's cassation appeal , on DATE ORG held that ORG improperly applied the relevant provisions of the domestic law to the facts of the case . ORG modified ORG decision and declared that the disputed property was in GPE 's ownership . ORG decision became final and enforceable upon its delivery .", "On DATE the applicant filed an \u201c additional cassation \u201d appeal with the President of ORG , asking for the reopening of the proceedings and quashing ORG decision of DATE by the ORG of ORG ( ORG ) .", "By a letter of DATE , the President of ORG rejected the applicant 's request , finding no grounds for the reopening of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Law On Courts and Judges of DATE", "\u201c [ T]he ORG shall be the highest judicial authority with regard to civil ... , criminal , administrative and other disputes falling within the jurisdiction of the general and specialized courts .", "ORG [ is ] a court of cassation instance ... \u201d", "\u201c The Plenum of the Supreme Court shall be composed of the President , Vice Presidents and judges of ORG , the President of ORG , the President of ORG and the President of ORG of GPE . ...", "The Plenum of ORG ... shall , in the manner established by law , review cases under the procedure of additional cassation , on submission of the President of ORG , or pursuant to a protest by ORG or an appeal by the defendant ... \u201d", "\u201c The President of ORG ... shall , in cases and under the procedure provided by law , submit cassation instance decisions for the review of the Plenum of ORG ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Code of Civil Procedure of GPE DATE", "\u201c The decision [ of the cassation instance court ] shall enter into legal force from the moment of its delivery . \u201d", "\u201c Submissions , appeals or protests concerning decisions of ORG ... may be reviewed by the ORG of ORG under the procedure of additional cassation . \u201d", "\u201c A submission concerning a decision of ORG ... may be made by the President of ORG on the basis of an application by persons non - parties to the case whose interests were affected by the judicial acts . An appeal may be filed by a party to the case who has been represented by an advocate . [ A protest may be filed by ORG in certain specified circumstances . ] \u201d", "\u201c The ORG shall consider cases exclusively on the points of law . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL lists the grounds which merit the reconsideration of ORG cassation instance decision by the ORG of ORG . These grounds are present if , inter alia , ORG decision was drawn up in violation of the formal requirements concerning the contents of a judicial decision , or was based on a legal norm declared as unconstitutional by ORG , or if ORG ruling infringed the rights and obligations of persons who were not a party to the case .", "\u201c If appropriate grounds exist , the President [ of ORG ] shall transmit the submission , appeal or protest , together with the case file , to the ORG of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Relevant domestic practice", "Any additional cassation proceedings in the ORG of ORG can be reopened only at the discretion of the President of ORG , following a motion by the relevant party ( e.g. , an additional cassation appeal or Chief Prosecutor 's protest ) . The ORG itself does not take a decision on the reopening of the proceedings or on the admissibility of additional cassation appeals .", "An additional cassation appeal is first submitted to the President of ORG . The President , in his or her sole discretion and without holding any formal judicial hearing , decides if there are any grounds to reopen the case and transmit the appeal to the ORG . If the President decides that the proceedings should be reopened , he or she then transmits the additional cassation appeal , together with the case file , for the in - substance review of the ORG at its next sitting . Meanwhile , if necessary , the President may issue an order suspending the execution of the final judgment pending the review of the case by the ORG .", "However , if the President deems that there are no grounds for additional cassation review , he or she simply sends a rejection letter to the applicant , briefly describing the reasons for the refusal to reopen the proceedings and transmit the appeal to the ORG . The recent practice shows that the President of ORG routinely denies additional cassation review in the majority of domestic cases , due to the absence of the relevant grounds ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
