The applicant , an NORP national , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , PERSON , a minor , complained to ORG in GPE ) that while on holiday in GPE he had been indecently assaulted by the applicant , a caretaker in the halls of residence where he had been staying . Consequently , the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office brought criminal proceedings against the applicant for sexual assault on a minor and gross indecency in a public place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG public prosecutor sent international rogatory letters to ORG GPE in GPE pursuant to LAW between the Government of GPE and the Government of GPE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , which had been ratified by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE . The aim of the rogatory letters was for questions to be put to PERSON , his father ( Mr NORP ) and PERSON , the doctor in whom PERSON had first confided . The public prosecutor set out in detail the questions which he considered should be put to the witnesses and the manner in which the record of interview should be drafted . He added that no lawyer should be present during the interview .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr NORP was questioned by a GPE police officer . No lawyer was present at the interview . In essence , he confirmed that his son had said that he had been fondled by the applicant . On DATE the NORP ORG in GPE ( GPE ) received the record of the interview from the NORP authorities with CARDINAL documents containing written statements by PERSON \u2019s mother ( PERSON ) and PERSON , a child psychotherapist who was treating PERSON for the behavioural disorders he presented . In their statements , PERSON recited the events that PERSON had related to her and the traumatic effects they had had , while PERSON confirmed her husband \u2019s version of events . The documents were then translated into NORP and sent to the ORG public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was committed for trial before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG public prosecutor applied to the President of ORG for permission to summons PERSON , PERSON and PERSON NORP and PERSON to appear at a public hearing on DATE for questioning . The case file does not reveal whether that application was granted or whether the witnesses concerned were served with summonses to attend . Whatever the position , none of them appeared at the trial before ORG and the examination requested by the public prosecutor did not take place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL police officers from GPE were questioned . They indicated that they had received PERSON \u2019s complaint from the NORP authorities and gave a description of the hall of residence where the applicant had been working at the material time .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the public prosecutor and despite opposition by the applicant , ORG ordered that the documents received from GPE , in particular the record of the interview with Mr NORP and the statements of PERSON and PERSON , should be read out . That decision was taken pursuant to LAW ORG ) , which provides : \u201c On application by a party and having regard to the other evidence , the judge may order that the records of the statements made by a foreign national living outside the NORP territory be read out if either that person has not been summonsed to appear or , having been so summonsed , has failed to appear . \u201d The applicant and the defence witnesses gave evidence that DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , which was deposited with the registry on DATE , the court imposed a DATE suspended sentence on the applicant . That decision was taken on the basis of the complaint lodged by PERSON with ORG in GPE and the statements made by PERSON and PERSON and PERSON , which the court found to be credible and consistent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . He argued , inter alia , that the acts performed pursuant to the rogatory letters were invalid . In that connection , he noted that PERSON had never been interviewed and that evidence had been taken from PERSON and PERSON whom the PERSON public prosecutor had not sought to interview \u2013 without authority . Furthermore , they had not been questioned but had merely made written statements . As regards PERSON interview , the NORP police officer who had conducted it had been acting without authority , given that the international rogatory letters had been sent to ORG in GPE . Moreover , no lawyer had been present when the interviews and statements were obtained and the persons concerned had not been asked to take the oath , which showed that the documents did not constitute \u201c testimony \u201d , but merely \u201c preliminary investigative acts \u201d . As such , they should not have been used by ORG as evidence of the accused \u2019s guilt . Lastly , the applicant contended that LAW ORG was not applicable in the instant case as that provision referred only to statements made in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG upheld the judgment of ORG . It observed that by virtue of the locus regit actum principle , acts performed under rogatory letters had to be regulated by the law of the foreign ORG to which the NORP authorities had referred , provided that the foreign law was not incompatible with NORP public order and in particular \u201c defence rights \u201d . In the instant case , the procedure followed by the GPE authorities could not be regarded as having infringed those rights as LAW allowed statements made in GPE or elsewhere by foreign nationals resident outside the national territory to be read out . As regards the fact that PERSON had not been questioned , ORG considered that it was quite understandable that the NORP police should have wished to prevent the minor , who had been affected psychologically by the violence he had endured , from suffering any further trauma .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . Referring to the arguments he had raised before ORG , he repeated his case that the documents obtained through rogatory letters should not have been used to decide his guilt . He also maintained that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( d ) ORG , which requires that a record of acts performed outside the NORP territory by rogatory letters be lodged on the judge \u2019s file ( fascicolo per il dibattimento ) , was unconstitutional . He considered in particular that that provision was incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , which respectively guarantee the equality of all citizens before the law and the right to defend oneself at every stage of the proceedings . In that connection , he stressed that he had been given no opportunity to question Mr NORP , PERSON , whose statements had formed the basis of his conviction .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , which was deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG cited the provisions of LAW ORG , which it held to be applicable in the instant case , and declared the issue of constitutionality raised by the applicant irrelevant . Finding that the reasons given by ORG on all the issues in dispute had been cogent and correct , it dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . Under the terms of LAW , the signatory GPE undertake to afford each other mutual assistance in criminal investigations and proceedings . Such assistance includes in particular the hearing of witnesses in the territory of the ORG to which the request is addressed . In that connection , LAW provides notably :", "\u201c A person from whom evidence is sought shall , if necessary , be compelled to appear and testify to the same extent as would be required in criminal investigations or proceedings in ORG .", "Upon request , the Requested State shall specify the date and place of the taking of testimony .", "The Requested State shall permit the presence [ at the hearing ] of an accused , counsel for the accused , and persons charged with the enforcement of the criminal laws to which the request relates .", "The executing authority shall provide persons permitted to be present [ at the hearing ] the opportunity to question the person whose testimony is sought in accordance with the laws of ORG .", "The executing authority shall provide persons permitted to be present [ at the hearing ] the opportunity to propose additional questions and other investigative measures .", "Testimonial privileges under the laws of the Requesting State shall not apply in the execution of a request , but such questions of privilege shall be preserved for the Requesting State . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
