On DATE she married an NORP citizen , Mr M.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant gave birth to the second applicant in a hospital in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG und Familie ) ordered that the second applicant should not accompany the first applicant upon her departure from hospital since her unclear personal and financial situation and lack of a residence permit would endanger the child \u2019s welfare .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , relying on Section CARDINALa of LAW ( Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) requested ORG ( GPE ) that custody as regards the care and education of the second applicant be transferred to it . ORG noted that the first applicant had , at first , incorrectly informed the hospital about her personal data , in particular on her name and residence . According to ORG she had also expressed the wish to place the child with foster parents . DATE after she had given birth , she had changed her mind and wanted to keep the child . Upon inquiries undertaken by ORG , her real name , the periods of her lawful residence in GPE and her marriage to PERSON had been discovered . Confronted with these facts , she had been very upset , had refused to give any further information and had insisted on keeping her child . Given her completely unclear situation , the means of existence of the second applicant were at risk and a transfer of custody to ORG was necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant left the hospital . The second applicant was placed with foster parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr M. instituted proceedings contesting paternity ( Ehelichkeitsbestreitungsklage ) of the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted ORG request of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

She had alleged that she obtained financial support from her husband , although she was no longer living with him .", "CARDINAL . Relying on a report by ORG of DATE , the court noted that the first applicant had not cooperated with that office . In particular , it had not been possible to arrange a visit at her husband \u2019s address and she had not kept her appointments with ORG . On DATE the first applicant had contacted ORG and had informed it about her address at DATE GPE , where she was allegedly supported by PERSON That Office \u2019s subsequent visit at PERSON apartment had shown that PERSON was not prepared to further support the first applicant . Given that she was living with her CARDINAL children in an apartment of QUANTITY , she could not accommodate the applicant and her son .", "CARDINAL . Relying further on a report by ORG ( GPE ) of DATE , the court noted that the first applicant had admitted in a meeting that a baby needed orderly conditions , which she could not offer at that moment . Otherwise , she had given evasive answers and , on questions she had been uncomfortable with , she had started crying or had complained that nobody was helping her . ORG visit at the foster GPE home had shown that the second applicant had got accustomed to them . Until DATE , the first applicant twice had a right of access at the parents - child centre ( ORG ) . The first time , she had not appeared at all , the second time she had been TIME late . The foster parents had subsequently met her by chance and had arranged a short meeting at a nearby parking .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the court stated that the first applicant was still in a very unstable and obscure situation , which was not enhanced by her unlawful residence in GPE , and which did not entitle her to financial aid . It was also not possible to cooperate with her , as she partly did not keep appointments and lacked any willingness to make active contributions .

According to ORG case - law the residence prohibition against her would have to be lifted . However , in her contacts with ORG and the other authorities involved she had not obtained any support to regulate her residence status or any help to preserve her relationship with her child . She had gained the impression that from the very beginning they were determined to place her child with foster parents .", "CARDINAL . She had also wished to make use of her access rights . However , the first time , she had not found the address , the second time she had been late , had met the foster parents and had briefly seen her son .

The first applicant \u2019s completely unclear financial and personal situation , in particular as regards her residence , and her incapability to cooperate constructively with ORG DATE as had been established by the lower court \u2013 constituted a situation , which endangered the child \u2019s well - being .
